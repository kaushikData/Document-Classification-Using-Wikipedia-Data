      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2659">The '''12th Light Infantry Division''' is a [[formation (military)|formation]] of the [[Iraqi Army]]. It was activated in the 1970s or 1980s, probably disbanded after 1991, but reformed in 2008. It was an armoured division during the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]]. The U.S. [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division (Mechanized)]]  , [[Task Force 1-41 Infantry]], and [[2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] played a key role in the destruction of the division, destroying no less than 80 combat vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of the division were destroyed by British forces at [[Battle of Norfolk|Objective Dorset]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourque P.337&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 2009 it was located in [[Tikrit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/nia-12id.htm 12th Division, Iraqi Army]. GlobalSecurity.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th Division was planned to be established in July 2008 by doubling the 4th Division. Its home base was planned to be at [[Tikrit]] and take into account the province of [[Salah ad-Din Governorate]]. It was to be initially made up of three trained strategic infrastructure brigades and was to receive the 4th Brigade, 4th Division. A new 4th Brigade was to have been formed for the 4th Division from effective excess staff from the other three brigades of the division.

Division Units:
* Headquarters and Service Company
* 46th Motorised Brigade (''ex-1st Strategic Infrastructure Brigade'')
* 47th Motorised Brigade (''ex-2nd Strategic Infrastructure Brigade'')
* 48th Brigade (''ex-9th Strategic Infrastructure Brigade'')
* 49th Brigade (''ex-4-4'')
* 12th Motorized Transportation Regiment

The 49th Brigade, former 4th Brigade of the 4th Division, the more operational brigade of 12th Division is currently (July 2008) deployed to Baghdad to take part in the battles of [[Sadr City]].

The 48th Brigade is now part of the 4th Division.

As July 2010, division's units are :
* Headquarters and Service Company
* 15th (Eagles) AAslt Brigade (from 4th Division)
* 46th Motorised Brigade (''ex-1st Strategic Infrastructure Brigade'')
* 47th Motorised Brigade (''ex-2nd Strategic Infrastructure Brigade'')
* 49th Brigade (''ex-4-4'')
* 12th Motorized Transportation Regiment

The '''Asia Cooperation Dialogue''' ('''ACD''') is an [[inter-governmental organization]] created on 18 June 2002 to promote [[Asia]]n cooperation at a continental level and to help integrate separate [[regional organization]]s such as [[ASEAN]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]], and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]].

==History==
It is the main objective of the former Thai Prime Minister to form the Asia Co-operation Dialogue or the forerunner to the Asian Union. The ACD's main members states are Pakistan, Kuwait, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, Uzbekistan, China and Japan, the so-called Major Ten ACD Nations.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the history of the ACD see Michael, Arndt (2013). China's Foreign Policy and Regional Multilateralism (Palgrave Macmillan), pp. 175-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an Asia Cooperation Dialogue was raised at the First International Conference of Asian Political Parties (held in [[Manila]] between 17–20 September 2000) by [[Surakiart Sathirathai]], then deputy leader of the now defunct [[Thai Rak Thai]] Party, on behalf of his party leader, [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], then [[Prime Minister of Thailand]]. It was suggested that Asia as a continent should have its own forum to discuss Asia-wide cooperation. Afterwards, the idea of the ACD was formally put forward during the 34th ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting in [[Hanoi]], 23–24 July 2001 and at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Retreat in [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]], 20–21 February 2002.

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the ACD are to:
#Promote interdependence among Asian countries in all areas of cooperation by identifying Asia's common strengths and opportunities which will help reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for Asian people whilst developing a knowledge-based society within Asia and enhancing community and people empowerment;
#Expand the trade and financial market within Asia and increase the bargaining power of Asian countries in lieu of competition and, in turn, enhance Asia's economic competitiveness in the global market;
#Serve as the missing link in Asian cooperation by building upon Asia's potentials and strengths through supplementing and complementing existing cooperative frameworks so as to become a viable partner for other regions;
#Ultimately transform the Asian continent into an Asian Community, capable of interacting with the rest of the world on a more equal footing and contributing more positively towards mutual peace and prosperity.

A '''Bé d'interès cultural''' (BIC) is the [[Andorra]]n name for a [[National Heritage Site]] listed by the Andorran heritage register, [[Patrimoni Cultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ca icon}} [http://www.bopa.ad/bopa.nsf/c56341fced070c89c12566c700571ddd/e2a748c3b17c5373c1256d6500265924?OpenDocument Law 9/2003, of June 12th, del patrimoni cultural d'Andorra], official bulletin of the government of Andorra.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term literally means "Property of Cultural Interest", although a better translation could be "Heritage of Cultural Interest", as Andorra now protects not only material heritage, like monuments or movable works of art, but also [[intangible cultural heritage]].

== Sub-categories ==
*Non-movable Andorran heritage is divided into the following classifications:
** ''Monument'', which as the term [[monument]] implies, refers to buildings or other individual constructions such as public art or memorials that have significant cultural value.
** ''Conjunt arquitectònic'' (architectural group or set), grouping of buildings that constitutes a coherent unit, regardless of individual value.
** ''Paisatge cultural'' (cultural landscape), joint work of man and nature with aesthetic, historical or cultural value. E.g. [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley]]
** ''Zona arqueològica'' (archaeological area), area with traces of human intervention in the past.
** ''Zona paleontològica'' (paleontological area), area with fossilized remains forming a coherent unit.
*Movable heritage, such archaeological objects, bibliographic heritage, and large works of art.

{{Christianity by country}}

'''Christianity in the Comoros''' is a minority religion. Roman Catholics in the [[Comoros]] number about 4,300 persons (0.5% of the population); Protestants number about 1,678 (0.25% of the population). In 2006 four persons were detained in the town of Moroni in the Comoros. The constitution guarantees religious liberty, although Christians are not allowed to witness publicly, and are subject to the denial of many civil rights, putting them at a societal disadvantage. There are foreign religious groups that take part in humanitarian action in the Comoros. They do not engage in proselytizing there, however. Religious groups do not have a duty to register.

A law states that whoever preaches another religion to any of the country's Muslims will be subject to both a prison sentence and a fine. On the island of [[Ngazidja]], Christian liberty is greater than in other parts of the Comoros. There is a Roman Catholic church in [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] on the island. Another Roman Catholic church is in [[Mutsamudu]]. There is also a Protestant church in Moroni. According to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'' (2nd Edition, Volume 1, p.&amp;nbsp;208), there is at least one congregation of both Seventh Day Adventists and the reformed Eglise de Jésus Christ aux Comores.{{Verify source|date=November 2014}}

The '''Custodian of Enemy Property''' is an institution that handles property claims created by war. In wartime, civilian property may be left behind or taken by the occupying state. In ancient times, such property was considered [[war loot]], and the legal right of the winner. In the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] Article 147, such action is defined as [[war crime]]: "Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the present Convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or willfully depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present Convention, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly."

==Custodian of Enemy Property laws==
The following list is incomplete.

'''Bangladesh:''' The [[Vested Property Act (Bangladesh)|Enemy Property Act]] was established to manage property of enemies (Indians) taken while it was part of Pakistan (1948–1971) or during its [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence war]] (1971).

'''Canada''' The Office of the [[Custodian of Enemy Property (Canada)|Custodian of Enemy Property]] was established in 1916 and existed until 1985, dealing with the property of Canada's enemies in both World Wars as well as the seized property of [[Japanese Canadians]].

'''India:''' The [[Custodian for Enemy Property for India]] was established to manage Pakistani property taken in the [[Second Kashmir War]] (1965).

'''Jordan:''' The Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property was established to handle property taken from Jews in the [[West Bank]] taken in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] (1948). In 1967, this function was disbanded (see below).

'''Israel:''' The [[Israeli land and property laws#The 'Absentees Property Law'|'Absentees Property Law']] were established to handle the property taken from [[Palestinian refugee]]s (including refugees who later became citizens of Israel, called "[[present absentee]]s") of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (1948) under the office of the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property. During the [[Six-Day War]] (1967), along with previously Palestinian properties, Israel took control of the Jewish property held by the Jordanian Custodian for Enemy Property and put it under the control of their own Custodian of Absentee Property.  Most of this property remains under the Custodian, while some (as in the [[Sheikh Jarrah]] case) has been granted to Jews contesting ownership, after claiming it in court.

'''United States:''' [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]] was an office within the United States federal government during World War I and again during World War II.

'''United Kingdom:''' Custodian of Enemy Property. Previously under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1914]] enemy property was inspected by the Board of Trade and ownership was transferred to the [[Public Trustee#United Kingdom and Australia|Public Trustee]]. Initially, the Public Trustee held ownership on trust for the enemy but after a 1916 amendment the Public Trustee was required to sell the assets and hold the proceeds in trust. Under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1939]], three custodians were established: England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland. Custodians were also appointed in respect of British Dependent Territories.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.enemyproperty.bis.gov.uk/fcoreport.pdf History Notes, ''British policy towards enemy property during and after the Second World War'', Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office] accessed 19 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
In [[Sweden]], the [[ISO 8601]] [[international_standard|standard]] is followed in most written [[Swedish language|Swedish]], but older forms remain. Dates are generally and officially written on the form YYYY-MM-DD, for instance 2001-08-31 for 31 August 2001, or using the full format ({{lang|sv|31 augusti 2001}}). Dates can also be shortened, allowing for two-digit years, so the dates are usually written on the form YY-MM-DD, which means that 31 August 2001 also can be written as 01-08-31. One can also omit the hyphens, leaving the notation to 010831.
Older forms for 31 August 2001 are 31/8 2001, or with the two-digit notation 31/8 -01. The common trait for all Swedish date notations is that the month (August or 8) always is between the year (01) and the day (31st). Months are not capitalised when written using letters (i.e. {{lang|sv|augusti}}, not {{lang|sv|Augusti}}).

The “month day, year” notation: (“08-31-2001”) is not used in Sweden, but may be used in [[Lule Sami language|Lule Sami]], [[Northern Sami]] and [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] languages.

Numbering of weeks are frequently used in companies and schools, and are simply expressed as in "({{lang|sv|vecka}}) 32" (''(week) 32'') in both writing (abbreviated {{lang|sv|v.}}) and speech. On labels and in computers' notation, the year may also be included, as in "2006W32". As in the ISO standard, the week begins with a Monday and week 1 is the week containing the year's first Thursday.

==Time==
Times are written with the [[24-hour clock]], with full stops as separators (although colons are sometimes used instead of full stops){{cn|date=July 2017}}, however seconds are usually left out if the additional precision is not required. Example: {{lang|sv|23.59}}, or sometimes {{lang|sv|23.59.00}}. Leading zeros are mostly used in time notation (i.e. 04.00 is more common than 4.00). In spoken Swedish however, the [[12-hour clock]] is much more common. Usually time is expressed in 5-minute intervals (rounded so that it can be evenly divided by 5) like this: ''&lt;the hour&gt;'', ''&lt;5, 10 or 20 [minutes]&gt; &lt;past, to&gt; &lt;the hour/the following hour&gt;'', ''a quarter &lt;past, to&gt; &lt;the hour/following hour&gt;'', ''half &lt;the following hour&gt;'' or ''five &lt;past, to&gt; half &lt;the following hour&gt;''. More accurately like this: ''&lt;1-29 [minutes]&gt; past &lt;the hour&gt;'', ''half &lt;the following hour&gt;'' or ''&lt;29-1 [minutes]&gt; to &lt;the following hour&gt;''. In these styles, the word for "minutes" is usually but not always left out. Finally the written notation can be pronounced as is: ''&lt;the hour&gt; and &lt;the minute&gt;'', although this is not very common in everyday conversation. The 24-hour time is always applied on the last form, may be applied to the second form and is never used with rounded time as in the first form. Seconds are very seldom expressed at all in speech. Example: 14.27 may be pronounced as "{{lang|sv|tre minuter i halv tre}}" (''three minutes to half three''), "{{lang|sv|tjugosju (minuter) över två/fjorton}}" (''twenty seven (minutes) past two/fourteen''), or, most commonly: "{{lang|sv|fjorton och tjugosju}}" (''fourteen and twenty seven''). 16.00 may be pronounced as "{{lang|sv|fyra}}" (''four'') or "{{lang|sv|sexton}}" (''sixteen'').

The '''Distillerie Dillon''' is in [[Fort de France]] in [[Martinique]]. It distills many types of [[rum]] from the locally grown [[sugar cane]]. It is powered by a [[Corliss steam engine]] that was built in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voyage.michelin.fr/web/destination/Martinique-Fort_de_France/site-Distillerie_Dillon-Rte_de_Chateauboeuf_9 Michelin guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413070637/http://voyage.michelin.fr/web/destination/Martinique-Fort_de_France/site-Distillerie_Dillon-Rte_de_Chateauboeuf_9 |date=April 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of the distillery was settled by sugar farmers in 1690. The name stems from [[Arthur Dillon (1750-1794)]] a soldier with Lafayette's troops in the American War of Independence. Serving with [[Dillon's Regiment]], of the [[Irish Brigade (France)]], he had been created a colonel at the age of 16.&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;http://www.rhums-dillon.com/ Dillons Rum website&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to his home from the war, he married a rich widow, named Louise. Then they bought the estate, flourishing with sugar cane, and had a daughter Fanny.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; Dillon became a deputy, and his daughter was presented by her cousin Josephine to [[Napoleon]]. She married General Bertrand, and they both accompanied Napoleon into exile on [[Elba]] and [[St Helena]].&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; On returning to the Dillon Plantation, she campaigned against slavery.

==Process==
There are ten varieties of sugar cane used by Dillon. The cane is grown for two years and when harvested the sugar is extracted over a period of 2 to 3 days. Speed is essential. The saying goes "the cane should have its feet in the earth and its head in the mill" &lt;ref name=dillon/&gt; The cane is crushed  three times to release the juice by a steam engine driven mill. Water is added and the juice is allowed to ferment- it is again milled to crush the sugar, and fermentation starts. The residue cane is used to fire the boilers that provide the steam. The distillation is a slow process, in columns heated to {{convert|65|C}}, producing an alcohol of 65%. It rests for five months then is reduced and bottled at 50% to 55%.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt;

The [[European Union regulation]] (EEC) No. 2092/91 of the [[European Council]] of 24 June 1991 on [[organic farming|organic production]] of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs ('''EU-Eco-regulation''') defines how agricultural products and foods that are designated as ecological products have to be grown. The regulation is derived from the guidelines of the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM), which is an association of about 800 member organizations in 119 countries.

In 1999 it was supplemented by regulation (EC) No. 1804/1999, which regulates the raising, labelling and inspection of the most relevant animal species (i.e. cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry). This agreement covers such issues as foodstuffs, disease prevention and veterinary treatments, animal welfare, husbandry practices and the management of manure. [[Genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) and products derived from GMOs are explicitly excluded from organic production methods.

The regulation No. 834/2007 is replacing the earlier 2092/91 regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:189:0001:0023:EN:PDF|title=on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91|date=28 June 2007|publisher=The Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation No. 889/2008 would supplement the breeding of animal species and the regulation No. 1235/2008 also regulates the import of ecologically grown agricultural products from third countries.

In July 2010, a new [[organic certification]] label was chosen to replace the earlier national labels for usage of [[organic food]] that meet the criteria of the EU Eco regulation. The regulation also states that the term ''biological'' or ''ecological'' may be used on products in the EU if the product consists of at least 95% ingredients from EU regulated organic food.

The '''Four Tribes of Tara''' was an alliance of powerful clans that consisted of the O'Harts, O'Kelly's, O'Connolly, and the O'Regan. The princes of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] were also styled princes of Brega, consisting of territory in the modern day counties Meath, Louth and Dublin, and containing the districts around the ancient Royal Seat of Tara, [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[Navan]], [[Athboy]], part of [[Dublin]] north of the [[River Liffey|Liffey]].  The Four Tribes were major defenders of Ireland against [[Viking]] invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireland-calling.com/irish-names-regan|title=Regan – direct descendants of Brian Boru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Franz Schurmann''' (June 21, 1926 – August 20, 2010) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[history|historian]] who was best known for his research and writings about [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] during the [[Cold War]] period. He taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the departments of Sociology and History for 38 years, and he also served a term as the head of the Center for Chinese Studies. He was an early opponent of the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], and was the first American professor to visit [[Hanoi]] during the bombing raids there. He co-founded the [[Pacific News Service]] in 1970 together with author [[Orville Schell]], serving as editor and commentator, and wrote the weekly "Predictions" column.&lt;ref name=SFCObit&gt;Egelko, Bob. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/22/BAGV1F1QA8.DTL "Historian and China expert Franz Schurmann dies"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', August 23, 2010. Accessed August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and scholarly career==
Schurmann was born on June 21, 1926, in [[Astoria, Queens]], New York, and grew up in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]]. He developed fluency in as many as 12 languages, acquiring them from his [[Slovenia]]n father who spoke five languages himself, his mother who was an immigrant from [[Germany]], and from the dialects spoken in the [[melting pot]] community where he was raised. He briefly attended [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in nearby [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He was drafted by the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] and was assigned to learn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], serving as a newspaper censor during the American [[occupation of Japan]]. He befriended [[Stefan Brecht]] during his Army service and met [[Thomas Mann]] and other German émigrés at the California home of Stefan's father [[Bertolt Brecht]]. After completing his military service Schurmann was awarded a Ph.D. in [[Asian studies]] from [[Harvard University]], which he was able to attend using his [[G.I. Bill]] benefits as a veteran.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/us/27schurmann.html "Franz Schurmann, Cold War Expert on China, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 26, 2010. Accessed August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NAMObit&gt;Staff. [http://newamericamedia.org/2010/08/pns-co-founder-franz-schurmann-dies.php "PNS Co-founder Franz Schurmann Dies"], [[New America Media]], August 23, 2010. Accessed August 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s, Schurmann spent two years exploring [[Afghanistan]] on horseback, where he documented a blue-eyed, blond-haired tribe that descended from the invasions by [[Genghis Khan]], a history that he recounted in his 1962 book ''The Mongols of Afghanistan: An Ethnography of the Moghôls and Related Peoples of Afghanistan''.&lt;ref name=NAMObit/&gt; He was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, founding the Berkeley Faculty Peace Committee in 1965 and visiting [[North Vietnam]] with author and political activist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] in 1968. In 1967, Schurmann signed a letter declaring his intention to [[tax resistance|refuse to pay taxes]] in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.&lt;ref&gt;"An Open Letter" [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/transaction/id/17162 archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

His major work ''[[Ideology and Organization in Communist China]]'' was published in 1966, just as Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] was starting, and was revised and enlarged in 1968 and 1971. A widely influential analysis, the book applied the sociological insights of [[Max Weber]] to interviews Schurmann conducted in [[Hong Kong]] with refugees and wide reading in Chinese newspapers and documents. The book demonstrates how [[Mao Zedong]]'s "dialectical conception of Chinese society" structured his organizational approach to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the government. The book argued that a "consistent yet changing ideology" created a web of organization which covered and penetrated all aspects of Chinese society, building from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideology and Organization in Communist China'' (Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1966; revised and enlarged, 1968, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the three-volume series ''The China Reader'' with [[Orville Schell]], a student of his who became an author and China expert in his own right. Together with Schell, he established the Pacific News Service in 1970, with the goal of providing Americans with more detailed coverage of news from Asia and Latin America. The service created [[New America Media]] in 1996, a multimedia ethnic news agency and a coalition of ethnic media.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

His 1974 work ''The Logic of World Power'' provided a summary of international relations following World War II. ''The Foreign Politics of [[Richard Nixon]]'', a book he wrote in the 1970s about the U.S. President's role in foreign affairs, was not published until 1987.

As he developed his thinking about global power and economy, he expanded his skills to keep abreast of world developments. Already fluent in French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and other languages, he now in his sixties learnt enough written Arabic to be able to read the [[Koran]] and the Arab-language press. This enabled him to write hundreds of columns for Pacific News, reporting on the development and goals of [[militant Islam]].&lt;ref name=NAMObit/&gt;

He died at age 84 on August 20, 2010, at his home in [[San Francisco]] due to complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. He is survived by his wife of 42 years, journalist [[Sandy Close]], as well as by two sons, Peter and Mark Schurmann, his daughter-in-law Aruna Lee, and his grandson Leon.&lt;ref name=NAMObit/&gt;

The '''Gate of Trajan''' or '''Trajan's Gate''' ({{lang-bg|Траянови врата}}, ''Trayanovi vrata'') is a historic mountain pass near [[Ihtiman]], [[Bulgaria]]. It was named so after [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], on whose order a fortress by the name of ''Stipon'' was constructed on the hill over the pass, as a symbolic border between the [[Roman province|provinces]] of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].

The pass is primarily known for the [[Battle of the Gates of Trajan|major medieval battle]] of 17 August 986, during which the forces of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil II]] were routed by [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] [[Samuil of Bulgaria]], effectively halting a Byzantine campaign in the Bulgarian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare'', (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005), 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a tunnel of [[Trakiya motorway]] similarly known as the Gate of Trajan Tunnel (тунел „Траянови врата“) is  near the fortress, {{convert|55|km|mi}} from [[Sofia]].

The [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]] [[Trajan Gate]] on [[Graham Land]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after the Gate of Trajan.

'''''Gaudeamus''''' is a novel written in 1928 by the Romanian writer [[Mircea Eliade]], portraying him at college during the [[Interbellum]]. It was only published as a single volume in 1989. It is the sequel to ''[[Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent]]'' (Romanian: ''[[Romanul adolescentului miop]])'', which is based on Eliade's time in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrabie|first=Diana|year=2009|url=http://limbaromana.md/index.php?go=articole&amp;n=396|title=Adolescentul în căutarea sinelui|language=Romanian|work=Limba Romana|volume=19|issue=5-6|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Gaudeamus'' will be published in English for the first time in April 2018 by [[Istros Books]], with a foreword by [[Bryan Rennie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istrosbooks.com/products/books/gaudeamus-87/|title=Guadeamus|website=istrosbooks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
As [[Bryan Rennie]] writes in the Foreword of the 2018 English edition: "[[Mircea Eliade]]’s ''Gaudeamus'', written between February and March of 1928, is a coming-of-age novel based on his undergraduate years at the [[University of Bucharest]] (1925 to 1928). His earlier novel, ''Romanul adolescenului miop'' (''[[Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent]]'', Istros Books, 2014) had focused on the final years of his ''Liceu'' (high school) education and had been serialised in its entirety in the Bucharest periodicals ''Cuvântul'', ''Viața Literară'', and ''Universul Literar'' in the ’20s, but the manuscript of ''Gaudeamus'' had a different trajectory. Finished before Eliade’s departure for India in 1928, it remained among his papers in the family house on Strada Melodiei in [[Bucharest]]. Only three pages, described as an “excerpt” from ''Gaudeamus'', appeared in ''Viața literară'' in March of 1928. Eliade attempted without success to place the manuscript with the publisher, Cartea Românească, but the novel was to wait more than fifty years to appear in print. Eliade did revisit and reread it in 1932-33, when, according to his ''Autobiography'', he found it “both lyrical and frenzied, too pretentious, timidly indiscreet, and quite lacking in grandeur”. He never again tried to have it published, nor, indeed to have any contact with it. The house was demolished in 1935 and the manuscript passed into the possession of his younger sister Cornelia (Corina) Alexandrescu. It was not until 1981 that a high school teacher and Eliade enthusiast, Mircea Handoca, along with the philosopher, essayist, and poet, Constantin Noica, were given access to Mme. Alexandrescu’s attic and recovered the manuscript. Together they assembled the first 2,500 typed pages of Eliade’s writings from 1921 up to 1928. Several chapters from ''Gaudeamus'' appeared in three issues of the journal ''Manuscriptum'' in 1983, three years before Eliade’s death, but the entire text of the novel did not appear until 1986 when it was published in ''Revista de istoire și teorie literară'' and then again as a single volume with ''Romanul adolescenului miop'' in 1989. Curiously, the three-page passage from ''Viața literară'' was absent from the final version of the manuscript. Thereafter ''Gaudeamus'' was translated into French in 1992 and Italian in 2012 and now it appears for the first time in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaudeamus|last=Eliade|first=Mircea|publisher=Istros Books|year=2018|isbn=9781908236340|location=London, UK|pages=Foreword by Bryan Rennie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1572">The '''Greater Ranges''' comprise the high [[mountain range]]s of [[Asia]]: 
*the [[Himalayas]], 
*the [[Karakoram]], 
*the [[Hindu Kush]],
*the [[Pamir Mountains]], 
*the [[Hengduan Mountains]],
*the [[Tien Shan]], 
*the [[Kunlun Shan]],
*the [[Transhimalaya]]. 

The [[UIAA]] gives a broader definition of the Greater Ranges than the traditional one. With the increasing popularity of global travel and adventure sports, this definition is now somewhat more popular than the original. In addition to the ranges listed above, the ranges also comprise:
*the [[Seven Summits]] (Messner list)
*the [[Andes]] of South America
*the [[Alaska Range]] and the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] of North America
*the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Mount Kenya]] of Africa

All of these ranges have peaks over {{Convert|4800|m|ft|sigfig=4}}, and most have peaks over {{Convert|6000|m|ft|sigfig=4}}. The Greater Ranges contain all of the world's peaks higher than {{Convert|7000|m|ft|sigfig=4}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140108090610/http://www.theuiaa.org/expeditions_general_regulations.html UIAA - Greater ranges and major geographical areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popular amongst [[alpinist]]s in the Victorian period and was used to distinguished the high peaks of Asia from the European [[Alps]].

'''Hendrick Coning''' (1604 &amp;ndash; after 1660), was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] member of the [[Haarlem schutterij]].

==Biography==
He was born in Haarlem as the son of Hendrick Hendricksz and Neeltje Jacobsdr Soeteman, who married Hester de Klerck on 18 July 1632.&lt;ref name=JBVH&gt;[http://nha.courant.nu/issue/JJVH/1961-01-01/edition/null/page/77 Hendrick Coning] in ''De Haarlemse Schuttersstukken'', by Jhr. Mr. C.C. van Valkenburg, pp. 74, Haerlem : jaarboek 1961, ISSN 0927-0728, on the website of the North Holland Archives&lt;/ref&gt; He became a sergeant in the St. George militia from 1636-1639 and was portrayed along with the rest of the officers of his militia  in [[Frans Hals]]' painting ''[[The Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1639]]''.&lt;ref name=JBVH/&gt; His brother [[Cornelis Coning|Cornelis]] is standing below him.&lt;ref name=JBVH/&gt; Later he became a lieutenant in the St. Adrian militia from 1639-1642, but he was again lieutenant for the St. George militia during the years 1645-1648, 1651-1654, and 1657-1660.&lt;ref name=JBVH/&gt; In the portrait, he is pointing at the weapon he should be holding (that of a lieutenant, because he was already serving as lieutenant) and the place he should be standing, namely the front row, like his brother.

He died in Haarlem.&lt;ref name=JBVH/&gt;

'''International Community School of Abidjan''' ('''ICSA''') is an English-speaking international school in Riviera III, [[Abidjan]], [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.icsabidjan.org/page.cfm?p=500 Directions]." International Community School of Abidjan. Retrieved April 27, 2015. "Off Boulevard Arsène Usher Assouan Road, Riveria III, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire".&lt;/ref&gt;

The school serves levels Kindergarten through Grade 12. The International Community School of Abidjan Association operates the school, while the U.S. Embassy in Côte d'Ivoire sponsors it and the [[U.S. State Department]] Office of Overseas Schools provides support. The [[Middle States Association]] and the [[Council of International Schools]] accredit the school.&lt;ref name=PROFILE&gt;"[http://www.icsabidjan.org/page.cfm?p=546 ICSA Profile]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Y62RQ56y Archive]).

==History==
Several Americans, all of whom related in some way to the U.S. Embassy, established the school in 1972 with 12 initial students. The school moved into its current campus in 1989. Both the [[First Ivorian Civil War]] of 2002–2007 and the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]] of 2010–2011 disrupted the school and caused its student population to decline. The school occupied a temporary campus near [[M’Pouto]] in 2005, during the course of the first war. After each war ended, the student body recovered.&lt;ref name=PROFILE/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Jean Marie Auguste Bachelot de La Pylaie''' (May 25, 1786 in [[Fougères]], [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] &amp;ndash; October 12, 1856) was a French botanist, explorer and archaeologist. 

He studied at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], and then in Paris at the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]], where he was a pupil of [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769–1832) and [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] (1777–1850). 

He was a prolific explorer, mainly in France, but also in Africa and America, in particular the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]. 

In 1816, sailing on the frigate ''Cybele'', he surveyed [[St. George's Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|St. George's Bay]] during a three months tour of Newfoundland and Saint Pierre and Miquelon. He was the first known collector of local species in Saint Pierre. 

In December 1825, he began surveying the French islands of [[Hoëdic]] and [[Houat]], to pursue his passion of collecting algae. In January 1826, instead of returning to the continent as he had originally planned, he stayed on the islands, having become fond of their inhabitants, and began to describe their lives, their activities, and the natural history of their environment. 

He was the author of various archaeological studies on [[Brittany]].

'''Lejeloven''', formally ''Lov om leje'', is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[law]] which governs [[Leasehold estate|rentals]] of residential tenancies in private rented accommodation, including [[single-family home]]s, [[condominium]]s, so-called mixed properties and club premises. The law therefore does not apply to [[public housing]] or to commercial leases.

The law is intended to protect the tenant, by, among other provisions, limiting how much a [[landlord]] may ask in rent; in addition, the rent must be proportionate to the value of the premises. The law also states that a maximum of three months' rent may be required as a deposit, and that there is to be a separate accounting for heating, and finally the law sets out the rules which apply with respect to maintenance and expenditures incurred in connection with improvements.

The Act is subject to periodic review and was last revised on 1 July 2015.

Public rental housing is governed by the so-called ''M ordningen'', for ''miksordningen'' or ''mellemtingsordningen'' (mixed or temporary system).

'''Mega March Madness''' was a [[pay-per-view]] [[out-of-market sports package]] covering games in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] which was exclusive to [[DirecTV]] from 2002 until 2010 and supplemented the coverage from [[CBS Sports]]. The charge for the package was a one-time $69 charge per year.

==Description==
{{see also|College Basketball on CBS#Tournament feed overview}}

Viewers were able to watch games which did not air on their CBS affiliate, and Mega March Madness also had a multiplex channel allowing all four games to be framed on the same screen. Game coverage still used CBS coverage and announcers, though DirectTV promotional advertising replaced CBS station local breaks and the games were uninterrupted by in-game analysis or a cut-over to a more compelling game like was done on the main CBS broadcasts.

==Decline and discontinuation==

In many markets however, CBS also provided sub-feeds of games for affiliates to air on [[digital subchannel]]s or secondary [[sister station]]s. Though these games featured regular advertising and analysis and were only aired in [[standard definition television|standard definition]], it was regarded as duplicative and as the stations offered the coverage for free, Mega March Madness was among the lowest-subscribed DirectTV sports packages as many viewers utilized a secondary cable connection or antenna to receive the games without charge, although in latter years CBS only allowed stations coverage of one further game on a digital subchannel to protect the Mega March Madness package. Further development of streaming of all games over [[video on demand]] on the Internet cut further into the package's appeal.

After the 2010 tournament, Mega March Madness was discontinued, as the NCAA's new tournament deal with CBS and the networks of [[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], and [[truTV]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/22/ncaa-mens-basketball-tournament-expands-to-68-teams-cbs-adds-turner-to-television-team/49412 NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament Expands To 68 Teams; CBS Adds Turner To Television Team] press release via TV by the Numbers&lt;/ref&gt; called [[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|NCAA March Madness]], facilitated national coverage of every game on a cable or broadcast channel without cut-aways or staggered scheduling, making the Mega March Madness package superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/463763-Turner_Networks_To_Air_41_March_Madness_Tournament_Games.php Turner Networks To Air 41 March Madness Tournament Games] ''Multichannel News'' February 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ozamiz''' is an archdiocese of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Misamis Occidental]], southern [[Philippines]]. The archdiocese cathedral is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in [[Ozamiz City]], and its present archbishop is Martin Jumoad.&lt;ref name=chdozam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dozam.html |title=Archdiocese of Ozamiz |date=23 April 2017 |website=Catholic Hierarchy |last=Cheney |first=David M. |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[ecclesiastical province]] over which the archbishop of Ozamiz serves as metropolitan see covers the northwestern portion of the island of [[Mindanao]], including the [[highly urbanized city]] of [[Iligan]] and the provinces of [[Misamis Occidental]], [[Lanao del Norte]], [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]].&lt;ref name=chdozam/&gt; 

==History==
The Territorial Prelature of Ozamiz was erected on 27 January 1951 from the territory of the then-[[Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro|diocese of Cagayan de Oro]].&lt;ref name=cbcp/&gt; This prelature covered the provinces of [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]] (which were split in 1952 into [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]) and [[Misamis Occidental]], and the chartered cities of [[Iligan]], [[Marawi]], [[Oroquieta]] (established 1969), [[Ozamiz]] and [[Tangub]] (established 1967).&lt;ref name=chdozam/&gt; 

On 17 February 1971 [[Pope Paul VI]] elevated the Prelature of Ozamiz into a diocese, covering only parishes within [[Misamis Occidental]], with [[Jesus Varela]] appointed as its [[bishop]].&lt;ref name=chdozam/&gt; The new diocese became a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Zamboanga]].&lt;ref name=cbcp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbcponline.org/jurisdictions/ozamiz.html |website=Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines |accessdate=26 May 2017 |title=Archdiocese of Ozamiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 1983, Ozamiz was elevated to an archdiocese, with the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dipolog|Dipolog]] (established 1967), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iligan|Iligan]] (established 1971) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pagadian|Pagadian]] (established 1971), and the [[Territorial Prelature of Marawi|Prelature of Marawi]] (established 1976) as its suffragan dioceses.&lt;ref name=chdozam/&gt; [[Jesus Dosado]] was officially installed as its first archbishop on 10 April 1983.&lt;ref name=cbcp/&gt;

'''Theater Baden-Baden ''' at Goetheplatz is the city theater of Baden-Baden in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]].

At the instigation of [[Edouard Bénazet]], a former casino director, the theater was modeled on the Paris Opera by Charles Couteau.

Especially for the opening in August 1862 [[Hector Berlioz]] composed the opera ''[[Béatrice et Bénédict]]'' after [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. In 1869 [[Jacques Offenbach]] conducted the premiere of his operetta ''[[La princesse de Trébizonde]]''.

Since 1918 the theater has had an ensemble of permanently employed actors. Opera and other works of the musical theater are also performed as part of guest performances and co-productions.
At the beginning of the 1990s the theater was completely renovated and equipped with modern technology.

The theater is one of the venues of the ''[[New Pop Festival]]''. The premises, especially the foyer, can be rented for weddings and other events.

'''USA-66''', also known as '''GPS IIA-1''', '''GPS II-10''' and '''GPS SVN-23''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the first of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched, and was the oldest GPS satellite still in operation until its decommissioning on 25 January 2016.&lt;ref name=USCG/&gt;

USA-66 was launched at 21:39:01 UTC on 26 November 1990, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D201, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-66 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star 37|Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 1990, USA-66 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20072|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20293|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.98 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially given PRN 23, which it used until its retirement in February 2004; however, it was subsequently reactivated broadcasting PRN 32 and in February 2008 it rejoined the operational constellation.

It is located in slot 5 of plane E of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; but remained in service for over 25 years.

On 25 January 2016, USA-66 was decommissioned, and removed from the GPS constellation.&lt;ref name=USCG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=gpsShowNanu&amp;num=2016008|title=Notice Advisory To NAVSTAR Users (NANU) 2016008|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When engineers took it offline, its disappearance triggered a software bug that left the timing of 15 of the remaining GPS satellites off by 13.7 microseconds, causing widespread GPS disruptions.  &lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2886.pdf|title=The effects of the January 2016 UTC offset anomaly on GPS-controlled clocks monitored at NIST|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''United Nations: The First Fifty Years'', 1997. Page 368.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 626]] on December 20, 1988.

In the civil war, the Soviet Union and Cuba backed the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA), while South Africa and the United States backed the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA). The MPLA became the stronger party.&lt;ref name="un-bg"&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unavem1/UnavemIB.htm UNAVEM I: Background]&lt;/ref&gt;
