The '''1871 St. Louis tornado''' was an [[Fujita scale|F3]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on Wednesday, March 8, 1871, at 3:00pm. It traveled east-northeast at {{convert|70|mph|km/h|0}}, cutting a swath up to {{convert|250|yd|m|0}} wide and {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} long into [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. The tornado was on the ground for 3 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gendisasters.com/missouri/21408/east-st-louis-mo-tornado-mar-1871|title=East St. Louis, MO Tornado, Mar 1871 {{!}} GenDisasters ...

Six railroad depots were destroyed with eight deaths in them. One death occurred on a bridge. Overall, 9&amp;nbsp;people were killed, 60 injured, and $1,500,000 damage occurred. It is one of four tornadoes ([[1896 St. Louis–East St. Louis tornado|1896]], [[1927 St. Louis – East St. Louis tornado|1927]], 1959) that have ripped through the central business district of St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Missouri Climate Center|url = http://climate.missouri.edu/news/arc/apr2011.php|website = climate.missouri.edu|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2010 China drought and dust storms''' were a series of severe [[drought]]s during the spring of 2010 that affected [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Guangxi]], [[Sichuan]], [[Shanxi]], [[Henan]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Chongqing]], [[Hebei]] and [[Gansu]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] as well as parts of [[Southeast Asia]] including [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]], and [[dust storm]]s in March and April that affected much of [[East Asia]].  The drought has been referred to as the worst in a century in southwestern China.&lt;ref name="Asiait"&gt;Asianews.it.

==Causes==
Prior to the drought in Yunnan and Guizhou, the [[China Meteorological Administration]] recorded temperatures averaging 2&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than normal over six months and half the average precipitation for the past year across the region, both unprecedented since at least the 1950s.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/25/china-drought-emergency-food|title=China sends emergency food to drought-stricken provinces|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=March 25, 2010|work=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100328031753/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/mar/25/china-drought-emergency-food| archivedate=March 28, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of [[El Niño]] are believed to be contributing to the drought, which may be exacerbated by [[global warming]],&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/08/china-water-drought-control-opinions-columnists-gordon-g-chang.html |title=Will China Run Out Of Water? |last=Chang |first=Gordon G. |date=April 9, 2010 |publisher=Forbes.com |accessdate=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412071422/http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/08/china-water-drought-control-opinions-columnists-gordon-g-chang.html |archivedate=12 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as some areas in Yunnan have recorded record high temperatures during the winter since record-keeping began in 1950.&lt;ref name="bjreview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/nation/txt/2010-03/29/content_258734.htm|title=Drought Takes its Toll|last=Liu|first=Yunyun|date=April 1, 2010|publisher=Beijing Review|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas in the drought-affected regions have seen no rainfall since before October.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/world/asia/05china.html?src=me|title=Spring Harvest of Debt for Parched Farms in Southern China|last=Wangzhi Journal|first=Asia Pacific|date=April 4, 2010|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring dust storms are common in China, but have become more severe in recent years due to [[desertification]], [[deforestation]], [[drought]], [[urban sprawl]] and [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jRAywP2HiPafKiAikGO_jlpPj0GwD9EK0DR00|title=China's sandstorms blast Beijing with dust, sand|last=Bodeen|first=Christopher|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326193623/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jRAywP2HiPafKiAikGO_jlpPj0GwD9EK0DR00| archivedate= 26 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries downstream from Yunnan are also affected by drought conditions upriver, and some places including much of Vietnam have seen very little precipitation since the previous September.&lt;ref name="Timeoverland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1969630,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-sidebar|title=Vietnam Feels the Heat of a 100-Year Drought|last=Overland|first=Martha Ann|date=March 4, 2010|work=Time Inc|publisher=TIME.com|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe drought in 2009 also affected much of [[North China|Northern China]] and [[Northeastern China]], resulting in agricultural losses of up to 50%.&lt;ref name="bjreview"/&gt;

==Water shortages==
By March 22, 2010, about 51 million people faced [[water shortages]] in a number of provinces.&lt;ref name="Asiait" /&gt;  Commodities including [[sugar cane]], [[flower]]s, [[tea]], [[fruit]], [[potato]]es, [[rapeseed]], [[traditional Chinese medicine|medicinal ingredients]], [[tobacco]], [[wheat]],&lt;ref name="Chinadaily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/09/content_9705016.htm|title=Dry spell hits where it hurts|last=Wang|first=Huazhong|author2=Peng Yining, Li Yingqing|date=April 9, 2010|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413132021/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/09/content_9705016.htm| archivedate= 13 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rubber]] and [[coffee]] have been severely affected with output reduced by as much as 50%.

Around 3,600 rivers and [[Stream|brooks]] in Guizhou have run dry, while 916,000 [[hectare|ha]] of crops were affected by drought in the province and one million farmers have left to find work in other provinces. The drought affected over 28 million farmers, and a [[grain]] shortage has affected 8 million people. The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] has transferred 1.7 million tonnes of grain to the region to reduce potential [[inflation]].&lt;ref name="Chinadaily"/&gt; About 4.348 million ha of cropland were affected by the drought in Southwestern China and 942,000 ha would yield no harvest by late March, according to China's State Commission of Disaster Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0322/1224266810808.html|title=More than 50 million hit by drought in south of China|last=Coonan|first=Clifford|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late March, the government began [[cloud seeding]] in Guizhou using [[silver iodide]] to produce rain.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; By April 10, the drought had eased in Chongqing due to heavy rain, but it had affected over 18 million [[livestock]] and 8.13 million ha of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/10/c_13245644.htm|title=Drought eases in Chongqing, lingers in other affected regions|last=Xinhua|first=English.news.cn|date=April 10, 2010|work=Xinhua News Agency|publisher=English.news.cn|accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418030416/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/10/c_13245644.htm| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Yunnan Province inhabited by the [[Dai people]], officials cancelled or shortened the [[Songkran (disambiguation)|Songkran]] water [[dousing]] festival due to the water shortage, including in [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture]] and [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1981220,00.html?xid=rss-topstories|title=Drought Throws Cold Water on Yunnan's Water Festival|last=Brenhouse|first=Hillary|date=April 13, 2010|work=TIME Inc|publisher=TIME.com|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early June, the drought had affected close to 5 million hectares of land.&lt;ref name="GoogleAP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Google News|first=AP|title=Landslides, flooding kill 53 in southern China|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hHfFBvX2yQ_i_xgymQAV_XTotGHQD9G69BJ80|accessdate=1 July 2010|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drought may also affect water levels at the headwaters of the [[Yangtze River|Chang Jiang]], [[Mekong River|Mekong]] and [[Salween River]]s.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Some experts believe that [[hydropower]] production may be contributing to the water shortage from the drought.&lt;ref name="NTDTV"/&gt; Countries downstream of the Mekong, including [[Thailand]], suggested that the building of [[dam]]s on the river such as at [[Lancang River|Lancang]] may be worsening the effects of drought on the river's water levels,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; which were at their lowest in 20 years.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Fisheries along the Mekong in Thailand have halted, and 7.9 million people in the country are affected by the drought. 3,674 small dams within the river basin have dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/06/china.mekong.river.thailand.laos/|title=Drought grips parts of China, Southeast Asia amid dam concerns|last=Leitsinger|first=Miranda|date=April 7, 2010|work=Turner Broadcasting System|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=17 April 2010|location=Hong Kong| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100412011928/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/06/china.mekong.river.thailand.laos/| archivedate= 12 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drought in Vietnam was described as the country's worst in a century. The [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] near [[Hanoi]] was by early March at a level of {{convert|0.68|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lowest on record, and [[rice]] plantations have been severely affected. [[Forest fire|Timber fire]]s have been sparked in several regions. The [[Mekong Delta]] experienced its lowest water levels in nearly 20 years, threatening to produce [[saltwater intrusion]] in dry areas. Some parts of Vietnam are forecast to possibly receive no rain until August.&lt;ref name="Timeoverland"/&gt; A power shortage of up to one billion [[kilowatt-hour]]s could also hit the country as less water is available for hydroelectricity.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-06/vietnam-faces-power-shortage-as-drought-hurts-hydroelectricity.html|title=Vietnam Faces Power Shortage as Drought Hurts Hydroelectricity|last=Nguyen|first=Dieu Tu Uyen|date=April 6, 2010|work=Bloomberg|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=16 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414102530/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-06/vietnam-faces-power-shortage-as-drought-hurts-hydroelectricity.html| archivedate= 14 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The El Niño conditions of the winter prior to the drought has raised concerns that the rice crop in Vietnam, Thailand and the [[Philippines]] may be significantly reduced by the summer.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-07/rice-output-may-drop-in-thailand-on-drought-fao-says-update1-.html|title=Rice Output May Drop in Thailand on Drought, FAO Says (Update2)|last=Suwannakij|first=Supunnabul|author2=Luzi Ann Javier|date=April 7, 2010|work=Bloomberg|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100421044252/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-07/rice-output-may-drop-in-thailand-on-drought-fao-says-update1-.html| archivedate= 21 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of precipitation caused [[land subsidence]] at [[Kunming Wujiaba International Airport]] in Yunnan.&lt;ref name="bjreview"/&gt;

About 5,000 villagers in Yunnan Province have left their homes from the drought for streams near [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[foothill]]s,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; and many residents in Guangxi who are able to leave have also left. However, officials have denied reports of [[climate refugee|drought refugee]]s leaving their villages.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The source of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]'s [[headwaters]] was cut off, and its outflow was severely reduced. [[Water rationing]] was put into practice in some rural regions.&lt;ref name="bjreview"/&gt;

Shortages of drinking water also affected parts of [[Inner Mongolia]], including a water shortage for over 250,000 residents of [[Chifeng]]. Reservoirs in the city held 73.7% less water than they did one year prior and water volume had reduced by 77.4% in major rivers in the area by mid-April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/10/c_13245689.htm|title=Drought affects 250,000 people in Chifeng of Inner Mongolia|last=Xinhua|first=English.news.cn|date=April 10, 2010|work=Xinhua News Agency|publisher=English.news.cn|accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418030419/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/10/c_13245689.htm| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drought has affected [[non-ferrous metal]] production in Guangxi, including of [[electrolytic]] [[zinc]], with companies in [[Nandan County]] cutting production by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-04/10/content_9712227.htm|title=Lingering drought threatens SW China non-ferrous metal production|last=Xinhua|first=China Daily|date=April 10, 2010|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Nanning| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417022907/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-04/10/content_9712227.htm| archivedate= 17 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algal blooms==
In mid-June 2010, a large [[algal bloom]], consisting of ''[[enteromorpha]]'' algae, developed off the coast of [[Shandong]], in the [[Yellow Sea]]. Causes of the algal outbreak include [[marine pollution]] from [[sewage]] and [[agriculture in China|agricultural]] [[Surface runoff|run-off]], in addition to run-off from [[fish farm]]s, worsened by [[eutrophication]] following the drought, subsequent flooding and heat wave, as well as high [[sea surface temperature]]s in the area. The bloom continues to expand, and preparations have been made for a flotilla of vessels to ward off the bloom, covering an area of {{convert|400|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the largest bloom since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|first=Google|title=Big algae bloom expanding off China's east coast|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i1iqc1fa1dBy0ZV-_wdnSn0JqtRgD9GI6T081|accessdate=15 July 2010|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch of algae since expanded offshore [[Jiangsu]] Province, and is pushing toward the city of [[Qingdao]].

Close to 4,000 tonnes a day of algae is being removed from the bloom, to be sent off and used as [[Fodder|animal feed]] or [[fertilizer]]. Green and [[red tide]]s have become more common in China in recent years. The green tides from the current algal blooms can also result in [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]s from localized [[ocean anoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|title=China launches armada to head off algae plume|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/07/china-algae|accessdate=15 July 2010|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=7 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100710194139/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/07/china-algae| archivedate= 10 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large blooms of [[jellyfish]], including giant [[Nomura's jellyfish]] have also appeared off Shandong and around the coasts of Japan within the past decade, as a result of the same type of pollution in dead zones.

'''Advanced composite materials''' (ACMs) are also known as  '''advanced polymer matrix composites'''. These  are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high [[stiffness]], or [[modulus of elasticity]]  characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices. These are termed advanced composite materials (ACM) in comparison to the [[composite material]]s commonly in use such as [[reinforced concrete]], or even concrete itself. The [[Composite laminates|high strength fibers]] are also low [[density]] while occupying a large fraction of the [[volume]]

Advanced composites exhibit desirable [[physical properties|physical]] and [[chemical properties]] that include light weight coupled with high stiffness ([[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), and strength along the direction of the reinforcing fiber, dimensional stability, temperature and chemical resistance, [[Flexible response|flex performance]], and relatively easy processing. Advanced composites are replacing metal components in many uses, particularly in the [[aerospace industry]].

Composites are classified according to their [[states of matter|matrix phase]]. These classifications are polymer matrix composites (PMCs), [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composite]]s (CMCs), and [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMCs). Also, materials within these categories are often called "advanced" if they combine the properties of high (axial, [[longitude|longitudinal]]) strength values and high ([[Geometry|axial]], longitudinal) stiffness values, with low weight, corrosion resistance, and in some cases special [[electrical]] properties.

Advanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the [[aircraft]], aerospace, and [[sports equipment]] sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts. ACMs have been developing for NASA's ''[[Advanced Space Transportation Program]]'', armor protection for ''[[Army aviation]]'' and the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration]]'' of the USA, and high-temperature shafting for the ''[[Comanche helicopter]]''.  Additionally, ACMs have a decades long history in  military and government [[aerospace industry|aerospace industries]]. However, much of the technology is new and not presented formally in secondary or [[undergraduate education]], and the technology of advanced composites manufacture is continually evolving.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno&gt;

==Overview and historical perspective==
Manufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from [[skateboard]]s to components of the [[space shuttle]]. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites. Several of the composites manufacturing processes are common to both segments. The two basic segments are described below.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;

===Industrial composites===
The industrial composites industry has been in place for over 40 years in the U.S. This large industry utilizes various [[resin]] systems including [[polyester]],  [[epoxy]], and other specialty resins. These materials, along with a [[catalyst]] or [[curing agent]] and some type of fiber reinforcement (typically glass fibers) are used in the production of a wide spectrum of industrial components and consumer goods: boats, piping, auto bodies, and a variety of other parts and components.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;

===Advanced composites===
The Advanced polymer matrix composites industry, or Advanced composite materials industry,  is characterized by the use of expensive, high-performance resin systems and high-strength, high-stiffness fiber reinforcement. The aerospace industry, including [[military aircraft|military]] and [[commercial aircraft]] of all types, is the major customer for advanced composites. These materials have also been adopted for use by the [[sporting goods]] suppliers who sell [[high-performance equipment]] to the [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[fishing]], and [[archery]] markets;&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt; as well as in the swimming pool industry with Composite wall structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlyalpha.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While aerospace is the predominant market for advanced composites today, the industrial and [[automotive market]]s will increasingly see the use of advanced composites toward the year 2000(Its now 2017 this is out of date). At present, both manual and automated processes are employed in making advanced-composite parts. As automated processes become more predominant, the costs of advanced composites are expected to decline to the point at which these materials will be used widely in electronic, machinery, and surface transportation equipment.

Suppliers of advanced composite materials tend to be larger companies capable of doing the [[research and development]] necessary to provide the high-performance resin systems used in this segment of the industry. End-users also tend to be large, and many are in the aircraft and aerospace businesses.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

===Design Guidelines for composite materials===
To achieve your desired characteristics like good strength, wear resistance, good impact resistance, rigidity, toughness, good weather resistance etc. you may follow these guidelines.

"Align the fibers with the load's direction."

"Avoid shear loading."

"Combine several components into an integral structure."

"Use light core material covered with strong composite layer."

"Avoid high temperatures."

"Involve manufacturing considerations early in the design."

==Matrix Materials==
Advanced composite systems are divided into two basic types based on the chemical characteristics of the matrix, the two most common are thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are by far the predominant type in use today. Thermosets are subdivided into several resin systems including epoxies, phenolics, polyurethanes, and polyimides. Of these, epoxy systems currently dominate the advanced composite industry.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

===Thermosets===
[[Thermoset]] resins require addition of a [[curing agent]] or hardener and impregnation onto a reinforcing material, followed by a [[curing agent|curing step]] to produce a cured or finished part. Once cured, the part cannot be changed or reformed, except for finishing. Some of the more common thermosets include [[epoxy]], [[polyurethane]]s, phenolic and amino resins, [[bismaleimide]]s (BMI, polyimides), [[polyamide]]s.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

Of these, epoxies are the most commonly used in the industry. Epoxy resins have been in use in U.S. industry for over 40 years. Epoxy compounds are also referred to as glycidyl compounds. The epoxy molecule can also be expanded or cross-linked with other molecules to form a wide variety of resin products, each with distinct performance characteristics. These resins range from low-viscosity liquids to high-molecular weight solids. Typically they are high-viscosity liquids.

The second of the essential ingredients of an advanced composite system is the curing agent or hardener. These compounds are very important because they control the reaction rate and determine the performance characteristics of the finished part. Since these compounds act as catalysts for the reaction, they must contain active sites on their molecules. Some of the most commonly used curing agents in the advanced composite industry are the aromatic amines. Two of the most common are methylene-dianiline (MDA) and sulfonyldianiline (DDS).

Several other types of curing agents are also used in the advanced composite industry. These include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic amines, polyaminoamides, amides, and anhydrides. Again, the choice of curing agent depends on the cure and performance characteristics desired for the finished part. Polyurethanes are another group of resins used in advanced composite processes. These compounds are formed by reacting the [[polyol]] component with an isocyanate compound, typically [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI); [[methylene diisocyanate]] (MDI) and [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) are also widely used. Phenolic and amino resins are another group of PMC resins. The bismaleimides and polyamides are relative newcomers to the advanced composite industry and have not been studied to the extent of the other resins.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

===Thermoplastics===
[[Thermoplastic]]s currently represent a relatively small part of the ACM industry. They are typically supplied as nonreactive solids (no [[chemical reaction]] occurs during processing) and require only [[thermodynamics|heat and pressure]] to form the finished part. Unlike the thermosets, the thermoplastics can usually be reheated and reformed into another shape, if desired.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

==Fiber reinforcements==
Fiber reinforcement materials are added to the resin system increase the tensile strength and stiffness of the finished part. The selection of reinforcement material is based on the properties desired in the finished product. These materials do not react with the resin but are a distinct and integral part of the advanced composite system.

The three basic types of fiber reinforcement materials in use in the advanced composite industry are

* carbon ([[Carbon (fibre)]], [[graphite]], [[carbon nanotube]]s)
* [[aramid]]
* [[glass fiber]]s

Fibers used in advanced composite manufacture come in various forms, including tows, yarns, rovings, chopped strands, and woven fabric 
mats. Each of these has its own special application. When prepreg materials are used in parts manufacture, woven fabric or mats are required. In processes such as filament wet winding or pultrusion, yarns and rovings are used.&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACM-group/&gt;

==Prepreg==
Prepregs are resin-impregnated cloth, mat, or filaments in flat form that can be stored for later use. The resin is often partially cured to a tack-free state called "B-staging." Catalysts, inhibitors, flame retardants, and other additives may be included to obtain specific end-use properties and improve processing, storage, and handling characteristics.&lt;ref name=Pilato-Michno/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSHA-ACM&gt;{{cite web

==Limitations==
Despite their strength and low weight, composites have not been a miracle solution for aircraft structures. Composites are typically difficult to inspect for flaws. Some of them absorb moisture. Most importantly, they can be prohibitively expensive, primarily because they are labor-intensive and often require complex and expensive fabrication machines. Aluminium, by contrast, is easy and inexpensive to manufacture and repair, for example in a minor collision an aluminium component can often be hammered back into its original shape, whereas a crunched fiberglass component will likely have to be completely replaced.&lt;ref name="CentComm"&gt;{{cite web| last =Day| first =Dwayne A.| title =Composites and Advanced Materials| publisher =NASA.

Aluminium has a relatively high fracture toughness, allowing it to undergo large amounts of [[plastic deformation]] before failure. Composites, on the other hand, are less damage tolerant and undergo much less plastic deformation before failure. An airplane made entirely from aluminium can be repaired almost anywhere. This is not the case for composite materials, particularly as they use different and more exotic materials. Because of this, composites will probably always be used more in military aircraft, which are constantly being maintained, than in commercial aircraft, which have to require less maintenance.&lt;ref name="CentComm"/&gt; Aluminium still remains a remarkably useful material for aircraft structures and metallurgists have worked hard to develop better aluminium alloys, for example [[aluminium-lithium alloy]]s.

[[Plutonium]] occurs in a variety of [[Allotropy|allotropes]], even at ambient pressure.  These allotropes differ widely in crystal structure and density; the α and δ allotropes differ in density by more than 25% at constant pressure.

==Overview==
Plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh (zeta, ζ) under high temperature and a limited pressure range.&lt;ref name="Baker1983"/&gt;&lt;!-- Note: page 148 --&gt; These allotropes have very similar [[internal energy|energy level]]s but significantly varying [[density|densities]] and [[crystal structure]]s. This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following [[phase transition]]s.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"&gt;

==Machining plutonium==
The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α phase exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to [[cast iron]] but changes to the β phase (''beta phase'') at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood; recent research has focused on constructing accurate computer models of the phase transitions.&lt;!-- Note: Ambient pressure phase diagram of plutonium --&gt; The α phase has a low-symmetry [[monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure, hence its poor conductivity, brittleness, strength and compressibility.&lt;ref name = "Baker1983"/&gt;

==Stabilization==
Plutonium in the δ phase (''delta phase'') normally exists in the 310&amp;nbsp;°C to 452&amp;nbsp;°C range but is stable at room temperature when [[alloy]]ed with a small percentage of [[gallium]], [[aluminium]], or [[cerium]], enhancing workability and allowing it to be [[welding|welded]] in weapons applications. The delta phase has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium. In fission weapons, the explosive [[shock wave]]s used to compress a [[plutonium core]] will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha phase, significantly helping to achieve [[supercriticality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/pu-phase.htm Plutonium Crystal Phase Transitions]. Globalsecurity.org (2005-04-27). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[plutonium-gallium alloy]] is the most common δ-stabilized alloy.

[[Gallium]], [[aluminium]], [[americium]], [[scandium]] and [[cerium]] can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. [[Silicon]], [[indium]], [[zinc]] and [[zirconium]] allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amount of [[hafnium]], [[holmium]] and [[thallium]] also allows retaining some of the δ phase at room temperature. [[Neptunium]] is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures. [[Titanium]], [[hafnium]] and [[zirconium]] stabilize the β phase at room temperature when rapidly cooled.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt;

'''Amorphous silicon''' ('''a-Si''') is the non-[[crystalline]] form of [[silicon]] used for solar cells and [[thin-film transistor]]s in [[liquid-crystal display|LCDs]].

Used as [[semiconductor material]] for '''a-Si solar cells''', or '''thin-film silicon solar cells''', it is deposited in [[thin film]]s&lt;!--at low temperatures--&gt; onto a variety of flexible substrates, such as glass, metal and plastic. Amorphous silicon cells generally feature low efficiency, but are one of the most environmentally friendly [[photovoltaic]] technologies, since they do not use any [[toxic heavy metal]]s such as cadmium or lead.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

As a second-generation [[thin-film solar cell]] technology, amorphous silicon was once expected to become a major contributor in the [[Growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] worldwide photovoltaic market, but has since lost its significance due to strong competition from conventional [[crystalline silicon]] cells and other thin-film technologies such as [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[CIGS solar cell|CIGS]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Amorphous silicon differs from other [[allotropic]] variations, such as [[monocrystalline silicon]]—a single crystal, and [[polycrystalline silicon]], that consists of small grains, also known as [[crystallite]]s.

==Description==
Silicon is a fourfold coordinated atom that is normally [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] bonded to four neighboring silicon atoms. In crystalline silicon (c-Si) this tetrahedral structure continues over a large range, thus forming a well-ordered crystal lattice.

In amorphous silicon this long range order is not present. Rather, the atoms form a continuous random network. Moreover, not all the atoms within amorphous silicon are fourfold coordinated. Due to the disordered nature of the material some atoms have a [[dangling bond]]. Physically, these dangling bonds represent defects in the continuous random network and may cause anomalous electrical behavior.

The material can be [[passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by hydrogen, which bonds to the dangling bonds and can reduce the dangling bond density by several orders of magnitude. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has a sufficiently low amount of defects to be used within devices such as solar [[photovoltaic]] cells, particularly in the [[protocrystalline]] growth regime.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Collins, et al., "Evolution of microstructure and phase in amorphous, protocrystalline, and microcrystalline silicon studied by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry", ''Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells'', 78(1-4), pp. 143-180, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hydrogenation is associated with light-induced degradation of the material, termed the [[Staebler–Wronski effect]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Wronski, et al., "Intrinsic and Light Induced Gap States in a-Si:H Materials and Solar Cells - Effects of Microstructure", ''Thin Solid Films'', 451-452 pp. 470-475, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic of allotropic forms of silcon horizontal plain.svg|thumb|center|550px|Schematic of allotropic forms of silicon: [[monocrystalline silicon|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], and amorphous silicon]]

==Amorphous silicon and carbon==
Amorphous [[alloy]]s of silicon and carbon (amorphous silicon [[carbide]], also hydrogenated, a-Si&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;:H) are an interesting variant. Introduction of carbon atoms adds extra degrees of freedom for control of the properties of the material. The film could also be made [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to visible light.

Increasing the concentration of carbon in the alloy widens the electronic gap between conduction and valence bands (also called "optical gap" and [[bandgap]]). This can potentially increase the light efficiency of solar cells made with amorphous silicon carbide layers. On the other hand, the electronic properties as a [[semiconductor]] (mainly [[electron mobility]]), are adversely affected by the increasing content of carbon in the alloy, due to the increased disorder in the atomic network.

Several studies are found in the scientific literature, mainly investigating the effects of deposition parameters on electronic quality, but practical applications of amorphous silicon carbide in commercial devices are still lacking.

==Properties==
The density of amorphous Si has been calculated as 4.90×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; atom/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2.285 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at 300 K. This was done using thin (5 micron) strips of amorphous silicon. This density is 1.8±0.1% less dense than crystalline Si at 300 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Custer|first=J.

==Hydrogenated amorphous silicon==
Unhydrogenated a-Si has a very high defect density which leads to undesirable semiconductor properties such as poor photoconductivity and prevents doping which is critical to engineering semiconductor properties. By introducing hydrogen during the fabrication of amorphous silicon, [[photoconductivity]] is significantly improved and doping is made possible. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H, was first fabricated in 1969 by Chittick, Alexander and Sterling by deposition using a silane gas (SiH4) precursor. The resulting material showed a lower defect density and increased conductivity due to impurities. Interest in a-Si:H came when (in 1975), [[Peter LeComber|LeComber]] and [[Walter Eric Spear|Spear]] discovered the ability for substitutional doping of a-Si:H using phosphine (n-type) or diborane (p-type).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQMwsMt4VmoC|title=Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon|last=Street|first=R.

==Applications==
While a-Si suffers from lower electronic performance compared to c-Si, it is much more flexible in its applications. For example, a-Si layers can be made thinner than c-Si, which may produce savings on silicon material cost.

One further advantage is that a-Si can be deposited at very low temperatures, e.g., as low as 75 degrees Celsius. This allows deposition on not only glass, but [[plastic electronics|plastic]] as well, making it a candidate for a [[roll-to-roll processing]] technique. Once deposited, a-Si can be [[doped]] in a fashion similar to c-Si, to form [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] or [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] layers and ultimately to form electronic devices.

Another advantage is that a-Si can be deposited over large areas by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|PECVD]]. The design of the PECVD system has great impact on the production cost of such panel, therefore most equipment suppliers put their focus on the design of PECVD for higher throughput, that leads to lower [[manufacturing cost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TW0-4H16NVN-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1005509540&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=97a33054065ae2a5a59f8327ce400217 |title= Towards very low-cost mass production of thin-film silicon photovoltaic (PV) solar modules on glass |publisher= Elsevier B.V. |date=2005-09-02 |doi=10.1016/j.tsf.2005.07.299 |volume=502 |journal=Thin Solid Films |pages=292–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when the [[silane]] is [[recycled]].&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Kreiger, et al., Life Cycle Analysis of Silane Recycling in Amorphous Silicon-Based Solar Photovoltaic Manufacturing, ''Resources, Conservation &amp; Recycling'', 70, pp.44-49 (2013). https://www.academia.edu/2310926/Life_Cycle_Analysis_of_Silane_Recycling_in_Amorphous_Silicon-Based_Solar_Photovoltaic_Manufacturing&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrays of small (under 1 mm by 1 mm) a-Si photodiodes on glass are used as visible-light [[image sensor]]s in some [[flat panel detector]]s for [[fluoroscopy]] and [[radiography]].

===Photovoltaics===
{{See also|Thin-film solar cell}}
[[File:Vintage Teal Photon Solar Powered Electronic Pocket Calculator, LCD With Yellow Filter, One Of The First Solar Powered Calculators, Made In Japan, Circa 1978 (15083726059).jpg|thumb|The "Teal Photon" [[solar-powered calculator]] produced in the late 1970s]]

Amorphous silicon (a-Si) has been used as a [[photovoltaic]] [[solar cell]] material for devices which require very little power, such as pocket [[calculator]]s, because their lower performance compared to conventional [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si) solar cells is more than offset by their simplified and lower cost of deposition onto a substrate. The first [[solar-powered calculator]]s were already available in the late 1970s, such as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.

More recently, improvements in a-Si construction techniques have made them more attractive for large-area solar cell use as well. Here their lower inherent efficiency is made up, at least partially, by their thinness – higher efficiencies can be reached by stacking several thin-film cells on top of each other, each one tuned to work well at a specific frequency of light. This approach is not applicable to c-Si cells, which are thick as a result of its [[Direct and indirect band gaps|indirect band-gap]] and are therefore largely opaque, blocking light from reaching other layers in a stack.

The source of the low efficiency of amorphous silicon photovoltaics is due largely to the low [[hole mobility]] of the material.&lt;ref name="LiangSchiff2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Jianjun|last2=Schiff|first2=E.

The main advantage of a-Si in large scale production is not efficiency, but cost. a-Si cells use only a fraction of the silicon needed for typical c-Si cells, and the cost of the silicon has historically been a significant contributor to cell cost. However, the higher costs of manufacture due to the multi-layer construction have, to date, made a-Si unattractive except in roles where their thinness or flexibility are an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;By Eric Wesoff, Greentech Media. "[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/The-End-of-Oerlikons-Amorphous-Silicon-Solar-Saga The End of Oerlikon’s Amorphous Silicon Solar Saga]." January 31, 2014. February 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, amorphous silicon thin-film cells use a [[p-i-n]] structure. The placement of the p-type layer on top is also due to the lower hole mobility, allowing the holes to traverse a shorter average distance for collection to the top contact. Typical panel structure includes front side glass, [[Transparent conducting oxide|TCO]], thin-film silicon, back contact, [[polyvinyl butyral]] (PVB) and back side glass. Uni-Solar, a division of [[Energy Conversion Devices]] produced a version of flexible backings, used in roll-on roofing products. However, the world's largest manufacturer of amorphous silicon photovoltaics had to file for bankruptcy in 2012, as it could not compete with the rapidly declining prices of conventional [[solar panel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/The-End-Arrives-For-ECD-Solar- |title=The End Arrives for ECD Solar |work=GreentechMedia |date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Oerlikon-Divests-its-Solar-Business-and-the-Fate-of-Amorphous-Silicon-Solar |title=Oerlikon Divests Its Solar Business and the Fate of Amorphous Silicon PV |work=GrrentechMedia |date=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microcrystalline and micromorphous silicon====
{{Main|Nanocrystalline silicon|Micromorph}}
Microcrystalline silicon (also called nanocrystalline silicon) is amorphous silicon, but also contains small crystals. It absorbs a broader spectrum of light and is [[flexible electronics|flexible]]. [[Micromorph]]ous silicon [[photovoltaic module|module]] technology combines two different types of silicon, amorphous and microcrystalline silicon, in a top and a bottom [[photovoltaic cell]]. Sharp produces cells using this system in order to more efficiently capture blue light, increasing the efficiency of the cells during the time where there is no direct sunlight falling on them. [[Protocrystalline]] silicon is often used to optimize the open circuit voltage of a-Si photovoltaics.

====Large-scale production====
[[Xunlight Corporation]], which has received over $40 million of institutional investments,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} has completed the installation of its first 25&amp;nbsp;MW wide-web, [[roll-to-roll]] photovoltaic manufacturing equipment for the production of thin-film silicon PV modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xunlight.com/2009/10/june-22-2009-xunlight-completes-installation-of-its-first-25-megawatt/ |title=Xunlight Completes Installation of its First 25 Megawatt Wide-Web Roll-to-Roll Photovoltaic Manufacturing Equipment |date=June 22, 2009 |publisher=Xunlight}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anwell Technologies]] has also completed the installation of its first 40 MW a-Si thin film solar panel manufacturing facility in Henan with its in-house designed multi-substrate-multi-chamber PECVD equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarbuzz.com/news/NewsASMA255.htm |title= Anwell Produces its First Thin Film Solar Panel | publisher= Solarbuzz |date= September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors====
[[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]]s (PVT), are systems that convert [[solar radiation]] into [[electrical energy]] and [[thermal energy]]. These systems combine a solar cell, which converts [[electromagnetic radiation]] ([[photon]]s) into electricity, with a [[solar thermal collector]], which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the solar PV module. Solar cells suffer from a drop in efficiency with the rise in temperature due to increased [[solar cell#Cell temperature|resistance]]. Most such systems can be engineered to carry heat away from the solar cells thereby cooling the cells and thus improving their efficiency by lowering resistance.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Kalogirou, Y. Tripanagnostopoulos (30 January 2006). These systems are most often used for domestic hot water (DHW) and electricity production&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is an effective method, it causes the thermal component to under-perform compared to a [[solar thermal]] collector. Recent research showed that a-Si:H PV with low temperature coefficients allow the PVT to be operated at high temperatures, creating a more symbiotic PVT system and improving performance of the a-Si:H PV by about 10%.

===Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display===
{{Main|Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display}}

Amorphous silicon has become the material of choice for the active layer in [[thin-film transistor]]s (TFTs), which are most widely used in [[large-area electronics]] applications, mainly for [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs).

[[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display]] (TFT-LCD) show a similar circuit layout process to that of semiconductor products. However, rather than fabricating the transistors from silicon, that is formed into a crystalline silicon [[wafer]], they are made from a thin film of amorphous silicon that is deposited on a [[glass]] panel. The silicon layer for TFT-LCDs is typically deposited using the [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|PECVD]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasma.com/classroom/fabricating_tft_lcd.htm |title=TFT LCD - Fabricating TFT LCD |publisher=Plasma.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502060952/http://www.plasma.com/classroom/fabricating_tft_lcd.htm |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transistors take up only a small fraction of the area of each pixel and the rest of the silicon film is etched away to allow light to easily pass through it.

[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is sometimes used in displays requiring higher TFT performance. Examples include small high-resolution displays such as those found in projectors or viewfinders. Amorphous silicon-based TFTs are by far the most common, due to their lower production cost, whereas polycrystalline silicon TFTs are more costly and much more difficult to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasma.com/classroom/what_is_tft_lcd.htm |title=TFT LCD - Electronic Aspects of LCD TVs and LCD Monitors |publisher=Plasma.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823203913/http://www.plasma.com/classroom/what_is_tft_lcd.htm |archivedate=2013-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
"The challenge of making this film was almost as severe as the challenge of the journey it depicts. The makers showed great imagination to get around the limitations of a zero budget, livening up the narrative with interviews, jokes, sight gags, even dance! It gently raised important issues along the way, allowing these issues to arise quite naturally out of the journey itself." -VIMFF Jury Statement for Grand Prize winner 'Borealis'

"An appealing ground-level spin on environmental issues" - The Vancouver Province

'''Bristow Helicopters Flight 56C''' was a helicopter flight that flew between Aberdeen and the Brae Alpha oil rig in the North Sea. On 19 January 1995 the [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma|AS 332L Super Puma]] [[helicopter]] operating the route, registered G-TIGK and named ''Cullen'', was struck by lightning. The flight was carrying 16 oil workers from [[Aberdeen]] to an oil platform at the [[Brae oilfield]]. All people on board survived.

==Crew==
The commander of the flight was Cedric Roberts (44). He had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1974. He was a very experienced pilot with more than 9,600 hours of flying time under his belt. The first officer was Lionel Sole (39). Sole had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1990. He had more than 3,100 hours of flying time to his credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/2-1997%20G-TIGK.pdf Aircraft Accident Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
En route, the helicopter ran into poor weather and was then struck by [[lightning]]. This caused severe damage to the [[tail rotor]]. Though the helicopter managed to limp for a few more minutes, the tail rotor eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a [[life raft]]. Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued by the ship ''Grampian Freedom''.

The lightning strike was an isolated one in the storm, and may have been induced by the helicopter flying through the cloud. The accident investigation also revealed potential troubles with the [[composite material]] with brass strip design of the rotors which made the rotorblades prone to explosion and damage from lightning strikes.

==In popular culture==
The events of Flight 56C were featured in "Helicopter Down", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 3 (2005)|Season 3 (2005)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Helicopter Down|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=3|number=7|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world).

'''Caorso Nuclear Power Plant''' was a [[nuclear power plant]] at [[Caorso]] in [[Italy]]. It featured a single [[Boiling Water Reactor]], a BWR 4 with a Mark II-[[Containment building|Containment]] from [[General Electric]],  with an electrical net output of 860 MW, used low-enriched [[uranium]] as fuel, was moderated and cooled by normal light water.

It operated from 1981 until 1990, when it was closed following the [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|referendum]] of November 1987. It was by far the most modern and in terms of capacity biggest nuclear power plant to go online in Italy.

'''Clapboard''' or '''clabbard''', also called '''bevel siding''', '''lap siding''', and '''weatherboard''', with regional variation in the definition of these terms, is wooden [[siding]] of a building in the form of horizontal boards, often overlapping.

==Definition==
''Clapboard'' in modern (American English) usage is a word for long, thin boards used to cover walls and (formerly) roofs of buildings.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clapboard&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also historically called ''clawboards'' and ''cloboards''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. "Clapboard" def. 1. ''The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language'',. New York: The Century Co., 188991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

An older meaning of clapboard is small, split pieces of oak imported from Germany for use as [[barrel]] staves, and the name is a partial translation of Middle Dutch ''klapholt'' and related to German ''Klappholz''.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt;

==Types==
===Riven===
Clapboards were originally [[Wood splitting|riven]] radially producing [[triangle|triangular]] or "feather-edged" sections, attached thin side up and overlapped thick over thin to shed water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularwoodworking.com/article/Finish_Both_Sides_Not_Necessary/ Heart side of boards]. ''PopularWoodworking.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radially sawn===
Later, the boards were [[Rift sawing|radially sawn]] in a type of [[sawmill]] called a ''clapboard mill'', producing ''vertical-grain'' clapboards. The more commonly used boards in [[New England]] are vertical-grain boards. Depending on the diameter of the log, cuts are made from 4½" to 6½" deep along the full length of the log. Each time the log turns for the next cut, it is rotated ⅝" until it has turned 360°. This gives the radially sawn clapboard its taper and true vertical grain.

===Flat-sawn===
''Flat-grain'' clapboards are cut tangent to the annual growth rings of the tree. As this technique was common in most parts of the [[British Isles]], it was carried by immigrants to their colonies in the [[Americas]] and in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Flat-sawn wood [[Wood warping|cups]] more and does not hold paint as well as radially sawn wood.

===Chamferboard===
[[File:Chamferboard house exterior (closeup), Brisbane, 2015.JPG|thumb|Chamferboard house exterior (closeup), Brisbane, 2015]]
''Chamferboards'' are an Australian form of weatherboarding using tongue-and-groove joints to link the boards together to give a flatter external appearance than regular angled weatherboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chamferboard|url=http://www.abis.com.au/chamferboard|publisher=Australian Building Inspection Services|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finger jointed===
Some modern clapboards are made up of shorter pieces of wood ''finger jointed'' together with an adhesive.

==Wood species==
In North America clapboards were historically made of split oak, pine and spruce. Modern clapboards are available in red cedar and pine.

In some areas, clapboards were traditionally left as raw wood, relying upon good air circulation and the use of 'semi-hardwoods' to keep the boards from rotting. These boards eventually go grey as the tannins are washed out from the wood. More recently clapboard has been tarred or painted—traditionally black or white due to locally occurring minerals or pigments. In modern clapboard these colors remain popular, but with a hugely wider variety due to chemical pigments and stains.

Clapboard houses may be found in most parts of the British Isles, and the style may be part of all types of traditional building, from cottages to windmills, shops to workshops, as well as many others.

In [[New Zealand]], clapboard housing dominates buildings before 1960. Clapboard, with a corrugated iron roof, was found to be a cost-effective building style. After the big [[earthquakes]] of 1855 and 1931, wooden buildings were perceived as being less vulnerable to damage. Clapboard is always referred to as 'weatherboard' in New Zealand.

Newer, cheaper designs often imitate the form of clapboard construction as "[[siding]]" made of [[vinyl siding|vinyl]] ([[Polyvinyl chloride#Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)|uPVC]]), [[aluminum]], [[fiber cement siding|fiber cement]], or other man-made materials.

[[File:Aachen Bonifatiuskirche Detail.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cornerstone with bronze relief images]]
The '''cornerstone''' (or '''foundation stone''' or '''setting stone''') is the first stone set in the construction of a [[masonry]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], important since all other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire [[Construction|structure]].

Over time a cornerstone became a [[ceremony|ceremonial]] masonry stone, or [[replica]], set in a prominent location on the outside of a building, with an inscription on the stone indicating the construction dates of the building and the names of [[architect]], [[Construction worker|builder]], and other significant individuals. The rite of laying a cornerstone is an important cultural component of eastern [[architecture]] and metaphorically in [[sacred architecture]] generally.

Some cornerstones include [[time capsule]]s from, or engravings commemorating, the time a particular building was built.

==History==
[[File:DCJCC cornerstone ceremony.jpg|thumb|The 1925 cornerstone ceremony of the [[Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center]]]]
Often, the ceremony involved the placing of [[Sacrifice|offerings]] of [[cereal|grain]], [[wine]] and [[oil]] on or under the stone. These were symbolic of the produce and the people of the land and the means of their subsistence. This in turn derived from the practice in still more ancient times of making an animal or human&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jarvis | first = William E. | authorlink = | title = Time Capsules: A Cultural History | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company | year = 2002 | location = | page = 105 | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7864-1261-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hastings | first = James | authorlink = | author2 = Selbie, John Alexander; Gray, Louis Herbert | title = Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. VI. | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | year = 1914 | location = New York | page = 863 | url = | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sacrifice]] that was laid in the foundations.

Frazer (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;106-107) in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' charts the various propitiary sacrifices and [[effigy]] substitution such as the [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]], states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or soul come out more clearly than in some customs practised to this day in South-eastern Europe. In modern Greece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone, under which the animal is afterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice is to give strength and stability to the building. But sometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to the foundation-stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or his shadow, and buries the measure under the foundation-stone; or he lays the foundation-stone upon the man's shadow. It is believed that the man will die within the year. The Roumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadow is thus [[Immurement|immured]] will die within forty days; so persons passing by a building which is in course of erection may hear a warning cry, Beware lest they take thy shadow! Not long ago there were still shadow-traders whose business it was to provide architects with the shadows necessary for securing their walls. In these cases the measure of the shadow is looked on as equivalent to the shadow itself, and to bury it is to bury the life or soul of the man, who, deprived of it, must die. Thus the custom is a substitute for the old practice of immuring a living person in the walls, or crushing him under the foundation-stone of a new building, in order to give strength and durability to the structure, or more definitely in order that the angry ghost may haunt the place and guard it against the intrusion of enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmSqmPSFzw8C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=foundation+stone+animal+sacrifice&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fFOI4DYYSs&amp;sig=Pwhc7VJHcOIvIHaQITGFiWOBmww |title=The Golden Bough - James George Frazer - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ancient Japan legends talk about [[Hitobashira]] (人柱, "human pillar"), in which maidens were buried alive at the base or near some constructions as a prayer to ensure the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks.

==Modern practices==
[[File:Cornerstone of old building, Los Angeles Central Library, laid 1925, photographed 2012.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial masonry stone of the [[Los Angeles Central Library]] building, laid in 1925]]
Normally, a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] of the organization, or a local [[celebrity]] or [[community leader]], will be invited to conduct the ceremony of figuratively beginning the foundations of the building, with the person's name and official position and the date usually being recorded on the stone. This person is usually asked to place their hand on the stone or otherwise signify its laying.

Often still, and certainly until the 1970s, most ceremonies involved the use of a specially manufactured and engraved [[trowel]] that had a formal use in laying [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] under the stone. Similarly, a special [[hammer]] was often used to ceremonially tap the stone into place.

The foundation stone often has a cavity into which is placed a [[time capsule]] containing [[newspapers]] of the day or week of the ceremony plus other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s that are typical of the period of the construction: [[coin]]s of the year may also be immured in the cavity or time capsule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kleisner |first=Tomas |url=https://www.academia.edu/434349/An_Unknown_Medal_for_the_Foundation_of_Susice_Monastery_1651 |title=An Unknown Medal for the Foundation of Susice Monastery, 1651 &amp;#124; Tomas Kleisner |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
Freemasons sometimes perform the public cornerstone laying ceremony for notable buildings. This ceremony was described by The Cork Examiner of 13 January 1865 as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...The Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Munster, applying the golden square and level to the stone said ; " My Lord Bishop, the stone has been proved and found to be 'fair work and square work' and fit to be laid as the foundation stone of this Holy Temple".' After this, Bishop Gregg spread cement over the stone with a trowel specially made for the occasion by John Hawkesworth, a silversmith and a jeweller. He then gave the stone three knocks with a mallet and declared the stone to be 'duly and truly laid'. The Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Munster poured offerings of corn, oil and wine over the stone after Bishop Gregg had declared it to be 'duly and truly laid'. The Provincial Grand Chaplain of the Masonic Order in Munster then read out the following prayer: 'May the Great Architect of the universe enable us as successfully to carry out and finish this work. May He protect the workmen from danger and accident, and long preserve the structure from decay; and may He grant us all our needed supply, the corn of nourishment, the wine of refreshment, and the oil of joy, Amen. So mote it be.' The choir and congregation then sang the [[Old Hundredth|Hundredth Psalm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/mapsimages/corkphotographs/michaelolearyphotos/saintfinbarrescathedral |title=Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral &gt; Cork Past and Present |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Freemasonry]], which grew from the practice of [[stonemason]]s, the initiate (Entered [[Apprentice]]) is placed in the north-east corner of the Lodge as a figurative foundation stone.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Malcolm C. ''Duncan's Ritual of Freemasonry'' David McKay Company, NY&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to signify the unity of the North associated with darkness and the East associated with light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lATeh8L-osMC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=In+ancient+buildings,+the+foundation+stone+was+placed+at+the+north-east+corner+of+the+structure.&amp;lr=&amp;ei=zropS_vKC5PslQTBjoS6Cw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=29#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Symbolism of Freemasonry: Its Science, Philosophy, Legends, Myths, and Symbolism - Albert Gallatin Mackey - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical==
[[File:SPaulo foundation.jpg|thumb|Cornerstone of the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau]] (1602).]]
[[File:BywaterStVincentCornerstone2.jpg|thumb|Cornerstone at [[St. Vincent De Paul Roman Catholic Church (New Orleans)|St. Vincent De Paul Roman Catholic Church]], [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (1866)]]

A cornerstone ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Άκρογωνιεîς, [[Latin language|Latin]]: Primarii Lapidis) will sometimes be referred to as a "foundation-stone", and is symbolic of Christ, whom the [[Apostle Paul]] referred to as the "head of the corner" and is the "Chief Cornerstone of the Church" ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:20|KJV}}). A chief or head cornerstone is placed above two walls to maintain them together and avoid the building to fall apart. Many of the more ancient churches will place [[relic]]s of the [[saint]]s, especially [[martyr]]s, in the foundation stone.

===Western Roman Catholic Churches===
According to the pre-[[Vatican II]] rite of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]: Before the construction of a new church begins, the foundations of the building are clearly marked out and a wooden cross is set up to indicate where the altar will stand. Once preparations have been made, the [[bishop]]—or a priest delegated by him for that purpose—will bless [[holy water]] and with it sprinkle first the cross that was erected and then the foundation stone itself. Upon the stone he is directed to engrave crosses on each side with a knife, and then pronounce the following prayer: "Bless, O Lord, this creature of stone (''creaturam istam lapidis'') and grant by the invocation of Thy holy name that all who with a pure mind shall lend aid to the building of this church may obtain soundness of body and the healing of their souls. Through Christ Our Lord, Amen."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontifical#Pontificale - service book|Pontificale Romanum]], Fasc. III, "De Benedictione et Impositione primarii Lapidis pro Ecclesia aedificanda"&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the [[Litany of the Saints]] is said, followed by an [[antiphon]] and Psalm 126 ({{bibleverse||Psalm|127|KJV}} in the Hebrew numbering), which appropriately begins with the verse, "Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it". Then the stone is lowered into its place with another prayer and again sprinkled with holy water. More antiphons and psalms follow, while the bishop sprinkles the foundations, dividing them into three sections and ending each with a special prayer. Finally, ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]'' is sung, and two short prayers. Then the bishop, if he deems it opportune, sits down and exhorts the people to contribute to the construction, appointments and maintenance of the new church, after which he dismisses them with his blessing and the proclamation of an [[indulgence]].&lt;ref name = cathen&gt;{{Citation | last =Thurston | first =Herbert  | contribution =Corner Stone | year =1912 | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume =XIV | place=New York | publisher =Robert Appleton Company | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14303a.htm | accessdate =2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Churches===
[[File:2005hrest05.jpg|thumb|The ceremony of laying the cornerstone of a church in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the [[blessing]] of the [[bishop]] must be obtained before construction on a new church may commence, and any clergyman who ventures to do so without a blessing can be [[deposition (politics)|deposed]].  The "Rite of the Foundation of a Church" (i.e., the laying of the cornerstone) will differ slightly depending on whether the church is to be constructed of wood or of stone. Even when a church is built of wood, the cornerstone must in fact be made of stone.

The cornerstone is a solid stone cube upon which a cross has been carved.  Below the cross, the following words are inscribed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, this church is founded, in honour and memory of (''here the name of the [[patron saint]] of the new church is inserted''); in the rule of (''here the name of the ruler is inserted''); in the episcopacy of (''here the name of the bishop is inserted''); in the Year of the World _____ ([[Aetos Kosmou|Anno Mundi]]), and from the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Birth in the flesh]] of [[Logos|God the Word]] _____ ([[Anno Domini]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the top of the stone a cross-shaped space is hollowed out into which relics may be placed. Relics are not required, but they are normally placed in the cornerstone. If no relics are inserted in the stone, the inscription may be omitted, but not the cross.

After the foundations for the new church have been dug and all preparations finished, the bishop (or his deputy) with the other clergy vest and form a [[crucession]] to the building site. The service begins with a [[moleben]] and the [[Holy water#Eastern Christians|blessing of holy water]].  Then a cross is erected in the place where the [[altar|Holy Table]] (altar) will stand, and the cornerstone is consecrated and set in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Hapgood | first =Isabel | contribution =The Office Used at the Founding of a Church (the Laying of the Corner-Stone) | year =1975 | title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church (5th Ed.) | page =479 | place=[[Englewood, NJ]] | publisher =[[Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America|Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Sokolof | first =Archpriest D. | contribution =The Order of the Consecration of a Church | year =2001 | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services (3rd printing, re-edited) | page =136 | place=[[Jordanville, New York|Jordanville, NY]] | publisher =Printshop of St. [[Job of Pochaev]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3272">The '''Dhruva reactor''' is [[India]]'s largest nuclear [[research reactor]]. Located in the [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) suburb of [[Trombay]] at the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC), it is India's primary generator of weapons-grade [[plutonium]]-bearing spent fuel for its [[nuclear weapon]]s program. Originally named the R-5, this [[pool-type reactor]] first went critical on 8 August 1985 after 10 years of construction. However, the unit did not attain full power until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/research/india/nuclear.htm|title= Selected Indian Nuclear Facilities|author=Andrew Koch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011215135620/http://cns.miis.edu/research/india/nuclear.htm|archivedate=15 December 2001|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor experienced at least one serious accident when 4MT (four metric tons) of heavy water overflowed from the reactor core in 1985 following vibration problems.&lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhruva Research Reactor|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/837/|website=Nuclear Threat Initiative|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed as a larger version of the [[CIRUS reactor]], Dhruva was an Indian designed project built to provide an independent source of weapons-grade plutonium free from safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menon|first1=Amarnath K|title=Indian scientists achieve major landmark in atomic energy programme with Dhruva|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indian-scientists-achieve-major-landmark-in-atomic-energy-programme-with-dhruva/1/354434.html|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=India Today|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dhruva project cost 950 million rupees. The reactor uses [[heavy water]] (deuterium) as a [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and coolant. Aluminum clad [[fuel rod]]s containing [[natural uranium]] are used to obtain a maximum power output of 100MW.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; According to conservative estimates, the reactor produces an average of 16–26&amp;nbsp;kg of weapons-grade plutonium per year in its spent fuel, while former [[Indian Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) Chairman P.K. Iyengar said the unit could produce up to 30&amp;nbsp;kg of weapons-grade plutonium each year.

[[Dhruva]], in Indian mythology, is a prince blessed to eternal existence and glory as the Pole Star (Dhruva Nakshatra in [[Sanskrit]]) by Lord [[Vishnu]]. It can also mean simply the [[Pole Star]] or 'ultimate' in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vinay|first1=Dr|title=Linga Purana|date=2006|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=9788128806797|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhIbyxoxHMgC&amp;pg=PA41|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''diver's pump''' is a manually operated low pressure air compressor used to provide divers in [[standard diving dress]] with air while they are underwater.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Robert Davis (inventor)|Davis, RH]] |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman &amp; Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |pages=693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stillson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stillson, GD |title=Report in Deep Diving Tests. |journal=US Bureau of Construction and Repair, Navy Department. Technical Report |volume= |year=1915 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6527 |accessdate=2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotary==
[[File:Dalgıç hava makinası iç aksam.JPG|thumb|left|Manually operated two-cylinder diver's air pump without cabinet, showing the functional components]]
[[File:Diving Stockholm 1951. Air supplied from the boat.jpg|thumb|Two men operating a rotary diver's air pump]]
'''Rotary pumps''' are driven by a [[crankshaft]] that is rotated by handles on two [[flywheel]]s attached to the ends of the shaft on each side of the pump. Rotary pumps were built with one, two or three [[Pneumatic cylinder|cylinder]]s,{{sfn|Pardoe|2016|pp=155–176 }} and are operated by a team of two men. [[Piston]]s attached to the crankshaft draw in air through the [[valve|inlet valves]] and then pump it through the outlet valves to an [[air hose]] which delivers the air to the [[standard diving dress|helmet]] of the [[surface supplied diving|diver]]. Cylinders, valves and outlet fittings for air are generally made from [[brass]] for corrosion resistance in the marine environment. Rotary operated pumps were manufactured with single or double action.&lt;ref&gt;Double action cylinders deliver on both the up- and down-stroke.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pardoe|2016|pp=155–176 }}

Flow of air through the helmet could be controlled by manually adjusting the back-pressure on the helmet exhaust valve, usually on the lower right side of the bonnet, and by manually adjusting the inlet supply valve on the airline, usually fastened to the front lower left of the corselet.&lt;ref name="USN training" /&gt; Flow rate would also be affected by the surface delivery system and depth. Manual pumps would be operated at the speed necessary for sufficient air supply, which could be judged by delivery pressure and feedback from the diver. Many manual pumps had delivery pressure gauges calibrated in units of water depth - feet or metres of water column - which would provide the supervisor with a reasonable indication of diver depth. If the diver needed more air, the operators would have to crank faster.

==Lever==
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1862) b 797 1.jpg|thumb|Two-cylinder lever pump]]
'''Lever pumps''' have one or two cylinders, which are operated by rocking a beam with handles attached to its ends which is pivoted at the centre for a two cylinder pump, and at the end for a single cylinder pump.{{sfn|Pardoe|2016|pp=176, 181–185 }} Vertical lever pumps with bell-crank operation were also made, usually for shallow water work. The piston rods are connected to the beam near the pivot.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=stillson/&gt; Upward movement of the pistons pulls the air into the cylinders through the inlet valves, and then downward movement pumps the air through the hose to the helmet of the diver in a single action pump. Cylinders, valves and outlet for air are usually made from brass for reliability.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;

Practical [[capacitors]] and [[inductors]] as used in [[electric circuit]]s are not ideal components with only [[capacitance]] or [[inductance]]. However, they can be treated, to a very good degree of approximation, as being ideal capacitors and inductors in [[Series circuits|series]] with a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]; this resistance is defined as the '''equivalent series resistance''' ('''ESR'''). If not otherwise specified, the ESR is always an [[AC resistance]]{{vague|date=October 2017}} measured at specified frequencies, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for switched-mode power supply components, 120&amp;nbsp;Hz for linear power-supply components, and at the self-resonant frequency for general-application components.  Audio components may report "[[Q factor]]", incorporating ESR among other things, at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Overview==
Electrical [[circuit theory]] deals with ideal [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s, each assumed to contribute only resistance, capacitance or inductance to the [[electrical circuit|circuit]]. However, all components have a non-zero value of each of these parameters. In particular, all physical devices are constructed of materials with finite [[electrical resistance]], so that physical components have some resistance in addition to their other properties. The physical origins of ESR depend on the device in question.
One way to deal with these inherent resistances in circuit analysis is to use a [[lumped element model]] to express each physical component as a combination of an ideal component and a small [[resistor]] in series, the ESR. The ESR can be measured and included in a component's [[datasheet]]. To some extent it can be calculated from the device properties.

[[Q factor]], which is related to ESR and is sometimes a more convenient parameter than ESR to use in calculations of high-frequency non-ideal performance of real inductors, is quoted in inductor data sheets.

Capacitors, inductors, and resistors are usually designed to minimise other parameters. In many cases this can be done to a sufficient extent that ''parasitic'' capacitance and inductance of a resistor, for example, are so small as not to affect circuit operation. However, under some circumstances parasitics become important and even dominant.

==Component models==
Pure capacitors and inductors do not dissipate energy; any component which dissipates energy must be treated in a equivalent circuit model incorporating one or more resistors.  Actual passive two-terminal components can be represented by some network of lumped and distributed ideal inductors, capacitors, and resistors, in the sense that the real component behaves as the network does. Some of the components of the equivalent circuit can vary with conditions, e.g., frequency and temperature.

If driven by a periodic sinewave ([[alternating current]]) the component will be characterised by its [[Complex variable|complex]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''Z''(ω) = ''R'' + ''j'' ''X''(ω); the impedance can involve several minor resistances, inductances and capacitances in addition to the main property. These small deviations from the ideal behavior of the device can become significant under certain conditions, typically high frequency, where the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of small capacitances and inductances can become a significant element of circuit operation. Models of lesser or greater complexity can be used, depending upon the accuracy required. For many purposes a simple model with an inductance or capacitance in series with an ESR is good enough.

These models, however simple or complex, can be inserted into a circuit to calculate performance. [[Computer]] tools are available for complex circuits; e.g., the [[SPICE]] program and its variants.

===Inductors===
An inductor consists of a conducting insulated wire coil usually wound around a ferromagnetic core.  Inductors have resistance inherent in the metal conductor, quoted as DCR in [[datasheet]]s. This metallic resistance is small for small inductance values (typically below 1 [[ohm|Ω]]). The DC wire resistance is an important parameter in transformer and general inductor design because it contributes to the impedance of the component, and current flowing through that resistance is dissipated as [[waste heat]] and lost from the circuit. It can be modeled as a resistor in series with the inductor, often leading to the DC resistance being referred to as the ESR. Though this is not precisely correct usage, the unimportant elements of ESR are often neglected in circuit discussion, since it is rare that all elements of ESR are significant to a particular application.

An inductor using a core to increase inductance will have losses such as [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]] in the core. At high frequencies there are also losses in the windings due to [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity]] and [[skin effect]]s. These are in addition to wire resistance, and lead to a higher ESR.

===Capacitors===
In a non-electrolytic capacitor and electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte the metallic resistance of the leads and electrodes and losses in the dielectric cause the ESR. Typically quoted values of ESR for ceramic capacitors are between 0.01 and 0.1 ohms. ESR of non-electrolytic capacitors tends to be fairly stable over time; for most purposes real non-electrolytic capacitors can be treated as ideal components.

Aluminium and [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum]] [[electrolytic capacitor]]s with non solid electrolyte have much higher ESR values, up to several ohms; electrolytics of higher capacitance have lower ESR.  ESR decreases with frequency up to the capacitor's self-resonant frequency. A very serious problem, particularly with aluminium electrolytics, is that ESR increases over time with use; ESR can increase enough to cause circuit malfunction and even component damage,&lt;ref&gt;There is a very long discussion at [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10308&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=pol098&amp;start=0] on component damage due to capacitor ESR increase. Essentially the switch-mode PSU of a particular PVR has a multisection transformer, each section being rectified and filtered for one of the voltages required. The PSU feedback is derived from the 5V supply; the drive adjusts to stabilise the 5&amp;nbsp;V line. A problem that arises in practice is that the first electrolytic filter capacitor on the 5&amp;nbsp;V line goes high-ESR. This reduces the voltage; feedback causes the drive to increase to maintain 5&amp;nbsp;V. As the capacitor ages the effect worsens. If the other capacitors are OK, all voltages except 5V increase, until eventually even the 5&amp;nbsp;V line cannot be maintained. Low voltages cause malfunction but usually not harm; but the excessive voltages on the other lines in this instance is enough to do quite a lot of damage to surface-mount semiconductors and disc drives. This is not a particularly exceptional case. This suggests that aluminium electrolytic capacitors shouldn't be used where they affect PSU feedback.&lt;/ref&gt; although measured capacitance may remain within [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. While this happens with normal aging, high [[temperature]]s and large [[ripple current]] exacerbate the problem. In a circuit with significant ripple current, an increase in ESR will increase heat dissipation, thus accelerating aging.

Electrolytic capacitors rated for high-temperature operation and of higher quality than basic consumer-grade parts are less susceptible to become prematurely unusable due to ESR increase. A cheap electrolytic capacitor may be rated for a life of less than 1000 hours at 85°C. (A year is 8760 hours.) Higher-grade parts are typically rated at a few thousand hours at maximum rated temperature, as can be seen from manufacturers' datasheets.  If ESR is critical, specification of a part with higher temperature rating, "low ESR" or larger capacitance than is otherwise required may be advantageous.  There is no standard for "low ESR" capacitor rating.

[[Polymer capacitor]]s usually have lower ESR than wet-electrolytic of same value, and stable under varying temperature. Therefore, polymer capacitors can handle higher ripple current. From about 2007 it became common for better-quality computer motherboards to use only polymer capacitors where wet electrolytics had been used previously.&lt;ref name=caplab&gt;[http://www.capacitorlab.com/capacitor-types-polymer/ Capacitor Lab - Types of Capacitors - Polymer Capacitors].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESR of capacitors larger than about 1&amp;nbsp;μF is easily measured in-circuit with an [[ESR meter]].

'''European windstorms''' are the strongest [[extratropical cyclone]]s which occur across the continent of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Martinez-Alvarado"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martínez-Alvarado|first=Oscar |author2=Suzanne L Gray |author3=Jennifer L Catto |author4=Peter A Clark|title=Sting jets in intense winter North-Atlantic windstorms|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=10 May 2012|volume=7|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/7/2/024014|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/2/024014/pdf/1748-9326_7_2_024014.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2012|issue=2|pages=024014|bibcode = 2012ERL.....7b4014M }}&lt;/ref&gt; They form as [[cyclone|cyclonic]] [[windstorm]]s associated with areas of low [[atmospheric pressure]]. They are most common in the autumn and winter months. On average, the month when most windstorms form is January. The seasonal average is 4.6 windstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal predictability of European wind storms|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/newsevents/meetings/forecast_products_user/Presentations2008/Renggli.pdf|work=Institute of Meteorology|publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]]|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the North Atlantic, sometimes starting as [[nor'easter]]s off the [[New England]] coast, and frequently track across the North Atlantic Ocean towards western Europe, past the north coast of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] and into the [[Norwegian Sea]]. However, when they track further south, they can affect almost any country in Europe. Commonly affected countries include the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]], but any country in [[Central Europe]], [[Northern Europe]] and especially [[Western Europe]] is occasionally struck by such a storm system.

The strong wind phenomena intrinsic to European windstorms, that give rise to "damage footprints" at the surface, can be placed into three categories, namely the "warm jet", the "cold jet", and the "sting jet". These phenomena vary in terms of physical mechanisms, atmospheric structure, spatial extent, duration, severity level, predictability, and location relative to cyclone and fronts.&lt;ref name="HewsonNeu"/&gt;

On average, these storms cause economic damage of around €1.9&amp;nbsp;billion per year, and insurance losses of €1.4&amp;nbsp;billion per year (1990–1998). They rank as the second highest cause of global natural catastrophe insurance loss (after U.S. [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s).&lt;ref name="FU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bios.edu/rpi/public/pubs/pre2000/euwindsum/eurowindsum.html#fig8a |title=European Windstorms and the North Atlantic Oscillation: Impacts, Characteristics, and Predictability |publisher=RPI Series No. 2, Risk Prediction Initiative/Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Hamilton, Bermuda |accessdate=2011-11-25 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815005255/http://www.bios.edu/rpi/public/pubs/pre2000/euwindsum/eurowindsum.html |archivedate=15 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature==

===Naming of individual storms===
Up to the second half of the 19th century, European windstorms were named after the person who spotted them.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Usually, they would be named either by the year, the date, the Saint's day of their occurrence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, What, Why: How are hurricanes named?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14796272|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any other way that made them commonly known.

However, a storm may still be named differently in different countries. For instance, the Norwegian weather service also names independently notable storms that affect [[Norway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url         = http://met.no/met/met_lex/a_f/ekstremvar/ekstremuvar_1005.html

 |archivedate = 3 January 2008
 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can result in multiple names being used in different countries they affect, such as:

* 1999 storm "'''[[Cyclone Anatol|Anatol]]'''" in Germany, is known as the "'''December hurricane'''" or "'''Adam'''" in Denmark and as "'''Carola'''" in Sweden.
* 2011 storm "'''[[Cyclone Dagmar|Dagmar]]'''" in Norway and Sweden is known as "'''Patrick'''" in Germany and "'''Tapani'''" in Finland.
* 2013 '''[[St. Jude storm]]''' in the English media, is known as '''Christian''' in German and French (following the Free University of Berlin's Adopt-a-Vortex program) it was named '''Simone''' by the [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]], and as the '''October storm''' in Danish and Dutch, it was later given the name '''Allan''' by the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] following the political decision to name strong storms which affect Denmark.

An alternative Scottish naming system arose in 2011 via social media/Twitter which resulted in the humorous naming of [[Hurricane Bawbag]]&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2011/12/09/how-internet-sensation-hurricane-bawbag-helped-scotland-conquer-the-world-86908-23621364/ |title=How internet sensation Hurricane Bawbag helped Scotland conquer the world |publisher=The Daily Record |date=2011-12-09 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|author=STEPHEN MCGINTY|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/would_bawbag_s_proud_progenitor_please_stand_up_and_take_a_bow_1_2001332 |title=Would Bawbag’s proud progenitor please stand up and take a bow - Cartoon |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=2011-12-09 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2011/12/10/scots-slang-highlighted-after-country-is-battered-by-hurricane-bawbag-86908-23624975/ | title=Scots slang highlighted after country is battered by Hurricane Bawbag | publisher=Daily Record | date=10 December 2011 | accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hurricane Fannybaws. Such usage of the term Hurricane is not without precedent, as the [[1968 Scotland storm]] was referred to as "Hurricane Low Q".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1968/feb/07/scotland-storm-damage | date = 7 February 1968 |title=Scotland (Storm Damage) | speaker= Mr. Edward Heath |position=MP Bexley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storm Oratia 30 Oct 2000.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite picture of [[Cyclone Oratia]] on 30 October 2000]]
During 1954, Karla Wege, a student at the Free University of Berlin's meteorological institute suggested that names should be assigned to all areas of low and high pressure that influenced the weather of Central Europe.&lt;ref name="EWS History"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Naming Weather Systems |publisher=The Free University of Berlin's Institute of Meteorology |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archivedate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Rtm0egLN?url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/adopt-a-vortex/historie/ |url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/adopt-a-vortex/historie/ |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university subsequently started to name every area of high or low pressure within its weather forecasts, from a list of 260 male and 260 female names submitted by its students.&lt;ref name="EWS History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gutman, Roy|title=Germany bans naming storms 'mean Irene' after howls of protest|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|page=F10}}{{subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female names were assigned to areas of low pressure while male names were assigned to areas of high pressure.&lt;ref name="EWS History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"/&gt; The names were subsequently exclusively used by Berlin's media until February 1990, after which the German media started to commonly use the names, however, they were not officially approved by the German Meteorological Service [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]].&lt;ref name="EWS History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEWS History"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geschichte der Namensvergabe |trans-title=History of Naming Weather Systems |publisher=The Free University of Berlin's Institute of Meteorology |archivedate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ru4gtDXp?url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/wetterpate/historie/ |accessdate=17 August 2014 |url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/wetterpate/historie/ |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DWD subsequently banned the usage of the names by their offices during July 1991, after complaints had poured in about the naming system.&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"/&gt; However, the order was leaked to the German press agency, [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]], who ran it as its lead weather story.&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"/&gt; Germany's ZDF television channel subsequently ran a phone in poll on 17 July 1991 and claimed that 72% of the 40,000 responses favored keeping the names.&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"/&gt; This made the DWD pause and think about the naming system and these days the DWD accept the naming system and request that it is maintained.&lt;ref name="Germany Bans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GEWS History"/&gt;

During 1998 a debate started about if it was discrimination to name areas of high pressure with male names and the areas of low pressure with female names.&lt;ref name="EWS History"/&gt; The issue was subsequently resolved by alternating male and female names each year.&lt;ref name="EWS History"/&gt; In November 2002 the "Adopt-a-Vortex" scheme began, which allows members of the public or companies to buy naming rights for a letter chosen by the buyer that are then assigned alphabetically to high and low pressure areas in Europe during each year.&lt;ref name="Cooper" &gt;{{cite web|title=European Cold Front 'Cooper' Sponsored by Mini|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,812461,00.html|publisher=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming comes with the slim chance that the system will be notable. The money raised by this is used by the meteorology department to maintain weather observations at the Free University.&lt;ref name=FU/&gt;

===Name of phenomena===
Several European languages use [[cognate]]s of the word ''huracán'' (''ouragan'', ''uragano'', ''orkan'', ''huragan'', ''orkaan'', ''ураган'', which may or may not be differentiated from tropical hurricanes in these languages) to indicate particularly strong cyclonic winds occurring in Europe. The term hurricane as applied to these storms is not in reference to the structurally different [[tropical cyclone]] of the same name, but to the ''hurricane strength'' of the wind on the [[Beaufort scale]] (winds ≥ 118&amp;nbsp;km/h or ≥ 73&amp;nbsp;mph).

In English, use of term ''hurricane'' to refer to European windstorms is mostly discouraged, as these storms do not display the structure of tropical storms. Likewise the use of the French term ''ouragan'' is similarly discouraged as ''hurricane'' is in English, as it is typically reserved for tropical storms only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pas d'ouragan possible en France, mais des tempêtes comparables à Sandy|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1032984-pas-ouragan-possible-france-tempetes-comparables-sandy|accessdate=6 January 2013 |newspaper=20minutes.fr|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'OUEST BALAYÉ PAR UN OURAGAN DÉVASTATEUR|url=http://www.alertes-meteo.com/tempete/tempete_1987.htm|publisher=alertes-meteo.com|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; European windstorms in [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]] are generally referred to by derivatives of ''tempestas'' (''tempest'', ''tempête'', ''tempestado'', ''tempesta''), meaning storm, weather, or season, from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tempus'', meaning time.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally storms of this type forming between 30° and 60° latitude are known as ''extratropical cyclones''. The name ''European windstorm'' reflects that these storms in Europe are primarily notable for their strong winds and associated damage, which can span several nations on the continent. The strongest cyclones are called ''windstorms'' within academia and the insurance industry.&lt;ref name="Martinez-Alvarado"/&gt; The name ''European windstorm'' has not been adopted by the UK Met Office in broadcasts (though it is used in their academic research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=XWS: a new historical catalogue of extreme european windstorms |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/r/r/12_0462_Windstorm_historical_catalogue_datasheet1.pdf |publisher=Met Office|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the media or by the general public, and appears to have gained currency in academic and insurance circles as a linguistic and terminologically neutral name for the phenomena.

In contrast to some other European nations there is a lack of a widely accepted name for these storms in English. The Met Office and UK media generally refer to these storms as ''severe gales''.&lt;ref name="HPA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Chris|author2=Brian Lee|title=Guidance on Windstorms for the Public Health Workforce|journal=Chemical Hazards and Poisons Report|year=2008|issue=13|pages=49–52|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1222068844046|accessdate=6 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523173820/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1222068844046|archivedate=23 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current definition of severe gales (which warrants the issue of a weather warning) are repeated gusts of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} or more over inland areas.&lt;ref name="HPA" /&gt; European windstorms are also described in forecasts variously as ''winter storms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extratropical Cyclones (Winter Storms)|url=http://www.air-worldwide.com/winterstorm.aspx|publisher=AIR worldwide|accessdate=6 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201135640/http://www.air-worldwide.com/winterstorm.aspx|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''winter lows'', ''autumnal lows'', ''Atlantic lows'' and ''cyclonic systems''.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} They are also sometimes referred to as ''bullseye isobars'' and ''dartboard lows'' in reference to their appearance on weather charts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A [[Royal Society]] exhibition has used the name ''European cyclones'',&lt;ref name="Royal Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Damaging winds from European cyclones|url=http://royalsociety.org/Damaging-winds-from-European-cyclones/|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''North-Atlantic cyclone'' and ''North-Atlantic windstorms'' also being used.&lt;ref name="Martinez-Alvarado"/&gt; Though with the advent of the "Name our Storms" project, they are generally known as storms.

===Clustering===
Temporal clustering of windstorm events has also been noted, with 8 consecutive storms hitting Europe during the winter of 1989/90. [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Lothar and Martin]] in 1999 were separated only by 36 hours.

Insurance losses from windstorms are the second greatest source of loss for any natural peril after [[Atlantic hurricane]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe Windstorm|url=https://support.rms.com/Publications/EU_WS_60.pdf|publisher=RMS|accessdate=21 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302235140/https://support.rms.com/Publications/EU_WS_60.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Windstorm losses exceed those caused by flooding in Europe.

===Energy supplies===
European windstorms wipe out [[Electricity generation|electrical generation]] capacity across large areas, making supplementation from abroad difficult (windturbines shut down to avoid damage and nuclear capacity may shut if cooling water is contaminated or flooding of the power plant occurs). [[Electric power transmission|Transmission]] capabilities can also be severely limited if power lines are brought down by snow, ice or high winds. In the wake of [[Cyclone Gudrun]] in 2005 Denmark and Latvia had difficulty importing electricity,&lt;ref name="astra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of winter storm Gudrun of 7th –9th January 2005 and measures taken in Baltic Sea Region|url=http://www.astra-project.org/sites/download/ASTRA_WSS_report_final.pdf|publisher=astra project|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden lost 25% of its total power capacity as the [[Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Barsebäck nuclear power plant]] nuclear plants were shut down.&lt;ref name="Eurelectric"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Severe Storms on Electric Grids |url=http://www.globalregulatorynetwork.org/Resources/ImpactsofSevereStorms.pdf |publisher=Union of the Electricity Industry – EURELECTRIC |accessdate=5 January 2013 |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054333/http://www.globalregulatorynetwork.org/Resources/ImpactsofSevereStorms.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Boxing Day Storm]] of 1998 the reactors at [[Hunterston B nuclear power station]] were shut down when power was lost, possibly due to [[Electric arc|arcing]] at pylons caused by salt spray from the sea.&lt;ref name=nuc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safetyinengineering.com/FileUploads/Nuclear%20power%20station%20loss%20of%20grid%20in%20storm_1312282624_2.pdf |title=Nuclear power station loss of electricity grid during severe storm (1998) |publisher=safetyinengineering.com |accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the grid connection was restored, the generators that had powered the station during the blackout were shut down and left on "manual start", so when the power failed again the station was powered by batteries for a short time of around 30 minutes, until the diesel generators were started manually.&lt;ref name=nuc/&gt; During this period the reactors were left without forced cooling, in a similar fashion to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], but the event at Hunterston was rated as [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] 2.&lt;ref name=nuc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/244765.stm |work=BBC News |title=UK Nuclear alert at Scottish plant |date=30 December 1998 |accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later in 1999 during the [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Lothar storm]] [[1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood|Flooding at the Blayais Nuclear Power Plant]] resulted in a "level 2" event on the International Nuclear Event Scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asn.fr/index.php/S-informer/Actualites/1999/COMMUNIQUE-N-7-INCIDENT-SUR-LE-SITE-DU-BLAYAIS COMMUNIQUE N°7 – INCIDENT SUR LE SITE DU BLAYAIS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527021840/http://www.asn.fr/index.php/S-informer/Actualites/1999/COMMUNIQUE-N-7-INCIDENT-SUR-LE-SITE-DU-BLAYAIS |date=27 May 2013 }} ASN, published 30 December 1999&lt;!--date on press release wrong--&gt;, Retrieved 22 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin]] in 1999 left 3.4 million customers in France without electricity, and forced [[EdF]] to acquire all the available portable power generators in Europe, with some even being brought in from Canada.&lt;ref name="Eurelectric" /&gt; These storms brought a fourth of France's high-tension transmission lines down and 300 high-voltage transmission pylons were toppled. It was one of the greatest energy disruptions ever experienced by a modern developed country.&lt;ref name="Tatge" &gt;{{cite web|last=Tatge|first=Yörn|title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Anatol, Lothar and Martin Ten Years Later|url=http://www.air-worldwide.com/Publications/AIR-Currents/Looking-Back,-Looking-Forward--Anatol,-Lothar-and-Martin-Ten-Years-Later/|publisher=Air-Worldwide|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Great Storm of 1987]] the [[HVDC Cross-Channel|High Voltage Cross-Channel Link]] between the UK and France was interrupted, and the storm caused a domino-effect of [[power outage]]s throughout the Southeast of England.&lt;ref name="BurtMansfield" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=S.

[[Cyclone Xynthia]] hit Europe in 2010, generating 19000 [[megawatts]] of electricity from Germany's 21000 wind turbines. The electricity produced was too much for consumers to use, and prices on the [[European Energy Exchange]] in [[Leipzig]] plummeted, which resulted in the grid operators having to pay over 18 euros per megawatt-hour to offload it, costing around half a million euros in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Grid: Solving the Energy Puzzle|url=http://www.t-systems.co.uk/umn/uti/141254_1/blobBinary/22_Smart-Grid-ps.pdf?ts_layoutId=432564|publisher=T-Systems customer magazine, Best Practice|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disruption of the gas supply during [[Cyclone Dagmar]] in 2011 left [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s [[Ormen Lange (gas field)|Ormen Lange]] gas processing plant in Norway inoperable after its electricity was cut off by the storm. This left gas supplies in the United Kingdom vulnerable as this facility can supply up to 20 percent of the United Kingdom's needs via the [[Langeled pipeline]].

=== Historic windstorms ===
[[File:Erschrecklichewasserfluth.jpg|thumb|Contemporary picture of the flood that struck the [[North Sea]] coast of Germany and Denmark in October 1634.]]
*[[Grote Mandrenke]], 1362 – A southwesterly Atlantic gale swept across England, the Netherlands, northern Germany and southern Denmark, killing over 25,000 and changing the Dutch-German-Danish coastline.
*[[Burchardi flood|Burchardi Flood]], 1634 – Also known as "second Grote Mandrenke", hit [[Nordfriesland]], drowned about 8,000–15,000 people and destroyed the island of [[Strand (island)|Strand]].
*[[Great Storm of 1703]] – Severe gales affect south coast of England.
*[[Night of the Big Wind]], 1839 – The most severe windstorm to hit Ireland in recent centuries, with hurricane-force winds, killed between 250 and 300&amp;nbsp;people and rendered hundreds of thousands of homes uninhabitable.
*[[Royal Charter Storm]], 25–26 October 1859 – The Royal Charter Storm was considered to be the most severe storm to hit the British Isles in the 19th century, with a total death toll estimated at over 800. It takes its name from the Royal Charter ship, which was driven by the storm onto the east coast of Anglesey, Wales with the loss of over 450 lives.
*[[Tay Bridge disaster|The Tay Bridge Disaster]], 1879 – Severe gales (estimated to be Force 10–11) swept the east coast of Scotland, infamously resulting in the collapse of the Tay Rail Bridge and the loss of 75&amp;nbsp;people who were on board the ill-fated train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taybridgedisaster.co.uk/|title=The Tay Bridge Disaster|accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1928 Thames flood]], 6–7 January 1928 – Snow melt combined with heavy rainfall and a storm surge in the North Sea led to flooding in central London and the loss of 14 lives.

===Severe storms since 1950===
*[[North Sea flood of 1953]] – Considered to be the worst natural disaster of the 20th century both in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, claiming over 2,500 lives, including 133 lost when the car ferry [[MV Princess Victoria|MV ''Princess Victoria'']] sank in the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] east of [[Belfast]]. 
*[[North Sea flood of 1962]] – The Storm reached the German coast of the North Sea with wind speeds up to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. The accompanying [[storm surge]] combined with the high [[tide]] pushed water up the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]], breaching dikes and caused extensive flooding, especially in [[Hamburg]]. 315&amp;nbsp;people were killed, around 60,000 were left homeless.
*[[Gale of January 1976]] January 2–5, 1976 – Widespread wind damage was reported across Europe from Ireland to Central Europe. Coastal flooding occurred in the United Kingdom, Belgium and Germany with the highest storm surge of the 20th century recorded on the German North Sea coast.
*[[Great Storm of 1987]] – This storm affected southeastern England and northern France. In England maximum mean wind speeds of 70&amp;nbsp;knots (an average over 10&amp;nbsp;minutes) were recorded. The highest gust of {{convert|117|kn|km/h}} was recorded at [[Pointe du Raz]] in Brittany. In all, 19&amp;nbsp;people were killed in England and 4 in France. 15&amp;nbsp;million trees were uprooted in England. 
*1990 storm series – Between 25 January and 1 March 1990, eight severe storms crossed Europe including the [[Burns' Day storm]] (Daria), [[Vivian (storm)|Vivian]] &amp; Wiebke.

The '''February 1995 Northeast United States snowstorm''' was a significant [[nor'easter]] that impacted the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]] around the beginning of the month.&lt;ref name="snowfall"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rank: 10 &amp;#124; 5 February 1995 &amp;#124; Score: 134.15|date=|publisher=Lyndon State College|accessdate=January 6, 2010|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/projects/snowstorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only major nor'easter of the 1994–1995 winter.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synoptic history==
The initial [[low pressure area]] tracked eastward from the southern [[Great Plains]] on February 2. Gradually intensifying, it was situated over eastern [[Kentucky]] by 0000 UTC on February 4. As the system entered [[West Virginia]], a secondary low began to develop over [[South Carolina]]. The new low quickly deepened, and absorbed the primary low over West Virginia into its expanding and strengthening circulation. It continued to rapidly mature as it moved northward from eastern [[Maryland]],&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; and it hugged the coast as it moved northeastward towards southern [[New England]].&lt;ref name="graphic"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=February 04–6 Observed Liquid Precipitation|date=|publisher=Lyndon State College|accessdate=January 6, 2010|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/projects/snowstorm/Images/LowTracks/19950204_tname_LIQUID.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cyclone reached a strength of 980 [[millibars]] while located south of [[Long Island]]. It crossed eastern New England and reached its peak intensity, with a minimum barometric pressure of 962 mb, over eastern [[Maine]]. Prior to the nor'easter, an [[high pressure area|area of high pressure]] drifted southeastward from north of the [[Great Lakes]], producing sufficient cold air to support snow throughout the Northeast. However, as the storm intensified, precipitation near the coast, including the major cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], changed to rain. Due to the lack of a strong [[anticyclone]] at the surface, winds in association with the system were minimal until after the storm abated.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; Behind the nor'easter, high winds, sufficient to bring down trees and powerlines, occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for New York: High Winds|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 5, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~219105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Snow from the nor'easter was heavy and widespread. Areas that picked up {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} or more include [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Scattered reports of {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} were received in upstate New York and northern Vermont.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; At [[Burlington, Vermont]], {{convert|16.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} of snow fell, beating the daily record of {{convert|8.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} set in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Vermont: Heavy Snow|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 5, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~244067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the event ranks as a category 2 on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]].&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt;

In Pennsylvania, the heaviest snow fell in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]]. Throughout the state, the number of traffic accidents was minimized due to the storm's arrival on a weekend. Three died of cardiac arrest after shoveling snow, and more than 100 people were hospitalized for chest pain. Several dozen more were injured after slipping and falling on ice, and 53 residents sustained snowblower-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Pennsylvania: Heavy Snow|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 5, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~230899}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 18 people were injured in nearby New Jersey, where the maximum snow accumulation was reported to be {{convert|16|in|cm}} in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for New Jersey: Heavy Snow|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 5, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~217292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the coast, minor to moderate coastal flooding occurred, along with some [[beach erosion]].

[[File:Fern Canyon pano 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Panorama of Fern Canyon]]
'''Fern Canyon''' is a [[canyon]] in the [[Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park]] in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]], [[California]], western United States. The park is managed in cooperation with other nearby redwoods state parks and [[Redwood National Park]]. It is named for the ferns growing on the 50-foot high walls, through which runs Home Creek. Fern Canyon is recognized as a [[World Heritage site]] and an [[International Biosphere Reserve]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Place Names of Humboldt County|last = Turner|first = Dennis W. &amp; Gloria H.|publisher = Dennis W. &amp; Gloria H. Turner|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0-9629617-2-4|location = Orangeville, CA|pages = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Fern Canyon was donated {{citation needed span|text=by the Pacific Lumber Company |reason=most PALCO land was south of this area, California Barrel Company or later Arcata Redwood Company seem more likely |date=June 2017}} to the State to add 2,125 acres to Prairie Creek State Park.

==Ferns==
Fern Canyon has [[California native plants|California native]] [[fern]]s covering the {{convert|10|-|15|m|ft}}  sheer walls, giving a primeval habitat quality.
Some species include:
*''[[Adiantum jordanii]]''
*''[[Blechnum spicant]]''
*''[[Polypodium californicum]]''
*''[[Polypodium glycyrrhiza]]''
*''[[Polystichum munitum]]''

==Access==
A [[hiking trail]] follows the canyon and creek. The start of Fern Canyon Trail is reached at the bottom of the canyon by hiking a quarter mile north up California Coastal Trail from Fern Canyon Day Use Area, which is north of [[Gold Bluffs Beach]] Campground. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fern Canyon Trail in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park|url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/fern-canyon-hike-prairie-creek-redwoods-state-park/|website=hikespeak.com|publisher=hikespeak|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trail loop is 0.5 miles, one end of the trail connecting to the James Irvine Trail.

==Filming location==
The prehistoric ambience led to the canyon being used as a [[filming location]] for ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', BBC's ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' and IMAX's [[Dinosaurs Alive!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Filming Locations for The Lost World: Jurassic Park | publisher = The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations| url = http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/l/lostworld.html| accessdate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">A '''flux loop''' is a loop of wire placed inside a plasma at a right angle.  Changes in the field create a current in the loop, which may be interpreted to measure the properties of the plasma.  Flux loops are key [[diagnostic]]s in [[fusion power]] research.

== Theory ==
[[File:The Mechanics of a Magnetic flux loop.png|thumbnail|A very basic flux loop]]

A flux loop is a loop of wire. The magnetic field passes through the wire loop. As the field varied inside the loop, it generated a voltage, driving a current. This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured.  The voltage induced is determined by:&lt;ref name ="Hutchin"&gt;"Principals of Plasma Diagnostics" Second edition, I H Hutchinson, page 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{voltage(Time) }= \text{Number of Loops}* \text{Area} * \frac{d\ \text{Magnetic Field(time)}}{d\ \text{time}} &lt;/math&gt;

Typically, you need to integrate the signal over a period of time to get the magnetic field at that instant (not just the change in magnetic fields).  This is normally done by adding a [[integrator circuit]] which will passively integrate the electrical signal.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{voltage} =\frac{\text{Number of Loops}*\text {Area} *\text{Magnetic Field}}{\text{resistance}*\text{capacitance}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:A Magnetic Flux Loop.png|thumbnail|Flux Loop with Circuit Integrator]]

== Common Uses ==
The flux loop is common on [[tokamak]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"NCSX Vacuum Vessel External Flux Loops Design and Installation, PPPL, Twenty-Second Symposium on Fusion Engineering, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[magnetic mirror]]s, [[Field-reversed configuration]]s, the [[Levitated dipole]] experiment and the [[polywell]].&lt;ref name ="Hutchin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jaeyoung; Krall, Nicholas A.; Sieck, Paul E.; Oﬀermann, Dustin T.; Skillicorn, Michael; Sanchez, Andrew; Davis, Kevin; Alderson, Eric; Lapenta, Giovanni (1 June 2014). "High Energy Electron Confinement in a Magnetic Cusp Configuration". arXiv:1406.0133v1 [physics.plasm-ph].&lt;/ref&gt; In tokamaks a set of loops is used, and these are spaced slightly off-center and non-concentrically.  Placing the loops intentionally asymmetrically allows the users to find the magnetic field density at different points inside the tokamak.  The distance between the loops was determined by shafranov, and is sometime called the "shafranov distance".&lt;ref&gt;shafranov, v,d 1963, plasma physics 5:251&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Energy Network Institute''' ('''GENI''') is a research and education organization founded by [[Peter Meisen]] in 1986 and registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1991. GENI's focus is on the interconnection of [[electric power transmission]] networks between nations and continents, emphasizing tapping abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, and utilizing the efficiencies of seasonal, time of day, and load differences around the world.

== Renewable Energy Interconnected Global Grid ==

GENI's goal is to educate world leaders and policy makers on the benefits of this global strategy. The concept of an interconnected global grid linked to renewable resources was first suggested by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in the [[World Game]] simulation in the 1970s.  Fuller concluded that this strategy is the highest priority of the World Game simulation, (see page 206 of Fuller's book ''Critical Path'' (1981, {{ISBN|0-312-17491-8}}).

GENI has organized international workshops on international electricity transmission grids and coordinated workshops on [[renewable energy generation]], the latter hosted by the [[IEEE]] Power Engineering Society.

GENI is one of the original members of [[American Council on Renewable Energy]] and has been a regular presence at the [[World Energy Congress]], held internationally every 3 years.

GENI has stated that one reason technologies to accelerate the use of renewable energy and to avert [[climate change]] were not making headway in the marketplace has been the lack of ways for investors to track and easily invest in these technologies. Because of this, in 2004, GENI partnered with [[KLD Research &amp; Analytics|KLD]], who creates socially conscious investing stock indexes in the US, to create the KLD Global Climate 100 stock index. The index became available for investment in Japan in 2005 and in the U.S. on April 24, 2007.

{{cquote|By connecting regional electricity grids around the world into a global network, it will be possible to tap new renewable resources and phase out our worst polluting coal-fired power plants|||[http://sunbrightenergy.blogspot.com/ Michael Powers, Spokesman]}}

== Research ==

GENI's research includes information about national electricity [[power grids]]; location and availability of [[renewable energy]] resources; international integrated energy models; current national energy usage (by fuel type) and global issues that are addressed by the GENI concept, such as  [[international relations]], [[human security]], [[peace]] and [[disarmament]], the [[natural environment|environment]], [[Armed conflict|conflict]] and [[Development studies|development]], and [[global health]].

'''Helge Lund''' (born 16 October 1962) is a Norwegian businessman, a director of [[Schlumberger]] since June 2016, and the former [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[BG Group]], [[Statoil]] and [[Aker Kværner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Helge_Lund Helge Lund] in [[Store norske leksikon]] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On 26 April 2018, it was announced  by [[BP]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/media/press-releases/helge-lund-to-suceed-carl-henric-svanberg-as-chairman.html&lt;/ref&gt; that he would join the board on the 1 September 2018 and succeed [[Carl-Henric Svanberg]] as chairman with effect from 1 January 2019.

==Early life==
Lund graduated in business management at the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] in [[Bergen]]. He also has a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) from the [[INSEAD]] business school in France. 

==Career==
He started his career as a management consultant for [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] and as political adviser for the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] in the Norwegian parliament [[Storting]]et, before starting work for [[Hafslund Nycomed]] in 1993. In 1997-8 he was vice president in [[Nycomed Pharma]] before starting work in [[Aker RGI]] in 1999 as vice president before becoming CEO for Aker Kværner in 2002. After [[Olav Fjell]] withdrew as CEO of [[Statoil]] in 2004, Lund took over and was retained after Statoil merged with the oil &amp; gas division of [[Norsk Hydro]] in 2007 to create [[StatoilHydro]].

On 15 October 2014, Lund resigned as CEO for [[Statoil]] with immediate effect,&lt;ref name=dn_lund&gt;{{cite web|title=Lund blir toppsjef i britiske BG|trans-title=Lund to join top management team of British BG|url=http://www.dn.no/nyheter/2014/10/15/0801/lund-blir-toppsjef-i-britiske-bg|website=dn.no|publisher=[[Dagenss Næringsliv]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to join the management team of the UK's [[BG Group]] as CEO from 9 February 2015.&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite web|title=Helge Lund starts as BG Group Chief Executive|url=http://bg-group.com/~/tiles/?tiletype=pressrelease&amp;id=767#opentile|website=bg-group.com|publisher=[[BG Group]]|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 December 2014, in response to pressure from shareholders, BG Group reduced a £12 million share award [[golden hello]] for Lund to between £4.7 million to £10.6 million, depending on the company's future performance. His basic salary will be £1.5 million, but with bonuses, total compensation could reach £14 million per annum.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Selina|title=BG Group Reduces Helge Lund’s CEO Pay Package|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bg-group-reduces-helge-lund-pay-package-1417418109|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=WSJ|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rankin|first1=Jennifer|title=BG Group cuts Helge Lund’s ‘golden hello’ after shareholder pressure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/01/bg-group-cuts-helge-lund-golden-hello|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the takeover of [[BG Group]] by [[Royal Dutch Shell]], Lund was out of a job, but did receive a total of £5.5 million for his 11 months work, and £9.7 million in shares in February 2016, as a result of the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jill Treanor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/10/bg-chief-helge-lund-shell-pay-deal |title=BG chief paid £5.5m for nine-month stint at firm &amp;#124; Business |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Lund was appointed to the board of directors of [[Schlumberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Selina |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/schlumberger-appoints-former-bg-statoil-boss-helge-lund-to-board-1465476600 |title=Schlumberger Appoints Former BG, Statoil Boss to Board |website=WSJ.com |date=2016-06-09 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.epmag.com/schlumberger-says-helge-lund-joins-director-not-ceo-906121 |title=Schlumberger Says Helge Lund Joins As Director, Not CEO &amp;#124; Exploration &amp; Production |website=Epmag.com |date=2016-06-10 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard's Rock''' is a large piece of white flint that is displayed in [[Clemson University|Clemson University's]] [[Memorial Stadium, Clemson|Memorial Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, Tim [http://collegefootball.about.com/od/traditions/a/Tradition-Clem.htm "Howard's Rock at Clemson University"] About Sports&lt;/ref&gt; The rock is the center of a longstanding tradition where players touch it before running down the hill in the east end zone at each home football game.

==History==

The rock was brought to football coach [[Frank Howard (American football coach)|Frank Howard]] in the early 1960s as a gift from Samuel C. Jones. Jones found the rock while driving through [[Death Valley]], California and gave it to Howard as a reference to "Death Valley," the name Howard used to refer to Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Dinich, Heather [http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9380123/howard-rock-damaged-clemson-university "Howard's Rock Damaged by Vandals"] ESPN College Football&lt;/ref&gt; The coach used the rock as a doorstop until 1966. He was cleaning out his office when he told Gene Willimon, a Clemson booster, "Take this rock and throw it over the fence or out in the ditch...Do something with it, but get it out of my office." It was Willimon who had the rock placed on a pedestal in the east end zone, where it remains today.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Blackman; Bob Bradley; Chuck Kriese (15 August 2017). Clemson: Where the Tigers Play. Sports Publishing. pp. 898–. {{ISBN|978-1-68358-040-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock made its first appearance on September 24, 1966: Clemson was losing to Virginia by 18 points with seventeen minutes left in the game. The Tigers made up the deficit and won the game 40-35. The next season was when the tradition of rubbing the rock upon entering the stadium began. Howard reportedly said to his players, "If you're going to give me 110 percent, you can rub that rock. If you're not, keep your filthy hands off of it."&lt;ref&gt;Schlabach, Mark [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?id=3017840 "Gift from Death Valley became "Death Valley" tradition"] ESPN College Football&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers have continued this tradition since 1967, except for two-and-a-half seasons between 1970 and 1972. This was due to new head coach Hootie Ingram's changing the team's entrance to the west end zone after Frank Howard's retirement. During those seasons, Clemson held a bad record at home of 6-9. Before the South Carolina rivalry game in 1972, the team voted to enter via the east end zone and run down the hill. They later won the game 7-6.

==Vandalism==

On June 2, 2013 Howard's Rock was vandalized. The case the Rock was held in was broken into and a large portion of the rock was broken off. 
Three men have been arrested in this ongoing investigation; ESPN reported that “the charges being pressed on him are felony malicious injury to animals or personal property valued at more than $2,000 but less than $10,000 and misdemeanor trespassing." &lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9433459/clemson-arrests-charges-man-connection-howard-rock-vandalism&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were subsequently upgraded. The damage to the rock was re-evaluated to more than 10,000 dollars. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/27904220/court-howards-rock-vandal-faces-more-charges&lt;/ref&gt;  Clemson University police later stated that the surveillance video from the outside of Memorial Stadium shows that three people got out of the truck used in the act.  Two more people have been arrested and released on a bond of 7,500 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wspa.com/story/22577174/clemsons-howards-rock-vandalized&lt;/ref&gt;

Micah Rogers was accused vandalizing and stealing a portion of Howard's Rock in Memorial Stadium. A jury found Rogers guilty of malicious damage, but they found him not guilty of grand larceny. The judge gave Rogers the maximum sentence of 30 days in jail or a $1,000 fine for the malicious damage charge; however, the sentence was suspended, meaning Rogers does not have to serve the jail time, so long as he pays a $750 fine and completes 25 days of supervised community service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyff4.com/news/suspect-in-howards-rock-vandalism-headed-to-court/34243000&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other men later pleaded guilty to attempting to cover up the vandalism of Howard's Rock that took place in June 2013. Michael J. Rogers, 49, and Alden J. Gainey, 20, pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of giving false Information to police for their involvement in attempting to cover up vandalism of Howard’s Rock at Clemson University. Micah Rogers, Michael Rogers' son, was previously convicted of malicious injury to property in the case. Michael Rogers had a meeting June 20, 2013 at his home in North Carolina with Micah Rogers, Gainey, and Xavia Wynn to discuss video surveillance of Micah’s truck and the three boys in the vicinity of Howard's Rock the night the vandalism occurred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/09/19/2-plead-guilty-cover-up-howards-rock-vandalism/90699454/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Humphry Davy, 1st Baronet''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PRS|MRIA|FGS|FRS}} (17 December 1778{{spaced ndash}}29 May 1829) was a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] [[chemist]] and inventor,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; who is best remembered today for isolating, using electricity, a series of [[Chemical element|elements]] for the first time: [[potassium]] and [[sodium]] in 1807 and [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[magnesium]] and [[boron]] the following year, as well as discovering the elemental nature of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. He also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of [[electrochemistry]]. In 1799 Davy experimented with [[nitrous oxide]] and became astonished that it made him laugh, so he nicknamed it "laughing gas", and wrote about its potential [[Anesthesia|anaesthetic]] properties in relieving pain during surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardman|first1=Jonathan G.|title=Oxford Textbook of Anaesthesia|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy was a [[baronet]], [[Presidents of the Royal Society|President of the Royal Society (PRS)]], [[Royal Irish Academy|Member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA)]], and [[Geological Society of London|Fellow of the Geological Society (FGS)]]. He also invented the [[Davy lamp]] and a very early form of [[incandescent light bulb]].

He joked that his assistant [[Michael Faraday]] was his greatest discovery.

==Education, apprenticeship and poetry==
Davy was born in [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] on 17 December 1778. Davy's brother, John Davy, writes that the society of their hometown was characterised by "an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous ... Amongst the middle and higher classes, there was little taste for literature, and still less for science ... Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in".&lt;ref name="Davy 1836"&gt;{{cite book |last = Davy |first= John |authorlink = John Davy (chemist) |title = Memoirs of the Life of Sir Humphry Davy |volume = Vol. 1 of 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EOQ5AAAAcAAJ |location = London, UK|publisher = Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, &amp; Longman |year = 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of six, Davy was sent to the grammar school at Penzance. Three years later, his family moved to Varfell, near [[Ludgvan]], and subsequently, in term-time Davy boarded with John Tonkin, his godfather and later his guardian.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; On leaving Penzance grammar school in 1793, Tonkin paid for Davy to attend [[Truro Grammar School]] in 1793 to finish his education under the Rev Dr Cardew, who, in a letter to [[Davies Gilbert]], said dryly: "I could not discern the faculties by which he was afterwards so much distinguished." Yet, Davy entertained his school friends with writing poetry, Valentines, and telling stories from [[One Thousand and One Nights]]. Reflecting on his school days, in a letter to his mother, Davy wrote: "Learning naturally is a true pleasure; how unfortunate then it is that in most schools it is made a pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Knight |first= David |authorlink = David M. Knight |title = Humphry Davy: Science and Power |location = Cambridge, UK|publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1992 |isbn = 0-631-16816-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davy said: "I consider it fortunate I was left much to myself as a child, and put upon no particular plan of study ... What I am I made myself."&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Hunt |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Hunt (scientist) |wstitle=Davy, Humphry |year=1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davy's brother praises his "native vigour": "there belonged, however, to his mind, it cannot be doubted, the genuine quality of genius, or of that power of intellect which exalts its possessor above the crowd."&lt;ref name="Davy 1836"/&gt;

After Davy's father died in 1794, Tonkin apprenticed him to John Bingham Borlase, a surgeon with a practice in Penzance. Davy's [[indenture]] is dated 10 February 1795. In the [[apothecary]]'s dispensary, Davy became a chemist, and conducted his earliest chemical experiments in a garret in Tonkin's house. Davy's friends said: "This boy Humphry is incorrigible. He will blow us all into the air." His elder sister complained of the ravages made on her dresses by corrosive substances.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; Davy was taught French by a refugee priest, and in 1797 read Lavoisier's ''Traité élémentaire de chimie'': much of his future work can be seen as reacting against Lavoisier's work and the dominance of French chemists.

As a poet, over one hundred and sixty manuscript poems were written by Davy, the majority of which are found in his personal notebooks. Most of his written poems were not published, and he chose instead to share a few of them with his friends. Eight of his known poems were published. His poems reflected his views on both his career and also his pereception of certain aspects of human life. He wrote on human endeavours and aspects of life like death, metaphysics, geology, natural theology and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[John Ayrton Paris]] remarked that poetry written by the young Davy "bear the stamp of lofty genius". Davy's first preserved poem entitled ''The Sons of Genius'' is dated 1795 and marked by the usual immaturity of youth. Other poems written in the following years, especially ''On the Mount's Bay'' and ''St Michael's Mount'', are descriptive verses, showing sensibility but no true poetic imagination. Three of Davy's paintings from around 1796 have been donated to the [[Penlee House]] museum at Penzance. One is of the view from above [[Gulval]] showing the church, [[Mount's Bay]] and [[St Michael's Mount|the Mount]], while the other two depict [[Loch Lomond]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anon|title=Davy paintings donated to museum|newspaper=[[The Cornishman]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davy's picture of Mounts Bay was included in the Penlee House exhibition "Penzance 400: A Celebration of the History of Penzance" 29 March – 7 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing verses at the age of 17 in honour of his first love, he was eagerly discussing the question of the materiality of heat with his [[Quaker]] friend and mentor [[Robert Dunkin]]. Dunkin remarked: 'I tell thee what, Humphry, thou art the most quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my life.' One winter day he took Davy to the Larigan River,&lt;ref&gt;The Larigan, or Laregan, river is a stream in Penzance.&lt;/ref&gt; To show him that rubbing two plates of ice together developed sufficient energy by motion, to melt them, and that after the motion was suspended, the pieces were united by regelation. It was a crude form of analogous experiment exhibited by Davy in the lecture-room of the [[Royal Institution]] that elicited considerable attention.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; As professor at the Royal Institution, Davy repeated many of the ingenious experiments he learned from his friend and mentor, Robert Dunkin.

Even though he initially started writing his poems albeit haphazardly, as a reflection of his views on his career, and on life generally, most of his final poems concentrated more on immortality and death. This was after he started experiencing failing health and a decline both in health and career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early scientific interests==
[[Davies Gilbert|Davies Giddy]] met Davy in [[Penzance]] carelessly swinging on the half-gate of Dr Borlase's house, and interested by his talk invited him to his house at Tredrea and offered him the use of his library. This led to an introduction to Dr Edwards, who lived at Hayle Copper House. Edwards was a lecturer in chemistry in the school of [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. He permitted Davy to use his laboratory and possibly directed his attention to the floodgates of the port of [[Hayle]], which were rapidly decaying as a result of the contact between copper and iron under the influence of [[seawater]]. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was not understood at that time, but the phenomenon prepared Davy's mind for subsequent experiments on ship's [[copper sheathing]]. Gregory Watt, son of [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]], visited Penzance for his health's sake, and while lodging at the Davy's house became a friend and gave him instructions in chemistry. Davy was acquainted with the [[Wedgwood]] family, who spent a winter at Penzance.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

[[Thomas Beddoes]] and [[John Hailstone]] were engaged in a geological controversy on the rival merits of the [[Plutonism|Plutonian]] and [[Neptunist]] hypotheses. They travelled together to examine the Cornish coast accompanied by Davies Gilbert and made Davy's acquaintance. Beddoes, who had established at [[Bristol]] a 'Pneumatic Institution,' needed an assistant to superintend the laboratory. Gilbert recommended Davy, and in 1798 Gregory Watt showed Beddoes the ''Young man's Researches on Heat and Light'', which were subsequently published by him in the first volume of ''West-Country Contributions''. After prolonged negotiations, mainly by Gilbert, Mrs Davy and Borlase consented to Davy's departure, but Tonkin wished him to remain in his native town as a surgeon, and altered his will when he found that Davy insisted on going to Dr Beddoes.

In 1802, Humphry Davy had what was then, the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution. With it, Davy created the first [[incandescent light]] by passing electric current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but demonstrated the principle. By 1806 he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the [[Royal Society]] in London. It was an early form of [[Arc lamp|arc light]] which produced its illumination from an electric arc created between two charcoal rods.

==Pneumatic Institution==
[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Watt]] in 1792 by [[Carl Frederik von Breda]]]]
On 2 October 1798, Davy joined the [[Pneumatic Institution]] at Bristol. It had been established to investigate the medical powers of factitious airs and gases (gases produced experimentally or artificially), and Davy was to superintend the various experiments. The arrangement agreed between Dr Beddoes and Davy was generous, and enabled Davy to give up all claims on his paternal property in favour of his mother. He did not intend to abandon the medical profession and was determined to study and graduate at Edinburgh, but he soon began to fill parts of the institution with voltaic batteries. While living in Bristol, Davy met the [[Earl of Durham]], who was a resident in the institution for his health, and became close friends with Gregory Watt, [[James Watt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]], all of whom became regular users of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), to which Davy became addicted. The gas was first synthesized in 1772 by the [[natural philosopher]] and chemist [[Joseph Priestley]], who called it ''phlogisticated nitrous air'' (see [[phlogiston]]).&lt;ref name="Nitrous Oxide pioneers" &gt;{{cite web

James Watt built a portable gas chamber to facilitate Davy's experiments with the inhalation of nitrous oxide. At one point the gas  was combined with wine to judge its efficacy as a cure for [[hangover]] (his laboratory notebook indicated success). The gas was popular among Davy's friends and acquaintances, and he noted that it might be useful for performing surgical operations.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1800 ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical'' (p.556), Davy commented: "''As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anesthetic]]s were not regularly used in medicine or dentistry until decades after Davy's death.&lt;ref name="AOW" &gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes |first=Richard|title=The Age of Wonder|publisher=Pantheon Books  |year=2008  |isbn=978-0-375-42222-5  |ref=Holmes, 2008, AOW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy threw himself energetically into the work of the laboratory and formed a long romantic friendship with Mrs Anna Beddoes, the novelist [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria Edgeworth's]] sister, who acted as his guide on walks and other fine sights of the locality. The critic Maurice Hindle was the first to reveal that Davy and Anna had written poems for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindle|first1=Maurice|title=Nature, Power, and the Light of Suns: The Poetry of Humphry Davy|url=http://mauricehindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nature-Power-the-Light-of-Suns-essay.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahida Amin has transcribed and discussed a number of poems written between 1803 and 1808 to "Anna" and one to her infant child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amin|first1=Wahida|title=THE POETRY AND SCIENCE OF HUMPHRY DAVY|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/30795/1/Wahida_Amin_-_The_Poetry_and_Science_of_Humphry_Davy_-_23.01.14.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1799 Davy visited London for the first time and extended his circle of friends. Davy features in the diary of William Godwin, with their first meeting recorded for 4 December 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godwin|first1=William|title=William Godwin's Diary|url=http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/people/DAV03.html|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the gas experiments Davy ran considerable risks. His respiration of [[nitric oxide]] which may have combined with air in the mouth to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name="Jay2014" /&gt; severely injured the mucous membrane, and in Davy's attempt to inhale four quarts of "pure hydrocarbonate" gas in an experiment with [[carbon monoxide]] he "seemed sinking into annihilation." On being removed into the open air, Davy faintly articulated, "I do not think I shall die,"&lt;ref name="Jay2014" /&gt; but some hours elapsed before the painful symptoms ceased.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Davy was able to take his own pulse as he staggered out of the laboratory and into the garden, and he described it in his notes as "threadlike and beating with excessive quickness".

In this year the first volume of the ''West-Country Collections'' was issued. Half consisted of Davy's essays ''On Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light'', ''On Phos-oxygen and its Combinations'', and on the ''Theory of Respiration''. On 22 February 1799 Davy, wrote to Davies Gilbert, "I am now as much convinced of the non-existence of [[Caloric theory|caloric]] as I am of the existence of light." In another letter to Gilbert, on 10 April, Davy informs him: "I made a discovery yesterday which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments. The gaseous oxide of azote (the laughing gas) is perfectly respirable when pure. It is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous gas. I have found a mode of making it pure." He said that he breathed sixteen quarts of it for nearly seven minutes, and that it "absolutely intoxicated me."&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; 
Davy became increasingly well known in 1799 due to his experiments with the physiological action of some gases, including laughing gas (nitrous oxide). In addition to himself, his enthusiastic experimental subjects included his poet friends [[Robert Southey]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref name="Jay2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=Mike |title="O, Excellent Air Bag": Humphry Davy and Nitrous Oxide |journal= [[The Public Domain Review]]|date=8 August 2014 |volume=4 |issue=16 |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/08/06/o-excellent-air-bag-humphry-davy-and-nitrous-oxide/ |publisher=[[Open Knowledge Foundation]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=High Times|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=36–39|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/high-times|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1799, Beddoes and Davy published ''Contributions to physical and medical knowledge, principally from the west of England'' and ''Essays on heat, light, and the combinations of light, with a new theory of respiration. On the generation of oxygen gas, and the causes of the colors of organic beings.'' Their experimental work was poor, and the publications were harshly criticized.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"/&gt; In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated "the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth."&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

These criticisms, however, led Davy to refine and improve his experimental techniques,&lt;ref name="Kenyon"/&gt; spending his later time at the institution increasingly in experimentation.
In 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been "repeating the galvanic experiments with success" in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which "almost incessantly occupied him from January to April." In 1800, Davy published his ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration'', and received a more positive response.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"/&gt;

[[William Wordsworth]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved to the [[Lake District]] in 1800, and asked Davy to deal with the Bristol publishers of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], Biggs &amp; Cottle. Coleridge asked Davy to proofread the second edition of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], the first to contain [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads|Preface]] in a letter dated 16 July 1800: "Will you be so kind as just to look over the sheets of the lyrical Ballads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|editor1-last=Griggs|editor1-first=E.

==Royal Institution==
In 1799, [[Count Rumford]] had proposed the establishment in London of an 'Institution for Diffusing Knowledge', i.e. the [[Royal Institution]]. The house in [[Albemarle Street]] was bought in April 1799.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=285}} Rumford became secretary to the institution, and Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] was the first lecturer.

Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] is the lecturer, holding the victim's nose.]]
In February 1801 Davy was interviewed by the committee of the Royal Institution, comprising [[Joseph Banks]], [[Benjamin Thompson]] (who had been appointed Count Rumford) and [[Henry Cavendish]]. Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism. He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases. The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution,&lt;ref name="AOW"/&gt; it having been resolved 'that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l. per annum.'&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

On 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of 'Galvanism'. He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davy's lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery. "It [science] has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments."&lt;ref name="AOW"/&gt; The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people. "There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause. Amen!"&lt;ref name="AOW"/&gt;
Davy revelled in his public status.

Davy's lectures included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations along with scientific information, and were presented with considerable showmanship by the young and handsome man.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Left Behind|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=40–43|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/left-behind|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Davy also included both poetic and religious commentary in his lectures, emphasizing that God's design was revealed by chemical investigations.   Religious commentary was in part an attempt to appeal to women in his audiences. Davy, like many of his enlightenment contemporaries, supported female education and women's involvement in scientific pursuits, even proposing that women be admitted to evening events at the Royal Society.
Davy acquired a large female following around London. In a satirical cartoon by Gillray, nearly half of the attendees pictured are female. His support of women caused Davy to be subjected to considerable gossip and innuendo, and to be criticized as unmanly.&lt;ref name="Golinski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golinski|first1=Jan|title=The Experimental Self: Humphry Davy and the Making of a Man of Science|date=2016|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226351360|pages=70–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Davy's lecture series on Galvanism ended, he progressed to a new series on [[Agricultural Chemistry]], and his popularity continued to skyrocket. By June 1802, after just over a year at the Institution and at the age of&amp;nbsp;23, Davy was nominated to full lecturer at the [[Royal Institution]] of Great Britain. Garnett quietly resigned, citing health reasons.&lt;ref name="AOW"/&gt;

In November 1804 Davy became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], over which he would later preside. He was one of the founding members of the [[Geological Society]] in 1807&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/society/history History of the Geological Society], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1810 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of new elements===
[[File:Sodium.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Sodium]] metal, about 10 g, under oil]]
[[File:VoltaBattery.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[voltaic pile]]]]
[[File:Magnesium crystals.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Magnesium]] metal crystals]]

Davy was a pioneer in the field of [[electrolysis]] using the [[voltaic pile]] to split common compounds and thus prepare many new elements. He went on to electrolyse molten salts and discovered several new metals, including [[sodium]] and [[potassium]], highly reactive elements known as the [[alkali metal]]s. Davy discovered potassium in 1807, deriving it from [[caustic potash]] (KOH). Before the 19th century, no distinction had been made between potassium and sodium. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Davy isolated sodium in the same year by passing an electric current through molten [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

===Discovery of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium===
During the first half of 1808, Davy conducted a series of further electrolysis experiments on alkaline earths including lime, magnesia, strontites and barytes. At the beginning of June, Davy received a letter from the Swedish chemist [[Berzelius]] claiming that he, in conjunction with Dr. Pontin, had successfully obtained amalgams of calcium and barium by electrolysing lime and barytes using a mercury cathode. Davy managed to successfully repeat these experiments almost immediately and expanded Berzelius' method to strontites and magnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electrochemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations in the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|pages=339–340|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that while these amalgams oxidated in only a few minutes when exposed to air they could be preserved for lengthy periods of time when submerged in [[naphtha]] before becoming covered with a white crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electro-Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations on the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|page=340|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 30 June 1808 Davy reported to the Royal Society that he had successfully isolated four new metals which he named [[barium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]] and magnium (later changed to [[magnesium]]) which were subsequently published in the ''Philosophical Transactions''. Although Davy conceded magnium was an "undoubtedly objectionable" name he argued the more appropriate name magnesium was already being applied to metallic manganese and wished to avoid creating an equivocal term.&lt;ref name="Electro-chemical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electro-chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations in the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|page=346|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The observations gathered from these experiments also led to Davy isolating [[boron]] in 1809.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=T. K.|title=Science and Celebrity: Humphry Davy's Rising Star |journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine |date=2008|volume=26 |issue=4|pages=30–35|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/science-and-celebrity-humphry-davys-rising-star|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of chlorine===
[[Chlorine]] was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], who called it ''"dephlogisticated marine acid"'' (see [[phlogiston theory]]) and mistakenly thought it contained [[oxygen]]. Davy showed that the acid of Scheele's substance, called at the time [[Chlorine#History|oxymuriatic acid]], contained no [[oxygen]]. This discovery overturned [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] definition of acids as compounds of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; In 1810, chlorine was given its current name by Humphry Davy, who insisted that chlorine was in fact an [[Chemical element|element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davy |first= Humphry |title = On Some of the Combinations of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene, and on the Chemical Relations of These Principles, to Inflammable Bodies |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 101|pages = 1–35|year = 1811|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1811.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name chlorine, chosen by Davy for "one of [the substance's] obvious and characteristic properties - its colour", comes from the Greek χλωρος (chlōros), meaning green-yellow.

===Laboratory accident===
Davy seriously injured himself in a laboratory accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]].&lt;ref name="Trans. RS, Davy, 1813" &gt;{{cite journal

In a letter to [[John George Children|John Children]], on 16 November 1812, Davy wrote: "It must be used with great caution. It is not safe to experiment upon a globule larger than a pin's head. I have been severely wounded by a piece scarcely bigger. My sight, however, I am informed, will not be injured".&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"&gt;* {{cite book

===European travels===

In 1812, Davy was knighted and gave up his lecturing position at the Royal Institution. He was given the title of Honorary Professor of Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt; He gave a farewell lecture to the Institution, and married a wealthy widow, [[Jane Davy|Jane Apreece]]. (While Davy was generally acknowledged as being faithful to his wife, their relationship was stormy, and in later years he travelled to continental Europe alone.)

Davy then published his ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy, part 1, volume 1'', though other parts of this title were never completed. He made notes for a second edition, but it was never required.&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt; 
In October 1813, he and his wife, accompanied by [[Michael Faraday]] as his scientific assistant (also treated as a valet), travelled to France to collect the second edition of the ''[[Volta Prize|prix du Galvanisme]],'' a medal that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] had awarded Davy for his electro-chemical work. Faraday noted that 'Tis indeed a strange venture at this time, to trust ourselves in a foreign and hostile country, where so little regard is had to protestations of honour, that the slightest suspicion would be sufficient to separate us for ever from England, and perhaps from life'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=H.B.|title=The life and letters of Faraday, Vol. 1|date=1870|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davy's party sailed from Plymouth to Morlaix by [[cartel (ship)|cartel]], where they were searched.&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt;

Upon reaching Paris, Davy was a guest of honour at a meeting of the First Class of the [[Institut de France]] and met with [[André-Marie Ampère]] and other French chemists.&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt;

While in Paris, Davy attended lectures at the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including those by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] on a mysterious substance isolated by [[Bernard Courtois]]. Davy wrote a paper for the Royal Society on the element, which is now called [[iodine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davy |first=H. |title=Sur la nouvelle substance découverte par M.

Davy's party did not meet Napoleon in person, but they did visit the Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] at the [[Château de Malmaison]].&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt; The party left Paris in December 1813, travelling south to Italy.&lt;ref name="Williams, 1965" &gt;For information on the continental tour of Davy and Faraday, see {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of experiments conducted with Faraday's assistance, Davy succeeded in using the sun's rays to ignite [[diamond]], proving it is composed of pure [[carbon]].

Davy's party continued to Rome, where he undertook experiments on iodine and chlorine and on the colours used in ancient paintings. This was the first chemical research on the pigments used by artists.&lt;ref name="Knight 1992"/&gt;

He also visited [[Naples]] and [[Mount Vesuvius]], where he collected samples of crystals. By June 1814, they were in [[Milan]], where they met [[Alessandro Volta]], and then continued north to [[Geneva]]. They returned to Italy via [[Munich]] and [[Innsbruck]], and when their plans to travel to Greece and [[Istanbul]] were abandoned after Napoleon's escape from [[Elba]], they returned to England.

After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Davy wrote to [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] urging that the French be treated with severity:

{{quote|My Lord, I need not say to Your Lordship that the capitulation of Paris not a treaty;  lest everything belonging to the future state of that capital &amp; of France is open to discussion &amp; that France is a conquered country.  It is the duty of the allies to give her more restricted boundaries which shall not encroach upon the natural limits of other nations.  to weaken her on the side of Italy, Germany &amp; Flanders.  To take back from her by contributions the wealth she has acquired by them to suffer her to retain nothing that the republican or imperial armies have stolen:  This last duty is demanded no less by policy than justice.|Sir Humphry Davy

===Davy lamp===

{{main|Davy lamp}}
{{further|Arc lamp}}
After his return to England in 1815, Davy began experimenting with lamps that could be used safely in coal mines. The Revd Dr Robert Gray of [[Bishopwearmouth]] in Sunderland, founder of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coalmines, had written to Davy suggesting that he might use his 'extensive stores of chemical knowledge' to address the issue of mining explosions caused by [[firedamp]], or [[methane]] mixed with oxygen, which was often ignited by the open flames of the lamps then used by miners. Incidents such as the [[Felling mine disaster]] of 1812 near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], in which 92 men were killed, not only caused great loss of life among miners but also meant that their widows and children had to be supported by the public purse. The Revd Gray and a fellow clergyman also working in a north-east mining area, the Revd John Hodgson of [[Jarrow]], were keen that action should be taken to improve underground lighting and especially the lamps used by miners.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, David (1992). Humphry Davy: Science and Power. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 105-6. {{ISBN|0-631-16816-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere. Although the idea of the [[safety lamp]] had already been demonstrated by [[William Reid Clanny]] and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer [[George Stephenson]], Davy's use of [[wire gauze]] to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. George Stephenson's lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=364–373}} Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits. Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from firedamp explosions rose yet further.

There was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of [[Smithson Tennant]], but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent. Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to his being awarded the [[Rumford medal]] in 1816.&lt;ref name="ODNB" &gt;[[David M. Knight|David Knight]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7314 "Davy, Sir Humphry, baronet (1778–1829)"] in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acid-base studies===
In 1815 Davy suggested that [[acid]]s were substances that contained replaceable [[hydrogen]]&amp;nbsp;ions;– hydrogen that could be partly or totally replaced by [[metals|reactive metals]] which are placed above hydrogen in the reactivity series. When acids reacted with metals they formed [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and hydrogen gas. [[Base (chemistry)|Base]]s were substances that reacted with acids to form salts and water. These definitions worked well for most of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;HSC, ''Conquering Chemistry'' Fourth Edition p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herculaneum papyri==
{{main|Herculaneum papyri}}

Humphry Davy experimented on fragments of the Herculaneum papyri before his departure to Naples in 1818. His early experiments showed hope of success. In his report to the Royal Society Davy writes that: 
'When a fragment of a brown MS. in which the layers were strongly adhered, was placed in an atmosphere of chlorine, there was an immediate action, the papyrus smoked and became yellow, and the letters appeared much more distinct; and by the application of heat the layers separated from each other, giving fumes of muriatic acid.'&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davy, 1821|Davy, 1821]], page 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Some Observations and Experiments on the Papyri Found in the Ruins of Herculaneum|journal=Philosophical Transactions|date=January 1821|volume=111|pages=191–208|jstor=107613|bibcode=1821RSPT..111..191D|doi=10.1098/rstl.1821.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the early trials prompted Davy to travel to Naples to conduct further research on the Herculaneum papyri. Accompanied by his wife, they set off on 26 May 1818 to stay in Flanders where Davy was invited to by the coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davy|first1=John|title=Memoirs of the life of sir Humphry Davy|date=1836|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman|location=London|page=97|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then traveled to Carniola (now Slovenia) which proved to become 'his favourite Alpine retreat' before finally arriving in Italy. In Italy, they befriended Lord Byron in Rome and then went on to travel to Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Humphry Davy: Science &amp; Power|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial experiments were again promising and his work resulted in 'partially unrolling 23 MSS., from which fragments of writing were obtained' &lt;ref name="Davy page 203"&gt;[[#Davy, 1821|Davy, 1821]], page 203&lt;/ref&gt; but after returning to Naples on 1 December 1819 from a summer in the Alps, Davy complained that 'the Italians at the museum [were] no longer helpful but obstructive'.&lt;ref&gt;page 119 of Knight 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Davy decided to renounce further work on the papyri because 'the labour, in itself difficult and unpleasant, been made more so, by the conduct of the persons at the head of this department in the Museum'.&lt;ref name="Davy page 203"/&gt;

==Electrochemical protection of ships' copper bottoms==
From 1761 onwards, copper plating had been fitted to the undersides of [[Royal Navy]] ships, to protect the wood from attack by [[shipworms]].&lt;ref name="Physis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Frank A. J. L.|title=Davy in the Dockyard: Humphry Davy, the Royal Society and the Electro-chemical Protection of the Copper Sheeting of His Majesty's Ships in the mid 1820s|journal=Physis|date=1992|volume=29|pages=205–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the copper bottoms were gradually corroded by exposure to the salt water. Between 1820 and 1825, Davy, assisted by [[Michael Faraday]], attempted to protect the copper by [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] means. He attached sacrificial pieces of [[zinc]] or [[iron]] to the copper, which provided [[cathodic protection]] to the host metal.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Humphry Davy: Science and Power|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered, however, that protected copper became foul quickly, i.e. pieces of weed and/or marine creatures became attached to the hull, which had a detrimental effect on the handling of the ship. The [[Navy Board]] approached Davy in 1822, asking for help. Davy conducted a number of tests in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], which led to the Navy Board adopting the use of Davy's "protectors". By 1824, it had become apparent that fouling of the copper bottoms was still occurring on the majority of protected ships. By the end of 1825, the [[Admiralty]] ordered the Navy Board to cease fitting the protectors to sea-going ships, and to remove those that had already been fitted. Davy's scheme was seen as a public failure, despite the fact that, as Frank A. J. L. James comments, "The somewhat ironical problem ... was not that they were unsuccessful. They did after all preserve the copper as Davy said they would. The problem was that the protectors, on most ships, had a chemical side effect which provided nutrients for weeds, barnacles etc. thus fouling the ships".&lt;ref name="Physis" /&gt;

==President of the Royal Society==
Elections took place on St Andrew's Day and Davy was elected on 30 November 1820. Although he was unopposed, other candidates had received initial backing. These candidates embodied the factional difficulties that beset Davy's presidency and which eventually defeated him.

The Society was in transition from a club for gentlemen interested in natural philosophy, connected with the political and social elite, to an academy representing increasingly specialised sciences. The previous president, [[Joseph Banks]], had held the post for over 40 years and had presided autocratically over what [[David Philip Miller]] calls the "Banksian Learned Empire", in which natural history was prominent.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Philip Miller,]] "Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 1-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks had groomed the engineer, author and politician [[Davies Gilbert]] to succeed him and preserve the status quo, but Gilbert declined to stand. Fellows who thought royal patronage was important proposed Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (later [[Leopold I of Belgium]]), who also withdrew, as did the Whig [[Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset]]. Davy was the outstanding scientist but some fellows did not approve of his popularising work at the Royal Institution.

The strongest alternative had been [[William Hyde Wollaston]], who was supported by the "Cambridge Network" of outstanding mathematicians such as [[Charles Babbage]] and [[John Herschel]], who tried to block Davy. They were aware that Davy supported some modernisation, but thought that he would not sufficiently encourage aspiring young mathematicians, astronomers and geologists, who were beginning to form specialist societies. Davy was only 41, and reformers were fearful of another long presidency.

In his early years Davy was optimistic about reconciling the reformers and the Banksians. In his first speech as president he declared, "I trust that, with these new societies, we shall always preserve the most amicable relations ... I am sure there is no desire in [the Royal Society] to exert anything like patriarchal authority in relation to these institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in David Philip Miller, "Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy spent much time juggling the factions but, as his reputation declined in the light of failures such as his research into copper-bottomed ships, he lost popularity and authority. This was compounded by a number of political errors. In 1825 his promotion of the new Zoological Society, of which he was a founding fellow, courted the landed gentry and alienated expert zoologists. He offended the mathematicians and reformers by failing to ensure that Babbage received one of the new Royal Medals (a project of his) or the vacant secretaryship of the Society in 1826. In November 1826 the mathematician Edward Ryan recorded that: "The Society, every member almost ... are in the greatest rage at the President's proceedings and nothing is now talked of but removing him."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in David Philip Miller, "Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event he was again re-elected unopposed, but he was now visibly unwell. In January 1827 he set off to Italy for reasons of his health. It did not improve and, as the 1827 election loomed, it was clear that he would not stand again. He was succeeded by [[Davies Gilbert]].

==Last years and death==
[[Image:M Faraday Th Phillips oil 1842.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]], portrait by [[Thomas Phillips]] c. 1841–1842&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?mkey=mw02170 National Portrait gallery NPG 269]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In January 1819, Davy was awarded a [[baronet]]cy. Although [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (also later made a peer&lt;ref&gt;As Baron Verulam and later Viscount St Alban.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] had already been [[knight]]ed, this was, at the time, the first such honour ever conferred on a man of science in Britain. This was followed a year later with the Presidency of the [[Royal Society]].

Davy's laboratory assistant, [[Michael Faraday]], went on to enhance Davy's work and would become the more famous and influential scientist. Davy is supposed to have even claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery. Davy later accused Faraday of [[plagiarism]], however, causing Faraday (the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]]) to cease all research in [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] until his mentor's death.

Of a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament, Davy displayed characteristic enthusiasm and energy in all his pursuits. As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he "had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age", and Southey said that "he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art." In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him "to increase his stock of metaphors." The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame; occasional petty jealousy did not diminish his concern for the "cause of humanity", to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners' lamp. Careless about etiquette, his frankness sometimes exposed him to annoyances  he might have avoided by the exercise of tact.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Davy, Sir Humphry|volume=7|pages=871-873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one of Davy's biographers, [[June Z. Fullmer]], he was a [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullmer |first=June Z. |title=Young Humphry Davy: The Making of an Experimental Chemist, Volume 237|year=2000|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=9780871692375|authorlink = June Zimmerman Fullmer|page=158|quote=In prominent alliance with his concept, Davy celebrated a natural-philosophic deism, for which his critics did not attack him, nor, indeed, did they bother to mention it. Davy never appeared perturbed by critical attacks on his "materialism" because he was well aware that his deism and his materialism went hand in hand; moreover, deism appeared to be the abiding faith of all around him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:davygrave.jpg|thumb|right|Davy's grave at [[Cimetière des Rois|Cimetière Plainpalais]] in Geneva]]
He spent the last months of his life writing ''Consolations in Travel'', an immensely popular, somewhat freeform compendium of poetry, thoughts on science and philosophy. Published posthumously, the work became a staple of both scientific and family libraries for several decades afterward. Davy spent the winter in Rome, hunting in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]] on his fiftieth birthday. But on 20 February 1829 he had another stroke. After spending many months attempting to recuperate, Davy died in a hotel room in Geneva, Switzerland, on 29 May 1829.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

He had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial delayed in case he was only [[coma]]tose. He refused to allow a post-mortem for similar reasons. But the laws of Geneva did not allow any delay and he was given a public funeral on the following Monday, in the [[Cimetière des Rois|Plainpalais Cemetery]], outside the city walls.

===Scientific and literary recognition===
*in 1827, the mineral [[davyne]] was named in his honour by W.

*Annually since 1877, the [[Royal Society of London]] has awarded the [[Davy Medal]] "for an outstandingly important recent discovery in any branch of chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/davy-medal/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Davy (crater)|Davy]] [[lunar crater]] is named after him. It has a diameter of 34&amp;nbsp;km and its coordinates are 11.8S, 8.1W.&lt;ref&gt;wenamethestars.inkleby.com/feature/1429&lt;/ref&gt;
*Davy's passion for [[fly-fishing]] earned him the informal title "the father of modern fly-fishing" and his book ''[https://books.google.com/?id=Qy8CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 Salmonia]'' is often considered to be "the fly-fisherman bible".

==In popular culture==
*Davy is the subject of a humorous song by [[Richard Gendall]], recorded in 1980 by folk-singer [[Brenda Wootton]] in the album ''Boy Jan Cornishman'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brendawootton.eu/storepage1776509.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the seven verses of which each recall a day of the week on which Davy purportedly made a particular discovery.&lt;ref&gt;https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=119413&lt;/ref&gt;
*English playwright [[Nick Darke]] wrote ''Laughing Gas'' (2005) a comedy script about the life of Sir Humphry Davy, unfinished at the time of Nick Darke's death; completed posthumously by actor and playwright Carl Grose and produced by the Truro-based production company O-region.
*[[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]'s first [[clerihew]], published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
:Sir Humphry Davy
:Abominated gravy.
:He lived in the odium
:Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Sir Humphrey Davy's kindly face, 
:Is turned away from Market Place
:Towards [[St Michael's Mount]]
:So, if he do want to tell the time
:He've got to wait till the clock do chime 
:Then he's forced to count.&lt;ref&gt;''https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=119413&lt;/ref&gt;

 Inertial wave pulse caused patterns of fluid flow inside a steadily-rotating spherical chamber.  Arrows on this cross section show the direction and strength of flow in the equatorial plane as the sphere continues to rotate clockwise on its axis which shown at left . Red indicates flow out of the plane; blue indicates flow into the plane.]]

'''Inertial waves''', also known as '''inertial oscillations''', are a type of [[mechanical wave]] possible in rotating [[fluids]]. Unlike [[wind waves|surface gravity waves]] commonly seen at the beach or in the bathtub, inertial waves flow through the interior of the fluid, not at the surface. Like any other kind of wave, an inertial wave is caused by a [[restoring force]] and characterized by its [[wavelength]] and [[frequency]]. Because the restoring force for inertial waves is the [[Coriolis force]], their wavelengths and frequencies are related in a peculiar way. Inertial waves are [[transverse waves|transverse]]. Most commonly they are observed in atmospheres, oceans, lakes, and laboratory experiments. [[Rossby waves]], [[geostrophic|geostrophic currents]], and [[geostrophic wind]]s are examples of inertial waves. Inertial waves are also likely to exist in the molten core of the rotating [[Earth]].

== Restoring force ==

Inertial waves are [[Restoring force|restored to equilibrium]] by the [[Coriolis force]], a result of rotation. To be precise, the Coriolis force arises (along with the [[centrifugal force]]) in a rotating frame to account for the fact that such a frame is always accelerating. Inertial waves, therefore, cannot exist without rotation. More complicated than tension on a string, the Coriolis force acts at a 90° angle to the direction of motion, and its strength depends on the rotation rate of the fluid. These two properties lead to the peculiar characteristics of inertial waves.

== Characteristics ==

Inertial waves are possible only when a fluid is rotating, and exist in the bulk of the fluid, not at its surface. Like light waves, inertial waves are [[transverse waves|transverse]], which means that their vibrations occur perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. One peculiar geometrical characteristic of inertial waves is that their [[phase velocity]], which describes the movement of the ''crests'' and ''troughs'' of the wave, is ''perpendicular'' to their [[group velocity]], which is a measure of the propagation of energy.

Whereas a sound wave or an electromagnetic wave of any frequency is possible, inertial waves can exist only over the range of frequencies from zero to twice the rotation rate of the fluid. Moreover, the frequency of the wave is determined by its direction of travel. Waves traveling perpendicular to the axis of rotation have zero frequency and are sometimes called the [[geostrophic]] modes. Waves traveling parallel to the axis have maximum frequency (twice the rotation rate), and waves at intermediate angles have intermediate frequencies. In free space, an inertial wave can exist at ''any'' frequency between 0 and twice the rotation rate. A closed container, however, can impose restrictions on the possible frequencies of inertial waves, as it can for any kind of wave. Inertial waves in a closed container are often called '''inertial modes'''. In a sphere, for example, the inertial modes are forced to take on discrete frequencies, leaving gaps where no modes can exist.

== Examples of inertial waves ==

Any kind of fluid can support inertial waves: water, oil, liquid metals, air, and other gases. Inertial waves are observed most commonly in planetary atmospheres ([[Rossby waves]], [[geostrophic wind]]s) and in oceans and lakes ([[geostrophic|geostrophic currents]]), where they are responsible for much of the mixing that takes place. Inertial waves affected by the slope of the ocean floor are often called [[Rossby waves]]. Inertial waves can be observed in laboratory experiments or in industrial flows where a fluid is rotating. Inertial waves are also likely to exist in the liquid outer core of the Earth, and at least one group [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v325/n6103/abs/325421a0.html] has claimed evidence of them. Similarly, inertial waves are likely in rotating astronomical flows like [[accretion disks]], [[planetary rings]], and [[galaxies]].

==Mathematical description==
Fluid flow is governed by the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] for momentum. The [[flow velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; of a fluid with viscosity &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; under pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and rotating at rate &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; changes over time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; according to

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t}
+ (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{\nabla}) \vec{u}
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \vec{\nabla}P
+ \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u}
- 2\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{u}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first term on the right accounts for pressure, the second accounts for viscous diffusion and the third (last) term on the right side of the momentum equation (above) is the Coriolis term.

To be precise, &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity as observed in the rotating frame of reference. Since a rotating frame of reference is accelerating (i.e. non-inertial frame), two additional (pseudo) forces (as mentioned above) emerge as a result of this coordinate transformation: the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force. In the equation above, the centrifugal force is included as a part of the generalized pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is related to the usual pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the distance from the rotation axis &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, by

: &lt;math&gt;
P = p + \frac{1}{2} \rho r^2 \Omega^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the rotation rate is large, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force become large compared to the other terms. Being small in comparison, diffusion and the "convective derivative" (second term on the left) can be left out. Taking a curl of both sides and applying a few vector identities, the result is

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nabla \times \vec{u} 
= 2 ( \vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{\nabla} ) \vec{u}.
&lt;/math&gt;

One class of solutions to this equation are waves that satisfy two conditions. First, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wave vector]],

: &lt;math&gt;
\vec{u} \cdot \vec{k} = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the waves must be transverse, as mentioned above. Second, solutions are required to have a frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the dispersion relation

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega = 2 \hat{k} \cdot \vec{\Omega} = 2 \Omega \cos{\theta},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction of the wave. These particular solutions are known as inertial waves.

The dispersion relation looks much like the Coriolis term in the momentum equation—notice the rotation rate and the factor of two. It immediately implies the range of possible frequencies for inertial waves, as well as the dependence of their frequency on their direction.

'''Kennedy Grove Regional Recreation Area''',(KGRRA), also known simply as Kennedy Grove, is located in West [[Contra Costa County, California]] at the base of San Pablo Dam. The nearest city is [[El Sobrante, California]]. Created in 1967, it contains a three-mile hiking trail with an elevation of {{convert|760|feet|m}}. The Grove features many large eucalyptus trees, picnic areas, volleyball nets, playgrounds, and horseshoe pits. Bird watching is popular here because [[hawk]]s are almost always spotted. Some hikers have reported seeing [[Golden eagle|golden]] and [[bald eagle]]s around the reservoir. There is no camping allowed. Parking is $5 with an extra $2 fee for a dog. Dogs have to be on the leash around the lawn but they are allowed off the leash in remote parts of the park. The park is open from 8 a.m. to dusk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Grove Regional Recreation Area, East Bay Regional Park District, Contra Costa County|url=http://www.bahiker.com/eastbayhikes/kengrove.html|website=Bay Area Hiker|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before this {{convert|222|acre|ha}} park became a protected area, it was home to wheat fields, the site of Ranchos and railroad stations for a railroad that ran from [[Oakland]] to [[Orinda, California|Orinda]] through [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] via [[El Sobrante]]. It was originally part of the 17,754-acre [[Rancho San Pablo]]. Francisco Castro acquired the rancho in 1823, and the grove later became the Clancy Ranch. By 1886 the railroad had scheduled stops from the [[California railroads|California]] and [[Nevada railroads|Nevada railroad]] at Laurel Glen and Frenchman's Curve. The picnic areas around the park are named after some of the former railroad stops. The [[eucalyptus tree]]s were planted in 1910. This park was named in honor of [[President John F. Kennedy]] and opened on October 22, 1967. It is now owned/operated by the [[East Bay Regional Park District]](EBRPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Grove Regional Recreation Area|url=http://www.ebparks.org/parks/kennedy|website=East Bay Regional Park District|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Trail locations==
There are several trails located within the recreation area ranging from very easy to somewhat difficult. All trails lead out from the eucalyptus grove located near the base of the San Pablo Dam, adjacent to the parking area. Several trails will guide visitors through changing landscapes of native Oak chaparrals and fern laden Bay laurel woodlands. A segment of the Bay Area Ridge Trail begins at Kennedy Grove and runs along the western shore of San Pablo Reservoir. Eventually the trail crosses [[San Pablo Dam Road]] and then climbs up the San Pablo Ridge. *NOTE* An [[EBMUD]] permit is required for this hike.

==Wildlife==
Seen from the Kennedy Grove area is the San Pablo Reservoir where fishing is popular. The reservoir has [[trout]] and [[catfish]] and is recognized as the one of the finest fisheries in the [[San Francisco East Bay|East Bay]]. However a [[fishing license]] and [[EBMUD]] fishing permit is required. You can see flocks of [[ducks]], [[shorebirds]], [[geese]], and [[Pelicans|white pelicans]] from the trails. Sometimes [[deer]], [[bobcats]], [[foxes]] and [[coyotes]] can be sighted. There are also species like [[quail]], [[dove]], and [[wild turkeys]]. Some birds of prey that are known to take the skies above Kennedy Grove are [[eagles]], [[owls]], hawks, and [[ospreys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Pablo Reservoir|url=https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/san-pablo-reservoir|website=East Bay Municipal Utility District|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weather==
The area surrounding San Pablo Dam is fairly temperate. The East Bay is warmer than the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]]. Summer temperatures tend to vary from 60-100 degrees. Fog is very common. Rainfall occurs mostly during the months of October through March. The temperatures can dip below 32 degrees in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco and Bay Area Weather|url=http://sftravelguide.com/weather.php|website=Grant's San Francisco Travel Guide|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Popular activities include hiking, day camps, bird watching, walking around the lawn asphalt path and special events such as cross-country meets. The eucalyptus grove is frequently used as a desirable setting for company picnics, family reunions and other group events.

Fern Cottage is an indoor/outdoor facility designed for a capacity of 60 guests (seated) or 120 guests {standing). L-shaped, it has a kitchen and two separate rooms, with an enclosed private backyard and two decks.

==Visiting the park==
Kennedy Grove's main entrance is off of San Pablo Dam Road in El Sobrante. The park is open year round, starting at 8:00 AM daily. Closing time depends on the month: November - February, 4:30 PM, March, 6:00 PM; April, 7:00 PM; May - August, 8:00 PM; September, 7:00 PM; October, 6:00 PM. Parking fees are charged on weekends and holidays from April 1 to October 31 and are $5.00 per car, $4.00 per trailered vehicle and $25.00 per bus. Visitors may bring dogs, and there is a dog fee of $2.00 each.

'''Lichtenberg figures''' (German ''Lichtenberg-Figuren''), or "Lichtenberg dust figures", are branching [[electric discharge]]s that sometimes appear on the surface or in the interior of [[Electrical insulation|insulating materials]]. Lichtenberg figures are often associated with the progressive deterioration of high voltage components and equipment. The  study of planar Lichtenberg figures along insulating surfaces and 3D [[Electrical treeing|electrical trees]] within insulating materials often provides engineers with valuable insights for improving the long-term reliability of high voltage equipment. Lichtenberg figures are now known to occur on or within solids, liquids, and gases during [[electrical breakdown]].

==History==
Lichtenberg figures are named after the German physicist [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]], who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, it was thought that their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric "fluids". In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large [[electrophorus]] to generate high [[voltage]] [[static electricity]] through [[Electrostatic induction|induction]]. After discharging a high voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns by sprinkling various powdered materials onto the surface. By then pressing blank sheets of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern [[xerography]].&lt;ref&gt;De Nova Methodo Naturam Ac Motum Fluidi Electrici Investigandi (Göttinger Novi Commentarii, Göttingen, 1777). The English translation from the Latin title is, "Concerning the New Method Of Investigating the Nature and Movement of Electric Fluid"&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery was also the forerunner of the modern day science of [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]]. Although Lichtenberg only studied two-dimensional (2D) figures, modern high voltage researchers study 2D and 3D figures ([[electrical tree]]s) on, and within, insulating materials. Lichtenberg figures are now known to be examples of [[fractals]].

== Formation ==
Two-dimensional (2D) Lichtenberg figures can be produced by placing a sharp-pointed needle perpendicular to the surface of a non-conducting plate, such as of [[resin]], [[ebonite]], or [[glass]]. The point is positioned very near or contacting the plate. A source of high voltage, such as a [[Leyden jar]] (a type of [[capacitor]]) or a [[static electricity]] generator, is applied to the needle, typically through a [[spark gap]]. This creates a sudden, small [[Electrostatic discharge|electrical discharge]] along the surface of the plate. This deposits stranded areas of charge onto the surface of the plate. These electrified areas are then tested by sprinkling a mixture of powdered flowers of [[sulfur]] and red lead (Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or [[lead tetroxide]]) onto the plate.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Hundred Years of Lichtenberg Figures" by Yuzo Takahashi, Journal of Electrostatics, Volume 6, Issue 1, February 1979, Pages 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

During handling, powdered sulfur tends to acquire a slight negative charge, while red lead tends to acquire a slight positive charge. The negatively electrified sulfur is attracted to the positively electrified areas of the plate, while the positively electrified red lead is attracted to the negatively electrified areas. In addition to the distribution of colors thereby produced, there is also a marked difference in the form of the figure, according to the polarity of the electrical charge that was applied to the plate. If the charge areas were positive, a widely extending patch is seen on the plate, consisting of a dense nucleus, from which branches radiate in all directions. Negatively charged areas are considerably smaller and have a sharp circular or fan-like boundary entirely devoid of branches. [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] employed Lichtenberg dust figures in his seminal work proving [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] electromagnetic wave theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Heinrich Rudolf|title=Electric waves: being researches on the propagation of electric action with finite velocity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyRWAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Heinrich%20Rudolf%20Hertz%20Electric%20waves%3A%20being%20researches%20on%20the%20propagation%20of%20electric%20action%20with%20finite%20velocity&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tracking1.jpg|thumb|Carbonized high-voltage discharge tracks cross the surface of a [[polycarbonate]] sheet]]
If the plate receives a mixture of positive and negative charges as, for example, from an [[induction coil]], a mixed figure results, consisting of a large red central nucleus, corresponding to the negative charge, surrounded by yellow rays, corresponding to the positive charge. The difference between positive and negative figures seems to depend on the presence of [[air]]; for the difference tends to disappear when the experiment is conducted in [[vacuum]]. [[Peter Theophil Riess|Peter T. Riess]] (a 19th-century researcher) theorized that the negative electrification of the plate was caused by the friction of the water vapour, etc., driven along the surface by the [[explosion]] which accompanies the [[disruptive discharge]] at the point. This electrification would favor the spread of a positive, but hinder that of a negative discharge.&lt;ref&gt;"Ueber elektrische Figuren und Bilde" by Riess, Peter Theophil, Annalen der Physik und Chemie, ISSN 0003-3804, 1846, Volume 145, Issue 9, pages 1-44&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now known that electrical charges are transferred to the insulator's surface through small spark discharges that occur along the boundary between the gas and insulator surface.&lt;ref&gt;"The Atomphysical Interpretation of Lichtenberg Figures and Their Application to the Study of Gas Discharge Phenomena" by F. H. Merrill and A. Von Hippel, Journal of Applied Physics, December 1939,  Volume 10, Issue 12, pp. 873-887&lt;/ref&gt; Once transferred to the insulator, these excess charges become temporarily stranded. The shapes of the resulting charge distributions reflect the shape of the spark discharges which, in turn, depend on the high voltage polarity and pressure of the gas. Using a higher applied voltage will generate larger diameter and more branched figures. It is now known that positive Lichtenberg figures have longer, branching structures because long sparks within air can more easily form and propagate from positively charged high voltage terminals. This property has been used to measure the transient voltage polarity and magnitude of lightning surges on electrical power lines.&lt;ref&gt;"The Klydonograph and Its Application to Surge Investigation" by J. H. Cox and J. W. Legg, Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, January, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of 2D Lichtenberg figure can be created when an insulating surface becomes contaminated with semiconducting material. When a high voltage is applied across the surface, leakage currents may cause localized heating and progressive degradation and charring of the underlying material. Over time, branching, tree-like carbonized patterns are formed upon the surface of the insulator called [[electrical tree]]s. This degradation process is called ''tracking''. If the conductive paths ultimately bridge the insulating space, the result is catastrophic failure of the insulating material. Some artists purposely apply salt water to the surface of wood or cardboard and then apply a high voltage across the surface to generate complex carbonized 2D Lichtenberg figures on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turningart.com/artists/artist-cory-hunter&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractal similarities ===
The branching, [[self-similar]] patterns observed in Lichtenberg figures exhibit [[fractal]] properties. Lichtenberg figures often develop during the [[dielectric breakdown]] of solids, liquids, and even gases. Their appearance and growth appear to be related to a process called [[diffusion-limited aggregation]] (DLA). A useful macroscopic model that combines an electric field with DLA was developed by Niemeyer, Pietronero, and Weismann in 1984, and is known as the [[dielectric breakdown model]] (DBM).&lt;ref&gt;"Fractal Dimension of Dielectric Breakdown" by L. Niemeyer, L. Pietronero*, and H. J. Wiesmann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 1033–1036 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the electrical breakdown mechanisms of air and PMMA plastic are considerably different, the branching discharges turn out to be related. So, it should not be surprising that the branching forms taken by natural lightning also have fractal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fractal Nature of Lightning: An Investigation of the Fractal Relationship of the Structure of Lightning to Terrain" by Brian Clay Graham-Jones, a thesis submitted to the Department of Mathematics in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, Florida State University, College of Arts and Sciences, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural occurrences ==
[[Image:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lightning]] is a naturally occurring 3-dimensional Lichtenberg figure]]
Lichtenberg figures may also appear on the skin of [[lightning]] strike victims. These are reddish, fernlike patterns that may persist for hours or days. They are also a useful indicator for medical examiners when determining the cause of death. Lichtenberg figures appearing on people are sometimes called '''lightning flowers''', and they are thought to be caused by the rupture of [[capillaries]] under the skin due to the passage of the lightning current or the [[shock wave]] from the lightning discharge as it flashes over the skin.&lt;ref&gt;"Lichtenberg Figures Due to a Lightning Strike" by Yves Domart, M.D., Emmanuel Garet, M.D., New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 343:1536, November 23, 2000, Number 21, Images in Clinical Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;

A lightning strike can also create a large Lichtenberg figure in grass surrounding the point struck. These are sometimes found on [[golf course]]s or in grassy meadows.&lt;ref&gt;"Lightning and Lichtenberg Figures" by Michael Cherington, Sheryl Olson and Philip R. Yarnell, Injury: International Journal of the Care of the Injured, Volume 34, Issue 5, May 2003, Pages 367-371&lt;/ref&gt;  Branching root-shaped "[[fulgurite]]" mineral deposits may also be created as [[sand]] and [[soil]] is fused into glassy tubes by the intense heat of the current.

[[Electrical treeing]] often occurs in high-voltage equipment prior to causing complete breakdown. Following these Lichtenberg figures within the insulation during post-accident investigation of an insulation failure can be useful in finding the cause of breakdown. An experienced high-voltage engineer can see from the direction and the shape of trees and their branches where the primary cause of the breakdown was situated and possibly find the initial cause. Broken-down transformers, high-voltage cables, bushings and other equipment can usefully be investigated in this manner. The insulation is unrolled (in the case of paper insulation) or sliced in thin slices (in the case of solid insulating materials). The results are then sketched or photographed to create a record of the breakdown process.

== In insulating materials ==
Modern Lichtenberg figures can also be created within solid insulating materials, such as acrylic (polymethyl methacrylate or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]]) or glass by injecting them with a beam of high speed [[electrons]] from a linear electron beam accelerator (or [[Linear particle accelerator|Linac]], a type of [[particle accelerator]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Irradiation effects in Plexiglas" by Bernhard Gross, Journal of Polymer Science, Volume 27, Issue 115, Pages 135-143, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the Linac, electrons are focused and accelerated to form a beam of high speed particles. Electrons emerging from the accelerator have energies up to 25MeV and are moving at an appreciable fraction (95 - 99+ percent) of the [[speed of light]] ([[special relativity|relativistic]] velocities).

If the electron beam is aimed towards a thick acrylic specimen, the electrons easily penetrate the surface of the acrylic, rapidly decelerating as they collide with molecules inside the plastic, finally coming to rest deep inside the specimen. Since acrylic is an excellent electrical insulator, these electrons become temporarily trapped within the specimen, forming a plane of excess negative charge. Under continued irradiation, the amount of trapped charge builds, until the effective voltage inside the specimen reaches millions of volts.&lt;ref&gt;"High Potentials in Electron-Irradiated Dielectrics" by Bernhard Gross and Sam V. Nablo, Journal of Applied Physics, April 1967, Volume 38, Issue 5, pages 2272-2275&lt;/ref&gt; Once the electrical stress exceeds the [[dielectric strength]] of the plastic, some portions suddenly become conductive in a process called [[electrical breakdown#Failure of electrical insulation|dielectric breakdown]].

During breakdown, branching tree or fern-like conductive channels rapidly form and propagate through the plastic, allowing the trapped charge to suddenly rush out in a miniature [[lightning]]-like flash and bang. Breakdown of a charged specimen may also be manually triggered by poking the plastic with a pointed conductive object to create a point of excessive voltage stress. During the discharge, the powerful [[electric spark]]s leave thousands of branching chains of fractures behind - creating a permanent Lichtenberg figure inside the specimen. Although the internal charge within the specimen is negative, the discharge is initiated from the positively charged exterior surfaces of the specimen, so that the resulting discharge creates a positive Lichtenberg figure. These objects are sometimes called '''electron trees''', '''beam trees''', or '''lightning trees'''.

As the electrons rapidly decelerate inside the acrylic, they also generate powerful [[X-rays]]. Residual electrons and X-rays darken the acrylic by introducing defects (color centers) in a process called [[Solarisation (physics)|solarization]]. Solarization initially turns acrylic specimens a lime green color which then changes to an amber color after the specimen has been discharged. The color usually fades over time, and gentle heating, combined with oxygen, accelerates the fading process.&lt;ref&gt;"Radiation-induced changes in the index of refraction, density, and dielectric constant of poly(methyl methacrylate)" by Donald G. Gardner and Mohammad T. A. Toosi, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Volume 11, Issue 7, July 1967, Pages 1065-1078&lt;/ref&gt;

== On wood ==
[[File:Leopardwood 9 x 24.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Lichtenberg branching figure in [[leopardwood]]]]
Lichtenberg figures can also be produced on wood. The types of wood and grain patterns affect the shape of the Lichtenberg Figure produced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH4Vlfv-klQ&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2744">'''Medway Community Forest Coop Ltd.''' is a [[Community forestry|community forest]] pilot project in southwestern [[Nova Scotia]]. Covering 15,000 hectares of land, it is the first community-owned forest on [[crown land]] in Canada east of [[Quebec]].

It borders the [[Kejimkujik National Park]] and the [[Tobeatic Game Reserve|Tobeatic Wilderness Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/forestry/community-forest/medway.asp|title=Community Forests - Medway Community Forest {{!}} novascotia.ca|website=novascotia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

}}'''Multinet Gas''' is an [[Australia]]n energy company and one of three [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[natural gas]] distribution networks.

Multinet Gas distributes natural gas to more than 690,000 customers throughout [[Melbourne]]'s [[List of Melbourne suburbs|inner eastern suburb]]s and outer Eastern Suburbs, the Yarra Ranges, and South Gippsland. The network comprises 175km of licensed Transmission Pipelines, 9,959km of distribution mains (operating at pressures between 7kPa and 515 kPa), and 258 regulator stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.multinetgas.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MG-2018-to-2022-Access-Arrangement-Information-211216-FINAL-1.pdf|title=2018 to 2022 Access Arrangement Information - Multinet Gas|last=Narvaez|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Multinet Gas area has over 200km of low pressure (7 kpa) gas mains, some of which are [[Ductile iron pipe|cast iron]] mains that date back to the 1880s. These older cast iron mains are subject to water ingress during wet weather and as such, are the common cause of supply reliability issues. Multinet Gas' mains Replacement Program is aimed at replacing low-pressure gas distribution mains in the network and is targeting to replace all low-pressure mains by 2033. Upgraded low-pressure mains are typically replaced with high-pressure polyethylene gas mains by inserting the new ductile [[High-density polyethylene|polyethylene pipe]] into the existing cast iron main. This method minimizes damage to property and offers additional protection to the polyethylene mains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=View source for Multinet Gas|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multinet_Gas&amp;action=edit|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Multinet Gas Distribution Area Map 532x532.jpg|thumb|301x301px|Multinet Gas' distribution Area]]Gas networks were first built in Melbourne by the [[Metropolitan Gas Company]] some time before the 1880's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/523942?c=people|title=Metropolitan Gas Company (Melbourne, Vic.).

In 1951 the Metropolitan Gas Company was taken over by the government-owned monopoly supplier, the [[Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria]] (G&amp;FC). G&amp;FC owned the Melbourne gas network area from 1951 until the privatization in 1997.   

The company is owned by the [[DUET Group]], which was purchased in 2017, by [[Cheung Kong Infrastructure]] (CKI) for A$7.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/business/energy/electricity/firb-approves-cheung-kongs-duet-acquisition-20170420-gvp0bk|title=FIRB approves Cheung Kong's DUET acquisition|date=2017-04-21|work=Financial Review|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CKI controls other energy networks in Australia, including [[United Energy]], an electricity distributor in Melbourne's eastern and south-eastern suburbs and the [[Mornington Peninsula]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedenergy.com.au/our-story-and-vision/|title=About Us {{!}} United Energy|website=www.unitedenergy.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CitiPower]] in Melbourne; [[Powercor]] in western Melbourne and western Victoria; and [[Envestra]], which distributes gas through Victoria, [[Queensland]] and [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name="age040917"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/melbournes-electricity-and-gas-facing-greater-chinese-control-20170409-gvh84k.html|title=Melbourne's electricity and gas facing greater Chinese control|last=Gordon|first=Josh|date=2017-04-09|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acquisition, CKI controls three out of five electricity distributors and two out of three gas distributors in Victoria.&lt;ref name=age040917/&gt; As of 2018, Multinet Gas is operated as a part of Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG) in conjunction with the other CKI owned Australian gas distribution Networks.

Speaking at the [[G8]] summit in 2008, British [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced plans for Britain to be at the forefront of a "green car revolution". Mr Brown suggested that by 2020 all new cars sold in Britain could be electric or hybrid vehicles producing less than {{convert|100|gCO2/km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Local councils were invited to submit bids to become Britain's first "green cities". One example is [[Glasgow]], where a Scottish consortium has been awarded more than {{GBP|1.8 million}} to run a pilot electric car scheme from 2009 to 2011.&lt;ref name=gh0905&gt;{{citation

London mayor [[Boris Johnson]] also announced plans in April 2009 to deliver 25,000 electric car-charging places across the capital by 2015, in order to make London the "electric car capital of Europe". His target is to get 100,000 electric vehicles on to London's streets.

{{As of|2013|11}}, the UK government had pledged {{GBP|400 million}} to support the deployment of plug-in vehicles in the five years between March 2010 and March 2015. However, {{as of|2013|09|30|lc=y}}, only {{GBP|92 million}} had been spent and an additional of {{GBP|44 million}} had been committed for projects up to March 2015, of which, {{GBP|82 million}} were allocated for research and development; {{GBP|16 million}} on infrastructure such as public charging points; and {{GBP|25 million}} in consumer purchase incentives (Plug-in Car Grant). {{As of|2013|11}}, the UK has around 5,000 public charging points, of which, only 200 are quick chargers.&lt;ref name=FT112013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/df62a896-6566-11e3-a27d-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz2nh6otuJD|title=Spending to encourage use of electric cars falls flat|author=Henry Foy|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2013-12-15|accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2014 the UK was the leader in quick charging deployment in Europe, with 211 [[CHAdeMO]] charging stations available across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insideevs.com/sweden-uk-driving-growth-chademo-chargers-europe-1117/|title=Sweden and UK Drive Growth Of CHAdeMO Chargers In Europe To 1,117|author=Mark Kane|publisher=InsideEVs.com |date=2013-04-22|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of lower than initially expected electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales, in January 2014 the UK government launched the "Go Ultra Low" national campaign in partnership with five of the largest manufacturers of plug-in electric vehicles, [[BMW]], [[Nissan]], [[Renault]], [[Toyota]] and [[Vauxhall]]. The campaign has a cost of {{GBP|2.5 million}} and its objective is to promote the benefits of electric and plug-in hybrid cars to buyers. The Government classifies any car emitting less than 75g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as ultra-low emission. The British government also announced its commitment to invest {{GBP|9 million}} to install more rapid charge-points to make motorway journeys by electric car feasible. According to [[Nicholas Clegg]], [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], “Our clear objective is to move the car fleet in this country to ultra low-emission vehicles by 2040 and to put money and policy money behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/green-motoring/10607357/Government-commits-to-electric-cars.html|title=Government commits to electric cars|author=Nick Gibbs|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|date=2014-01-31|accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 [[Baroness Kramer]], [[Minister of State for Transport]], announced that all of the government’s fleets will be supplied with funding to introduce electric vehicles. The "Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Readiness Project", funded with {{GBP|5 million}}, is the first step towards making all government vehicles electrically powered. Central government fleets will benefit first, with plans to bring in over 150 plug-in cars and vans. The [[Government Car Service]], which presently has 85 vehicles used by ministers, will be the initial target with electric cars expected to be in operation by the third quarter 2014. A second phase is scheduled next to provide funds for the public sector in general to purchase more electric vehicles. Beneficiary agencies includes the [[National Health Service]], [[Community council|councils]] and police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nextgreencar.com/news/6710/Govt-fleets-funded-to-introduce-EVs |title=Govt fleets funded to introduce EVs|author=Edward Wirgman|work=Next Green Car|date=2014-07-18|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchase incentives===

In January 2009, transport secretary Geoff Hoon said the British government would make {{GBP|250 million}} (~{{USD|375 million}}) available for consumer incentives to bring electric cars to market in the UK.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;{{citation

The coalition government, led by [[David Cameron]], took office in May 2010 and confirmed their support of the grant on 28 July 2010. This confirmed that £43 million would be available for the first 15 months of the scheme, with the 2011 Spending Review confirming funding for the programme for the lifetime of the Parliament of around £300 million (~{{USD|450 million}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=414706&amp;SubjectId=16&amp;AdvancedSearch=true|title=Green light to ultra low carbon car consumer incentive|publisher=[[Department for Transport]]|date=2010-07-28|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=414706&amp;NewsAreaID=2|title=Transport Secretary Philip Hammond confirmed today that motorists will receive up to £5,000 towards purchase of an ultra-low carbon car from January 2011|publisher=[[Department for Transport]]|date=2010-07-28|accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10783287 |title=Electric car subsidy spared cuts by government |author=Richard Scott|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two subsidy programs were implemented, the Plug-in Car Grant, from January 2011, and the Plug-In Van Grant, from February 2012. Both offer buyers of eligible vehicles a purchase subsidy discounted at the point of purchase. {{As of|2017|12}}, the number of eligible registered plug-in electric cars that have benefited with the subsidy totaled 127,509 units since the launch of the programme in 2011.&lt;ref name=UK2017/&gt; {{As of|2016|12}}, the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012.&lt;ref name=UK4Q2016Van/&gt; {{As of|2014|12}}, there were 1,467 electric cars and vans registered which were not eligible for the Plug-in Grant scheme.&lt;ref name=UK24K/&gt;

==== Plug-in Car Grant ====
{{See also|Plug-in Car Grant}}
The [[Plug-in Car Grant]] programme started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the [[United Kingdom|UK]] The programme reduces the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at {{GBP|5,000}} ({{USD|7,450}}).&lt;ref name=GCC0210/&gt;&lt;ref name=DfT/&gt; From 1 April 2015, the purchase price cap was raised to cover up to 35% discount of the vehicle’s recommended retail price, up to the already existing £5,000 limit. This change means electric cars priced under {{GBP|20,000}}, such as the [[Renault Zoe]], are able to take advantage of most or all of the £5,000 discount.&lt;ref name=Grant2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transportevolved.com/2015/02/13/uk-government-announces-changes-plug-car-incentives-introduces-banding-based-zev-capabilities/|title=UK Government Announces Changes to Plug-in Car Incentives, Introduces Banding Based on ZEV Capabilities|author=Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield|publisher=Transport Evolved|date=2015-02-13|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both private and business fleet buyers are eligible for this grant which is received at the point of purchase.&lt;ref name=GCC0210/&gt;

In December 2015, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until the end of March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of {{GBP|400 million}} (~{{USD|600 million}}) will be available for the extension. The criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from {{GBP|5,000}} (~{{USD|7,450}}) to {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,750}}). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels ({{CO2}} emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage with a minimum [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|10|mi|abbr=on}}.

===Plugged-in Places===

On 19 November 2009, [[Andrew Adonis]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport]], announced a scheme called "Plugged-in-Places", making available £30 million to be shared between three and six cities to investigate further the viability of providing power supply for electric vehicles, and encouraging local government and business to participate and bid for funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/news/2009/11/thousands-of-electric-car-charging-points-due-189176

The Government is supporting the ‘Plugged-In Places’ programme to install vehicle recharging points across the UK. The scheme offers match-funding to consortia of businesses and public sector partners to support the installation of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure in lead places across the UK.&lt;ref name=DfT2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/sustainable/olev/recharging-electric-vehicles/|title=Recharging infrastructure|publisher=[[Department for Transport]] |date=|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight Plugged-In Places: East of England;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourceeast.net/]&lt;/ref&gt; Greater Manchester; London;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sourcelondon.net/]&lt;/ref&gt; Midlands;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenex.co.uk/programmes/plugged-in-places the] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825170205/http://www.cenex.co.uk/programmes/plugged-in-places |date=25 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton Keynes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chargemasterplc.com/charging-schemes/milton-keynes/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316101205/http://chargemasterplc.com/charging-schemes/milton-keynes/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; North East;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chargeyourcar.org.uk/indexx3.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316101204/http://www.chargeyourcar.org.uk/indexx3.php |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Ireland;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/ecar]&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland.

===London congestion charge===
[[File:2017 Volkswagen Golf GTE S-A 1.4.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Golf GTE]] [[plug-in hybrid]] is exempted from the [[London congestion charge]].]]

[[Battery electric vehicles|All-electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and eligible [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% discount from the [[London congestion charge]]. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) and has a fuel type of 'electric', or alternatively, if the vehicle is a 'plug-in hybrid' and is on the Government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions?intcmp=4368|title=Discounts and exemptions - Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)|author=[[Transport for London]]|publisher=Transport for London |date=February 2015|accessdate=2015-02-15}} ''Click on "Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)" for details.''&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2016|02}}, approved PHEVs include all extended-range cars such as the [[BMW i3 REx]], and plug-in hybrids that emit 75g/km or less of {{CO2}} and that meet the [[Euro 5]] standard for air quality, such as the [[Audi A3 Sportback e-tron]], [[BMW i8]], [[Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV]] (passenger and van variants), [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]], and [[Volkswagen Golf GTE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goultralow.com/what-are-go-ultra-low-cars/types-of-vehicles/plug-in-hybrid/|title=Vehicle technologies - Plug-in hybrids|author=Go Ultra Low|publisher=Go Ultra Low|date=February 2016|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) scheme that went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and meets the [[Euro 5]] emission standards for air quality. {{As of|2013|07}} there are no [[internal combustion]]-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure is designed to limit the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. Mayor Boris Johnson approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year [[Sunset provision|sunset period]] (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/04/uled-20130424.html|title=London to introduce new Ulta Low Emission Discount for Congestion Charge scheme; countering dieselization|author= |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=24 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/24/pollution|title=London tightens up congestion charge in attempt to drive out diesel |author= |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/07/01/london-tightens-congestion-charge-exemptions/|title=London tightens Congestion Charge exemptions |author=Faye Sunderland|publisher=The Green Car Website (UK)|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23125082|title=New green discount for the congestion charge comes in|author= |work=[[BBC News]]|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost-effectiveness of carbon reductions==
A study by Element Energy commissioned by [[BP]] and published in September 2013, concluded that the use of [[advanced biofuel]]s in the UK, and particularly [[E20 fuel|E20]] [[cellulosic ethanol]], is a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than using [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) in the timeframe to 2030. The study also found that the use of higher blends of biofuels is complementary to [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s (HEVs) and [[plug-in hybrid]]s (PHEVs). [[Battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) can deliver strong CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings with a decarbonised electric grid, but are expected to have significantly higher costs than [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles and hybrid cars to 2030, as the latter are expected to be the most popular models by 2030. According to the study, blending biofuels in fuels is a cheaper way to reduce 
emissions than using BEVs in the timeframe to 2030, as an E20 blend in a HEV can achieve a 10% emission savings compared to an HEV running on E5, for an annual fuel cost premium of £13 compared to an annual cost of £195 for an all-electric car. The study also concluded that advanced biofuels address emissions of both new and existing vehicles, thus reducing emissions earlier than new powertrains and abating the risk of relying solely on longer term deployment of new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/09/23/advanced-biofuels-could-cut-ghg-emissions-for-less-than-electric-cars/|title=Advanced biofuels could cut GHG emissions for less than electric cars |author=Faye Sunderland|publisher=The Green Car Website (UK)|date=2013-09-23|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.element-energy.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130916-Element-Energy_Role-of-biofuels_FINAL.pdf|title=The Role of Biofuels Beyond 2020|author=Element Energy Limited|publisher=Element Energy|date=2013-09-16|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13460">'''Real gases''' are non-hypothetical gases whose molecules occupy space and have interactions; consequently, they adhere to gas laws.
To understand the behaviour of real gases, the following must be taken into account:

*[[compressibility]] effects;
*variable [[specific heat capacity]];
*[[van der Waals force]]s;&lt;!-- "van", see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --&gt;
*non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects;
*issues with molecular dissociation and elementary reactions with variable composition

For most applications, such a detailed analysis is unnecessary, and the [[ideal gas]] approximation can be used with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, real-gas models have to be used near the [[condensation]] point of gases, near [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]s, at very high pressures, to explain the [[Joule–Thomson effect]] and in other less usual cases. The deviation from ideality can be described by the [[compressibility factor]] Z.

{{Main|Equation of state}}

===Van der Waals model===
{{Main|van der Waals equation}}
Real gases are often modeled by taking into account their molar weight and molar volume
:&lt;math&gt;RT = \left(p + \frac{a}{V_\text{m}^2}\right)\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{V_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''p'' is the pressure, ''T'' is the temperature, ''R'' the ideal gas constant, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the [[molar volume]]. ''a'' and ''b'' are parameters that are determined empirically for each gas, but are sometimes estimated from their [[critical temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[critical pressure]] (''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) using these relations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a &amp;= \frac{27R^2 T_\text{c}^2}{64p_\text{c}} \\
  b &amp;= \frac{RT_\text{c}}{8p_\text{c}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the [[reduced properties]] &lt;math&gt;
  p_r = \frac{p}{p_\text{c}},\ 
  V_r = \frac{V_\text{m}}{V_\text{m,c}},\ 
  T_r = \frac{T}{T_\text{c}}\ 
&lt;/math&gt; the equation can be written in the ''reduced form'':
:&lt;math&gt;p_r = \frac{8}{3}\frac{T_r}{V_r - \frac{1}{3}} - \frac{3}{V_r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Redlich–Kwong model===
[[File:Critical isotherm Redlich-Kwong model.png|thumb|Critical isotherm for Redlich-Kwong model in comparison to van-der-Waals model and ideal gas (with V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=RT&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
The [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state|Redlich–Kwong equation]] is another two-parameter equation that is used to model real gases. It is almost always more accurate than the [[van der Waals equation]], and often more accurate than some equations with more than two parameters. The equation is
:&lt;math&gt;RT = \left(p + \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}V_\text{m}\left(V_\text{m} + b\right)}\right)\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}V_\text{m}\left(V_\text{m} + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' two empirical parameters that are '''not''' the same parameters as in the van der Waals equation. These parameters can be determined:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a &amp;= 0.42748\, \frac{R^2{T_\text{c}}^\frac{5}{2}}{p_\text{c}} \\
  b &amp;= 0.08664\, \frac{RT_\text{c}}{p_\text{c}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;\ 
  p_r = \frac{p}{p_\text{c}},\ 
  V_r = \frac{V_\text{m}}{V_\text{m,c}},\ 
  T_r = \frac{T}{T_\text{c}}\ 
&lt;/math&gt; the equation of state can be written in the ''reduced form'':
: &lt;math&gt;p_r = \frac{3 T_r}{V_r - b'} - \frac{1}{b'\sqrt{T_r} V_r \left(V_r + b'\right)}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b' = \sqrt[3]{2} - 1 \approx 0.26&lt;/math&gt;

===Berthelot and modified Berthelot model===
The Berthelot equation (named after D. Berthelot)&lt;ref&gt;D. Berthelot in ''Travaux et Mémoires du Bureau international des Poids et Mesures – Tome XIII'' (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt; is very rarely used,
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} - \frac{a}{TV_\text{m}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

but the modified version is somewhat more accurate
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m}}\left[1 + \frac{9\frac{p}{p_\text{c}}}{128\frac{T}{T_\text{c}}} \left(1 - \frac{6}{\frac{T^2}{T_\text{c}^2}}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Dieterici model===
This model (named after C. Dieterici&lt;ref&gt;C. Dieterici, ''Ann. Phys. Chem. Wiedemanns Ann.'' 69, 685 (1899)&lt;/ref&gt;) fell out of usage in recent years
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} \exp\left(-\frac{a}{V_\text{m}RT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with parameters a, b, and
: &lt;math&gt;\exp\left(-\frac{a}{V_\text{m}RT}\right) = e^{-\frac{a}{V_\text{m}RT}} = 1 - \frac{a}{V_\text{m}RT} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

===Clausius model===
The Clausius equation (named after [[Rudolf Clausius]]) is a very simple three-parameter equation used to model gases.
:&lt;math&gt;RT = \left(p + \frac{a}{T(V_\text{m} + c)^2}\right)\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} - \frac{a}{T\left(V_\text{m} + c\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a &amp;= \frac{27R^2 T_\text{c}^3}{64p_\text{c}} \\
  b &amp;= V_\text{c} - \frac{RT_\text{c}}{4p_\text{c}} \\
  c &amp;= \frac{3RT_\text{c}}{8p_\text{c}} - V_\text{c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is critical volume.

===Virial model===
The [[Virial coefficient|Virial]] equation derives from a [[Perturbation theory|perturbative treatment]] of statistical mechanics.
:&lt;math&gt;pV_\text{m} = RT\left[1 + \frac{B(T)}{V_\text{m}} + \frac{C(T)}{V_\text{m}^2} + \frac{D(T)}{V_\text{m}^3} + \ldots\right]&lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively
:&lt;math&gt;pV_\text{m} = RT\left[1 + B'(T)p + C'(T)p^2 + D'(T)p^3 \ldots\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''A''&amp;prime;, ''B''&amp;prime;, and ''C''&amp;prime; are temperature dependent constants.

===Peng–Robinson model===
[[Peng–Robinson equation of state]] (named after [[D.-Y. Peng]] and D. B. Robinson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A New Two-Constant Equation of State |journal= Industrial and Engineering Chemistry: Fundamentals |volume= 15 |year= 1976 |pages= 59–64 |author1=Peng, D. Y. |author2=Robinson, D. B. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi= 10.1021/i160057a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has the interesting property being useful in modeling some liquids as well as real gases.
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} - \frac{a(T)}{V_\text{m}\left(V_\text{m} + b\right) + b\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Wohl model===
[[File:Isotherm wohl model.png|thumb|Isotherm (V/V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-&gt;p_r) at critical temperature for Wohl model, van der Waals model and ideal gas model (with V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=RT&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
[[File:ZPhCh87p9f.png|thumb|Untersuchungen über die Zustandsgleichung,&lt;small&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;9,10, ''Zeitschr. f. Physikal. Chemie 87''&lt;/small&gt;]]
The Wohl equation (named after A. Wohl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Wohl |title=Investigation of the condition equation |journal=Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie |date=1914 |volume=87 |pages=1–39 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is formulated in terms of critical values, making it useful when real gas constants are not available, but it cannot be used for high densities, as for example the critical isotherm shows a drastic ''decrease'' of pressure when the volume is contracted beyond the critical volume.
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{V_\text{m} - b} - \frac{a}{TV_\text{m}\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)} + \frac{c}{T^2 V_\text{m}^3}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

or:
: &lt;math&gt;\left(p - \frac{c}{T^2 V_\text{m}^3}\right)\left(V_\text{m} - b\right) = RT - \frac{a}{TV_\text{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt;RT = \left(p + \frac{a}{TV_\text{m}(V_\text{m} - b)} - \frac{c}{T^2 V_\text{m}^3}\right)\left(V_\text{m} - b\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;a = 6p_\text{c} T_\text{c} V_\text{m,c}^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{V_\text{m,c}}{4}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;V_\text{m,c} = \frac{4}{15}\frac{RT_c}{p_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = 4p_\text{c} T_\text{c}^2 V_\text{m,c}^3\ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;
  V_\text{m,c},\ 
  p_\text{c},\ 
  T_\text{c}
&lt;/math&gt; are (respectively) the molar volume, the pressure and the temperature at the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].

And with the [[reduced properties]] &lt;math&gt;\ 
  p_r = \frac{p}{p_\text{c}},\ 
  V_r = \frac{V_\text{m}}{V_\text{m,c}},\ 
  T_r = \frac{T}{T_\text{c}}\ 
&lt;/math&gt; one can write the first equation in the ''reduced form'':
:&lt;math&gt;p_r = \frac{15}{4}\frac{T_r}{V_r - \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{6}{T_r V_r\left(V_r - \frac{1}{4}\right)} + \frac{4}{T_r^2 V_r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

===Beattie–Bridgeman model===
&lt;ref&gt;Yunus A. Cengel and Michael A. Boles, ''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'' 7th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2010, {{ISBN|007-352932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;This equation is based on five experimentally determined constants. It is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{RT}{v^2}\left(1 - \frac{c}{vT^3}\right)(v + B) - \frac{A}{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A &amp;= A_0 \left(1 - \frac{a}{v}\right)
  B &amp;= B_0 \left(1 - \frac{b}{v}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known to be reasonably accurate for densities up to about 0.8&amp;nbsp;''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the substance at its critical point. The constants appearing in the above equation are available in the following table when ''p'' is in kPa, ''v'' is in &lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{k}\,\text{mol}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''T'' is in K and ''R'' = 8.314&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{kPa}\cdot\text{m}^3}{\text{k}\,\text{mol}\cdot\text{K}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordan J. Van Wylen and Richard E. Sonntage, ''Fundamental of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed, New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1986 P46 table 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benedict–Webb–Rubin model===
{{Main|Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation}}
The BWR equation, sometimes referred to as the BWRS equation,
:&lt;math&gt;p = RTd + d^2\left(RT(B + bd) - \left(A + ad - a\alpha d^4\right) - \frac{1}{T^2}\left[C - cd\left(1 + \gamma d^2\right) \exp\left(-\gamma d^2\right)\right]\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the molar density and where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''α'', and ''γ'' are empirical constants. Note that the ''γ'' constant is a derivative of constant ''α'' and therefore almost identical to 1.

==Thermodynamic expansion work==
The expansion work of the real gas is different than that of the ideal gas by the quantity &lt;math&gt; \int \left(V - \frac{RT}{P}\right) dP &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Severe weather''' refers to any dangerous [[meteorological]] phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPS/Meetings/Wshop-SEEF_Toulouse2004/Doc3-1(1).doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103094209/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPS/Meetings/Wshop-SEEF_Toulouse2004/Doc3-1%281%29.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-01-03 |author=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |title=Workshop On Severe and ExPOO  Events Forecasting |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2009-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Types of severe weather phenomena vary, depending on the [[latitude]], [[altitude]], [[topography]], and [[atmospheric]] conditions.  High winds, [[hail]], excessive [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[wildfire]]s are forms and effects of severe weather, as are [[thunderstorm]]s, [[downbursts]], [[tornado]]es, [[waterspout]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, and [[extratropical cyclone]]s.  Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include [[blizzard]]s ([[snowstorm]]s), [[ice storms]], and [[duststorm]]s.&lt;ref name="AMS1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=severe+weather&amp;submit=Search|title=Severe weather|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201147/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=severe+weather&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Meteorologists generally define '''severe weather''' as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life, property or requires the intervention of authorities. A narrower definition of ''severe weather'' is any weather phenomena relating to [[thunderstorm|severe thunderstorms]].&lt;ref name="AMS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glossary2009"&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=severe-storm1|title=Severe storm|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2010-02-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026171035/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=severe-storm1|archivedate=26 October 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), severe weather can be categorized into two groups: general severe weather and localized severe weather.&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; [[Nor'easter]]s, European wind storms, and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas. These occurrences are classified as ''general severe weather''.&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;  Downbursts and tornadoes are more localized and therefore have a more limited geographic effect. These forms of weather are classified as ''localized severe weather''.&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; The term ''severe weather'' is technically not the same phenomenon as [[extreme weather]]. Extreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/518.htm |title=IPCC Third Assessment Report – Climate Change 2001 – Complete online versions &amp;#124; GRID-Arendal – Publications – Other |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928074318/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2FCLIMATE%2FIPCC_TAR%2Fwg1%2F518.htm |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized severe weather occurs from the same conditions that generate ordinary thunderstorms: atmospheric moisture, lift (often from [[thermal]]s), and [[atmospheric instability|instability]].&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq |title=Storm Prediction Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=Spc.noaa.gov |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of conditions cause severe weather. Several factors can convert thunderstorms into severe weather. &lt;!--specifically what are the conditions that create the variety?--&gt; For example, a pool of cold air aloft may aid in the development of large hail from an otherwise innocuous appearing thunderstorm. However, the most severe hail and tornadoes are produced by [[supercell]] thunderstorms, and the worst [[downburst]]s and [[derecho]]s (straight-line winds) are produced by [[bow echo]]es. Both of these types of storms tend to form in environments high in [[wind shear]].&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;!--this section does not address the cause/conditions that produce severe weather consider removing and answering in each subsection--&gt;&lt;!--consider a subsection on geography and its effects on storm severity--&gt;

Floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms are considered to be the most destructive weather-related [develop [[Weather model|models]] to predict the most frequent and possible locations. This information is used to notify affected areas and save lives.

Severe thunderstorms can be assessed in three different categories. These are "approaching severe", "severe", and "significantly severe".

'''Approaching severe''' is defined as hail between {{convert|1/2|to|1|in|sp=us}} diameter or winds between 50 and 58 M.P.H. (50 knots, 80–93&amp;nbsp;km/h). In the United States, such storms will usually warrant a [[Significant Weather Alert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//append/glossary_a.htm |title=NWS JetStream – Weather Glossary: A's |publisher=Srh.noaa.gov |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Severe''' is defined as hail {{convert|1|to|2|in|sp=us}} diameter, winds {{convert|58|to|75|mph}}, or an F1 tornado.&lt;ref name="WhyOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/oneinchhail/ |title=Why One Inch Hail Criterion? |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Significant severe''' is defined as hail {{convert|2|in|sp=us}} in diameter or larger, winds 75 M.P.H. (65 knots, 120&amp;nbsp;km/h) or more, or a [[tornado]] of strength EF2 or stronger. &lt;ref name="WMO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OnlineSevere2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/rda|title=Online Severe Weather Climatology – Radar Coverage Areas|publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]] |date= 6 October 2007|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''severe'' and ''significant severe'' events warrant a [[severe thunderstorm warning]] from the United States [[National Weather Service]] (excludes flash floods), the [[Environment Canada]], the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]], or the [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] if the event occurs in those countries. If a tornado is occurring (a tornado has been seen by [[Weather spotter|spotter]]s) or is imminent ([[Doppler weather radar]] has observed [[Tornado vortex signature|strong rotation in a storm]], indicating an incipient tornado), the severe thunderstorm warning will be superseded by a ''[[tornado warning]]'' in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=spc-faq&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Roger|title=The Online Tornado FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about Tornadoes|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/|publisher=Storm Prediction Center, NOAA|accessdate=29 March 2012|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe weather outbreak is typically considered to be when ten or more tornadoes, some of which will likely be long-tracked and violent, and ''many'' large hail or damaging wind reports occur within one or more consecutive days. Severity is also dependent on the size of the geographic area affected, whether it covers hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;Guyer, Jared. "SPC Web Feedback – Outbreaks."

Hurricane-force winds, caused by individual thunderstorms, thunderstorm complexes, derechos, tornadoes, extratropical cyclones, or tropical cyclones can destroy mobile homes and structurally damage buildings with foundations. Winds of this strength due to downslope winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars.&lt;ref name="boulder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/winds.html|accessdate=2009-06-16|date=10 April 2000|author=Rene Munoz|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|title=Boulder's downslope winds|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsChh6S?url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/winds.html|archivedate=22 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once winds exceed {{convert|135|kn|km/h}} within strong tropical cyclones and tornadoes, homes completely collapse, and significant damage is done to larger buildings.

Tornadoes, despite being one of the most destructive weather phenomena, are generally short-lived. A long-lived tornado generally lasts no more than an hour, but some have been known to last for 2 hours or longer (for example, the [[Tri-State Tornado]]). Due to their relatively short duration, less information is known about the development and formation of tornadoes.&lt;ref name="Tornadoes2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tornadoes|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/tornado.html&amp;edu=high |date=1 August 2008|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please review MAIN article prior to editing this section - this article is specific to SEVERE WEATHER--&gt;
Downbursts are created within thunderstorms by significantly rain-cooled air, which, upon reaching ground level, spreads out in all directions and produce strong winds. Unlike winds in a [[tornado]], winds in a downburst are not rotational but are directed outwards from the point where they strike land or water.[[File:Microburstnasa.JPG|thumb|left|Illustration of a microburst. The air moves in a downward motion until it hits ground level.

Very high winds can be caused by mature tropical cyclones (called ''hurricanes'' in the United States and Canada and ''typhoons'' in eastern Asia).

Waterspouts typically do not do much damage because they occur over open water, but they are capable of traveling over land. Vegetation, weakly constructed buildings, and other infrastructure may be  damaged or destroyed by waterspouts. Waterspouts do not generally last long over terrestrial environments as the friction produced easily dissipates the winds.

A [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic-scale]] extratropical storm along the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada]] is called a Nor'easter.

Dust storms have numerous hazards and are capable of causing deaths. Visibility may be reduced dramatically, so risks of vehicle and aircraft crashes are possible. Additionally, the particulates may reduce oxygen intake by the lungs,&lt;ref name="Duststorms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/environmental/dust_storms.html |title=Dust storms Factsheet – NSW Department of Health |publisher=Health.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in suffocation.

Dust storms can many issues for agricultural industries as well. Soil erosion is one of the most common hazards and decreases [[arable land]]s. Dust and sand particles can cause severe weathering of buildings and rock formations. Nearby bodies of water may be polluted by settling dust and sand, killing aquatic organisms. Decrease in exposure to sunlight can affect plant growth, as well as decrease in infrared radiation may cause decreased temperatures.

&lt;!--I removed information about Amazon farmers needing dust storms because it has little relevance to weather severity and has been uncited for nearly two years.  The information about the Dust Bowl, again, is not relevant to severe weather (it is more important here to focus on EFFECTS than on CAUSES).  However, it is apropos to include the Dust Bowl under "see also" and with the Drought section.--&gt;

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In the United States, Canada, and Northwest China, lightning is the major source of ignition.  In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor.  For instance, in Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Fiji, and New Zealand, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as [[animal husbandry]], agriculture, and land-conversion burning.  Human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires in China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]].  In Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced to both lightning strikes and human activities such as machinery sparks and cast-away cigarette butts."&lt;ref name=Krock&gt;{{cite web |last=Krock|first=Lexi|title=The World on Fire|publisher=NOVA online – Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=2009-07-13|date=June 2002|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wildfires have a rapid ''forward rate of spread'' (FROS) when burning through dense, uninterrupted fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flash.org/resources/files/WildfireBrochure.pdf|format=PDF|title=Protecting Your Home From Wildfire Damage|publisher=Florida Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH)|accessdate=3 March 2010|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can move as fast as {{Convert|10.8|km/h|mph|sp=us}} in forests and {{convert|22|km/h|mph|sp=us}} in grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;Billing, 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a ''flanking'' front, or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by ''backing''.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al.''., 12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Rain|Flood|Flash flood}}
Heavy rainfall can lead to a number of hazards, most of which are floods or hazards resulting from floods.  Flooding is the inundation of areas that are not normally under water. It is typically divided into three classes: River flooding, which relates to rivers rising outside their normals banks; flash flooding, which is the process where a landscape, often in urban and arid environments, is subjected to rapid floods;&lt;ref name="Glossary2009f"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Flash+flood|title=Flash Flood|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|year=2009|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085246/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Flash+flood|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coastal flooding, which can be caused by strong winds from tropical or non-tropical cyclones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaawatch.gov/themes/coastal_inundation.php |title=Coastal Inundation: NOAA Watch: NOAA's All-Hazard Monitor: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: U.S. Department of Commerce |publisher=Noaawatch.gov |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105140621/http://www.noaawatch.gov/themes/coastal_inundation.php |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meteorology|Meteorologically]], excessive rains occur within a plume of air with high amounts of moisture (also known as an [[atmospheric river]]) which is directed around an upper level [[cold-core low]] or a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="Boniface2010"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/90annual/techprogram/paper_161861.htm|title=An Analysis of Heavy Rainfall Weather Systems over Louisiana|date=20 January 2010|author1=Boniface J.

Richardson  |last-author-amp=yes |conference=24th Conference of Hydrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and are usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in dense populated urban environments, where less plants and bodies of water are presented to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within experiencing areas can also be displaced. [[Soil]] erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of [[landslide]] phenomena. Like all forms of flooding phenomenon, flash flooding can also spread and produce [[Waterborne disease|waterborne]] and [[insect-borne disease|insect-borne]] diseases cause by microorganisms.

A tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a [[low-pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and flooding rain.

Ice storms are also known as a ''Silver storm'', referring to the color of the freezing precipitation.&lt;ref name="amsglossary.allenpress.com"/&gt; Ice storms are caused by liquid [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] which freezes upon cold surfaces and leads to the gradual development of a thickening layer of ice.&lt;ref name="amsglossary.allenpress.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Ice+storm |title=AMS Glossary |publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com |accessdate=2009-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606153248/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Ice+storm |archive-date=6 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The accumulations of ice during the storm can be extremely destructive. Trees and vegetation can be destroyed and in turn may bring down power lines, causing the loss of heat and communication lines.&lt;ref name="Glossary2009i"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=ice+storm |title=Glossary – NOAA's National Weather Service |publisher=Weather.gov |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roofs of buildings and automobiles may be severely damaged.  Gas pipes can become frozen or even damaged causing gas leaks. [[Avalanches]] may develop due to the extra weight of the ice present. Visibility can be reduced dramatically. The aftermath of an ice storm may result in severe flooding due to sudden thawing, with large quantities of displaced water, especially near lakes, rivers, and bodies of water.&lt;ref name="WinterStormsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winterstorm/winterstorms.pdf |title=WinterStorms.p65 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825020946/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winterstorm/winterstorms.pdf |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soil Gradations.JPG|thumb|Soil Gradation Categories]]
'''Soil gradation''' is a classification of a coarse-grained [[soil]] that ranks the soil based on the different particle sizes contained in the soil.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Holtz, R. and Kovacs, W. (1981), ''An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering'', Prentice-Hall, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-484394-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil gradation is an important aspect of [[soil mechanics]] and [[geotechnical engineering]] because it is an indicator of other engineering properties such as compressibility, shear strength, and hydraulic conductivity. In a design, the gradation of the in situ or on site soil often controls the design and ground water drainage of the site. A poorly graded soil will have better drainage than a well graded soil.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;"[http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6913.htm ASTM D6913 - 04(2009)]".''ASTM International''. ASTM International. 1996-2009. October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil gradation is determined by analyzing the results of a [[sieve analysis]]

The process for grading a soil is in accordance with either the [[Unified Soil Classification System]] or the [[AASHTO Soil Classification System]]. Gradation of a soil is determined by reading the grain size distribution curve produced from the results of laboratory tests on the soil. Gradation of a soil can also be determined by calculating the coefficient of uniformity, C&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;, and the coefficient of curvature, C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, of the soil and comparing the calculated values with published gradation limits.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="f"&gt;Coduto, Donald P.

== Soil Gradations ==

Soil gradation is a classification of the particle size distribution of a soil. Coarse-grained soils, mainly gravels or sands, are graded as either well graded or poorly graded. Poorly graded soils are further divided into uniformly-graded or gap-graded soils. Fine-grained soils, mainly silts and clays, are classified according to their [[Atterberg limits]].&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="f"/&gt;

=== Well Graded ===

A ''well graded'' soil is a soil that contains particles of a wide range of sizes and has a good representation of all sizes from the No. 4 to No. 200 sieves.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; A well graded gravel is classified as GW while a well graded sand is classified as SW.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

=== Poorly Graded ===

A ''poorly graded'' soil is a soil that does not have a good representation of all sizes of particles from the No. 4 to No. 200 sieve. A poorly graded gravel is classified as GP while a poorly graded sand is classified as SP. Poorly graded soils are more susceptible to [[soil liquefaction]] than well graded soils.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

A ''gap-graded'' soil is a soil that has an excess or deficiency of certain particle sizes or a soil that has at least one particle size missing.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; An example of a gap-graded soil is one in which sand of the No. 10 and No. 40 sizes are missing, and all the other sizes are present.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

=== Process of Grading a Soil ===

The process of grading a soil is in accordance with either the Unified Soil Classification System or the AASHTO Soil Classification System. The steps in grading a soil are data collection, calculating coefficients of uniformity and curvature, and grading the soil based on the grading criteria given in the used soil classification system.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

==== Data Collection ====

Soil gradation is determined by analyzing the results of a [[sieve analysis]] or a [[hydrometer|hydrometer analysis]].&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; 

In a sieve analysis, a coarse-grained soil sample is shaken through a series of woven-wire square-mesh sieves. Each sieve has successively smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each sieve are retained on the sieve.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each sieve and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample. The results of a sieve analysis are plotted as a grain size distribution curve, which is then analyzed to determine the soil gradation of the particular soil.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

In a hydrometer analysis, a fine-grained soil sample is left to settle in a [[viscosity|viscous]] fluid. This method is used based on [[Stoke's Law]] which relates terminal velocity of fall of a particle in a viscous fluid to the grain diameter and density of the grain in suspension.Grain diameter is calculated from a known distance and time of the fall of the particle. This is used to classify fine-grained soils.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

==== Calculating the Coefficients of Uniformity and Curvature ====

Calculating the coefficients of uniformity and curvature requires grain diameters. The grain diameter can be found for each percent of the soil passing a particular sieve. This means that if 40% of the sample is retained on the No. 200 sieve then there is 60% passing the No. 200 sieve.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

The ''coefficient of uniformity'', C&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is a crude shape parameter and is calculated using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;C_u = \frac {D_{60}}{D_{10}}&lt;/math&gt;

where D&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is the grain diameter at 60% passing, and D&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the grain diameter at 10% passing

The ''coefficient of curvature'', C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is a shape parameter and is calculated using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;C_c = \frac {(D_{30})^2}{D_{10} \times\ D_{60}}&lt;/math&gt;

where D&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is the grain diameter at 60% passing, D&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; is the grain diameter at 30% passing, and D&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the grain diameter at 10% passing

Once the coefficient of uniformity and the coefficient of curvature have been calculated, they must be compared to published gradation criteria.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

==== Criteria for Grading Soils ====

The following criteria are in accordance with the [[Unified Soil Classification System]]:

For a gravel to be classified as well graded, the following criteria must be met:

C&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 4 &amp; 1 &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3

If both of these criteria are not met, the gravel is classified as poorly graded or GP. If both of these criteria are met, the gravel is classified as well graded or GW.

For a sand to be classified as well graded, the following criteria must be met:

C&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 6 &amp; 1 &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3

If both of these criteria are not met, the sand is classified as poorly graded or SP. If both of these criteria are met, the sand is classified as well graded or SW.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

=== Importance ===
Soil gradation is very important to geotechnical engineering. It is an indicator of other engineering properties such as compressibility, shear strength, and hydraulic conductivity. 

In a design, the gradation of the in situ or on site soil often controls the design and ground water drainage of the site. A poorly graded soil will have better drainage than a well graded soil because there are more void spaces in a poorly graded soil.

When a fill material is being selected for a project such as a highway embankment or earthen dam, the soil gradation is considered. A well graded soil is able to be compacted more than a poorly graded soil. These types of projects may also have gradation requirements that must be met before the soil to be used is accepted. 

When options for ground remediation techniques are being selected, the soil gradation is a controlling factor.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10738">'''Solid acid fuel cells''' (SAFCs) are a class of [[fuel cell]]s characterized by the use of a [[solid acid]] material as the electrolyte. Similar to [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s, they extract electricity from the electrochemical conversion of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing gases, leaving only water as a byproduct. Current SAFC systems use hydrogen gas obtained from a range of different fuels, such as industrial-grade propane and diesel. They operate at mid-range temperatures, from 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;Calum R.I. Chisholm, Dane A. Boysen, Alex B. Papandrew, Strahinja Zecevic, SukYal Cha, Kenji A.

==Design==
Solid acids are chemical intermediates between salts and acids, such as CsHSO&lt;sub href="Fuel cell"&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;Sossina M. Haile, Dane A. Boysen, Calum R. I. Chisholm, Ryan B. Merle. "Solid acids as fuel cell electrolytes." Nature 410, 910-913 (19 April 2001). doi:10.1038/35073536.&lt;/ref&gt;  Solid acids of interest for fuel cell applications are those whose chemistry is based on oxyanion groups (SO&lt;sub href="solid acid"&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup href="Proton exchange membrane fuel cell"&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub href="Solid oxide fuel cell"&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;) linked together by hydrogen bonds and charge-balanced by large cation species (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

At low temperatures, solid acids have an ordered molecular structure like most salts. At warmer temperatures (between 140 and 150 degrees Celsius for CsHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered "superprotonic" structures, which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt; When used in fuel cells, this high conductivity allows for efficiencies of up to 50% on various fuels.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;“SAFCell – Oil and Gas.” http://www.safcell.com/oil-gas/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first proof-of-concept SAFCs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate (CsHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; However, fuel cells using acid sulfates as an electrolyte result in byproducts that severely degrade the fuel cell anode, which leads to diminished power output after only modest usage.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;Ryan B. Merle, Calum R. I. Chisholm, Dane A. Boysen, Sossina M. Haile. "Instability of Sulfate and Selenate Solid Acids in Fuel Cell Environments." Energy Fuels, 2003, 17 (1), pp 210–215. DOI: 10.1021/ef0201174&lt;/ref&gt;

Current SAFC systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate (CsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours.&lt;ref name="Five1"&gt;Sossina M.

== Electrode Reactions ==
{{Main article|Fuel_cell#Types_of_fuel_cells.3B_design}}
Hydrogen gas is channeled to the [[anode]], where it is split into protons and electrons. Protons travel through the solid acid electrolyte to reach the [[Cathode]], while electrons travel to the cathode through an external circuit, generating electricity. At the cathode, protons and electrons recombine along with oxygen to produce water that is then removed from the system.

'''Anode''': H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Cathode''': ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

'''Overall''': H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The operation of SAFCs at mid-range temperatures allows them to utilize materials that would otherwise be damaged at high temperatures, such as standard metal components and flexible polymers. These temperatures also make SAFCs tolerant to impurities in their hydrogen source of fuel, such as carbon monoxide or sulfur components. For example, SAFCs can utilize hydrogen gas extracted from propane, natural gas, diesel, and other hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Five2"&gt;Cheap Diesel-Powered Fuel Cells. Bullis, Kevin.

Discovery News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seven2"&gt;Running fuel cells on biodiesel. Claude R. Olsen, Else Lie. October 8, 2010. The Research Council of Norway.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fabrication and Production ==
In 2005, SAFCs were fabricated with thin electrolyte membranes of 25 micrometer thickness, resulting in an eightfold increase in peak power densities compared to earlier models. Thin electrolyte membranes are necessary to minimize the voltage lost due to internal resistance within the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uda|first=Tetsuya|last2=Haile|first2=Sossina M.|date=2005-05-01|title=Thin-Membrane Solid-Acid Fuel Cell|url=http://esl.ecsdl.org/content/8/5/A245|journal=Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=A245–A246|doi=10.1149/1.1883874|issn=1099-0062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Suryaprakash et al. 2014, the ideal solid acid fuel cell anode is a "porous electrolyte nanostructure uniformly covered with a platinum thin film." This group used a method called spray drying to fabricate SAFCs, depositing CsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solid acid electrolyte nanoparticles and creating porous, 3-dimensional interconnected nanostructures of the solid acid fuel cell electrolyte material CsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suryaprakash|first=R.

== Applications ==
Because of their moderate temperature requirements and compatibility with several types of fuel, SAFCs can be utilized in remote locations where other types of fuel cells would be impractical. In particular, SAFC systems for remote oil and gas applications have been deployed to electrify wellheads and eliminate the use of pneumatic components, which vent methane and other potent greenhouse gases straight into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt; A smaller, portable SAFC system is in development for military applications that will run on standard logistic fuels, like marine diesel and JP8.&lt;ref name="Eleven"&gt;SAFCell Inc. awarded Enhancement grant from US Army.

In 2014, a toilet that chemically transforms waste into water and fertilizer was developed using a combination of solar power and SAFCs.&lt;ref name="Twelve"&gt;Solar/Fuel Cell-Powered Caltech-Designed Enviro-Toilet to Debut in India.

The '''Teton–Yellowstone tornado''' was a rare [[high altitude|high-altitude]] [[tornado]] which occurred on July 21, 1987 in the U.S. State of [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; Rated at F4 on the [[Fujita scale]], it was the strongest tornado ever recorded in the state.&lt;ref name=wyo/&gt; It was also the only recorded F4 tornado in Wyoming history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado cut through a {{convert|24|mi|km|adj=on}} long, {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} wide swath of the [[Teton Wilderness]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]], and even crossed the Continental Divide.&lt;ref name=fujita/&gt; The damage occurred at elevations ranging from {{convert|8500|to|10000|ft|m}}, making it the highest altitude violent tornado recorded in the United States.&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt;  No human fatalities or injuries were recorded,&lt;ref name=wyo/&gt; but up to 1,000,000 trees were uprooted by the storm.&lt;ref name=nws/&gt; The F4 rating was based on the severity of the tree damage in the worst affected areas. Huge swaths of trees were flattened, and many were stripped of leaves and limbs, with the trunks debarked. Topsoil was picked up and spattered against the bare trunks. Fujita noted that the tree damage was only comparable to that he had seen associated with some of the tornadoes from the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], as well as the [[April 1977 Birmingham tornado]].&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281989%29117%3C1913%3ATTYTOJ%3E2.0.CO%3B2&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the damaged forest later burned in the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]].&lt;ref name=fujita/&gt;

[[File:Textilbeton1.jpeg|thumb|Close-up of a piece of textile-reinforced concrete]]
'''Textile-reinforced concrete''' is a type of [[reinforced concrete]] in which the usual [[Rebar|steel reinforcing bars]] are replaced by [[textile]] materials. Instead of using a metal cage inside the concrete, this technique uses a fabric cage inside the same.

==Overview==
[[File:3DBewehrung.jpeg|thumb|Glass-fiber structure for use in textile-reinforced concrete]]
Materials with high [[tensile strength]]s with negligible [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]] properties are reinforced with [[woven]] or [[nonwoven]] fabrics. The [[fibres]] used for making the fabric are of high tenacity like [[Jute]], [[Glass Fibre]], [[Kevlar]], [[Polypropylene]], [[Polyamides]] (Nylon) etc. The [[weaving]] of the fabric is done either in a coil fashion or in a layer fashion. Molten materials, [[ceramic]] clays, plastics or cement concrete are deposited on the base fabric in such a way that the inner fabric is completely wrapped with the concrete or plastic.

As a result of this sort of structure the resultant concrete becomes flexible from the inner side along with high strength provided by the outer materials. Various nonwoven structures also get priority to form the base structure. Special types of weaving machines are used to form spiral fabrics and layer fabrics are generally nonwoven.

==Uses==
[[File:TextilbetonArchitektur.jpg|thumb|A building made of textile-reinforced concrete]]
Uses of textile reinforced materials, concretes are extensively increasing in modern days in combination with [[materials science]] and [[textile]] technology. Bridges, Pillars and Road Guards are prepared by kevlar or jute reinforced concretes to withstand vibrations, sudden jerks and [[torsion (mechanics)]].
The use of reinforced concrete construction in the modern world stems from the extensive
availability of its ingredients – reinforcing steel as well as concrete. Reinforced concrete fits
nearly into every form, is extremely versatile and is therefore widely used in the construction
of buildings, bridges, etc. The major disadvantage of RC is that its steel reinforcement is prone
to corrosion. Concrete is highly alkaline and forms a passive layer on steel, protecting it
against corrosion. Substances penetrating the concrete from outside (carbonisation) lowers
the alkalinity over time (depassivation), making the steel reinforcement lose its protection
thus resulting in corrosion. This leads to spalling of the concrete, reducing the permanency of
the structure as a whole and leading to structural failure in extreme cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18295">'''The Open Solar Outdoors Test Field''' (OSOTF) is a project organized under [[open source principles]], which is a fully grid-connected test system that continuously monitors the output of many [[solar photovoltaic modules]] and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings.

==History==
As the [[solar photovoltaic]] industry grows there is an increased demand for high-quality research in solar systems design and optimization in realistic (and sometimes extreme) outdoor environments such as in Canada.&lt;ref name="cangeo"&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jun12/solar_panels.asp Solar panels for all seasons] - Canadian Geographic May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; To answer this need, a partnership has formed the [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] (OSOTF). The OSOTF was originally developed with a strong partnership between the [[Queen's Applied Sustainability Research Group]] run by [[Joshua M. Pearce]] at Queen’s University (now at [[Michigan Tech]]) and the [http://searckingston.ca/ Sustainable Energy Applied Research Centre] (SEARC) at St. Lawrence College headed by Adegboyega Babasola.
This collaboration has grown rapidly to include multiple industry partners and the OSOTF has been redesigned to provide critical data and research for the team.

The OSOTF is a fully grid-connected test system, which continuously monitors the output of over 100 photovoltaic modules and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings. The teamwork has resulted in one of the largest systems in the world for this detailed level of analysis, and can provide valuable information on the actual performance of photovoltaic modules in real-world conditions. Unlike many other projects, the OSOTF is organized under [[open source]] principles.

''All data and analysis when completed will be made freely available to the entire photovoltaic community and the general public.''&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Pearce, Adegboyega Babasola, Rob Andrews, “'''[http://nciia.org/sites/default/files/features/conference/2012/papers/Pearce-Babasola-Andrews-queensu.pdf Open Solar Photovoltaic Systems Optimization]'''” ''Proceedings of the 16th Annual National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance Conference, Open 2012'', pp. 1-7.[https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1555998/Open_Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems_Optimization open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first project for the OSOTF quantifies the losses due to snowfall of a solar photovoltaic system, generalizes these losses to any location with weather data and recommends best practices for system design in snowy climates.&lt;ref name="cangeo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Andrews and Joshua M.

== Open Solar Outdoors Test Field ==
The [[SEARC]] [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] consists of two discreet test beds, the largest of which is located on the roof of the new Wind Turbine and Trades building at St.Lawrence College and which has room for 60 commercial PV panels, which are divided between eight angles of 5.10,15,20,30,40,50 and 60 degrees. Live video for the test field is openly available [https://web.archive.org/web/20120724163417/http://snowstudy.ati.sl.on.ca/ online]. Full data access available [http://www.searckingston.ca/osotf.php  here]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The second test field is located on a flat rooftop at St.Lawrence College and consists of two commercial flat roof ballasted systems. Live video of this test field is also available [https://web.archive.org/web/20120724163342/http://snowstudyballast.ati.sl.on.ca/ online]

In addition the  [[Queen's Innovation Park Test Site]] which was developed as part of a preliminary study on the effects of snow on photovoltaic performance funded by [http://www.sustainableenergy.com/ Sustainable Energy Technologies]. It consists of 16 panels mounted at angles from 0 to 70 degrees, with two each at increments of 10 degrees. By monitoring panel output, solar influx, snow fall and meteorological factors a loss due to snowfall can be determined for a general system at a variety of angles. In addition, thermal panel measurements lead to a better understanding of snow shedding mechanisms. A series of analysis algorithms have been developed which allow for constant data mining to determine factors such as snow coverage ratio using image analysis, performance ratio, and estimated losses/gains due to snowfall. A detailed description of the sensors and measurements used in the study can be seen below.

== Specifications ==
The [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] is designed to be a state-of-the-art outdoors test facility which makes this site one of the premier PV test beds in North America.The capabilities of this test bed are shown in the following table.

'''Wok racing''' has been developed by the German TV host and entertainer [[Stefan Raab]]: Modified [[wok]]s are used to make timed runs down an Olympic [[bobsled]] track. There are competitions for one-person-woksleds and four-person-woksleds, the latter using four woks per sled.

== History ==
Wok racing was inspired by a bet in the German TV show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]''. In November 2003, the ''First official Wok World Championship'' was broadcast from [[Winterberg]]. The immediate success led to the second world championship in [[Innsbruck]] on March 4, 2004. Participants are mostly b-list celebrities like musical artists, actors, and TV hosts, but there are also known athletes that have ongoing professional careers in winter sports, like three-time Olympic [[luge]] champion [[Georg Hackl]] and the [[Jamaican Bobsled Team]].
The third championship took place again in Winterberg on March 5, 2005. In contrast to the previous championships, there were two runs in which all contesters participated. The times of both runs were added. As a further innovation a qualifying round was created in which the participants had to jump from a trickski-jump with woks to determine the starting order. Further the sport event was professionalized.

==Equipment==
[[Image:Wok 2.jpg|175px|left]]
The typical racing woks are the ordinary round-bottomed Chinese pans, usually directly imported from [[China]]. The only modifications are that the bottom is reinforced with an [[epoxy]] filling and the edges of the wok are coated with [[polyurethane]] foam to avoid injuries. Four-person woksleds consist of two pairs of woks, each of them is held together by a rounded frame. The two pairs are connected by a coupling. Due to the rather risky nature of the sport the participants wear heavy protective gear, usually similar to [[ice hockey equipment]]. To further reduce [[friction]] and the risk of injuries, the athletes wear [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]]s under their feet.

To improve performance, the undersides of the woks are often heated with a [[blowlamp]] before the race.

==Advertising controversy==
Public wok Racing is only practiced once a year: The "World Wok Racing Championships" (German: Wok-WM, {{IPA-de|ˈvɔk.veːˌɛm}}, lit. Wok Worldcup) are aired  as special edition of Raab's show ''[[TV total]]'' on the German television channel [[ProSieben]]. The network used to declare these broadcasts as sporting events. Under German law that allowed the network to treat the massive corporate sponsorship of the event as incidental advertising which didn't count against Germany's strict rules regarding time limits for TV commercials. After a Berlin court ruling in 2009, however, the shows have to be labeled as an [[infomercial]], since – unlike a regular sporting event – the races are explicitly staged for the TV broadcast, and there is strong evidence that the profits of the event sponsorship directly benefit the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article2869192/Schleichwerbung-bei-Stefan-Raabs-Wok-WM.html|title=Gerichtsurteil: Schleichwerbung bei Stefan Raabs "Wok WM" - Nachrichten Fernsehen - WELT ONLINE|date=December 12, 2008|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ZubaBox''' is a [[solar-power]]ed [[Internet cafe|internet café]] developed by [[Computer Aid International]]. It is constructed from used shipping containers and consists of a [[Pentium 4]] PC (3&amp;nbsp;GHz+, 3GB RAM, 80GB+ HDD), 11 sets of peripherals (keyboards, mice, monitors), 2 desktop virtualisation cards, a ventilation fan for the server, low-power lights and an advanced [[power inverter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energymatters.com.au/index.php?main_page=news_article&amp;article_id=1958 "Solar Shipping Containers Help Bring Internet to Rural Africa"], ''Energy Matters''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[solar panels]] used are poly-crystalline and the cell batteries are of Advanced Glass Mat type. It is named after the [[Nyanja]] word "Zuba", which means "Sun".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computeraid.org/zubaBox-solar-internet-hub.asp "ZubaBox Solar Internet Hub"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318043455/http://www.computeraid.org/zubaBox-solar-internet-hub.asp |date=March 18, 2013 }}, ''Computer Aid International''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployments ==

=== First Deployment ===

The first ever ZubaBox was deployed in a mission hospital in the village of [[Macha, Zambia]] and is used by the [[Johns Hopkins]] Malaria Research Institute. It is located 70&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest paved road and supports a mesh network with a radius of 1.5&amp;nbsp;km. The ZubaBox in Macha has a rota system which  enables students to use it in the mornings, teachers and nurses to use it for professional training in the afternoon and is then open to adults to use thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Solar-powered-Internet-cafes-link-rural-Africa/-/1248928/1195700/-/item/0/-/5o0q7c/-/index.html "Solar-powered Internet cafés link rural Africa to global village"], ''Business Daily Africa'', 7 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent Deployments ===

Since then, there have been around 10 ZubaBoxes deployed in countries such as [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onwindows.com/Articles/Dell-launches-ZubaBox-in-Nigeria/7874/Default.aspx "Dell launches ZubaBox in Nigeria"], ''On Windows'', 30 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2012/02/07/6102443.htm "Ensoft And Computer Aid Provide Three ZubaBoxes To Rural Zambia, Zimbabwe And Nigeria"], ''Culture Odyssey''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vertatique.com/containerbased-ict-developing-countries "Container-Based ICT For Developing Countries"], ''Vertatique''&lt;/ref&gt;
