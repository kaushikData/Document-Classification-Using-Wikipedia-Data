'''Amalia Kahana-Carmon''' ([[Hebrew]]: עמליה כהנא-כרמון) (born 1926) is an [[Israel]]i author and literary critic. She was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for literature in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kahana-carmon-amalia Jewish Women: Amalia Kahana-Carmon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film industry, a '''bankable star''' is an [[actor]] famous or charismatic enough to be "capable of guaranteeing box-office success simply by showing up in a movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,4909,00.html |title=Survey Says: Hanks Hollywood's Most Bankable Star |author=Daniel Frankel |date=1999-06-14 |publisher=E! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320100935/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0%2C1%2C4909%2C00.html |archivedate=March 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|bankable director}}A '''bankable director''' is a similar notion.

== Overview ==

Media consultant Blake Harris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victorian.fortunecity.com/cloisters/46/ch10.htm|work=The True Art of Screenwriting|author=Blake Harris|title=A Brief Look at the Industry|accessdate=2005-12-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512191946/http://victorian.fortunecity.com/cloisters/46/ch10.htm|archivedate=2006-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that a bankable star is one of the "3 minimum ingredients to any film package." the other two being a successful director and a script or a strong story idea. The involvement of a bankable star in a film gives investors confidence that they will achieve a return on their investments by ensuring that the film is widely distributed and that at least some people will pay to see it (that it will "open").

Harris adds that obtaining a bankable star for a package is not easy because of the dearth of such stars. He states that at any point in time there are no more than "a dozen or so" stars whose mere involvement will ensure that a film will be made.

Analyst Alex Epstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Epstein|title=Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made|publisher=Owl Books|date=2002-10-08|isbn=0-8050-6992-5|url=http://www.craftyscreenwriting.com/hook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that bankable stars or, more generally, "bankable elements" are how "hookless" films (films without a compelling concept that makes people interested in them in their own right) get made. He gives ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' as an example of a movie: the involvement of [[Kevin Costner]] as the bankable star guaranteed that the movie was made. Writer Melissa Robbie{{ref|Robbie}} concurs, stating that some movies are [[high-concept]] (they have what Epstein terms "hooks"), but others are simply [[star vehicle]]s for bankable stars.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has published several results of polls for [[Hollywood]]'s top ten most bankable stars, the most recent three being one in 1999, one in 2002 and the last one in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2005-12-28 |url=http://www.gabrielleluthy.com/highconcept.html |author=Melissa Robbie |title=Find your high concept &amp;mdash; or be left low without one |work=Melbourne Romance Writers Guild articles |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208014440/http://www.gabrielleluthy.com/highconcept.html |archivedate=2005-12-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 survey polled "114 executives at both major studios and independent companies, financiers and various industry players from around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/05/entertainment/main328301.shtml|title=Bankable Stars|date=2002-02-05|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked which stars "did the most to attract financing to a film, ensure its global distribution, and deliver that hugely important opening weekend based on the strength of their good name."

[[James Ulmer (journalist)|James Ulmer]] has compared his list of bankable stars, ''The Ulmer Scale'', to a [[stock market index]]. His criteria for ranking is based on the name of a star alone being able to get people to movie theaters in the United States as well as the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="ulmernpr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129034339 |title=Company Ranks Celebrity Bankability |publisher=NPR |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105130730/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129034339| archivedate= 5 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2010 interview Ulmer described the international movie market as "unfortunately ... pretty sexist"; how a woman's name alone cannot sell a movie, and how female stars are only bankable when cast with a male star or in [[Ensemble cast|ensemble movies]].&lt;ref name="ulmernpr" /&gt;

'''Bussa''', or '''Mossiya''', is a [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language spoken in the [[Dirashe special woreda]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] located in southern [[Ethiopia]]. The people themselves, numbering 18,000 according to the 2007 census, call their language ''Mossittaata''.

Blench (2006) reclassified Bussa from the [[Dullay languages|Dullay]] to Konsoid branch of Cushitic, but left the Mashole, Lohu, and Dobase (D'oopace, D'opaasunte) dialects in Dullay as the [[Dobase language]]. He considers Mashile (Mashelle) to be a distinct language within Konsoid.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List] (ms)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bussa is highly influenced by surrounding [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Omotic languages]] and should be considered endangered according to Gurmu (2005). Speakers of the North Bussa variety are shifting to [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Dirasha language|Dirasha]] or [[Amharic language|Amharic]], whereas speakers of the West Bussa variety are shifting to the Omotic languages Zargulla, [[Zayse]] and [[Gamo-Gofa-Dawro language|Gamo]]. Important factors for the ongoing [[language shift]] include intermarriage with other ethnic groups and heavy contact with neighbouring people.

In [[urban planning]] in the [[United States]], a '''community separator''' (or simply a '''separator''') is a parcel of undeveloped land, sometimes in the form of open space, separating two or more [[urban area]]s under different municipal jurisdictions which has been designated to provide a permanent low-density area preserving the communal integrity of the two municipalities. Separators are typically created by one or more municipalities in situations of rapid [[urban growth]], where unchecked development might otherwise result in the contiguity of the urban areas. A unilateral separator that partially or completely encircles a municipality is commonly known as a [[Green belt|greenbelt]].

Separators often consist of undeveloped [[agriculture|farmland]], [[forest]]s, [[floodplain]]s, or other areas that may or may not be desirable for residential or commercial development. The enactment of a separator is commonly achieved through a variety of different means, including [[conservation easement]]s, outright purchase of land for [[park]]s, or [[zoning]] restrictions. Separators are often enacted along major [[highway]]s connecting municipalities in order to preserve the open [[viewshed]] that provides a natural boundary between two communities.

Separators are sometimes controversial since they can withdraw desirable development land from the [[Economic system|marketplace]], resulting not only in the loss of [[tax]] revenue but also incurring the cost of acquiring and managing the land.

In many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries (e.g.: [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]]) a '''contravention''' is a non-criminal offense, similar to an [[Infraction#United States|infraction]] or [[civil penalty]] in common law countries.

==France==
'''Contravention''' is, in [[Law of France|French law]], an act which violates the [[law]], a treaty or an agreement which the party has made. It designates a minor infraction, as opposed to a [[delict]] or misdemeanor, or a [[felony|crime]].
Any infraction of a law or regulation enforced by the agents of the State executive, that is not punishable by more than a €3000 fine for a person, is considered as a contravention.
The fine may also be accompanied by an additional sentence (peine complémentaire).

===Competence===
Contraventions and their penalties are determined by the executive organs of the French State, unlike délits and [[crimes]] which are determined by the legislative organs (Parliament Senate), as per Article 34 of the [[French Fifth Republic|French Constitution of 1958]].&lt;br /&gt;
The executive organs include:
*The [[President of France|President of the Republic]]
*The government (Cabinet)
*The local government (prefects of regions and departments)
*The department and region Councils
*The police prefect of Paris
*The town Council and Mayor

===Penalties===
As previously stated the maximum fine for an individual is €3000, and the maximum for a corporation or collectivity is €45,000.

The additional penalties are defined in the Article 131-10 of the Code Pénal.
They include:
* [[Prohibition]]s (e.g. prohibition of [[Permanent residency|residency]] in the country (for foreign individuals only), prohibition of civil and family rights)

==Brazil==
In [[Brazil]], contravention is a sort of penal infraction - not only an administrative offense - which is considered to be less serious than a crime.

Since 1941, [[Brazilian Law]] has a dual system which separates penal infractions in two main different acts. They are the Código Penal ([[Brazilian Penal Code]]) - describing crimes in general - and the [[:pt:Contravenção|Lei de Contravenções Penais]] (Penal Contraventions Act) - describing the contraventions.

Contraventions are punished less severely than crimes in Brazilian Law. While crimes may be punished to ''reclusão'' (reclusion) or ''detenção'' (detention), the only kind of possible [[imprisonment]] for contraventions is ''prisão simples'' (simple prison), which is never served under closed conditions (only open ans semi-closed conditions may be applied. Fines may also be imposed due to contravention sentencing.

In Brazilian Law System, one who is already convicted for a crime is not considered to be [[Recidivism|recidivist]] when committing a contravention for the first time, and vice versa.

'''Donald Herbert Davidson''' (March 6, 1917&amp;nbsp;– August 30, 2003) was an [[American philosopher]]. He served as Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at [[Stanford University]], [[Rockefeller University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Chicago]]. Davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Colin. "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n16/colin-mcginn/cooling-it Cooling it]". ''London Review of Books''. 19 August 1993. Accessed 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]]. While Davidson was an [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]], and most of his influence lies in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in [[continental philosophy]] as well, particularly in [[literary theory]] and related areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dasenbrock, Reed Way, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VkpR25ji4-wC Literary Theory After Davidson]''. Penn State Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although published mostly in the form of short, terse essays that do not explicitly rely on any overriding theory, his work is nonetheless noted for a highly unified character, the same methods and ideas brought to bear on a host of apparently unrelated problems, and for synthesizing the work of a great number of other philosophers. He developed an influential [[truth-conditional semantics]], attacked the idea of mental events as governed by strict psychological laws, and rejected the conception of linguistic understanding as having to do with conventions or rules, concluding famously that "there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with." His philosophical work, as a whole, is said to be concerned with how human beings communicate and interact with one another.

==Life and career==
Davidson was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] on March 6, 1917, to Clarence ("Davie") Herbert Davidson and Grace Cordelia Anthony. The family lived in the [[Philippines]] from shortly after Davidson's birth until he was about 4. Then, having lived in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] and [[Philadelphia]], the family finally settled on [[Staten Island]] when Davidson was 9 or 10. He then began to attend public school and had to begin in first grade with much younger children. He then attended the [[Staten Island Academy]], starting in fourth grade.

At [[Harvard University]], he switched his major from English and comparative literature ([[Theodore Spencer]] on [[William Shakespeare]] and the [[Bible]], [[Harry Levin]] on [[James Joyce]]) to [[classics]] and philosophy. Among his influences was [[Alfred North Whitehead]]; Davidson said that "Whitehead took me under his wing; he would invite me to his apartment for afternoon tea all the time."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-ernest-lepore/Davidson_interview.pdf An Interview with Donald Davidson]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1939, with a B.A. ''[[magna cum laude]]''.

Davidson was a pianist and always had an interest in music, later teaching philosophy of music at Stanford. At Harvard, he was in the same class as the conductor and composer [[Leonard Bernstein]], with whom Davidson played [[piano four hands]]. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production which Davidson mounted of [[Aristophanes]]' play ''The Birds'' in the original Greek. Some of the music was later to be reused in Bernstein's ballet ''Fancy Free''.

After graduation, he went to [[California]], where he wrote radio scripts for the private-eye drama ''[[Big Town]]'', starring [[Edward G. Robinson]]. He returned to Harvard on a scholarship in classical philosophy, teaching philosophy and concurrently undergoing the intensive training of [[Harvard Business School]]. Before he had the opportunity to graduate from Harvard Business School, Davidson was called up by the [[US Navy]], for which he had volunteered. He trained pilots to recognize enemy planes and participated in the invasions of Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio.  After three and a half years in the Navy, he tried unsuccessfully to write a novel before returning to his philosophy studies and earning his doctorate in philosophy in 1949 under [[Raphael Demos]] and Donald Williams. [[Plato]]'s ''[[Philebus]]'' was the topic of his dissertation.

Under the influence of [[W. V. O. Quine]], whom he often credited as his mentor, he began to gradually turn toward the more formal methods and precise problems characteristic of [[analytic philosophy]].

In the 1950s, Davidson worked with [[Patrick Suppes]] on developing an experimental approach to [[Decision Theory]].  They concluded that it was not possible to isolate a subject's beliefs and preferences independently of one another so there would always be multiple ways to analyze a person's actions in terms of what they wanted or were trying to do or valued. That result was comparable to Quine's thesis on the [[indeterminacy of translation]] and figured significantly in much of Davidson's later work on philosophy of mind.

His most noted work (see below) was published in a series of essays from the 1960s onward, moving successively through philosophy of action into philosophy of mind and philosophy of language, and dabbling occasionally in aesthetics, philosophical psychology, and the history of philosophy.

Davidson was widely traveled and had a great range of interests he pursued with enormous energy. Apart from playing the piano, he had a pilot's license, built radios, and he was fond of mountain climbing and surfing.

He was married three times. His first wife was the artist Virginia Davidson, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Elizabeth (Davidson) Boyer.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vSzaAAAAQBAJ Donald Davidson: Life and Words]''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his divorce from Virginia Davidson, he married for the second time to Nancy Hirschberg, Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later at Chicago Circle. She died in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bhsclass1955.info/BHS/Hirschberg_Nancy_Grayscale_Full.htm Nancy Ann Hirschberg, In Memoriam, 1937 - 1979]"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Davidson married for the third and last time, to philosopher [[Marcia Cavell]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/donalddavidson.htm In Memoriam: Donald Davidson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226092834/http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/donalddavidson.htm |date=2015-02-26 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

He served terms as president of both the Eastern and Western Divisions of the American Philosophical Association, and held various professional positions at [[Queens College]] (now part of CUNY), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (1961-1967), [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (1967-1970), [[Rockefeller University]] (1970-1976), and the [[University of Chicago]] (1976-1981). From 1981 to his death he was at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor of Philosophy. In 1995, he was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]].

==Philosophical work==

===Actions, reasons, and causes===
Davidson's most noted work began in 1963 with an essay, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," which attempted to refute the prevailing orthodox view, widely attributed to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]{{whom|date=June 2017}} but already present in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'', that an agent's reasons for acting cannot be the causes of his action (Malpas, 2005, §2).  Instead, Davidson argued that, "rationalization (the providing of reasons to explain an agent's actions) is a species of ordinary causal explanation" (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;685). In particular, action ''A'' is explained by what Davidson called a ''primary reason'', which involves a pro-attitude (roughly, a desire) toward some goal ''G'' and an instrumental belief that performing action ''A'' is a means to attaining ''G''. For example, someone's primary reason for taking an umbrella outside on a rainy day might be that wanting to stay dry and believing that taking an umbrella is a means to stay dry today.

This view, which largely conforms to common-sense folk psychology, was held in part on the ground that while causal laws must be strict and deterministic, explanation in terms of reasons need not. Davidson argued that the fact that the expression of a reason was not so precise did not mean that the having of a reason could not itself be a state capable of causally influencing behavior.  Several other essays pursue consequences of this view and elaborate Davidson's theory of actions.

===Mental events===
In "Mental Events" (1970) Davidson advanced a form of token [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] about the mind: token [[mental event]]s are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was that it did not seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that the sky is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain.  Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating ''types'' (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to ''types'' of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything ''more'' than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position [[anomalous monism]]: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from ''a-'', "not," and ''omalos'', "regular") because mental and physical event ''types'' could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).

Davidson argued that anomalous monism [[Logical consequence|follows from]] three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes the ''denial of [[epiphenomenalism]]'', the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a ''nomological view of causation'', according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing the relation between the events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the ''anomalism of the mental'', according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental event types and physical event types. By these three theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a [[supervenience]] relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).

===Truth and meaning===
In 1967 Davidson published "Truth and Meaning," in which he argued that any ''learnable'' language must be statable in a finite form even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions, as may be assumed that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way, it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language that could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms. Following, among others, [[Rudolf Carnap]] (''Introduction to Semantics'', Harvard 1942, 22) Davidson also argued that "giving the meaning of a sentence" was equivalent to stating its truth conditions, so stimulating the modern work on [[truth-conditional semantics]]. To sum up, he proposed that it must be possible to distinguish a finite number of distinct grammatical features of a language, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences making use of that feature. Thus, a finite theory of meaning can be given for a natural language; the test of its correctness is that it would generate (if applied to the language in which it was formulated) all the sentences of the form "'p' is true if and only if p" ("'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white"). (They are called T-sentences: Davidson derives the idea from [[Alfred Tarski]].)

This work was originally delivered in his [[John Locke Lectures]] at Oxford and launched a large endeavor by many philosophers to develop Davidsonian semantical theories for natural language.  Davidson himself contributed many details to such a theory, in essays on quotation, indirect discourse, and descriptions of action.

===Knowledge and belief===
After the 1970s Davidson's philosophy of mind picked up influences from the work of [[Saul Kripke]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Keith Donnellan]], all of whom had proposed a number of troubling counterexamples to what can be generally described as "descriptivist" theories of content. The views, which roughly originate in [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Descriptions]], held that the referent of a name, which object or person the name refers to, is determined by the beliefs a person holds about that object. Kripke et al. argued that this was not a tenable theory, and that in fact whom or what a person's beliefs were about was in large part (or entirely) a matter of how they had acquired those beliefs, and those names, and how if at all the use of those names could be traced "causally" from their original referents to the current speaker.

Davidson picked up this theory, and his work in the 1980s dealt with the problems in relating first-person beliefs to second- and third-person beliefs. It seems that first person beliefs ("I am hungry") are acquired in very different ways from third person beliefs (someone else's belief, of me, that "He is hungry"). How can it be that they have the same content?

Davidson approached the question by connecting it with another one: how can two people have beliefs about the same external object? He offers, in answer, a picture of triangulation: beliefs about oneself, beliefs about other people, and beliefs about the world come into existence jointly.

Many philosophers throughout history had, arguably, been tempted to reduce two of these kinds of belief and knowledge to the other one: [[René Descartes]] and [[David Hume]] thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] (and some would say Wittgenstein, or [[Wilfrid Sellars]]) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]] held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.

===Radical interpretation===
Davidson's work is well noted for its unity, as he has brought a similar approach to a wide variety of philosophical problems. [[Radical interpretation]] is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its [[truth value]], this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.

The significance of this conclusion is that it allows Davidson to draw on the work of [[Alfred Tarski]] in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.

Davidson points out that beliefs and meanings are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true based on what he believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular [[state of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] at a particular time.

Davidson argues that because the language is compositional, it is also [[semantic holism|holistic]]: sentences are based on the meanings of words, but the meaning of a word depends on the totality of sentences in which it appears. That holistic constraint, along with the requirement that the theory of truth is law-like, suffices to minimize indeterminacy just enough for successful communication to occur.

In summary, what radical interpretation highlights is what is necessary and sufficient for communication to occur. The conditions are to recognize speakers ''as'' speakers, their beliefs must be mostly coherent and correct; indeterminacy of meaning does not undermine communication, but it must be constrained just enough.

{{quotation|I conclude that there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with.  We must give up the idea of a clearly defined shared structure which language-users acquire and then apply to cases. And we should try again to say how convention in any important sense is involved in language; or, as I think, we should give up the attempt to illuminate how we communicate by appeal to conventions.|"A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs," Truth and Interpretation|446}}

'''Edgar Raoul-Duval''' (9 April 1832 – 10 February 1887) was a French magistrate and politician who was Representative of Seine-Inférieure and then twice Deputy of Eure. 
He had right-wing views, and for most of his career he was a Bonapartist. He was a passionate orator, but somewhat inconsistent in his politics.

==Early years==

Edgar Raoul Raoul-Duval was born on 9 April 1832 in [[Laon]], Aisne.{{sfn|Edgar, Raoul Raoul-Duval – Assemblée}}
His father was Charles-Edmond Raoul-Duval (1807–93), a senator from 1876 to 1879.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
His father's surname was originally Duval, later changed to Raoul-Duval.
His mother was Octavie Say (1804–65).{{sfn|Pierfit}}
She was the daughter of the economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], and he was the cousin of [[Léon Say]].{{sfn|RAOUL DUVAL (EDGARD) – Le Trombinoscope|p=97}}
He was a Protestant.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
His father and grandfather were both magistrates.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

Raoul-Duval completed his law studies and in 1853 was appointed a substitute magistrate in Nantes at a very early age.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
On 8 January 1857 at Le Havre he married Catherine Foerster (1834–1922).
Their children were Marianne (1857–1940), Valentine (1860–1932), Edmond (1862–1932) and André (1870–1927).{{sfn|Pierfit}}
Edgar Raoul-Duval was in turn advocate-general at Angers, at Bordeaux, and from 1866 to 1870 at Rouen.
He resigned on 4 September 1870 to register at the bar in Rouen as a prelude to entering militant politics.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

==Political career==

Raoul-Duval ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature on 8 February 1871.
He was elected later that year as conservative candidate in a by-election for [[Seine-Inférieure]], where there were four vacant seats.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
He was a representative in the [[National Assembly (1871)|National Assembly]] for Seine-Inférieure from 2 July 1871 to 7 March 1876, and sat with the Union des Droites parliamentary group.{{sfn|Edgar, Raoul Raoul-Duval – Assemblée}}
He later joined the [[Appel au peuple]] group.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

Raoul-Duval was soon one of the most active deputies of the conservative majority and one of its favorite speakers.
He adopted [[Montesquieu]]'s definition, "Freedom is the right to do anything the law does not prohibit."{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
Raoul-Duval was rather inconsistent in his politics.
A critic wrote of him, "M. Raoul Duval has plenty of ''entrain'', of ''élan'', of fire, of repartee, but he lacks the power of continued pursuance of one subject. ... He begins with a good and substantial address; he finishes with  rolling fire of passionate responses to attacks hurled at him."{{sfn|King|1876|pp=173–174}}
Raoul-Duval was responsible for forcing the retirement from office of the Minister of the Interior, [[Victor Lefranc]].{{sfn|King|1876|pp=175–176}}
He did not succeed in an attack on the treaty [[Adolphe Thiers]] had made with Germany after the [[Franco-Prussian War]].{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

In 1872 Raoul-Duval intervened in several important debates.
On economic questions Raoul Duval always defended the principles of free trade.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
He opposed the first constitutional laws and the "great council" proposed by [[Albert, 4th duc de Broglie|Albert de Broglie]], and also fought the proposal to extend the powers of [[Marshal MacMahon]] for seven years.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
He once said that any person who ventured to hint at dissolution was fit to be classed with Communists.{{sfn|King|1876|p=177}}
However, several times between 1873 and 1875, when he sat with the Bonapartist group, he called for the dissolution of the Chamber.
He demanded a plebiscite to sanction the constitution, and voted against the constitutional laws on 25 February 1875.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

In the 1876 legislative elections Raoul-Duval ran both in the 8th arrondissement of Paris and in the [[Louviers]] district of Eure.
He failed in Paris but was elected in the second round in Louviers.
He rejoined the Bonapartist group.
He was rapporteur of the budget of the navy and colonies for 1877, and intervened several times in the budget discussions.
After the [[16 May 1877 crisis]] he was one of 11 deputies who abstained from the vote of confidence requested by the Broglie ministry.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
He held office until 25 June 1877.{{sfn|Edgar, Raoul Raoul-Duval – Assemblée}}
In the elections of 14 October 1877 after the dissolution of the House he was defeated in his attempt to be reelected in Louviers.
He tried again on 21 August 1881, but was again defeated.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}

Raoul-Duval won in a by-election on 25 May 1884 in the [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]] district of Eure to replace Eugène Janvier de La Motte&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Eugène Janvier de La Motte (1823-1884)|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;, who had died.
On 4 October 1885 he was elected on the conservative list of the Eure department.
He broke with the Bonapartists.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
In mid-1886 he proposed to [[Lucien Millevoye]] that a broad conservative coalition should be formed that would include conservative republicans and Protestants.
The idea was discussed vaguely by the conservatives but did not have much effect.
Most monarchists were not interested apart from a small clique of business-related northern deputies.{{sfn|Fuller|2012|p=50}}
In 1886 Raoul-Duval was a member of the Central Committee of the newly founded French Association for the Propagation of Volapük.{{sfn|Members du Comité Central – Le Volapük|p=3}}
The association was authorized on 8 April 1886 as a union of French enthusiasts of the [[Volapük]] constructed language.{{sfn|Members du Comité Central – Le Volapük|p=2}}

Due to poor health Raoul-Duval went to [[Monte Carlo]] in December 1886, where he died of a chill on 10 February 1887 at the age of 54.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1889–1891}}
A bronze statue of Edgar Raoul-Duval was erected in 1890 in [[Notre-Dame-du-Vaudreuil]], Eure.{{sfn|Perchet|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11564">In [[Thailand]], as elsewhere, one can find several different gender roles, identities and diverse visual markers of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. The demand for positive self-identity is growing in Thailand and support is growing.&lt;ref name="Jackson-1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter A.|title=Thai research on male homosexuality and transgenderism and the cultural limits of Foucaultian analysis|jstor=3704488|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=1997-07-08|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|52-85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Peter A. Jackson|url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/jackson-pa|website=Australian National University|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the identities oddly use English terms that are ''overloaded'' (reassigned meanings).

==Heterosexual/Traditional==
===Male===
A heterosexual male is the only sexuallity, which refers not just to physical sex but gender identity as well.  Note this may differ from Western ideas of heterosexual male, to which ''lesbian sex'' has been eroticized.  This means he seeks a traditional Thai female, but does not accept as a sexual or marriage partner the other female gender identities listed below.

===Female===
A heterosexual female refers to the traditional female who seeks the traditional heterosexual male (''man'') in Thai society.

==The Tom-Dee identity==
The Tom-Dee duality in Thailand maybe be compared to the [[butch and femme|butch]]-[[butch and femme|fem]] duality of [[lesbianism]] but differs in a number of ways.&lt;ref name="coconuts12315"/&gt;  Among them are ''1-way'' and ''2-way'' subcategories in both, and in Toms physical presentation that may be compared to [[transgender men]] and a sense of role and duty of living up to strict stereotypes associated with [[gentleman]].&lt;ref name="coconuts12315"/&gt;

===Tom identity===
A "tom" (ทอม), from the English word ''tomboy'', is a female who dresses, acts, and possibly speaks in a masculine fashion. She may not identify as a [[lesbian]], but she may be perceived as one by others. Toms wear short hair, a deviation from traditional Thai culture which prizes long hair as a sign of feminine beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chami Jotisalikorn|date=2006|title=Thailand's Luxury Spas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRHRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-7946-0341-0|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women usually wear skirts in Thailand, and in many government offices skirts are compulsory and pants suits banned. Toms dress in men's clothing—slacks, sandals, and loose fitting button-down shirts. According to [[Ara Wilson]], a tom will use male speech terms, especially the old, now-crude pronouns "goo" (Thai: กู) and "mueng" (Thai: เม็ง / มึง).&lt;ref name="Wilson-2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ara|last=Wilson|title=The Intimate Economies of Bangkok: Economies of Bangkok Tomboys, Tycoons, and Avon Ladies in the Global City|date=July 2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520239685|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520239685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Benjawan Poomsan|title=Thai for Intermediate Learners|date=1998|publisher=Paiboon Poomsan Publishing|location=Bangkok|isbn=1887521011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|127,131}}

===Dee identity===
The "dee" (ดี้), from the English word ''lady'', is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] (or [[bisexuality|bisexual]]) female who follows outward Thai gender norms. A dee will look, act, and speak in a manner congruent with Thai female gender norms. The only difference between dees and traditional females is that dee often engage in relationships with toms.&lt;ref name="Wilson-2004" /&gt;  Some dees however, seek other dees.

===Tom-dee within society===
Heterosexual public displays of affection are frowned upon in Thai culture. However, minor displays of affection, such as hand-holding, between same sex individuals is considered the norm. In this way tom-dee partnerships can be invisible to the wider society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jody Houton|date=2016|title=A Geek in Thailand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4C4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-4448-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tom Gay===
A Tom Gay is a Tom who is attracted to all 3 types of women, heterosexual women, Toms, and Dees.&lt;ref name="nextshark"&gt;http://nextshark.com/thailand-18-different-gender-identities/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbian===
A lesbian in Thai culture differs from the West, i.e. a woman who is attracted to the traditional gender adhering Thai female.&lt;ref name="nextshark"/&gt;

===Female roles visavis identity===
Within the female community, there are roles which complicate identity.  Particular among them are ''one-way'' and ''two-way'', which refer to the perceived permanent sexual roles of ''giver'' and ''receiver and giver'', respectively, but taking on a broader meaning than merely sex.  A 1-way tom would see it fit to ''take care'' of the female both materially (pay for everything) and psychologically, but not accept the same in return.  Conversely, the terms ''king'' and ''queen'' refer to active or receptive roles, yet can also be situational rather than an identity.  The same terms ''king'' and ''queen'' are used for male homosexual roles.  Toms may seek dees or toms (specialists referred to as''Tom Gay King''), toms may be 1-way or 2-way.  Dees may seek toms or dees.&lt;ref name="coconuts12315"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUagSrRd6kI&amp;feature=youtu.be YouTube video,Coconuts Media (documentary),Toms: The Complex World of Female Love in Thailand Published on Jan 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam===
An ''Adam'' is a male who is attracted to Toms.&lt;ref name="nextshark"/&gt;

==Kathoeys==
{{main article|Kathoey}}
Although the terms "[[kathoey]]"&lt;ref name=Wictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=kathoey |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kathoey|website=Wiktionary| accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "ladyboy"&lt;ref name=Ladyboy&gt;{{cite web|title=ladyboy|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ladyboy|website=Wiktionary|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are rather ambiguous, simply put, both terms refer to someone assigned male at birth, who dresses as and adopts the mannerisms and identity of a woman. Though the term is often translated as "transgender", the term is rarely used in Thailand. Instead Thais use the term [[kathoey]]. This term can now also be used to refer to any male homosexual and was originally used to refer to [[intersex]] people. Due to this term becoming so broad, many choose to use the English word to explain a homosexual male dressing as a woman as a "ladyboy".&lt;ref name="Winter-2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winter|first1=Sam|last2=Udomsak|first2=Nuttawut|title=Male, Female and Transgender : Stereotypes and Self in Thailand|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|date=2002|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://www.transgenderasia.org/paper_male_female.htm|accessdate=29 November 2015|issn=1434-4599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be meant as an insult, especially to those who are trying to alter or openly express their identity, as it suggests that they are still men who are merely dressed as women.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The term is used rather loosely at times and can be used to refer to any male who possesses traditionally 'feminine' qualities.

===Acceptance of kathoeys===
Kathoeys are numerous in Thailand and are seemingly accepted by society, not only in the cities but in the countryside as well.&lt;ref name=Michaelson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michaelson|first1=Jay|title=Thailand’s Transgender People Aren’t Just ‘Ladyboys’ Anymore|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/08/the-best-place-to-be-trans-is-a-dictatorship.html|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=The Daily Beast|date=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai Buddhism does not specifically regard homosexuality as a sin and has no specific prohibitions regarding the lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Jackson-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter A.|title=Performative Genders, Perverse Desires: A Bio-History of Thailand's Same-Sex and Transgender Cultures|journal=Intersections: Gender, History, and Culture in the Asian Context|date=August 2003|issue=9|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue9/jackson.html|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acceptance of kathoeys is still grudging in many corners of Thai society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/pc-air-transgender-flight-attendants|title=Flying the flag for ladyboys: Thai airline takes on transgender flight attendants|date=2012-01-17|work=The Guardian|last1=Hodal|first1=Kate|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathoey have not yet attained equal status with those who are not transgender, and restrictions come with the identity. Kathoey cannot officially change their birth sex on birth certificates or passports, meaning they cannot marry someone of the same sex (even if they identify with a different gender).&lt;ref name="Jackson-1999" /&gt;{{RP|121-138}}

Though kathoeys have experienced some prestige in the past, they still face many struggles in everyday life.  Many have found success in the entertainment business or in fashion, while others dance cabaret or accept lower level work so that they are able to live their lives in the open.&lt;ref name="Winter-2002" /&gt; Beginning in the 1950s we are able to see a presence of kathoey and it can be traced in the media. The trend of kathoeys being a regular part of entertainment such as movies, music entertainment, and television shows is rather recent.&lt;ref name="Jackson-2003" /&gt;

'''Gwilym Arthur Edwards''' (31 May 1881 – 5 October 1963) was a [[Presbyterian Church of Wales|Welsh Presbyterian]] minister and writer on theological topics.  He was Principal of the [[United Theological College Aberystwyth]] from 1939 to 1949.

==Life and career==
Edwards was born in [[Caernarfon]], [[Gwynedd]] in north Wales.  His father, Owen Edwards, a [[Presbyterian]] minister, emigrated to Australia for health reasons, but his wife Mary died before she could join him with the children.  Edwards was then brought up by his maternal grandparents in [[Dolgellau]], and was educated at the county school there before studying at the [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]].  He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1903, and later studied at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] (graduating from there in 1908).  He had begun preaching at an early age and was ordained in 1909, serving firstly at Zion chapel in [[Carmarthen]].  Between 1911 and 1917, he was minister at a chapel in [[Oswestry]]; he also worked in chapels in [[Chester]] (1917 to 1923) and [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] (1923 to 1928).  Edwards was then appointed professor at [[Bala College]] in 1929, before becoming Principal of the [[United Theological College Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth Theological College]] in 1939.  After retiring in 1949 he moved back to Oswestry. In 1957 he was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Wales.  He died on 5 October 1963 and was buried in [[Llanycil]], Gwynedd.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

==Works==
Edwards lectured and wrote extensively for the periodicals of the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales|Welsh Presbyterian church]].  He wrote books in Welsh on the Bible and on Christian doctrine, a history of civilisationand a history of Bala College.  He also wrote two volumes of stories for children in Welsh and a syllabus for religious instruction in Welsh schools. A pamphlet he wrote on Sunday School teachers and world peace was published by the United Nations in 1934.  He was described as a "scholar with a clear, analytical mind" who paid "great attention to detail".&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-EDWA-ART-1881.html|title=Edwards, Gwilym Arthur (1881&amp;ndash;1963), minister (Presb.), principal of the Theological College, Aberystwyth, and author|last=Roberts|first=Gomer Morgan|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="589">'''Head of navigation''' is the farthest point above the mouth of a [[river]] that can be navigated by [[ship]]s.  Determining the head of navigation can be subjective on many streams, as this point may vary greatly with the size of the ship being contemplated for navigation and the seasonal water level.  On others, it is quite objective, being caused by a [[waterfall]] or a [[dam]] without navigation [[Canal lock|locks]]. Several rivers in a region may have their heads of navigation along a line called the [[Fall line]].

The '''Het''' were the people of the northern [[Patagonia]]n [[pampas]] west of the [[Paraná River]]: The '''Chechehet''', the '''Diuihet''' {{sc|aka}} '''Didiuhet''', and the '''Taluhet'''. The easternmost Didiuhet, near modern [[Buenos Aires]] and influenced by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]], were called the [[Querandí]] (see).&lt;ref&gt;Th. Falkner: ''A description of Patagonia and the adjoining parts of South America'', 1774&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if these three peoples were related linguistically or only culturally. 

The Het were neighbored on the north by the [[Charrúa people|Chaná]], on the northwest and west by the [[Mapuche people|Mapuche]], and on the south by the [[Puelche people|Puelche]]. 

From north to south, the Het peoples were,
*The Taluhet occupied the modern provinces of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] in the east, [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] in the west.
*The Diuihet (Divihet, Didiuhet, Diliuhet) inhabited the coastal region between the [[Río de la Plata|La Plata]] and Paraná rivers in [[Buenos Aires Province]],  southern Santa Fe, and inland through [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] and as far as [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]].
*The Chechehet lived as far south as the mouths of the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]] and [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] rivers in southern Buenos Aires Province.

== Language ==
The Het population was decimated by the end of the eighteenth century by epidemics, which facilitated the Mapuche absorption of its territory and its survivors rapid [[Araucanization]] at the cultural level that consolidated them into the Puelche.  For this reason it is today difficult to find evidence of the Het languages. Of Querandí (Diuihet) we only have two sentences and a few words, recorded by French sailors around 1555. Based on this admittedly inadequate data, Viegas Barros showed that Querandí may have been closely related to [[Puelche language|Puelche]].&lt;ref&gt;Viegas Barros, P. 1992. "La familia lingüística tehuelche. ''Revista patagónica''. 13. 54:39–46. Buenos Aires.&lt;/ref&gt; Viegas Barros (2005) further attempted to demonstrate that Puelche is more distantly related to the [[Chon languages]] to its south.

==Application==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}} &lt;!--No sources cited. --&gt;
A [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.

For example:  &lt;!-- Don't add examples, these demonstrate the concept sufficiently --&gt;
* You call that a hat‽
* You're dying‽
* What are those‽


Writers using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis, however this is regarded as poor style in formal writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Punctuation.html?page=2 Punctuation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154718/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Punctuation.html?page=2 |date=April 2, 2015 }}.

==History==
[[File:interrobang.svg|thumb|left|75px|An interrobang in the [[Palatino]] [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] font]]

Historically writers have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''What the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It'' (headline from ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', May 9, 1936)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Invention===
American Martin K. Speckter (1915 – February 14, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Martin K. Speckter, 73, Creator of Interrobang|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/16/obituaries/martin-k-speckter-73-creator-of-interrobang.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320015031/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/16/obituaries/martin-k-speckter-73-creator-of-interrobang.html|archivedate=March 20, 2016|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=16 February 1988|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an [[advertising agency]], Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if [[Copywriting|copywriters]] conveyed surprised [[rhetorical question]]s using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine ''TYPEtalks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spekter, Martin K. |title=Making a New Point, or, How About That&amp;nbsp;…|journal=TYPEtalks|date=March–April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included ''exclamaquest'', ''QuizDing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Garfield|title=Just My Type: A Book About Fonts|location=London|publisher=Profile|year=2010|isbn=9781846683015 |page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''rhet'', and ''exclarotive'', but he settled on ''interrobang''. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: ''interrogatio'' is [[Latin]] for "[[rhetorical question]]" or "[[cross-examination]]";&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Gideon O. [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/I/interrogatio.htm interrogatio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119182734/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/figures/I/interrogatio.htm |date=November 19, 2005 }}. Silva Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric. [[Brigham Young University]]. Accessed August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''bang'' is [[printer (publisher)|printers]]' slang for the exclamation mark. [[Graphic design|Graphic treatments]] for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.&lt;ref name=fonthaus&gt;Haley, Allan. {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507055249/http://www.fonthaus.com/xheight/interrobang.cfm|title=The Interrobang Is Back|url=http://www.fonthaus.com/xheight/interrobang.cfm|date=June 2001|publisher=fonthaus.com|archivedate=May 7, 2008|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early interest===

In 1965, [[Richard Isbell]] created the [[Americana (typeface)|Americana]] typeface for [[American Type Founders]] and included the interrobang as one of the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Houston |first1=Keith |title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, &amp; Other Typographical Marks |date=2013 |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some [[Remington Rand|Remington]] [[typewriter]]s. In the 1970s, replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces were available for some [[Smith-Corona]] typewriters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/rpforwarded/Home/interrobang1.jpg Smith-Corona flyer illustrating the Changeable Type system with an exclamation mark / interrobang unit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326214527/http://sites.google.com/site/rpforwarded/Home/interrobang1.jpg |date=March 26, 2009 }} Accessed March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s; the word ''interrobang'' appeared in some [[dictionary|dictionaries]], and the mark was used in magazine and newspaper articles.&lt;ref name=fonthaus /&gt;

===Continued support===
Most fonts do not include the interrobang, but it has not disappeared: [[Lucida Grande]], the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[OS X]] operating system, includes the interrobang, and [[Microsoft]] provides several versions of the interrobang in the [[Wingdings|Wingdings 2]] character set (on the right [[bracket]] and [[tilde]] keys on US keyboard layouts), included with [[Microsoft Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interrobang-mks.com/ The Interrobang: A Twentieth Century Punctuation Mark.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013080952/http://www.interrobang-mks.com/ |date=October 13, 2004 }} Accessed August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was accepted into [[Unicode]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf |title=Unicode Code Charts, General Punctuation, 2000–206F |format=PDF |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804231917/http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf |archive-date=August 4, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is included in several fonts, including [[Lucida Sans Unicode]], [[Arial Unicode MS]], and [[Calibri]], the default font in the [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]], [[Microsoft Office 2010|2010]], and [[Microsoft Office 2013|2013]] suites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2005/12/22/506936.aspx MSDN fontblog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307025631/http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2005/12/22/506936.aspx |date=March 7, 2010 }}. Accessed August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inverted interrobang== &lt;!-- courtesy comment per [[WP:RSECT]]: [Inverted question and exclamation marks#Mixtures of question marks and exclamation points]] links here. --&gt;
A reverse and upside down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Asturian language|Asturian]], which use [[inverted question and exclamation marks]], is called an "inverted interrobang" or a ''gnaborretni'' (''interrobang'' written backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf |title=Unicode Code Charts, Supplemental Punctuation, 2E00–2E7F |format=PDF |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812080522/http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (''¿¡De verdad!?'' or ''¡¿De verdad?!'' [''Really!?'']).&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española|RAE]]'s [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=interrogaci%F3n%20y%20exclamaci%F3n%20(signos%20de)#3 Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: ''¡Verdad?'' or ''¿Verdad!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Buen |first=Jorge |title=Manual de diseño editorial |edition=3rd |publisher=Trea |location=Gijón |year=2008 |isbn=978-84-9704-378-6}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entering and display==
The interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern [[typeface]]s or fonts include a [[glyph]] for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at [[Unicode]] code point {{unichar|203D|Interrobang|html=}}.  The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point {{unichar|2E18|inverted interrobang}}.&lt;ref name="Everson-Unicode"&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]].

The interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code {{key press|Alt|8253}} when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an [[operating system]] that performs [[font substitution]].

Depending on the browser and the fonts installed by the user, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be replaced with a character of a different font.

On a [[Linux]] system supporting the [[Compose key]], an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang.  On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination {{keypress|control|cmd|Space}}.

The interrobang can be displayed in [[LaTeX]] by using the package textcomp and the command \textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \textinterrobangdown.

'''Kanakanavu''' (also spelled '''Kanakanabu''') is a Southern [[Tsouic language]] is spoken by the [[Kanakanavu people]], an [[indigenous people]] of [[Taiwan]] (see [[Taiwanese aborigines]]). It is a [[Formosan language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.

The Kanakanavu live in the two villages of Manga and Takanua in [[Namasia District]] (formerly Sanmin Township), [[Kaohsiung]].{{sfnp|Zeitoun|Teng|2014|loc=[http://iscll-14.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files-pdf/Papers/Session6/ZeitounTeng.pdf abstract]}}

The language is considered to be moribund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3236 Did you know Kanakanabu is critically endangered? (n.d.). Retrieved April 15, 2016, from http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3236]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The native Kanakanavu speakers were [[Taiwanese aboriginals]] living on the islands. Following the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch Colonial Period]] in the 17th century, [[Han-Chinese]] immigration began to dominate the islands population. The village of [[Takanua]] is a village assembled by [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rulers]] to relocate various aboriginal groups in order to establish easier dominion over these groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/ethnographic-situation.html https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/setting-of-language/ethnographic-situation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language Description ==
There are 14 different consonant phonemes, containing only voiceless plosives within Kanakanavu. Adequate descriptions of liquid consonants become a challenge within Kanakanavu. It also contains 6 vowels plus [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s. Vowel length is often not clear if distinctive or not, as well as speakers pronouncing vowel phonemes with variance. As most [[Austronesian]] and [[Formosan languages|Formosan]] languages, Kanakanavu has the syllable structure '''C''' '''V'''. Very few, even simple words, contain less than three to four syllables.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/system-of-language/distinctive-system-2/phonology.html https://www2.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/Vgl_SW/kanakanavu/language-description/system-of-language/distinctive-system-2/phonology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4482">The [[mathematician]] [[Irving Kaplansky]] is notable for proposing numerous [[conjecture]]s in several branches of [[mathematics]], including a list of ten conjectures on [[Hopf algebra]]s. They are usually known as '''Kaplansky's conjectures'''.

==Kaplansky's conjectures on group rings==
Let ''K'' be a field, and ''G'' a [[torsion-free group]]. Kaplansky's zero divisor conjecture states that the [[group ring]] ''K''[''G''] does not contain nontrivial [[zero divisor]]s, that is, it is a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]. Two related conjectures are:

* ''K''[''G''] does not contain any non-trivial units – if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''1''}} in ''K''[''G''], then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''k''.''g''}} for some ''k'' in ''K'' and ''g'' in ''G''.
* ''K''[''G''] does not contain any non-trivial idempotents – if {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''1''}} or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''0''}}.

The zero-divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture and is implied by the unit conjecture. As of 2017 all three are open, though there are positive solutions for large classes of groups for both the idempotent and zero-divisor conjectures. For example the zero-divisor conjecture is known to hold for all [[virtually]] [[Solvable group|solvable]] groups and more generally also for all residually torsion-free solvable groups. These solutions go through establishing first the conclusion to the [[Atiyah conjecture]] on &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers, from which the zero-divisor conjecture easily follows. 

The idempotent conjecture has a generalisation, the [[Richard Kadison|Kadison]] idempotent conjecture, also known as the Kadison&amp;ndash;Kaplansky conjecture, for elements in the [[group algebra#The group C*-algebra C*(G)|reduced group C*-algebra]]. In this setting it is known that if the [[Farrell–Jones conjecture]] holds for ''K''[''G''] then so does the idempotent conjecture. The latter has been positively solved for an extremely large class of groups, including for example all [[hyperbolic group]]s. 

The unit conjecture is also known to hold in many groups but its partial solutions are much less robust than the other two: for example there is a torsion-free 3-dimensional [[crystallographic group]] for which it is not known whether all units are trivial. This conjecture is not known to follow from any analytic statement as the other two, and so the cases where it is known to hold have all been established via a direct combinatorial approach involving the so-called unique products property.

==Kaplansky's conjecture on Banach algebras==
This conjecture states that every [[algebra homomorphism]] from the [[Banach algebra]] ''C''(''X'') (continuous complex-valued functions on ''X'', where ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]) into any other Banach algebra, is necessarily [[continuous function|continuous]]. The conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every algebra norm on ''C''(''X'') is equivalent to the usual [[uniform norm]]. (Kaplansky himself had earlier shown that every ''complete'' algebra norm on ''C''(''X'') is equivalent to the uniform norm.)

In the mid-1970s, H. Garth Dales and J. Esterle independently proved that, ''if one furthermore assumes'' the validity of the [[continuum hypothesis]], there exist compact Hausdorff spaces ''X'' and discontinuous homomorphisms from ''C''(''X'') to some Banach algebra, giving counterexamples to the conjecture.

In 1976, [[Robert M. Solovay|R. M. Solovay]] (building on work of H. Woodin) exhibited a model of ZFC ([[Zermelo&amp;ndash;Fraenkel set theory]] + [[axiom of choice]]) in which Kaplansky's conjecture is true. Kaplansky's conjecture is thus an example of a [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC|statement undecidable in ZFC]].

[[File:Lolwut cat.jpg|thumb|A [[lolcat]] using "LOL"]]

'''LOL''', or '''lol''', is an initialism for '''laugh(ing) out loud'''&lt;ref name="Haig2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franzini2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Egan2004" /&gt; and a popular element of [[Internet slang]]. It was first used almost exclusively on [[Usenet]], but has since become widespread in other forms of [[computer-mediated communication]] and even [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] communication. It is one of many [[initialism]]s for expressing bodily reactions, in particular [[laughter]], as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as '''LMAO'''&lt;ref name=NetlingoLMAO/&gt; ("laugh(ing) my ass off") and '''ROFL'''&lt;ref name=Goudelocke2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hershock2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shortis2001/&gt; (or its older form '''ROTFL''';&lt;ref name=RaymondSteele1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsCummiungs1993/&gt; "roll(ing) on the floor laughing"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly [[obsolete]] "lots of luck" or "lots of love" used in letter-writing.&lt;ref name=AHD1/&gt;

The list of [[acronym]]s "grows by the month",&lt;ref name=Hershock2003/&gt; and they are collected along with [[emoticon]]s and [[smiley]]s into [[folklore|folk]] dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=Jones1998/&gt; These initialisms are controversial, and several authors&lt;ref name=LacettiStevens2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIT2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=FondillerNerone2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=YunkerBarry2006/&gt; recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.

==Analysis==

Laccetti (professor of humanities at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]]) and Molski, in their essay entitled ''The Lost Art of Writing'', are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, "Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms."&lt;ref name=LacettiStevens2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIT2003/&gt; Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that "professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and abbreviations, stating that they are "no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication".&lt;ref name=FondillerNerone2007/&gt;

Linguist John McWhorter stated, "Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles…" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as ''oh'' in "Oh, I don’t know" and ''uh'' when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that ''lol'' is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWhorter|first1=John|title=Txtng is killing language. JK!!!|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/john_mcwhorter_txtng_is_killing_language_jk/transcript?language=en#t-485351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through [[podcast]]ing have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are "often misunderstood" by students and are "difficult to decipher" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of "ROFL" as not obviously being the abbreviation of "rolling on ''the'' floor laughing" (emphasis added).&lt;ref name=YunkerBarry2006/&gt; Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN{{dubious|reason=Never, ever used|date=September 2015}} ("bye for now") and IMHO ("in my honest/humble opinion"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that "as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing".&lt;ref name=Haig2001/&gt; Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms "save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver" and that "[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings"; he advises that they be used "only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning".&lt;ref name=Bidgoli2004/&gt;

Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of "annotating text with stage directions".&lt;ref name=Shortis2001/&gt; Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between ''telling'' someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor."&lt;ref name=Hershock2003/&gt;

[[David Crystal]] notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question "How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?".&lt;ref name=Crystal2001/&gt; Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.&lt;ref name=Franzini2002/&gt;

[[Victoria Clarke]], in her analysis of [[telnet]] talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that "a user who types ''LOL'' may well be laughing louder than one who types ''lol''", and opines that "these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse".&lt;ref name=Clarke2002/&gt; Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence.&lt;ref name=Egan2004/&gt; June Hines Moore shares that view.&lt;ref name=Moore2007/&gt; So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, "or you won't be LOL".&lt;ref name="Lindsell-Roberts2004"/&gt;

==Acceptance==
On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], was formally recognized in an update of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="omglol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moorestown.patch.com/articles/omg-kids-imho-needs-to-go|title=OMG, K.I.D.S., IMHO, Needs to Go |author=Marsia Mason|date=April 4, 2011 |publisher=Moorestown Patch|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for "little old lady" in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/public/latest/latest-update/|title=New initialisms in the OED|author=Graeme Diamond|date=March 24, 2011|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of "Laughing Out Loud" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12893416|title=Why did LOL infiltrate the language?|author=James Morgan|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriella Coleman]] references "lulz" extensively in her anthropological studies of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Quinn|title=Why Do Anonymous Geeks Hate Scientologists?|url=https://gizmodo.com/5590049/why-do-anonymous-geeks-hate-scientologists|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Gabriella|title=Our Weirdness Is Free: The logic of Anonymous — online army, agent of chaos, and seeker of justice|url=http://canopycanopycanopy.com/15/our_weirdness_is_free|publisher=Triple Canopy|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study of college students by [[Naomi Baron]] found that the use of these initialisms in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), specifically in [[instant messaging]], was actually ''lower'' than she had expected. The students "used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total;&lt;ref name=Philipkoski2005/&gt; 76 were occurrences of ''LOL''.&lt;ref name=Baron2005/&gt;

''LOL'', ''ROFL'', and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of ''LOL'', ''ROFL'', and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of [[movable type]] in the 15th century—states that this is "a brand new variety of language evolving", invented by young people within five years, that "extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language".&lt;ref name=Ulaby2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Philipkoski2005/&gt; However [[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoffrey K. Pullum]] argues that even if interjections such as ''LOL'' and ''ROFL'' were to become very common in spoken English, their "total effect on language" would be "utterly trivial".&lt;ref name=Pullum2005/&gt;

==Variations on the theme==
===Variants===
* '''[[wikt:lul|lul]]''': phonetic spelling of LOL. "LUL" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on [[Twitch.tv]], which shows a picture of [[TotalBiscuit]]'s face laughing.
* '''[[wikt:lolz|lolz]]''': Occasionally used in place of LOL.
* '''[[wikt:lulz|lulz]]''': Often used to denote [[Schadenfreude|laughter at someone who is the victim]] of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' article about [[Internet trolling]], "''lulz'' means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium."&lt;ref name=Schwartz2008/&gt;  Can be used as a noun – e.g. "do it for the lulz.", shortened into "ftlulz" (to distinguish it from "ftl" – "for the loss"). See also [[LulzSec]].
* '''LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL''': For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of "OL".  In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., "Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud"), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row.
* '''trolololol''' or '''trollololol''': A portmanteau of [[Internet troll|troll]] and LOL iterated. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as [[internet trolling]]. See also [[Mr. Trololo]].

===Derivations===
* '''[[wikt:lolwut|lolwut]]''' (sometimes "lulwut"): [[wikt:lol|lol]] + [[wikt:wut|wut]], used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion.
* '''lawl''', '''lawlz''', or '''lal''': Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying "lawl" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL, and is not meant to express laughter.
* '''lel''': A satirical form of lol, often used to denote bemusement or lack of amusement in response to a statement. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A popular [[glitch]] in the [[Microsoft Sam]] text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when 'SOI' is entered, and the phrase 'My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi..." is often associated with the term as a result.
* '''[[wikt:PMSL|PMSL]]''': For "pissing myself laughing".

=== Commonly used equivalents in other languages ===

In some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic [[wikt:لول|لول]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] [[wikt:ru:лол|лол]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Pre-dating the [[Internet]] and [[Text messaging|phone texting]] by a century, the way to express laughter in [[morse code]] is "hi hi". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.&lt;ref name=Dinkins2010a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dinkins2010b/&gt;

&lt;!-- WARNING: This article is not a dumping ground for arbitrary variations. Any variation added here MUST already have a Wiktionary article, and satisfy the Wiktionary criteria for inclusion as a word. --&gt;
Most of these variants are usually found in lowercase.

* [[wikt:555|555]]: the [[Thai language|Thai]] variation of LOL. "5" in Thai is pronounced "ha", three of them being "hahaha".
* [[wikt:asg|asg]]: [[Swedish language|Swedish]] abbreviation of the term ''asgarv'', meaning intense laughter.
* [[wikt:g|g]]: [[Danish language|Danish]] abbreviation of the word ''griner'', which means "laughing" in Danish.&lt;ref name=Elkan2009/&gt;
* ha3: [[Malaysia]]n variation of LOL. ''ha3'' means pronouncing ''ha'' three times, "hahaha".

* jejeje: in the [[Philippines]] is used to represent "hehehe". "j" in Filipino languages is pronounced as [[/h/]], derived from the Spanish [[/x/]]. Its origins can be traced to [[SMS language]]. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as [[Jejemon]]s.&lt;ref name="PDI"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-04-24 |first=Harvey |last=Marcoleta |title=Jejemons: The new ‘jologs’ |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/2bu/2bu/view/20100424-266068/gtJejemons-The-new-jologs |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427084817/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/2bu/2bu/view/20100424-266068/gtJejemons-The-new-jologs |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web |date=2010-04-26 |title=Jejemon in the Philippines |first=Joseph |last=Nacino |url=http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/the-virtual-eye/post.htm?id=63018444&amp;scid=hm_bl |work=[[CNET]] Asia |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828171747/http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/jejemon-in-the-philippines-62116449.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* kkkk: in [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Ethiopian languages]] spoken in the [[Horn of Africa]], iterations of the letter "k", usually ranging between 2 and 8 k's, are used as a variation of LOL. These iterations are also used by [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] and other [[languages of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean languages]] speakers, with the longer variant being "kikiki" (emulating a laughing sound).
* [[wikt:mdr|mdr]]: [[Esperanto]] version, from the initials of "multe da ridoj", which translates to "lot of laughs" in English.
* [[wikt:mdr|mdr]]: [[French language|French]] version, from the initials of "mort de rire" which roughly translated means "died of laughter", although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet.&lt;ref name="mort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Mort+de+Rire|title=MDR |author=|date=|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mort2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/french-english/mdr-mort-de-rire|title=French-English translation for "mdr (mort de rire)"|author=|date=|publisher=babLa|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:mkm|mkm]]: in [[Afghanistan]] "mkm" (being an abbreviation of the phrase "ma khanda mikonom"). This is a [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] phrase that means "I am laughing".
* [[wikt:ptdr|ptdr]]: [[French language|French]] variant from ''pété de rire'' - literally meaning "broken with laughter"
* [[wikt:rs|rs]]: in [[Brazil]] "rs" (being an abbreviation of "risos", the plural of "laugh") is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it ("rsrsrsrsrs") is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is "kkk" (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter ''k'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] sounding similar to the ''ca'' in ''card'', and therefore representing the laugh "cacacacaca" (also similar to the Hebrew version above).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.semantica-portuguese.com/learning-to-laugh-and-smile-online-1006/ |title=Learning to laugh and smile online...

* wkwkwk: in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], "wkwkwk" is often used to express laughter.
* [[wikt:חחח|חחח]]/[[wikt:ההה|ההה]]: [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version of LOL. The letter [[ח]] is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and [[ה]] is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter.
* ههههه: [[Arabic script]] repetition of the "[[هـ]]" character meaning "Hahahaha" or "Hehehehe". "هـ" is equivalent to the letter "H". The equivalents of the "a" or "e" short vowels are [[Arabic diacritics]] and are optional to write.
* ''ㅋㅋㅋ'' ("kkk" or "kekeke")&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; and ''ㅎㅎㅎ'' ("hhh") are usually used to indicate laughter in [[Korean language|Korean]]. '[[wikt:ㅋ|ㅋ]]', is a Korean [[Jamo]] consonant representing a "k" sound, and '[[wikt:ㅎ|ㅎ]]' represents an "h" sound. Both "ㅋㅋㅋ" and "ㅎㅎㅎ" represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: ''하하'' "haha" ''호호'', "hoho."&lt;ref name="korea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westudykorean.com/slang3.php|title=Slang 속어|author=|date=|publisher=We Study Korean|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 哈哈哈/呵呵呵: in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Although [[wikt:大笑|大笑]] (da xiao; "big laugh") is used, a more widespread usage is "哈哈哈" (ha ha ha) or "呵呵呵" ({{not a typo|he he}}) on internet forums. The phonetic rendering, "haha", is also common.
* (笑): in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the [[kanji]] for laugh (笑) is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as ''kakko warai'' (literally "parentheses laugh") or just ''wara''. [[wikt:w#Japanese|w]] is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple ''w'' to be chained together.&lt;ref name="tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-insider.net/?p=4756|title=LOL=wwwwww|publisher=Tokyo-Insider|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The resulting shape formed from multiple ''w'' leads to the usage of 草 (read as ''kusa''), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass.

===The word "lol" in other languages===
* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[wikt:lol#Dutch|lol]] is a word (not an acronym) which, coincidentally, means "fun" ("[[wikt:lollig|lollig]]" means "funny")
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[wikt:lol#Welsh|lol]] means "nonsense" or "ridiculous" &amp;nbsp;– e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "lol wirion" or "rwtsh lol"&lt;ref name="cscs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconWE.html|title=Welsh-English Lexicon|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language ideology''' (also referred to as '''linguistic ideology''') is a concept used primarily within the fields of [[anthropology]] (especially [[linguistic anthropology]]), [[sociolinguistics]], and [[cross-cultural studies]] to characterize any set of beliefs or feelings about [[language]]s as used in their social worlds. When recognized and explored, language ideologies expose connections between the beliefs speakers have about language and the larger social and cultural systems they are a part of, illustrating how these beliefs are informed by and rooted in such systems.  By doing so, language ideologies link the implicit as well as explicit assumptions people have about a language or language in general to their social experience and political as well as economic interests. Language ideologies are conceptualizations about languages, speakers, and discursive practices. Like other kinds of ideologies, language ideologies are influenced by political and moral interests and are shaped in a cultural setting. &lt;ref&gt;Irvine, J. T. (2012, January 11). Language Ideology. Retrieved February 9, 2018, from

==Applications and approaches==

===Definitions===
Several scholars have noted difficulty in attempting to delimit the scope, meaning, and applications of language ideology.  [[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologist]] [[Paul Kroskrity]] describes language ideology as a “cluster concept, consisting of a number of converging dimensions” with several “partially overlapping but analytically distinguishable layers of significance,” and cites that in the existing scholarship on language ideology “there is no particular unity . . . no core literature, and a range of definitions.”&lt;ref name=Kroskrity&gt;{{cite book|last=Duranti|first=ed. by Alessandro|title=A companion to linguistic anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-22352-5|pages=496–517|edition=[Repr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the broadest definitions is offered by Alan Rumsey, who describes language ideologies as “shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world.”&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rumsey|first=Alan|title=Wording, Meaning, and Linguistic Ideology|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1990|volume=92|issue=2|pages=346–361|doi=10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is seen by Kroskrity as unsatisfactory, however, because “it fails to problematize language ideological variation and therefore promotes an overly homogeneous view of language ideologies within a cultural group.”&lt;ref name=Kroskrity /&gt;  Emphasizing the role of speakers’ awareness in influencing language structure, [[Michael Silverstein]] defines linguistic ideologies as “sets of beliefs about language articulated by users as a rationalization or justification of perceived language structure and use.”&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;Silverstein, M. (1979). Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology. In P. Clyne, W. Hanks, and C. Hofbauer (eds.), The Elements (pp. 193–248). Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions that place greater emphasis on [[sociocultural linguistics|sociocultural factors]] include [[Shirley Heath]]’s characterization of language ideologies as “self-evident ideas and objectives a group holds concerning roles of language in the social experiences of members as they contribute to the expression of the group”&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;Heath, SB. (1977). Social history. In Bilingual Education: Current Perspectives. Vol. 1: Social Science, pp. 53--72. Arlington,
VA: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judith Irvine]]’s definition of the concept as “the [[cultural system]] of ideas about social and linguistic relationships, together with their loading of moral and political interests.”&lt;ref name="Irvine1989"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, J.]] (1989). When talk isn't cheap: language and political economy. American Ethnologist 16(2):248-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical vs. neutral approaches===
The basic division in studies of language ideology is between neutral and critical approaches to [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;  In neutral approaches to language ideology, speakers’ beliefs or ideas about language are understood as being shaped by the cultural systems in which they are embedded, but no attempt to identify variation within or across these systems is made.  Often, a single ideology will be identified in such cases.  Characterizations of language ideology as representative of an entire community or [[culture]], such as those routinely documented in [[ethnography|ethnographic research]], are common examples of neutral approaches to language ideology.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;

Critical approaches to language ideology explore the capacity for language and linguistic ideologies to be used as strategies for maintaining [[Power (social and political)|social power]] and domination.  They are described by [[Kathryn Woolard]] and Bambi Schieffelin as studies of "some aspects of representation and [[social cognition]], with particular social origins or functional and formal characteristics."&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn A.|author2=Schieffelin, Bambi B. |title=Language Ideology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1994|volume=23|issue=1|pages=55–82|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.23.100194.000415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although such studies are often noted for their discussions of [[language politics]] and the intersection between language and [[social class]], the crucial difference between these approaches to language ideology and neutral understandings of the concept is that the former emphasize the existence of variability and contradiction both within and amongst ideologies, while the latter approach ideology as a conception on its own terms.&lt;ref&gt;Woolard, K.A. (1992) "Language Ideology: Issues and Approaches." In P. Kroskrity, B. Schieffelin, K. Woolard, eds. Language Ideologies. Special Issue of Pragmatics 2 (3): 235-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of inquiry==

===Language use and structure===
Many scholars have argued that ideology plays a role in shaping and influencing linguistic structures and speech forms.  Michael Silverstein, for example, sees speakers’ awareness of language and their rationalizations of its structure and use as critical factors that often shape the evolution of a language’s structure.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  According to Silverstein, the ideologies speakers possess regarding language mediate the variation that occurs due to their imperfect and limited awareness of linguistic structures, resulting in the regularization of any variation that is rationalized by any sufficiently dominant or culturally widespread ideologies.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  This is demonstrated by such linguistic changes as the rejection of “he” as the generic pronoun in [[English language|English]], which coincided with the rise of the [[feminist movement]] in the second half of the twentieth century {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.  In this instance, the accepted usage of the masculine pronoun as the generic form came to be understood as a linguistic symbol of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and male-dominated society, and the growing sentiment opposing these conditions motivated some speakers to stop using “he” as the generic pronoun in favor of the construction “he or she.”  This rejection of generic “he” was rationalized by the growing desire for [[gender equality]] and women’s empowerment, which was sufficiently culturally prevalent to regularize the change.

Alan Rumsey also sees linguistic ideologies as playing a role in shaping the structure of a language, describing a circular process of reciprocal influence where a language’s structure conditions the ideologies that affect it, which in turn reinforce and expand this structure, altering the language “in the name of making it more like itself.”&lt;ref name=Rumsey /&gt;  This process is exemplified by the excessive glottalization of consonants by bilingual speakers of [[endangered language|moribund]] varieties of [[Xincan languages|Xinca]], who effectively altered the structure of this language in order to make it more distinct from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Lyle; &amp; Muntzel, M. (1989). The structural consequences of language death. In N. C. Dorian (Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  These speakers glottalized consonants in situations where more competent speakers of Xinca would not because they were not only less familiar with the phonological rules of the language, but because they wished to distinguish themselves from socially dominant Spanish, whose speakers viewed glottalized consonants as “exotic.”&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Ethnography of speaking===
Studies of "ways of speaking" within specific communities have been recognized as especially productive sites of language ideological investigation.  They often include a community’s own theory of speech as a part of their ethnography, which allows for the documentation of explicit language ideologies on a community-wide level or in “the neutral sense of cultural conceptions.”&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;  A study of language socialization practices in [[Dominica]], for example, revealed that local notions of personhood, status, and authority are associated with the strategic usage of Patwa and English in the course of the adult-child interaction.&lt;ref name=Paugh&gt;Paugh, A.L. (2005). ‘Acting adult: Language socialization, shift, and ideologies in Dominica, West Indies’, in J. Cohen, K.T. McAlister, K. Rolstad, and J. MacSwan (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism. Cascadilla Press, Somerville, MA, 1807–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Patwa by children is largely forbidden by adults due to a perception that it inhibits the acquisition of English and thus restricts [[social mobility]], which in turn has imbued Patwa with a significant measure of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|covert prestige]] and rendered it a powerful tool for children to utilize in order to defy authority.&lt;ref name=Paugh /&gt;  Thus there are multiple, competing ideologies of Patwa in Dominica: one which encourages a shift away from Patwa usage; and another which contributes to its maintenance.

====Linguistic ideologies in speech act theory====
[[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]]'s [[speech act theory]] has been described by several ethnographers, anthropologists, and linguists as being based in a specifically Western linguistic ideology that renders it inapplicable in certain ethnographic contexts.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;  Jef Verschueren characterized speech act theory as privileging “a privatized view of language that emphasizes the psychological state of the speaker while downplaying the social consequences of speech,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verschueren|first=Jef|title=What people say they do with words : prolegomena to an empirical-conceptual approach to linguistic action|year=1985|publisher=Ablex Pub. Corp.|location=Norwood, N.J.|isbn=0893911968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while Michael Silverstein argued that the theory’s ideas about language “acts” and “forces” are “projections of covert categories typical in the [[metapragmatics|metapragmatic]] discourse of languages such as English.”&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  Scholars have subsequently used speech act theory to caution against the positioning of linguistic theories as universal applicable, citing that any account of language will reflect the linguistic ideologies held by those who develop it.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, M.L. (1986). Ideology and Speech-Act Theory. Poetics Today 7.1: 59-72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language contact and multilingualism===
Several scholars have noted that sites of cultural contact promote the development of new linguistic forms that draw on diverse language varieties and ideologies at an accelerated rate.  According to Miki Makihara and Bambi Schieffelin, it becomes necessary during times of cultural contact for speakers to actively negotiate language ideologies and to consciously reflect on language use.&lt;ref name=contact /&gt;  This articulation of ideology is essential to prevent misconceptions of meaning and intentions between cultures, and provides a link between sociocultural and linguistic processes in contact situations.&lt;ref name=contact&gt;{{cite book|last=Schieffelin|first=edited by Miki Makihara, Bambi B.|title=Consequences of contact : language ideologies and sociocultural transformations in Pacific societies|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University|location=Oxford|isbn=0195324986|pages=1–22|edition=[Reprint.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language policy and standardization===
The establishment of a [[standard language]] has many implications in the realms of politics and power.  Recent examinations of language ideologies have resulted in the conception of “standard” as a matter of ideology rather than fact,&lt;ref name=Woolard&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn|title=Language ideologies : practice and theory|year=1998|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-510561-3|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising questions such as “how doctrines of linguistic correctness and incorrectness are rationalized and how they are related to doctrines of the inherent representational power, beauty, and expressiveness of language as a valued mode of action.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Michael|title=Language and the Culture of Gender: At the Intersection of Structure, Usage and Ideology.|year=1985|publisher=Academic Press|location=Orlando, Fla.|pages=219–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language policy====
Governmental policies often reflect the tension between two contrasting types of language ideologies: ideologies that conceive of language as a resource, problem, or right&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Richard|title=Orientations in Language Planning|journal=National Association for Bilingual Education Journal|year=1984|volume=8|series=15-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Hornberger, N.H. (2016). Re-visiting orientations to language planning: problem, right, and resource. &lt;i&gt;Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe, 33&lt;/i&gt;(3), 30-49. Available from http://bilingualreview.utsa.edu/index.php/br/article/view/118&lt;/ref&gt; and ideologies that conceive of language as pluralistic phenomena.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt; The language-related policies that emerge in such instances often reflect the compromise that is reached between these two types of ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Pietikäinen, S. (2014).  Shaping discourses of multilingualism through a language ideological debate: The case of Swedish in Finland. &lt;i&gt;Journal of Language and Politics, 13&lt;/i&gt;, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Blommaert and Verschueren, this compromise is often reinterpreted as a single, unified ideology, evidenced by the many [[Europe]]an societies characterized by a language ideological ''[[Homogeneity|homogenism]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaspers|first=Jürgen|title=Society and language use|year=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9027207844|pages=189–210|author2=Östman, Jan-Ola |author3=Verschueren, Jef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideologies of linguistic purism====
[[Linguistic purism|Purist language ideologies]] or ideologies of linguistic conservatism can close off languages to nonnative sources of innovation, usually when such sources are perceived as socially or politically threatening to the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, B. (1989). Francophonie: Purism at the International Level. In The Politics of Language Purism, ed. Bjorn H. Jernudd and Michael Shapiro, pp. 53-80. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the [[Tewa]], for example, the influence of theocratic institutions and ritualized linguistic forms in other domains of Tewa society have led to a strong resistance to the extensive [[Loanword|borrowing]] and [[Language shift|shift]] many of its neighboring language communities have experienced. According to [[Paul Kroskrity]] this is due to a "dominant language ideology" through which ceremonial Kiva speech is elevated to a linguistic ideal and the cultural preferences that it embodies, namely regulation by convention, indigenous purism, strict compartmentalization, and linguistic indexing of identity, are recursively projected onto the Tewa language as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. (1993). Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. (1998). Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In ''Language ideologies: Practice and theory''. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn A. Woolard, and Paul V. Kroskrity, eds., pp. 103-122. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandra Jaffe]] points out that language purism is often part of “essentializing discourses” that can lead to stigmatizing habitual language practices like [[code-switching]] and depict [[language contact|contact-induced linguistic changes]] as forms of cultural deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Alexandra (2007). “Discourses of endangerment: Contexts and consequences of essentializing discourses.” In ''Discourses of Endangerment: Ideology and Interest in the Defence of Languages,'' eds. Alexandre Duchêne and Monica Heller, pp. 57-75. London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standard language ideology====
As defined by [[Rosina Lippi-Green]], standard language ideology is "a bias toward an abstract, idealized homogeneous language, which is imposed and maintained by dominant institutions and which has as its model the written language, but which is drawn primarily from the spoken language of the upper middle class." According to Lippi-Green, part of this ideology is a belief that standard languages are internally consistent.&lt;ref name=Green1997&gt;Lippi-Green, R. (1997). English with an accent: Language, ideology, and discrimination in the United States. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists generally agree, however, that variation is intrinsic to all spoken language, including standard varieties.&lt;ref name=Tollefson1999&gt;Tollefson, J.W. (1999). Language Ideology and Language Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard language ideology is strongly connected with the concepts of [[linguistic purism]] and [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Elabbas Benmamoun|author=Keith Walters|author2=Reem Bassiouney|title=The Routledge Handbook of Arabic Linguistics|publisher=Routledge|date=2017|isbn=9781351377799|pages=483|chapter=Arab nationalism and/as language ideology|url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/pdf/doi/10.4324/9781315147062-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language, Society and Power: An Introduction|author=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|publisher=Routledge|date=2018|isbn=9780429823398|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nnd0DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=standard+language+ideology#v=snippet&amp;q=standard%20language%20ideology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tvrtko Vuković|editor2=Maša Kolanović|author=Mate Kapović|chapter=Jezik i konzervativizam|title=Komparativni postsocijalizam: slavenska iskustva|publisher=Zagrebačka slavistička škola|pages=391-400|date=2013|url=https://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/jezik-i-konzervatizam-nije-tesko-vidjeti-da-je-jezicni-purizam-desni-politicki-projekt|accessdate=16 November 2018|language=sh}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also linked with [[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]] (linguistic discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Miklós Kontra|title=The Unrecognized Linguistic Right in Hungarian Education|year=2012|url=http://allstudentsaboard.eu/Downloads/CountryInformation/LinguisticRights/Hungary_LR2.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy===
[[Literacy]] cannot be strictly defined technically, but is rather a set of practices determined by the language ideology of a community.  It can be interpreted in a multitude of ways that are determined by political, social, and economic forces.&lt;ref&gt;Street, B.V. (1984). Literacy in Theory and Practice. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kathryn Woolard and Bambi Schieffelin, literacy traditions are closely linked to social control in most societies.&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;  The typical European literacy ideology, for example, recognizes literacy solely in an alphabetic capacity.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;

====Kaluli literacy development====
In the 1960s, missionaries arrived in [[Papua New Guinea]] and exposed the [[Kaluli]] to [[Christianity]] and [[modernization]], part of which was accomplished through the introduction of literacy.&lt;ref name=kaluli&gt;Schieffelin, B. B. (2000). Introducing Kaluli Literacy: A Chronology of Influences. In P. V. Kroskrity (ed.), Regimes of Language: pp. 293–327. Santa Fe, NM: School of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaluli primers that were introduced by the missionaries promoted [[Westernization]], which effectively served to strip the [[Vernacular|vernacular language]] of cultural practices and from [[discourse]] in church and school.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;  Readers written in the 1970s used derogatory terms to refer to the Kaluli and depicted their practices as inferior, motivating the Kaluli to change their self-perceptions and orient themselves towards Western values.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;  The missionaries’ control of these authoritative books and of this new “technology of language literacy” gave them the power to effect culture change and morph the ideology of Kaluli into that of modern Christianity.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;

===Orthography===
[[Orthography|Orthographic systems]] always carry historical, cultural, and political meaning that are grounded in ideology.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;  Orthographic debates are focused on political and social issues rather than on linguistic discrepancies, which can make for intense debates characterized by ideologically charged stances and symbolically important decisions.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;

===Classroom practice/second language acquisition===
"Language ideologies are not confined merely to ideas or beliefs, but rather is extended to include the very language practices through which our ideas or notions are enacted" (Razfar, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Razfar, A. (2005). Language ideologies in practice: Repair and classroom discourse. Linguistics and Education, 16(4), 404-424.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers display their language ideologies in classroom instruction through various practices such as correction or repair, affective alignment, metadiscourse, and narrative (see Razfar &amp; Rumenapp, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;289).&lt;ref&gt;Razfar, A., &amp; Rumenapp, J.C. (2013) Applying linguistics in the classroom: A sociocultural perspective. NY, NY: Routledge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ideology seeks to uncover the hidden world of students and teachers to shed light on the fundamental forces that shape and give meaning to their actions and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Tollefson, J.W., Yamagami, M. (2012). Language ideology in a language classroom. The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
[[Fiji]] has three official languages under the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 constitution]] (and not revoked by the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]]): [[English language|English]], [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and Hindi. Fijian is spoken either as a first or second language by most [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] who make up around 54% of the population. 

Fijians of [[Indians in Fiji|Indian]] descent make up a further 37%, mainly speaking a local variant of [[Hindi]], known as ''[[Fiji Hindi]]''. English, a remnant of British colonial rule over the islands, was the sole official language until 1997 and is widely used in government, business, and education as a [[lingua franca]]. Considerable business is also done in Fijian, especially away from larger town centre.

A small number of other indigenous [[East Fijian languages|East Fijian]] and [[West Fijian languages|West Fijian]] regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are also spoken by immigrant populations.

==History==
Until the 19th century, Fiji's population consisted almost entirely of indigenous Fijians, who were of mixed Polynesian and Melanesian descent and generally spoke languages of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language family]].  After the islands came under [[British Empire|British colonial rule]], a number of contract workers were brought from present-day [[British India]], spreading the use of the [[Hindi]] language. 

All three of Fiji's official languages have greatly been influenced by one another, in terms of vocabulary and, in some cases, grammar because of the constant, everyday contact between these languages, now for over a century. Fiji's diverse, multiracial and multilingual makeup make these languages, as well as other unofficial, minority languages in Fiji (such as Western Fijian, Chinese, Banaban, Rotuman, Tuvaluan and other present Indian languages), influence one another.

==English==
[[English language|English]] usage in Fiji predates the cession of Fiji to [[Great Britain]] by a few decades. English was first encountered from the first explorers and traders and found greater popularity as a [[lingua franca]] (albeit mixed with English in an early and now extinct [[Pidgin Fijian]]) between frontier settlers and the indigenous peoples. By the time of the British administration, much of the [[Ratu|Fijian nobility]] were able to comprehend basic English. The English spoken in Fiji today is very different and has developed significantly over the close to 150 years of usage in the islands.

Like many former colonies of Great Britain, there are certain 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would resemble formal English in [[Australia]] or the [[United Kingdom]]) as it is known, which is to be used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. 

Very informal Fiji English, or Finglish, is used among all races with family, friends and in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate [[dialect]] from [[Standard English]] (as has developed in Australia and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]]) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest it is part of a greater South Pacific English dialect because of the shared development of English within former [[British colonies]] and [[protectorates]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].

==Fijian==
Fijian is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian family]] spoken in [[Fiji]]. It has 300,000 first-language speakers, which is more than half the population of Fiji, but another 300,000 speak it as a second language. The early missionaries selected the [[Fijian language|Bau dialect]] or Bauan (which, among the East Fijian dialects, held the place that French would in Europe, while the purer Rewa dialect would be Latin) as the standard dialect for printing and communicating. Bauan soon became the standard of communication among the indigenous [[Fijians|iTaukei]]. Bauan was selected not only because of its prestige but also because it was the language of the then politically dominant island of Bau and the [[Ratu|Mataiwelagi]] chiefs (and claimed King of Fiji).

By the middle to the late 19th century, with the push by missionaries, Bauan had also invaded the Western areas of Viti Levu, which spoke an entirely different set of dialects belonging to the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian language]], which is grouped with Polynesian and Rotuman in the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian-Polynesian language family]] and practiced a different culture. This occurred up to the point that many Bauan words entered many western Fijian languages. Bauan was then adopted by the British administration for communication with the iTaukei. Over time, it evolved into what is today [[Fijian language|Standard Fijian]] which includes many English and Other Fijian Dialectal contributions, becoming quite distinct from the original Bauan Dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orientation - Bau|url = http://www.everyculture.com/Oceania/Bau-Orientation.html|website = www.everyculture.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindi==

Hindi is an official language in [[Fiji]]. In the 1997 Constitution, it was referred to as "Hindustani",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/fj00000_.html |title=Section 4 of Fiji Constitution |publisher=servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]], it is simply called "Hindi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|title=- Ooops! -|author=|date=|website=www.fiji.gov.fj|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fiji Hindi]], also known as Fijian Baat or Fijian Hindustani, is the language spoken by most [[Fiji]]an citizens of [[India]]n descent. It is derived mainly from the [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] varieties of [[Hindi languages|Hindi]]. It has also borrowed a large number of words from [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and [[English language|English]]. The relation between Fiji Hindi and [[Standard Hindi]] is similar to the relation between [[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Indian [[indenture]]d labourers were initially brought to Fiji mainly from districts of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] and [[South India]] such as from [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. They spoke numerous, mainly Hindi, dialects and languages depending on their district of origin.

A language soon developed in Fiji that combined the common elements of the [[Hindi dialects]] spoken in these areas with Fijian, Arabic, and English words; this has diverged significantly from the varieties of Hindi spoken on the [[Indian sub-continent]]. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different dialects and sub-dialects of Hindi to work together and the practice of young children being left during working hours in early versions of day care centers. 

Later, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of [[Dravidian languages]] ([[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]]), were brought from South India. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Fiji Indians and the South Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous North Indians and European overseers. Inward migration of free Gujarati and Punjabi settlers further contributed to Fiji Hindi.

==Others==
Fiji is also home to many smaller minorities which make up its multicultural and multilingual populace.

[[Rotuman language|Rotuman]], also referred to as Rotunan, Rutuman or Fäeag Rotuma, is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken by the indigenous people of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island group of [[Rotuma]], an island with a [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]]-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of [[Fiji]] in 1881 and later chose to remain with Fiji in 1970 upon independence and in 1987, when Fiji became a republic. The rotuman language is spoken by more than 2000 people on the island of Rotuma and a further 10,000 people who live or work in the Republic of Fiji.

Other Indian languages are spoken in Fiji. After the indenture system, Indians who spoke [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. At present, many free settler descendants in Fiji and their families speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Telugu, Punjabi and Gujarati at home, but all speak and communicate with each other in English. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Two significant languages that are seeing growth are [[Cantonese Chinese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Many Chinese settlers, especially from southern China speak Cantonese, which is quickly incorporating many Fijian and English words. Many of these migrants are farmers and are constantly exposed to the Fijian and Hindi dominated areas of rural Fiji.

Furthermore, sizeable minorities of Micronesians and Polynesians mean that Fiji is also home to various [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] languages. Significant among them are the Banaban, which is the language of the former residents of Ocean Island, which was decimated through British phosphate mining. They were given [[Rabi Island]] in North-Eastern Fiji as a new homeland and number 2000-3000. Also, Kioa, which was given to former [[Tuvalu]]ans, who migrated as the consequence of overcrowding on [[Vaitupu]]. They speak [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]], a Polynesian language and number around a thousand. Also, there are many Tongan residents and Fijians of Tongan descent in Fiji. These groups speak the [[Tongan language]] or a mix of Tongan and Fijian.

[[File:Theatre at Syracuse, Sicily.jpg|thumb|300px|Ancient theater at Syracuse, Sicily, originally Greek]]
'''Lucius Livius Andronicus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|v|i|ə|s}}; c. 284 – c. 205 BC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/344903/Lucius-Livius-Andronicus "Lucius Livius Andronicus"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greco-Roman]] [[dramatist]] and [[epic poetry|epic poet]] of the [[Old Latin]] period. He began as an educator in the service of a noble family at Rome by translating [[Greek language|Greek]] works into [[Latin language|Latin]], including  [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; They were meant at first as educational devices in the school he founded. He wrote works for the stage—both tragedies and comedies—which are regarded as the first dramatic works written in the Latin language of ancient Rome. His comedies were based on Greek [[New Comedy]] and featured characters in Greek costume. Thus, the Romans referred to this new genre by the term [[fabula palliata|comoedia palliata]] (fabula palliata). The Roman biographer [[Suetonius]] later coined the term "half-Greek" of Livius and [[Ennius]] (referring to their genre, not their ethnic backgrounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Source book of the history of education for the Greek and Roman period|first=Paul|last= Monroe|chapter=Selections from the Lives of Eminent Grammarians, by Suetonius|quote=...for the earliest men of learning, who were both poets and orators, may be considered as half-Greek: I speak of Livius and [[Ennius]], who are acknowledged to have taught both languages as well at Rome as in foreign parts.|location=New York, London|publisher=Macmillan Co.|year=1902|pages=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was imitated by the next dramatists to follow in Andronicus' footsteps and on that account he is regarded as the father of [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]] and of Latin literature in general; that is, he was the first man of letters to write in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston (2004, xi).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], [[Cicero]], and [[Horace]], all men of letters during the subsequent [[Classical Latin]] period, considered Livius Andronicus to have been the originator of [[Latin literature]]. He is the earliest Roman poet whose name is known.&lt;ref name="Rose 1954, 21"&gt;Rose (1954, 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
===Name===
In ancient sources, Livius Andronicus is either given that name or is simply called Livius. [[Andronicus (disambiguation)|Andronicus]] is the Latinization of a Greek name, which was held by a number of Greek historical figures of the period. It is generally considered that Andronicus came from his Greek name and that Livius, a name originally local to [[Latium]], was the [[Gentilicium#Nomen|gentilicium]], the family name, of his [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron (''patronus'')]]. His career at Rome was launched from servitude and he became a [[freedman]] (''libertus'') by the grace of his master, one of the ''[[Livia (gens)|Livia gens]]''. The [[praenomen]] Lucius is given by [[Aulus Gellius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aulus Gellius|title=Attic Nights|chapter=Book 18, Chapter 9|quote=For in the library at Patrae I found a manuscript of Livius Andronicus ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingston (2004, xii).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dates===
Livius' dates are based mainly on Cicero&lt;ref name=brutus&gt;''Brutus'' 18.72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marcus Tullius|last=Cicero|authorlink=Marcus Tullius Cicero|title=De Senectute|chapter=Section 50|quote=I myself [ [[Cato the Elder]] ] saw Livius Andronicus when he was an old man, who, though he brought out a play in the consulship of Cento and Tuditanus [240 BC], six years before I was born, yet continued to live until I was a young man.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Livy.&lt;ref name=livy27.37.7/&gt; Cicero says, "This Livius exhibited his first performance at Rome in the Consulship of M. Tuditanus, and [[Gaius Claudius Centho|C. Clodius]] the son of Caecus, the year before Ennius was born," that is, in 240 BC. Cicero goes on to relate the point of view of [[Lucius Accius|Accius]], that Livius was captured from Tarentum in 209, and produced a play in 197. Cicero disagrees with this view on the grounds that it would make Livius younger than [[Plautus]] and [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]], though he was supposed to have been the first to produce a play. Livy says, "The pontiffs also decreed that three bands of maidens, each consisting of nine, should go through the city singing a hymn. This hymn [the ''parthenion'') was composed by the poet, Livius." This action was taken to expiate the gods after a series of evil portents in the consulship of "[[Gaius Claudius Nero|C. Claudius Nero]] for the first time, [[Marcus Livius Salinator|M. Livius]] for the second;" that is, in 207. Only the dates of 240 and 207 seem exempt from controversy.&lt;ref name="Conte 1994, 40"&gt;Conte (1994, 40).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
[[Jerome]] has some additional detail that tends to support the capture at Tarentum and enslavement. His entry for the year of Abraham 1829, the second year of the 148th [[Olympiad]] (186/185 BC), of his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'', reads&lt;blockquote&gt;''Titus Livius tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur, qui ob ingenii meritum a Livio Salinatore, cuius liberos erudiebat, libertate donatus est.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Titus Livius, author of tragedies, is held to be outstanding. He was given liberty by Livius Salinator, whose children he was educating, by merit of his intelligence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jerome is the only author to name him Titus. The passage is ambiguous concerning the events actually happening in Olympiad 148; Andronicus could have been being given liberty or simply have been being honoured, having been liberated long ago. Livius Salinator might be [[Gaius Livius Salinator]], his father [[Marcus Livius Salinator]], or his grandfather Marcus. If Jerome means that the liberation took place in 186, then he seems to be following Accius' view, which might have been presented in the missing portions of Suetonius' ''de Poetis'' and read by Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=xii|title=A linguistic commentary on Livius Andronicus|first=Ivy J. |last=Livingston|year=2004|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francos Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is not conclusive about anything. However, the mixed name of Livius and his being associated with Salinator suggests that he was captured at the first fall of [[History of Taranto#Pyrrhic War|Tarentum]] in 272, sold to the first Marcus Livius Salinator, tutored the second and was set free to have an independent career when the task was complete.

==Works==
===''Odusia''===
Livius made a translation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', entitled the ''Odusia'' in Latin, for his classes in [[Saturnian (poetry)|Saturnian]] verse. All that survives is parts of 46 scattered lines from 17 books of the Greek 24-book epic. In some lines, he translates literally, though in others more freely.&lt;ref name="Rose 1954, 21"/&gt; His translation of the ''Odyssey'' had a great historical importance. Before then, the [[Mesopotamians]] and Egyptians had translated judicial and religious texts, but no one had yet translated a literary work written in a foreign language until Livius. Livius' translation made this fundamental Greek text accessible to Romans, and advanced literary culture in Latin. This project was one of the first examples of translation as an artistic process; the work was to be enjoyed on its own, and Livius strove to preserve the artistic quality of the original. Since there was no tradition of epic in Italy before him{{dubious|date=February 2015}}, Livius must have faced enormous problems. For example, he used archaising forms  to make his language more solemn and intense. His innovations would be important in the history of Latin poetry.&lt;ref name="Conte 1994, 40"/&gt;

In the fragments we have, it is clear that Livius had a desire to remain faithful to the original and to be clear, while having to alter untranslatable phrases and ideas. For example, the phrase "equal to the gods", which would have been unacceptable to Romans, was changed to "''summus adprimus''", "greatest and of first rank".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Also, early Roman poetry made use of pathos, expressive force, and dramatic tension, so Livius interprets Homer with a mind to these ideas as well.&lt;ref&gt;Conte (1994, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Livius did not make arbitrary changes to the text; rather, he attempted to remain faithful to Homer and to the Latin language.&lt;ref&gt;von Albrecht (1997, 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===
[[File:DSC00367 - Affresco con scena teatrale (epoca romana) - Foto G. Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco of a theatre scene]]
Livius' first play, according to Cicero, was staged in 240. [[Livy]] tells us that Livius was the first to create a play with a plot. One story says that after straining his voice, Livius, who was also an actor, was the first to leave the singing to singers and limited the actors to dialogue.

His dramatic works were written in the iambic senarius and [[trochaic septenarius]]. They included both lyric passages (''cantica'') and dialogue (''diverbia''). His dramatic works had large element of solos for chief actor, often himself. It is not known whether he had a chorus. These dramatic works of Livius Andronicus were consistent with Greek requirements of drama and probably had Greek models, and we have no more than 60 fragments, as quoted in other authors.

The titles of his known [[Tragedy|tragedies]] are ''Achilles'', ''Aegisthus'', ''Aiax Mastigophorus'' (''Ajax with the Whip''), ''Andromeda'', ''Antiopa'', ''Danae'', ''Equus Troianus'', ''Hermiona'', and ''Tereus''.

Two titles of his [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] are certain, ''Gladiolus'' and ''Ludius'', though the third, ''Virgo'', is probably corrupt. They were all composed on the model of Greek [[New Comedy]], adapting stories from the Greek. The Romans called this sort of adaptation of comedy by Livius and his immediate successors ''[[Fabula palliata|fabulae palliatae]]'', or ''comoedia palliata'', named from the ''pallium'', or short cloak, worn by the actors.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore (1908, 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Of Andronicus' ''palliata'' we have 6 fragments of 1 verse each and 1 title, ''Gladiolus'', (''Little Saber'').

===The hymn===
According to Livy,&lt;ref name=livy27.37.7&gt;27.37.7&lt;/ref&gt; Livius also composed a hymn for a chorus of 27 girls in honour of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to be performed in public as part of religious ceremonies in 207. Because of the success of this hymn, Livius received public honours when his professional organization, the ''collegium scribarum histrionumque'' was installed in the Temple of [[Minerva]] on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]. Actors and writers would gather here and offer gifts.

The '''Mangbetu–Asoa''' or '''Mangbetu''' languages of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language family]] are a cluster of closely related languages spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

The languages are [[Mangbetu language|Mangbetu]], spoken by perhaps a million people, and the smaller [[Lombi language (DRC)|Lombi]] and [[Asoa language|Asoa]]. 
Blench (2000) considers Lombi to be part of the Mangbetu dialect continuum. Asoa is spoken by [[Pygmy languages|Pygmies]].

The '''Mangbutu–Lese languages''' of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language family]], also known as '''Mangbutu–Efe''' or simply '''Mangbutu''' (e.g. Starostin 2016), are a cluster of closely related languages spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Uganda]].

The languages are:
:[[Mangbutu language|Mangbutu]], [[Mvuba language|Mvuba]], [[Ndo language|Ndo]], [[Mamvu language|Mamvu]], [[Lese language|Lese]], [[Bendi language (Sudanic)|Bendi]].
Efe (the language of the [[Efe people|Efe]] Pygmies) is often counted as another, but appears to be a dialect of Lese. Ndo (Membitu) is the most populous language and is spoken by a [[caste]] of blacksmiths.

'''Manuel Antônio de Almeida''' (November 17, 1831 – November 28, 1861) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[satire|satirical]] writer, medician and teacher. He is famous for the book ''[[Memoirs of a Police Sergeant]]'', written under the [[pen name]] '''Um Brasileiro''' ({{lang-en|A Brazilian}}). He is the patron of the 28th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
Almeida was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], to [[lieutenant]] Antônio de Almeida and Josefina Maria de Almeida. Few things are known about his years of primary studies — although he entered at the Medicine course in 1849, graduating in 1855. Financial difficulties inspired him to dedicate himself to literature and journalism. His ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[Memoirs of a Police Sergeant]]'' (or, in Portuguese, ''Memórias de um Sargento de Milícias''), was initially published in ''[[feuilleton]]'' form during the years 1852-1853, in the journal ''Correio Mercantil''.

In 1858, he became the administrator of Tipografia Nacional, where he met [[Machado de Assis]]. Trying to enter in the political career, he would go to the city of [[Campos dos Goytacazes]], embarking in the ship ''Hermes'', in order to start his political research. However, the ship [[shipwreck|wrecked off]] near the shores of [[Macaé]], and he died in the disaster.

'''Maír José Benardete''' (born 1895 in [[Çanakkale]], [[Turkey]]—died 1989 in the United States) was a scholar of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] studies and was a long-time Professor of Spanish and Sephardic Studies at [[Brooklyn College]].

He was a past Director of The Hispanic Institute at [[Columbia University]]'s Sephardic Studies Section in the late 1920s. The Institute was also known as Casa Hispánica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/mair.html Mair Jose Benadrete Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Benardete was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the city of [[Çanakkale]], on Dardanalles, Turkey. He was the eldest of nine children, and came from a Ladino ([[Judaeo-Spanish]])-speaking family. At the age of eight, he contracted a serious illness that left him unable to walk for months. He spent his year-long convalescence among the Sephardic women of his community, absorbing the Judeo-Spanish folklore and language that would later serve him well in his career as a Sephardic scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aviva Ben-Ur.|title=" Benardete, Maír José." Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/benardete-mair-jose-SIM_0003790|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Benardete immigrated to the United States, to live with an uncle living in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aviva Ben-Ur|title=Benardete, Mair Jose|url=http://people.umass.edu/abenur/Ben-Ur%20on%20Benardete.pdf|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benardete also went by the names Mair José Benardete; Mair José Benadrete; M. J. Benadete; Meyer Benardete; and Mercedes Benardete.

==Career==
Under Benardete's direction, the Sephardic Section of Casa Hispanica hosted or sponsored lectures on Sephardic civilization, generated articles for the institute's "Revista Hispanica Moderna,", published a Ladino/Spanish commemorative volume on the medieval Spanish-Jewish poet, [[Judah Halevi|Yehuda Halevi]], and staged dramatic performances in [[Judaeo-Spanish]]. Benardete's doctoral dissertation, "Hispanic Culture and Character of the Sephardic Jews," was first published by the Hispanic Institute in 1953.

{{Importance section|date=May 2017}}
In 1962, two Sephardic activists, Louis N. Levy and David N. Barocas, published "Studies in Honor of M.J. Benadrete."

==Personal life==
Benardete produced three academically-successful sons; [[Seth Benardete]], who was an American classicist and philosopher, [http://dailynous.com/2016/02/26/jose-benardete-2016/ José Benardete], who was also a philosopher.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Harvey C.

'''Ongamo''', or '''Ngas''', is a probably extinct [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] language of [[Tanzania]]. It is closely related to the [[Maa languages]], but more distantly than they are to each other. Ongamo has 60% of lexical similarity with [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Samburu language|Samburu]], and [[Camus language|Camus]]. Speakers have shifted to [[Chaga languages|Chagga]], a dominant regional [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]].

== History ==
An expansion of Ngas speakers onto the plains north of Mount Kilimanjaro occurred in the 12th century. The language was mutually intelligible with Proto-Maasai during that period. Vocabulary retention from this time attests to the cultivation of sorghum and elusine by the Ngas. Subsequent immigration of Bantu-speaking Chagga over the next five centuries considerably reduced the extent and viability of the Ngasa language.&lt;ref&gt;Leeman, Bernard and informants. (1994).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10345">'''NooJ''' is a linguistic development environment software as well as a corpus processor constructed by Max Silberztein. NooJ allows linguists to construct the four classes of the [[Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy]] of generative grammars: [[Finite state grammar | Finite-State Grammars]], [[Context-free grammar | Context-Free Grammars]],  [[Context-sensitive grammar | Context-Sensitive Grammars]] as well as [[Unrestricted grammar | Unrestricted Grammars]], using either a text editor (e.g. to write down regular expressions), or a Graph editor.&lt;ref&gt;Silberztein M., 2015. La formalisation des langues : l'approche de NooJ. ISTE: London (426 p.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

NooJ allows linguists to develop orthographical and morphological grammars, dictionaries of simple words, of compound words as well as discontinuous expressions, local syntactic grammars (such as [[Named-entity recognition | Named Entities Recognizers]]),&lt;ref&gt;Fehri H., Haddar K. and Ben Hamadou A. 2011. A new representation model for the automatic recognition and translation of Arabic Named Entities with NooJ. RANLP 2011 (Hissar, Bulgaria)[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R11-1076]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mota C. and Grishman R. 2008. Is this NE tagger getting old? Proceedings of LREC 2008. Marrakech: ELRA, pp. 1196-1202.[http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/5455.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; structural syntactic grammars (that produce syntactic trees) as well as [[Zellig Harris]]‘ [[transformational grammar | transformational grammars]]. &lt;br /&gt;

All NooJ parsers process [[Atomic Linguistic Units]] (ALUs), as opposed to word forms (i.e. sequences of letters between two space characters).&lt;ref&gt;Silberztein M., 2003. [http://www.nooj4nlp.net/pages/references.html NooJ manual]&lt;/ref&gt; This allows NooJ’s syntactic parser to parse sequences of word forms such as “can not” exactly as [[contracted word]] forms such as “cannot” or “can’t”. This allows linguists to write relatively simple syntactic grammars, even for agglutinative languages. ALUs are represented by annotations that are stored in the [[Text Annotation Structure]] (or TAS): all NooJ parsers add, or remove annotations in the TAS. A typical NooJ analysis involves applying to a text a series of elementary grammars in cascade, in a bottom-up approach (from spelling to semantics).

== History ==
NooJ originated in investigations by Silberztein and the INTEX community of linguist users into the Lexicon-Grammar approach of [[Maurice Gross]]’ LADL, which states that no grammar rule can be developed independently from a strict delimitation of its domain of application.&lt;br /&gt;

NooJ has been used as a [[corpus processor]] by researchers in Linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;Mesfar S. 2011. Towards a Cascade of Morpho-syntactic Tools for Arabic Natural Language Processing.

Idiomatic Constructions in Italian. A Lexicon-Grammar Approach. John Benjamins BV: Amsterdam Netherlands. {{ISBN|9789027231413}} &lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. to take the bull by the horns) as well as support verb/predicative noun associations (e.g. to take a nap).
NooJ allows linguists to create, edit, debug and maintain a large number of grammars that belong to the four classes of generative grammars in the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy: finite-state grammars, context-free grammars, context-sensitive grammars and unrestricted grammars.&lt;br /&gt;

NooJ can often apply grammars to texts in linear time: for instance, most NooJ Context-Free Grammars can often be derecursived. NooJ Context-Sensitive Grammars are made of two parts: one part is a Context-Free (or even a Finite-State Grammar) that is applied to texts very efficiently, the second consists in a set of constraints applied to matching sequences, each one performed in constant time.
NooJ unrestricted grammars are context-sensitive grammars that can contain variables and can modify the text input. They are typically used to perform transformational analysis &amp; generation (see [[Zellig Harris]]), but several teams of linguists have shown that, when used in conjunction with multilingual lexicons, they can be used to perform [[Machine Translation]]&lt;ref&gt;Barreiro A. 2008.

'''Pahang Malay''' ([[Standard Malay]]: ''Bahasa Melayu Pahang''; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: بهاس ملايو ڤهڠ) is a [[Malayan languages|dialect]] of [[Malay language]] spoken in the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Pahang]]. It is regarded as the dominant Malay dialect spoken along the vast riverine systems of Pahang, but co-exists with other Malay dialects traditionally spoken in the state. Along the coastline of Pahang, [[Terengganu Malay]] is spoken in a narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dialect spoken in [[Tioman]] island is a distinct Malay variant and most closely related to [[Riau Islands Province|Riau Archipelago Malay]] [[subdialect]] spoken in [[Natuna]] and [[Anambas]] islands in the [[South China Sea]], together forming a [[dialect continuum]] between the [[Borneo|Bornean]] Malay with the Mainland [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]]/[[Sumatra]]n Malay.

Nonetheless, the essential unity of Pahang and Terengganu Malay is demonstrated by the number of shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations. Both varieties along with [[Kelantan Malay]], have been classified under the subgroup of the East Coast dialect of [[Malay peninsula]], due to their possible common origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pahang Malay is known for its sharp rise and fall of tone and quick flowing accent. It exhibits a number of differences from the [[Standard Malay]], particularly in phonology and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it also shares a lot of similarities with standard Malay, the dialect in its purest form remains unintelligible to standard Malay speakers. There are a number of sub-dialects of Pahang Malay identified by linguists, but the form spoken in the vicinity of Pahang's [[List of capitals in Malaysia|royal capital]], [[Pekan District|Pekan]], is considered as its 'standard sub-dialect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|2008|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialect is traditionally written in [[Jawi script]], but its role as the main writing language has been replaced with Standard Malay written in [[Rumi script|Rumi]]. A local radio station, [[Pahang FM]], broadcasts in this dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pahang Delights|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Pahang Malay is [[Exonym and endonym|natively]] referred to as ''base Pahang'' ({{IPA|/basɘ pahã&lt;sup&gt;ŋ&lt;/sup&gt;/}}; Standard Malay: ''bahasa Pahang'', بهاس ڤهڠ), or ''cakak Pahang'' ({{IPA|/tʃakaʔ pahã&lt;sup&gt;ŋ&lt;/sup&gt;/}}; Standard Malay: ''cakap Pahang'', چاكڤ ڤهڠ). However, in academic writings, it is alternatively known as ''bahasa Melayu Pahang'' or ''dialek Pahang''. The term Pahang itself originated from the name of the state which in turn derived from the name of [[Pahang River]], where the early civilisation in the state could have developed from.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many theories on the origin of the name Pahang. A local lore mentioned that it is derived from the corruption of the name ''[[:ms:Pokok Mahang|Mahang]]'' tree ([[Macaranga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tan|Tan|1978|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, William Linehan relates the early foundation of the state to the settlers from ancient Khmer civilisation, and claims its naming origin to the word ''saamnbahang'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: សំណប៉ាហាំង) meaning '[[tin]]', which abundantly found in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tan|Tan|1978|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest literary reference to the name 'Pahang' was from the chronicle of [[Liu Song dynasty]], ''[[Book of Song]]'', that records about two consecutive envoys received from the kingdom of '[[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pohuang]]' (alternatively 'Panhuang') between 449 and 457 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guy|2014|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
There are at least two theories on the origin of Pahang Malay. Asmah Omar identifies the settlements near the estuary of [[Pahang River]] and its adjacent areas, where the early civilisation of Pahang could have begun, as the place of origin of the dialect before it was diffused inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|2008|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes [[Pekan District|Pekan]], the historical capital of Pahang, which the subdialect of Pahang Malay spoken in the area is named after. This theory is consistent to the known details of Malay settlement patterns in Southeast Asia. Until the 19th century, the Malay population was riverine and maintaining inter-communal link by river and maritime routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory by Tarmizi Harsah, suggests that the dialect originated from Ulu Tembeling, in deep hinterland of Pahang. The theory is based on the study of a variant spoken in Ulu Tembeling, also known locally as ''cakap ulu'' ("the upstream speech") or ''base lama'' ("the old language").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2013|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it retains part of the general characteristics of Pahang Malay, the dialect of Ulu Tembeling has the special feature of consonantal diphthongisation at the end of words, which is one of its kind among Malay dialects of the peninsula. Another unique feature of the dialect is that it retains several phonological characteristics of [[History of the Malay language#Ancient Malay|Ancient Malay]] language, for example the use of vowel *i and *u, and the addition of glottal consonant at the last position in words ending with vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2013|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tarmizi's theory went against the commonly accepted Malay settlement patterns which began at river mouth and coastal areas before dispersing inland.

==Distribution==
Pahang Malay is almost exclusively spoken within the state of Pahang, though there are sizeable migrant communities of its native speakers in urban areas like [[Klang Valley]], and other states of the peninsula. Nevertheless, within the state of Pahang, there are at least two other distinct Malay varieties traditionally spoken. Coastal [[Terengganu Malay]], a relative variant with shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations, is spoken in narrow  strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicated spatial layering of different Malay variants, often within a few kilometres radius between hamlets of Pahang Malay speakers along the riverine systems and the Terengganu-speaking coastal fishermen villages, is influenced by the historical movement of Terengganu Malays to that area. For centuries, the coastal line stretching from Terengganu border to the [[Endau]] of Johor, was the heaven for temporary settlements of fishermen from Terengganu and Kelantan who came there during fishing season. Over the time, a well established communities began to develop in areas like [[Beserah]], [[Kuala Pahang]], and [[Kuala Rompin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dialect not related to Pahang Malay, is spoken in [[Tioman]] island of Pahang and Aur Islands of [[Johor]], and most closely related only to [[Sarawak Malay]], spoken across the [[South China Sea]] in northwest [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the existence these foreign and isolated Malay variants, Pahang Malay remains as the de facto official dialect of the state, predominantly spoken along the lining of its vast riverine systems.

==Sub-dialects==
Due to high divergences of the sub-dialects of Pahang Malay, their classifications remain unclear so far. Among the earliest attempt to classify these sub-dialects was by Asmah Omar who conducted her study based on the ''[[daerah]]'' (district). She enlisted 8 sub-dialects of Pahang Malay, namely the dialects of [[Pekan District|Pekan]], [[Benta]], [[Raub]], Ulu Tembeling, [[Rompin]], [[Temerloh]], [[Kuala Lipis]] and [[Bentong]]. She also named the sub-dialect spoken in the vicinity of Pekan, including the state capital, [[Kuantan]], as the 'standard sub-dialect' and the major source for other sub-dialects spoken inland. Her view is based on the prestige of Pekan and Kuantan as the main economic, cultural and administration centres of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asmah Omar|2008|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars like Collins and Tarmizi Harsah provided an alternative method in this dialectal study, focusing on the geographic units of river basins and coastal strips, rather than on the existing political boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the fact that the spread of these sub-dialects is independent of the political divisions of current Malaysian states. On the other hand, both river basins and coastal strips are the features of topography that have greatly shaped the earliest patterns of migration and settlement in the [[Malay world]] of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1989|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this, Tarmizi Harsah identified three main variants of Pahang Malay, spoken along the lining of three main rivers of Pahang; [[Pahang River]], [[Jelai River]] and [[Lipis River]]. He classified these variants further into two main sub-dialects; ''Hulu Pahang'' ('Upper Pahang') consisting Lipis and Jelai rivers variants, and ''Hilir Pahang'' ('Lower Pahang') consisting Pahang River variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Phonology===
In general, like many other dialects of Malay language, the differences between Pahang Malay and the Standard Malay are recognized through changes in phonology at the end of the words. The unique identity of Pahang Malay can be traced in three features of phonology; vowels before consonant [± coronal], [[alveolar trill]] and [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/-ai̯/|}} and {{IPA|/-au̯/}}. The contrast between [[coronal consonant|coronal]]s and [[peripheral consonant|non-coronal]]s is among the first feature recognised by Collins (1983, 1998) and Ajid Che Kob &amp; Mohd Tarmizi (2009). Although this feature is shared among all sub-dialects of Pahang, there are still different vowel realisation patterns found among those variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; These varied patterns are demonstrated in the following tables.

The Standard Malay [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|/-r/}}, at the end of words, is usually omitted in most Malay dialects. But the omitted sound will always be replaced with certain phonetic forms, either through the elongation of consonant or de-articulation of ''[[schwa]]''.  Both forms exist in Pahang Malay and described by linguists as 'very obvious'. Elongation of consonant can be seen in the use of {{IPA|[ɐː]}}, {{IPA|[ɔː]}} and {{IPA|[ɛː]}} in sub-dialect spoken along the Jelai River, while de-articulation of schwa is shown by sub-dialects spoken along the Pahang and Lipis rivers that utilise {{IPA|[ɐ&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common diphthongs found in Standard Malay, {{IPA|/-ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/-au̯/}} are not exist in Pahang Malay, as both are [[monophthongisation|monophthongised]] instead. This does not means that there are no diphthongs in the dialect at all. Pahang Malay acquired its [[diphthong]]s through the diphthongisation of [[monophthong]]s, for example vowel sounds {{IPA|/-i/}} and {{IPA|/-u/}} are diphthongised into {{IPA|[-ij]}} and {{IPA|[-uw]}}. This phenomenon is considered common among many Malay dialects. The following table shows some monophthong realisation for diphthongs {{IPA|/-ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/-au̯/}} in Pahang Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarmizi Hasrah|Rahim Aman|Shahidi A.H|2010|pp=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1596">The term '''''seriation''''' [mise en série] was proposed for use in [[semiotics]] by [[Jean Molino]] and derived from classical [[philology]]. Seriation "invokes the idea that any investigator, in order to assign some plausible meaning to a given phenomenon, must interpret it within a ''series'' of comparable phenomena." One cannot interpret what philology calls a ''hapax''; that is, an isolated phenomenon. Art historian Erwin Panofsky has explained the situation in very clear terms:
*'Whether we deal with historical or natural phenomena, the individual observation of phenomena assumes the character of a 'fact' only when it can be related to other, analogous observations in such a way that the whole series 'makes sense.' This 'sense' is, therefore, fully capable of being applied, as a control, to the interpretation of a new individual observation within the same range of phenomena. If, however, this new individual observation definitely refuses to be interpreted according to the 'sense' of the series, and if an error proves to be impossible, the 'sense' of the series will have to be reformulated to include the new individual observation' (1955, p.&amp;nbsp;35)" (1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;230–231).

A seriation is determined by the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

The [[Old Aramaic language]] was adopted by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC) when the Assyrians conquered the various [[Syro-Hittite states]] to its west. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] (546-332 BC), which rose after the fall of the Assyrian Empire, also retained Old Aramaic as its official language, and Old Aramaic remained the [[lingua franca]] of the region. During the course of the third and fourth centuries AD, the inhabitants of the region began to embrace Christianity.

Along with Latin and Greek, Syriac became one of "the three most important Christian languages in the early centuries" of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilken |first=Robert Louis |title=The First Thousand Years: A Global History of Christianity |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=978-0-300-11884-1 |page=26|date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1st century AD, Syriac became the vehicle of [[Syriac Christianity]] and culture, and the liturgical language of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Maronite Church]], and the [[Church of the East]], along with its descendants: the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]],  the [[Ancient Church of the East]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name="Indian Express"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/Bengaluru-Youth-Learn-Dying-Language-Preserve-It/2016/05/09/article3422438.ece |title=City Youth Learn Dying Language, Preserve It |website=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=May 9, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Catholic Church]], and the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]].

Syriac Christianity and language spread throughout [[Asia]] as far as the Indian [[Malabar Coast]]&lt;ref name="Indian Express" /&gt; and Eastern [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ji |first=Jingyi |title=Encounters Between Chinese Culture and Christianity: A Hermeneutical Perspective |year=2007 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |isbn=978-3-8258-0709-2 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxhyQJEUXq4C&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the medium of communication and cultural dissemination for the later [[Arabs]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Parthian Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]. Primarily a [[Christian]] medium of expression, Syriac had a fundamental cultural and literary influence on the development of [[Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beeston |first=Alfred Felix Landon |title=Arabic literature to the end of the Umayyad period |year=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-24015-4 |page=497 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0QkhaK4kBUC&amp;pg=PA497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which largely replaced it towards the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Angold391 /&gt; Syriac remains the [[sacred language]] of Syriac Christianity to this day.

Syriac is a Middle Aramaic language and, as such, a language of the [[Northwest Semitic languages]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]]. It is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]], a derivation of the [[Aramaic alphabet]].

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|right|alt=The distribution of the Syriac language in the Middle East and Asia|Although once a major language in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Eastern Arabia]], Syriac is now limited to the towns and villages in the [[Nineveh plains]], [[Tur Abdin]], the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] plains, in and around the cities of [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]] and [[Kirkuk]].]]
[[File:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|thumb|250px|An 11th-century Syriac [[manuscript]].]]
Syriac was the local accent of Aramaic in [[Edessa]], and evolved under the influence of the Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church into its current form. Before Arabic became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among Christian communities in the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Kerala]],&lt;ref name="Indian Express" /&gt; and remains so among the [[Terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac Christians]] to this day. It has been found as far afield as [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Great Britain]], with inscriptions written by Assyrian and Aramean soldiers of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Charlotte|title=When Syrians, Algerians and Iraqis patrolled Hadrian's Wall|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall|work=The Guardian|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Eesho Aramaic name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|''Yeshuʿ'', {{lang|he|ישוע}}, the Hebrew and Aramaic name of [[Jesus]]]]
The history of Syriac can be divided into three distinct periods:
* [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]], the language of the [[Syro-Hittite states]] of the [[Levant]] in the [[Early Iron Age]], was adopted as a lingua franca beside [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]
* Middle Syriac/Middle Syriac Aramaic ({{lang|syr|ܟܬܒܢܝܐ}} ''{{transl|syr|Kṯāḇānāyā}}'', "Literary Syriac"), which is divided into:
** Eastern Middle Syriac/Eastern Middle Syriac Aramaic (the literary and ecclesiastical language of the ethnic [[terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac Christians]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]])
** Western Middle Syriac/Western Middle Syriac Aramaic (the literary and ecclesiastical language of the largely Syriac members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]] and [[Maronite Church]]).
* "Modern Syriac"/"Modern Syriac Aramaic" is a term occasionally used to refer to the modern [[Neo-Aramaic languages]].&lt;ref name=lipinski&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward Lipiński|authorlink=Edward Lipiński|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0815-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if they cannot be positively identified as the direct descendants of attested Middle Syriac, they must have developed from closely related dialects belonging to the same branch of Aramaic, and the varieties spoken in Christian communities have long co-existed with and been influenced by Middle Syriac as a liturgical and literary language. In this terminology, Modern Syriac is divided into:
** Modern Western Syriac Aramaic ([[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] and [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]]). Note however that these are sometimes excluded from the category of "Modern Syriac".&lt;ref name=lipinski /&gt;
** Modern Eastern Syriac Aramaic ([[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], including [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] but the term usually is not used in reference to [[Neo-Mandaic]], another variety of Eastern Aramaic spoken by the [[Mandaeans]]).

The name "Syriac", when used with no qualification, generally refers to one specific dialect of Middle Aramaic but not to Old Aramaic or to the various present-day Eastern and Central Neo-Aramaic languages descended from it or from close relatives. The modern varieties are, therefore, not discussed in this article.

== Origins ==
In 132 BC, the kingdom of [[Osroene]] was founded in Edessa and Proto-Syriac evolved in that kingdom. Many Syriac-speakers still look to Edessa as the cradle of their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drijvers |first=H. J. W. |title=Cults and beliefs at Edessa |year=1980 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-06050-0 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69YUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are about eighty extant early Syriac inscriptions, dated to the first three centuries AD (the earliest example of Syriac, rather than Imperial Aramaic, is in an inscription dated to AD 6, and the earliest parchment is a deed of sale dated to AD 243). All of these early examples of the language are non-Christian. As an official language, Syriac was given a relatively coherent form, style and grammar that is lacking in other Old Eastern Aramaic dialects. The Syriac language split into a western variety used by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]es in upper Mesopotamia and western Syria, and an eastern dialect used in the Sasanian Empire controlled east used by the [[Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=SMzgBLT87MkC&amp;pg=PA652#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Semitic Languages: An International Handbook |author=Stefan Weninger |page=652 |year=2011 |isbn=9783110251586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary Syriac ==
{{Further information|Syriac literature}}

In the 3rd century, churches in Edessa began to use Syriac as the language of worship. There is evidence that the adoption of Syriac, the language of the Assyrian people, was to effect mission.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Much literary effort was put into the production of an authoritative translation of the Bible into Syriac, the [[Peshitta]] ({{lang|syr|ܦܫܝܛܬܐ}} {{transl|syr|Pšīṭtā}}). At the same time, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] was producing the most treasured collection of poetry and theology in the Syriac language.

In 489, many Syriac-speaking Christians living in the eastern reaches of the Roman Empire fled to the Sasanian Empire to escape persecution and growing animosity with Greek-speaking Christians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Christological differences with the Church of the East led to the bitter [[Nestorian Schism]] in the Syriac-speaking world. As a result, Syriac developed distinctive western and eastern varieties. Although remaining a single language with a high level of comprehension between the varieties, the two employ distinctive variations in pronunciation and writing system, and, to a lesser degree, in vocabulary.

Western Syriac is the official language of the [[West Syriac Rite]], practised by the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Catholic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Malabar Independent Syrian Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church.

Eastern Syriac is the liturgical language of the [[East Syriac Rite]], practised in modern times by the ethnic Assyrian followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church, the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian-Chaldean Catholic Church, as well as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in India.

Syriac literature is by far the most prodigious of the various Aramaic languages. Its corpus covers poetry, prose, theology, liturgy, hymnody, history, philosophy, science, medicine and natural history. Much of this wealth remains unavailable in critical editions or modern translation.

From the 7th century onwards, Syriac gradually gave way to [[Arabic]] as the spoken language of much of the region, excepting northern Iraq. The [[Mongol invasions and conquests]] of the 13th century, and the religiously motivated massacres of Syriac Christians by [[Timur]] further contributed to the rapid decline of the language. In many places outside of [[Upper Mesopotamia]], even in liturgy, it was replaced by Arabic.

==Grammar==
Many Syriac words, like those in other [[Semitic languages]], are built out of [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|triconsonantal roots]], collations of three Syriac consonants with variable vowel (and some consonant) sets as a "glue". For example, the root {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}}, ''{{transl|syc|ŠQL}}'', has the basic meaning of ''taking'', and the following are some words that can be formed from this root:

* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – {{transl|syc|šqal}}: "he has taken"
* {{lang|syc|ܢܫܩܘܠ}} – {{transl|syc|nešqol}}: "he will take, he was taking, he does take"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܘܠ}} – {{transl|syc|šqol}}: "take!"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – {{transl|syc|šāqel}}: "he takes, he is taking"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – {{transl|syc|šaqqel}}: "he has lifted/raised"
* {{lang|syc|ܐܫܩܠ}} – {{transl|syc|ʾašqel}}: "he has set out"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠܐ}} – {{transl|syc|šqālā}}: "a taking, burden, recension, portion or syllable"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܐ}} – {{transl|syc|šeqlē}}: "takings, profits, taxes"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠܘܬܐ}} – {{transl|syc|šaqluṯā}}: "a beast of burden"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܘܩܠܐ}} – {{transl|syc|šuqqālā}}: "arrogance"

=== Nouns ===
Most Syriac [[noun]]s are built from triliteral roots. Nouns carry [[grammatical gender]] (masculine or feminine), they can be either singular or plural in number (a very few can be dual) and can exist in one of three grammatical states. These states should not be confused with [[grammatical case]]s in other languages.

* The absolute state is the basic form of the noun – {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܝܢ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlin}}, "taxes".
* The emphatic state usually represents a definite noun – {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܐ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlē}}, "the taxes".
* The construct state marks a noun in relationship to another noun – {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܝ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlay}}, "taxes of...".

However, very quickly in the development of Classical Syriac, the emphatic state became the ordinary form of the noun, and the absolute and construct states were relegated to certain stock phrases (for example, {{lang|syc|ܒܪ ܐܢܫܐ/ܒܪܢܫܐ}}, {{transl|syc|bar nāšā}}, "man, person", literally "son of man").

In Old and early Classical Syriac, most [[genitive case|genitive]] noun relationships are built using the construct state, but contrary to the genitive case, it is the head-noun which is marked by the construct state. Thus, {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܝ ܡܠܟܘܬܐ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlay malkuṯā}}, means "the taxes of the kingdom". Quickly, the construct relationship was abandoned and replaced by the use of the relative particle {{lang|syc|ܕ}}, ''{{transl|syc|d-, da-}}''. Thus, the same [[noun phrase]] becomes {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܐ ܕܡܠܟܘܬܐ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlē d-malkuṯā}}, where both nouns are in the emphatic state. Very closely related nouns can be drawn into a closer grammatical relationship by the addition of a pronominal suffix. Thus, the phrase can be written as {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܝܗ ܕܡܠܟܘܬܐ}}, {{transl|syc|šeqlêh d-malkuṯā}}. In this case, both nouns continue to be in the emphatic state, but the first has the suffix that makes it literally read "her taxes" ("kingdom" is feminine), and thus is "her taxes, [those] of the kingdom".

[[Adjective]]s always agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. Adjectives are in the absolute state if they are [[predicative expression#Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicative]], but agree with the state of their noun if [[adjective#Attributive adjective|attributive]]. Thus, {{lang|syc|ܒܝܫܝ̈ܢ ܫܩ̈ܠܐ}}, ''{{transl|syc|bišin šeqlē}}'', means "the taxes are evil", whereas {{lang|syc|ܫܩ̈ܠܐ ܒܝ̈ܫܐ}}, ''{{transl|syc|šeqlē ḇišē}}'', means "evil taxes".

=== Verbs ===
Most Syriac verbs are built on triliteral roots as well. Finite verbs carry [[grammatical person|person]], gender (except in the first person) and number, as well as [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. The non-finite verb forms are the [[infinitive]] and the [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice|passive]] [[participle]]s.

Syriac has only two true [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] tenses: perfect and imperfect. Whereas these tenses were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] in Aramaic, they have become a truly temporal [[past tense|past]] and [[future tense|future]] tenses respectively. The [[present tense]] is usually marked with the [[participle]] followed by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] [[pronoun]]. However, such pronouns are usually omitted in the case of the third person. This use of the participle to mark the present tense is the most common of a number of ''compound'' tenses that can be used to express varying senses of tense and aspect.

Syriac also employs [[Derived stem|derived verb stems]] such as are present in other Semitic languages. These are regular modifications of the verb's root to express other changes in meaning. The first stem is the ground state, or ''{{transl|syc|Pəʿal}}'' (this name models the shape of the root) form of the verb, which carries the usual meaning of the word. The next is the intensive stem, or ''{{transl|syc|Paʿʿel}}'', form of the verb, which usually carries an [[Intensive word form|intensified meaning]]. The third is the extensive stem, or ''{{transl|syc|ʾAp̄ʿel}}'', form of the verb, which is often [[causative]] in meaning. Each of these stems has its parallel [[passive voice|passive]] conjugation: the ''{{transl|syc|ʾEṯpəʿel}}'', ''{{transl|syc|ʾEṯpaʿʿal}}'' and ''{{transl|syc|ʾEttap̄ʿal}}'' respectively. To these six cardinal stems are added a few irregular stems, like the ''{{transl|syc|Šap̄ʿel}}'' and ''{{transl|syc|ʾEštap̄ʿal}}'', which generally have an extensive meaning.

Phonetically, there is some variation in the pronunciation of Syriac in its various forms. The various Modern Eastern Aramaic vernaculars have quite different pronunciations, and these sometimes influence how the classical language is pronounced, for example, in public prayer. Classical Syriac has two major streams of pronunciation: western and eastern.

=== Consonants ===
Syriac shares with Aramaic a set of lightly-contrasted [[stop consonant|stop]]/[[fricative consonant|fricative]] pairs. In different variations of a certain lexical root, a root consonant might exist in stop form in one variation and fricative form in another. In the Syriac alphabet, a single letter is used for each pair. Sometimes a dot is placed above the letter (''quššāyā'' "strengthening"; equivalent to a [[dagesh]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) to mark that the stop pronunciation is required, and a dot is placed below the letter (''rukkāḵā'' "softening") to mark that the fricative pronunciation is required. The pairs are:
* Voiced [[labial consonant|labial]] pair – {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}
* Voiced [[velar consonant|velar]] pair – {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}
* Voiced [[dental consonant|dental]] pair – {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}}
* Voiceless [[labial consonant|labial]] pair – {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}
* Voiceless velar pair – {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}
* Voiceless dental pair – {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}

As with other Semitic languages, Syriac has a set of five [[emphatic consonant]]s. These are consonants that are articulated or released in the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] or slightly higher. The set consists of:
* [[Voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] – {{IPA|/ħ/}}
* [[Pharyngealization|Pharyngealized]] [[voiceless dental stop]] – {{IPA|/tˤ/}}
* [[Voiced pharyngeal fricative]] – {{IPA|/ʕ/}}
* Pharyngealized [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] – {{IPA|/sˤ/}}
* [[Voiceless uvular stop]] – {{IPA|/q/}}

Syriac also has a rich array of [[sibilant]]s:
* [[Voiced alveolar fricative]] – {{IPA|/z/}}
* [[Voiceless alveolar fricative]] – {{IPA|/s/}}
* Pharyngealized [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] – {{IPA|/sˤ/}}
* [[Voiceless postalveolar sibilant]] – {{IPA|/ʃ/}}

=== Vowels ===
As with most Semitic languages, the vowels of Syriac are mostly subordinated to consonants. Especially in the presence of an emphatic consonant, vowels tend to become mid-centralised.

Classical Syriac had the following set of distinguishable vowels:
* [[Close front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/i/}}
* [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/e/}}
* [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/ɛ/}}
* [[Open front unrounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/a/}}
* [[Open back unrounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/ɑ/}}
* [[Close-mid back rounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/o/}}
* [[Close back rounded vowel]] – {{IPA|/u/}}

In the western dialect, {{IPA|/ɑ/}} has become {{IPA|/o/}}, and the original {{IPA|/o/}} has merged with {{IPA|/u/}}. In eastern dialects there is more fluidity in the pronunciation of [[front vowel]]s, with some speakers distinguishing five qualities of such vowels, and others only distinguishing three. Vowel length is generally not important: [[close vowel]]s tend to be longer than [[open vowel]]s.

The open vowels form [[diphthong]]s with the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}. In almost all dialects, the full sets of possible diphthongs collapses into two or three actual pronunciations:
* {{IPA|/ɑj/}} usually becomes {{IPA|/aj/}}, but the western dialect has {{IPA|/oj/}}
* {{IPA|/aj/}}, further, sometimes [[monophthong]]ized to {{IPA|/e/}}
* {{IPA|/aw/}} usually becomes {{IPA|/ɑw/}}
* {{IPA|/ɑw/}}, further, sometimes monophthongized to {{IPA|/o/}}

'''Vahe-Vahian''' (''Armenian'': Վահէ-Վահեան), born '''Sarkis Abdalian''' (22 December 1908, [[Gürün]] Turkey, died in 1998, [[Beirut]], Lebanon), was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] poet, writer, editor, pedagogue and orator.&lt;ref name="asbarez1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/37108/famous-poet-editor-and-writer-vahe-vahian-dies/|title=Famous Poet Editor and Writer Vahe Vahian Dies|date=25 August 1998|publisher=''[[Asbarez]]''|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics|year=2012|page=85|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1400841429|author1=Stephen Cushman |author2=Clare Cavanagh |author3=Jahan Ramazani |author4=Paul Rouzer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Vahe-Vahian was the fifth son of his parents; Hagop Abdalian, a merchant, and Azniv Vartabedian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who's Who in Lebanon |year=2004 |publisher=Publitec Publications |isbn=290318822X |page=324 |accessdate=September 13, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmhmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Vahe+Vahian&amp;dq=Vahe+Vahian}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, with his two elder sisters and mother survived the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915.  As a kid, Vahe-Vahian had been the ocular witness of the assassination of his two brothers and father, and those atrocious scenes haunted him the rest of his life.  After the many vicissitudes of his life, he completed his tertiary studies in 1930, with a BSc in Structural Engineering from the [[American University of Beirut]]. The next four years he taught physics and mathematics to the upper classes in [[Broumana High School]], and then, in 1935 he was invited to Melkonian Institute of Education in Nicosia, Cyprus, as lecturer of Armenian language and literature.

In 1936, in Melkonian, Vahe-Vahian met Ashkhen Shadan, a fellow teacher, and got married in 1938.  They had three children, Tsolak, Vahram and Shogher.

The death of Ashkhen in 1955 left her husband consumed.  Vahe-Vahian, besides his daily occupation as a teacher to meet the needs of his family, was struggling at the time with the publication of ''Ani'', an Armenian monthly of Literature and Art, which was interrupted for a while. In 1968, Vahe-Vahian published a series of poems dedicated to his departed wife under the title of Մատեան Սիրոյ եւ Մորմոքի (''Book of Love and Grief'').

In 1957 Vahe-Vahian remarried to Anahid Topjian, and they had a daughter Sheila (1958).  His book of poems, Ղօղանջ ու Մրմունջ Վերջալուսային (''Twilight Chime and Murmur'') (1990) is dedicated to Anahid for her affactionate and coddling support.

In 1976, Vahe-Vahian, for a second time, was devastated by the death of Vahram in a car-crash, and described his shock and grief in a book of 29 poems, Յուշարձան Վահրամիս (''Monument in Memory to Vahram) (1977).  He first learned about the death of his son, when he was travelling around the United States and Canada on a fund raising mission for bereaved Armenians in Lebanon.

In his twenties, Vahe-Vahian had an emotionally intense sentimental life, appropriate to his young age.  In the third section "Intimate letters" of the book Բանաստեղծին Սիրտը (''The Heart of the Poet'') (2012), we encounter his first platonic love letter to Mrs. Lucie Potoukian (Tosbath), written at the age of 24.  Later, he, with a greater out-pouring of emotions, corresponds with the elder sister of Lucie, Siran Seza, a prose writer and the editor of newly published''Yeridasart Hayouhi''  Երիտասարդ Հայուհի (''The Young Armenian''), and with Alice Sinanian. Chronologically, from the first and to the last letter addressed to Siran Seza (11 September 1935), these love letters demonstrate the noble, sincere and genuine sentiments of the author, written in the sweet resonance and the magnificent architecture of the Western Armenian language, different from the language of his other letters, and which can certainly be considered as a literary tour de force by itself.
From 1946 onwards to his death in 1998, Vahe-Vahian took the decision to live and stay in Lebanon, despite the continuous civil war in the area from 1975 to 1990, with the strong conviction that the dismantling of the Armenian Community in Lebanon would be the last blow of mercy to the Armenian Diaspora.

His primary education in the local 'Armenian National School' in [[Gürün]] was interrupted in 1914 by the deportation.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardakjian|first=Kevork B.|title=A Reference Guide to Modern Armenian Literature 1500-1920|year=2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0-8143-2747-8|pages=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bR7hMqV3Ij0C&amp;pg=PA682&amp;lpg=PA682&amp;dq=vahe+vahean#v=onepage&amp;q=vahe%20vahean&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he lived the terror of Turkish atrocities, which was occasionally reflected in his literature.

Surviving the [[Armenian Genocide]] as an orphan, after having been forced out of Turkey, in 1919 he returned to [[Aintab]] at the [[armistice]] with his mother, where he attended the local 'Vartanian School'. In 1921 he finally settled in [[Aleppo]] (Syria), where he continued his studies at the Armenian Evangelical School, which later became the [[Aleppo College]] run by American missionaries. Still eager to learn, in 1925 he enrolled in the [[American University of Beirut]] where he gained a B.S. degree in Structural Engineering in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Princeton Handbook of Multicultural Poetries |last=Brogan |first=Terry V.

== Career ==

In 1931 he commenced teaching Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at [[Brummana High School|Broumana Senior High School]] in Lebanon. In 1935 he was invited to assume the Armenian Language and Literature position vacated by [[Vahan Tekeyan]] at the [[Melkonian Educational Institute]].

In the autumn of 1946 he moved to Beirut where he launched the monthly magazine 'Ani' &lt;ref name="asbarez1998" /&gt; of Armenian Literature and Art acting as the editor for the next 9 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Armenian Mirror-Spectator|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2011/09/29/on-the-90th-anniversary-of-adl-prof-parounag-tovmassian-a-true-leader-still-inspires-20-years-after-his-death/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ani has served as a pacesetter in modern Armenian literature by introducing new works from Armenia to Diaspora readers, and nurturing young talents in the Diaspora.

In 1947 he was appointed part-time teacher of Armenian Language and Literature in senior high schools in Beirut, patronised by the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (AGBU).

In 1964 he founded the 'Yervant Hussissian Armenology Institute' in Beirut,&lt;ref name="asbarez1998" /&gt; and held the position of Principal and lecturer of Armenian Language and Literature. Over the span of a decade, hundreds of Armenian teachers were educated to subsequently pursue their chosen profession at different Armenian institutions all over the world.

Holder of several social and cultural posts in the Armenian community, both in Cyprus and Lebanon, he was invited to Armenia on several occasions in 1946, 1975, 1978 and 1981 to participate in literary conferences, attended university celebrations of outstanding historical events and met with prolific Armenian writers of the time.

Always on the go, first in 1946 then in 1976, during the devastating situation of the Armenians at the start of the civil war in Lebanon, he was sent on a mission to the USA and Canada to undertake fundraising activities organised by the Central Committee of AGBU in America on behalf of bereaved Armenians in Lebanon.

In 1970, the Catholicosate of Antelias (Lebanon) presented him with the Gold Medal for his prolific career as an educator and a writer. He was also awarded, the order of [[Saint Mesrop Mashtots]] by Armenia's Cultural Ministry for his devotion to Armenian culture and heritage in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harout|first=Melkonian|title=Vahe Vahian's legacy|newspaper=Zartonk Daily|date= 6 Oct 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 and 1978 respectively, he edited and published with detailed prefaces, the works of eminent poets Madtheos Zarifian and [[Vahan Tekeyan]].&lt;ref name="WorldCat Library Content"&gt;{{cite web|title=WorldCat Library Content|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AVah%C4%93-Vahian%2C&amp;qt=results_page|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Valyrian languages''' are a fictional [[language family]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of fantasy novels by [[George R. R. Martin]], and in their television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

In the novels, High Valyrian and its descendant languages are often mentioned, but not developed beyond a few words. For the TV series, linguist [[David J. Peterson]] created the High Valyrian language, as well as the derivative languages Astapori and Meereenese Valyrian, based on the fragments given in the novels.&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 31 March 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

In the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', High Valyrian occupies a cultural niche similar to that of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="TIME 3 May 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tharoor |first=Ishaan |title=Tongues of Ice and Fire: Creating the Languages in ''Game of Thrones'' |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/05/03/tongues-of-ice-and-fire-creating-the-languages-of-game-of-thrones/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novels describe it as no longer being used as a language of everyday communication, but rather as a language of learning and education among the nobility of Essos and Westeros, with much literature and song composed in Valyrian.

===Creation===
[[File:David J. Peterson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|David J. Peterson, creator of the Valyrian spoken language for ''Game of Thrones'']]
To create the [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]] and Valyrian languages to be spoken in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', [[HBO]] selected the linguist [[David J. Peterson]] through a competition among [[constructed language|conlangers]]. The producers gave Peterson a largely free hand in developing the languages, as, according to Peterson, George R. R. Martin himself was not very interested in the linguistic aspect of his works.&lt;ref name="TIME 3 May 2013" /&gt; The already published novels include only a few words of High Valyrian, including ''valar morghulis'' ("all men must die"), ''valar dohaeris'' ("all men must serve") and ''dracarys'' ("dragonfire"). For the forthcoming novel ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'', Peterson has supplied Martin with additional Valyrian translations.&lt;ref name="TIME 3 May 2013" /&gt;

Peterson commented that he considered Martin's choice of ''dracarys'' unfortunate because of its (presumably intended) similarity to the Latin word for dragon, ''{{lang|la|draco}}''. Because the [[Latin Language|Latin language]] does not exist in the fictional world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', Peterson chose to treat the similarity as coincidental and made ''dracarys'' an independent [[lexeme]];&lt;ref name="Peterson 22 April 2013 comment-1257"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J. Peterson |url=http://www.dothraki.com/2013/04/sesir-urnebion-z%c8%b3hon-keliton-issa/#comment-1257 |title=Sesīr Urnēbion Zȳhon Keliton Issa (comment at 10:12 pm) |publisher=Dothraki.com |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his High Valyrian term for dragon is ''zaldrīzes''. The phrases ''valar morghulis'' and ''valar dohaeris'', on the other hand, became the foundation of the language's [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] system.&lt;ref name="TIME 3 May 2013" /&gt; Another word, ''trēsy'', meaning "son", was coined in honour of Peterson's 3000th Twitter follower.&lt;ref name="Declension party"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson | first=David J. |authorlink=David J. Peterson |url=http://www.dothraki.com/2013/05/t%C8%B3ni-tresi/ |title=Tȳni Trēsi |publisher=Dothraki.com |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson did not create a High Valyrian [[writing system]] at the time, but he commented that he "was thinking something more like Egyptian's system of [[hieroglyph]]s—not in style, necessarily, but in their functionality. Egyptian had an alphabet, of sorts, a couple of phonetically-based systems, and a logography all layered on top of one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

At the start of June 2013, there were 667 High Valyrian words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

Vowels with a macron over them (ī, ȳ, ū, ē, ō and ā) are long, held for twice as long as short vowels. Some words are distinguished simply by their vowel length in High Valyrian. The rounded vowels {{angle bracket|ȳ}} and {{angle bracket|y}} may not be pronounced in modern High Valyrian, as a non-native or [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] language and did not survive into the descendant languages. As a result, while [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s first name may generally be pronounced {{IPA|[də.ˈnɛː.ɹɪs]}} by characters in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', in High Valyrian it would have been closer to {{IPA|[ˈdae.ne.ɾys]}}, with a [[diphthong]] in the first syllable and a [[close front rounded vowel|rounded vowel]] in the last. The long vowels have also been lost in some derived languages; in [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|season 3]] of ''Game of Thrones'', we hear Astapori Valyrian, from which all long vowels have been lost.&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 8 April 2013"/&gt;

Syllable stress is penultimate unless the penultimate syllable is [[syllable weight|light]] and the antepenultimate syllable is heavy, in which case stress is on the antepenultimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

===Grammar===

====Nouns====
There are four [[grammatical number]]s in High Valyrian — [[singular number|singular]], [[plural]], [[paucal]] and [[collective noun|collective]].

There are four [[grammatical gender]]s, which do not align with biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

: ''hūrenkon qogror'' — "lunar class",
: ''vēzenkon qogror'' — "solar class",
: ''tegōñor qogror'' — "terrestrial class",
: ''embōñor qogror'' — "aquatic class".

[[Animacy|Animate]] and [[individuation|individuatable]] nouns are generally in the lunar or solar classes, while other nouns are generally classified as terrestrial or aquatic. The names of the classes derive from the nouns themselves, which are prototypical members of each gender.&lt;ref name="Noun classes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

According to Peterson, "what defines declension classes in High Valyrian" can be divined by paying "close attention to the singular and plural numbers" and noting "where cases are conflated and where they aren't".&lt;ref name="Conjugation party"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dothraki.com/2013/05/some-high-valyrian-inflection/ |title=Some High Valyrian inflection |authorlink=David J.

It is possible to tell which paradigm is in use from the [[grammatical person|first person]] [[plural]] [[indicative]] — consonant stems will always end in ''-i'', whereas vowels stems will end in ''-ī''.&lt;ref name="Conjugation party"/&gt; Verbs with stems ending in a vowel follow a pattern where that stem-terminal vowel might change — ''-a'' and ''-i'' do not change, ''-e'' becomes ''-i'', but ''-o'' and ''-u'' both become ''-v''.&lt;ref name="Conjugation party"/&gt; Verb stems may never end in a long vowel or a diphthong.&lt;ref name="Conjugation party"/&gt; There is a subjunctive mood that is not only used in subordinate clauses, but also in all negative statements.&lt;ref name="artoflanguageinvention142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Language Invention|first=David J.|last=Peterson|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson |url=http://www.dothraki.com/2013/07/valyrian-adjectives/ |title=Valyrian Adjectives |publisher=Dothraki.com |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like verbs, adjectives only have two number forms — a singular, which is also used for the collective, and a plural, also used for paucal numbers.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt; Adjectives may be both prepositive (e.g. "the ''white'' shoe") or [[post-positive adjective|post-positive]] (e.g. "the body ''politic''"); when prepositive some further rules apply.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;

Several forms of [[elision]] and [[assimilation (linguistics)|consonant assimilation]] occur with prepositive adjectives:

* With inflections of two syllables (such as ''kast'''oti''''' in several class {{rn|I}} plurals), the second syllable is often lost to elision; word-final ''-t'' is also lost before consonants — compare ''ader'''ot''' ābrot'' ("to the quick woman") with ''ader'''o''' Dovaogēdot'' ("to the quick Unsullied").&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;
* When such elision causes a word-final ''-z'' (such as with the class {{rn|I}} ''kasta'' becoming ''kastyzy'' ([[nominative case|nom.]]) and ''kastyzys'' ([[vocative case|voc.]]) in the lunar plurals, below), the final ''-z'' is [[consonant voicing and devoicing|devoiced]] to ''-s'' when it precedes a voiceless consonant — compare ''kast'''ys''' hobresse'' ("blue goats") with ''kast'''yz''' dāryssy'' ("blue kings"), both forms from ''kastyzy'', the lunar nominative plural.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;
* If the syllable in question is vowel–consonant–vowel, then only the final vowel is elided — compare ''ānogro ēl'''ȳro''''' ("of the first blood") to ''ēl'''ȳr''' ānogro'' ("of the first blood").&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;
* Whereas [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms are generally listed as containing ''-s-'' or ''-ss-'' and [[comitative case|comitative]] forms generally contain ''-m-'' or ''-mm-'', some nouns use only the ''s''-forms in both cases and some nouns use the ''m''-forms for both. When this occurs, the consonant in question experiences [[consonant harmony]], causing the use of what might otherwise be a comitative form for an instrumental and vice versa, {{citation needed span|such as with the examples given of class {{rn|III}} vowel mutations below,|date=July 2013}} where the forms appear to be instrumental ("by means of the ... men", "by means of the ... rains"), despite being comitative ("accompanying the ... man", "accompanying the ... rains").&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;
* Finally, word-final ''-m'' is decreasingly common in High Valyrian. Contracted inflections that end in ''-m'' will often assimilate to ''-n'' unless the next word begins with a vowel or a [[labial consonant]].&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;

=====Class I adjectives=====
Class {{rn|I}} adjectives decline differently for each of the four noun classes.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt; The exemplar is ''kasta'', meaning "[[distinction of blue and green in various languages|blue and green]]".&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt; As before, in the following tables, adjacent case conflations are merged into the same table cell; other cases that share a form with another are underlined.

=====Class II and III adjectives=====
Adjective classes {{rn|II}} and {{rn|III}} both conflate rather more forms, failing to distinguish between solar and lunar nouns and failing to distinguish between terrestrial and aquatic nouns.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt; Class {{rn|II}} also has some subclasses, that have not yet been detailed.&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt; The exemplars used here are the class {{rn|II}} adjective ''adere'' ("sleek, smooth, slippery, fast, quick") and the class {{rn|III}} adjective ''ēlie'' ("first").&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;

Class {{rn|III}} adjectives also experience vowel changes when subject to the elision described above. When a lunar or solar form is elided to a syllable containing ''-ȳ-'' (such forms are highlighted in the table below), this ''-ȳ-'' mutates to ''-io-''; this does not occur with terrestrial or aquatic forms. Compare:&lt;ref name="Adjectives"/&gt;

: ''valosa ēl'''ȳse''''' — "with the first man" (''vala'' is a lunar noun of the first declension)&lt;ref name="Declension party"/&gt;
: ''ēl'''ios''' valosa'' — "with the first man"
: ''daomȳssi ēl'''ȳssi''''' — "with the first rains" {{citation needed span|(''daomio'' is a lunar noun of the third declension)|date=July 2013}}

=== Duolingo course ===

Since {{date|31 October 2016|mdy}} a course in High Valyrian for English speakers has been in the works at the [[Duolingo]] Language Incubator. David J. Peterson is one of the contributors to the course.&lt;ref name="duolingo-wikia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duolingo.wikia.com/wiki/High_Valyrian_for_English|title=High Valyrian for English|work=Duolingo Wiki|accessdate={{date|4 April 2017}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duolingo-incubator"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://incubator.duolingo.com/courses/hv/en/status|title=Course Status: High Valyrian for English Speakers|work=Duolingo Language Incubator|accessdate={{date|5 April 2017}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beta version was released on July 12, 2017.&lt;ref name="duolingo-wikia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duolingo-incubator"/&gt;

==Derivative languages==
In the world of the novel and TV series, the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Free Cities and vicinity|Nine Free Cities of Essos]] speak variants of High Valyrian, described by the character [[List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters#Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] in ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'' as "not so much a [[dialect]] as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues".&lt;ref&gt;''A Dance with Dragons'', Tyrion I.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]] speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dothraki.com/2014/05/the-state-of-valyrian/ The State of Valyrian]&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, "If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dothraki.com/2014/05/the-valyrian-word-for-hamster/ The Valyrian Word for Hamster]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between [[classical Latin]] and the [[Romance languages]], or more accurately between [[Classical Arabic]] and the [[varieties of Arabic|modern varieties of Arabic]], in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 22 April 2013" /&gt;

===Astapori Valyrian===
{{Quote box
|quote  = ''Si kizy vasko v’uvar ez zya gundja yn hilas.'' &lt;p&gt;"And this because I like the curve of her ass."
|source = — Astapori Valyrian, ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', season 3, [[Walk of Punishment|episode 3]]&lt;ref name="Vulture 23 April 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Denise |title=Learn to speak Dothraki and Valyrian from the man who invented them for ''Game of Thrones'' |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/game-of-thrones-dothraki-language-inventor.html |accessdate=24 April 2013 |newspaper=Vulture |date=23 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first derivative Valyrian language to be featured in the series was Astapori Valyrian, a variety from the city of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Astapor|Astapor]] in Slaver's Bay. It appeared in the third-season premiere episode "[[Valar Dohaeris]]".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="CNN What's Next"&gt;{{Cite web |first=David |last=Peterson |authorlink=David J. Peterson |url=http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/29/david-peterson-and-the-languages-of-game-of-thrones/ |title=David Peterson and the languages of ''Game of Thrones'' |work=[[CNN]] What's Next |accessdate=4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) and most [[diphthong]]s.&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 8 April 2013"/&gt; Between vowels, [b, d, g] have become [v, ð, ɣ]; subsequently, [p, t, k] have become [b, d, g] in the same environment.&lt;ref name="artlanguage168169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=David J.|title=The Art of Language Invention|page=168-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, an "Unsullied" is rendered as ''Dovaogēdy'' {{IPA|[do.vao.ˈɡeː.dy]}} in High Valyrian, but as ''Dovoghedhy'' {{IPA|[do.vo.ˈɣe.ði]}} in Astapori.&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 8 April 2013"/&gt; Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the [[grammatical case|case system]] of High Valyrian, so the [[word order]] is more reliably [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three [[definite article]]s: ''ji'' {{IPA|[ˈʒi]}} (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian ''ziry'' {{IPA|[ˈzi.ry]}} "him/her (accusative)"), ''vi'' {{IPA|[ˈvi]}} (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian ''ūī'' {{IPA|[ˈuː.iː]}} "it (accusative)"), and ''po'' {{IPA|[ˈpo]}} (plural, derived from High Valyrian ''pōnte'' {{IPA|[ˈpoːn.te]}} "them (accusative)").&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 8 April 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artlanguage196"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=David J.|title=The Art of Language Invention|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an indefinite article, ''me'' {{IPA|[ˈme]}}, derived from High Valyrian ''mēre'' {{IPA|[ˈmeː.re]}} ("one").&lt;ref name="artlanguage196"/&gt; [[Stress (linguistics)|Word stress]] is less predictable than in High Valyrian, but commands are stressed word-finally (for example: ''ivetrá'').&lt;ref name="Dothraki.com 15 April 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

Fowler]],&lt;ref&gt;''See'', for example, Collinson (1927) p. 127; Wordsworth (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase was in fact coined by the historian Archibald Ballantyne in an article entitled ''Wardour Street English'', published in [[Longman's Magazine]] in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; in which, for example, he characterized [[William Morris]]'s translation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' as “not literary English of any date; this is Wardour-Street Early English—a perfectly modern article with a sham appearance of the real antique about it.”&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne (1888) p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase appeared sporadically thereafter in literary criticism, particularly in reference to Morris's work,&lt;ref&gt;''See'', for examples, Anonymous (1890), Sainsbury (1912) p. 435, Ball (1931) p. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a brief mention of "antiquarian rubbish, Wardour Street English" in ''[[The King's English]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Fowler and Fowler (1906) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; by the brothers H.W. and [[F.G. Fowler]], but it was the article ''Wardour Street'' in ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'', written by H.W. Fowler after his brother's death, that gave the expression broad currency.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler (1926) p. 700&lt;/ref&gt; In his typical idiosyncratic style, Fowler wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As Wardour Street itself offers to those who live in modern houses the opportunity of picking up an antique or two that will be conspicuous for good or ill among their surroundings, so this article offers to those who write modern English a selection of oddments calculated to establish (in the eyes of some readers) their claim to be persons of taste &amp; writers of beautiful English.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Words deprecated by Fowler include such examples as ''anent, aught, ere, erstwhile, haply, maugre, oft, perchance, thither, to wit, varlet, withal'' and ''wot''. Some words that Fowler found objectionable, such as ''albeit, for(e)bears'' and ''proven'' have found their way into normal English idiom and have been replaced in more recent editions of ''Modern English Usage'' by, amongst others, ''betimes, peradventure, quoth'' and ''whilom''.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield (2004) p. 833&lt;/ref&gt; None of these lists is exhaustive.

Wardour Street English includes not only an incongruous choice of vocabulary, but also pseudo-archaic sentence structure. Fowler, in the first edition of ''Modern English Usage'', criticized the use of inverted protasis with ''had'', ''should'' and ''were'' (as in 'Had he done this, then…', rather than 'If he had done this, then…'), although this objection does not appear in later editions. A more recent edition&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield (2015) p. 870&lt;/ref&gt; gives as examples the, at first glance, almost incomprehensible 'Bread and wine needs a man to fight and die' and 'Us enchants he, but eke frightens.'

As Butterfield&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield (2015) p. 870&lt;/ref&gt; points out, 21st Century critics are more likely to be exercised by what is in many respects the opposite process, namely the incongruous use of modern vernacular in popular broadcast [[period drama]]s. An example of this is the number of web pages devoted to pointing out, and arguing over, anachronistic language in the popular British television programme ''[[Downton Abbey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Examples, among many others, include 
[https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/downton-abbey-tracking-the-anachronisms/ "Downton Abbey": Tracking the Anachronisms]; [http://www.prochronism.com/2014/02/downton-abbey-season-4.html Prochronisms: Downton Abbey, Season 4]; [http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/02/09/downton_abbey_anachronisms_watch_a_video_of_all_the_lines_actual_edwardians_would_never_say.html Did You See This?

''See'' BBC: [https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-28794870 Downton Abbey: Plastic bottle appears in promotional photo]&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the deliberate Wardour Street English, the producers have agreed that the language has been modernized in order to allow modern audiences to "relate to" the characters.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11912408/Downton-Abbey-viewers-should-stop-picking-holes-in-it-says-shows-producer.html Downton Abbey producer admits language is dumbed down to make characters sound more 'like us']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HITRON MH-65C Fires warning shots.jpg|thumb|A [[Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron|United States Coast Guard helicopter]] firing warning shots at a non-compliant boat during training.]]

A '''warning shot''' is a [[military]] and/or [[police]] term describing an intentionally harmless [[artillery]] shot or [[gunshot]] with intent to enact direct compliance and order to a hostile perpetrator or enemy forces. It is recognized as signalling intended confrontations on land, sea, and air.

As an analogy, "warning shot" can be said of any action of declaration, especially a demonstration of power, intended or perceived as a last warning before hostile measures.

==Uses==

===Nautical===
During the 18th century, a warning shot (in nautical terms, often called a '''shot across the [[bow (ship)|bow]]''') could be fired towards any ship whose "[[Ensign|colours]]" (nationality) had to be ascertained. According to the [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]], a ship thus hailed had to fly her flag and confirm it with a gunshot. Warning shots may still be used in modern times to signal a vessel to stop or keep off and may be fired from other ships, boats, or aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webaircraft/AC_HITRON_History.asp U.S. Coast Guard HITRON Jacsonville]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352579,00.html|title=Navy-Contracted Vessel Fires Warning Shots on Fast Boats in Persian Gulf|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
Warning shots are also used in [[military aviation]], to demand some action of an unresponsive and presumed hostile aircraft; the most common demand would be for the aircraft to change course. The ostensible justification for firing shots is that [[Tracer ammunition|tracer rounds]] are very bright and would immediately gain the attention of a crew whose radio is non-functioning, or who might not have noticed radio transmissions. The objective of warning shots is to demonstrate the ability to shoot, and threaten the crew of the unresponsive aircraft that they will be shot down if they do not comply.

In [[telecommunications]] business, a '''white route''' is a route where both source and destination are legal termination.
This is opposed to a '''black route''', which is a route that is illegal in both ends.  Also common in telecom (especially [[VoIP]]) is the term '''grey route''', which defines a route that is legal for one country or the party on one end, but illegal on the alternative end.

An example of the white/grey/black trichotomy is often seen in telecom routes from the United States to India.  In India, a telecom oligopoly is granted to a few large corporations.  Hence, all legal ("white") telecom traffic to the country is subject to the rates imposed by these corporations.  To overcome this restriction for the purpose of achieving lower costs for consumers, and to make a profit in the process, many small parties set up [[VoIP]] routers in homes and offices around India.  Telecom traffic from the Foreign Countries like USA, UK is sent to these VoIP routers via [[Internet Protocol|IP]] and terminated to the local Indian [[PSTN]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = TECHNICAL NOTE ON ILLEGAL INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE IN INDIA|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294927963|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is illegal in India ("black"), but completely lawful in the USA ("white").  A route like this, white on one end and black on the other is said to be "grey".

==SIM boxes==
A "[[SIM box]]" is an unofficial voice over IP gateway which uses multiple [[mobile telephone]]s and [[SIM card]]s for PSTN connectivity, while connecting to the Internet by conventional means. These are normally operated clandestinely in third-world calling destinations as the "black" end of a "grey route" where conventional [[private branch exchange]] lines (such as [[T-carrier]] [[primary rate interface]]) are not available to VoIP operators due to a hostile local regulatory environment.

In India, for instance, an Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity as voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following [[E.164]] numbering is prohibited in India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By using licensing restrictions and regulations to ensure that the interconnection between the PSTN/PLMN network and Internet is not permitted, the government in India delivers a lucrative monopoly to International Long Distance (ILD) service providers licensed under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act as the only carriers officially allowed to carry international long distance traffic into India.

'''Wilhelm Molly''' (1838–1919) was a doctor, [[Philately|philatelist]], [[Activism|activist]], and [[Esperantist]].&lt;ref name="moresnet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neutral-Moresnet History 1916–1919 |publisher=moresnet.nl |date= |url=http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm |accessdate=17 July 2016 |archiveurl=http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm |archivedate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the chief medical doctor of the [[Vieille Montagne]] mining company.

As an avid philatelist, he tried to organize a local postal service with its own stamps. This enterprise was quickly thwarted by Belgian intervention.&lt;ref name="moresnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moresnet2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stamps and postal history |publisher=moresnet.nl |date= |url=http://www.moresnet.nl/english/postverkeer_en.htm |accessdate=17 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420132008/http://www.moresnet.nl/english/postverkeer_en.htm |archivedate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weber |first=Saine |title=Amikejo, Ort der Freundschaft |publisher=Deutschlandfunk |language=German |date=12 May 2008 |url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/amikejo-ort-der-freundschaft.1247.de.html?dram:article_id=190076 |accessdate=17 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Molly proposed to make Neutral Moresnet the world's first state with [[Esperanto]] as its official language, named ''Amikejo'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} ''Place of Friendship'').&lt;ref name="moresnet"/&gt;

==Origins==

The term “winders” was originally coined in 2008 by the sociologist [[John W. Leigh]], in his article ''Moving towards new forms of social success'',&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;John W. Leigh, SIU, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/36664106/Moving-towards-new-forms-of-social-success Moving towards new forms of social success] 2008&lt;/ref&gt; describing the new forms of social success in the United States, and in Western societies. The term (a contraction of the expression “windy winners”) goes back to the original way of experiencing social success by individuals uninhibited with regards to their own success, not looking as much to reconcile rival existential expectations (such as the [[Bobos in Paradise|bobos]], for example) but rather to juxtapose them in a way which is not seeking to constitute a system.

==Description==
The analysis of this new group is positioned along the same lines as the social success models embodied respectively by [[yuppies]], “hardcore winners” (traders and other “golden boys” of the 1980s), and then [[Bobos in Paradise|bobos]]. It borrows from the [[critical theory|critical sociology]] of [[Michael Hartmann (sociologist)|Michael Hartmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hartmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A802Pz-IZ7cC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=%22michael+hartmann%22+sociology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I6-YOpOttH&amp;sig=ghUxFaZc15UEzg97yGs97ZT5VIE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2Ny2TPOqJsT24AamhL2_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Sociology of Elites] 2007, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; as well as employment sociologists [[Peter Meiksins]] and [[Peter Whalley]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meiskins and Peter Whalley, [http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/The_Network_News/4-2/TNN4-2_Meiskins.pdf Conversations with the Experts], 2002, Boston College&lt;/ref&gt; whose work ''Putting work in its place: a quiet revolution''&lt;ref name="A quiet Revolution"&gt;{{cite book | last = Meiskins | first = Peter | authorlink =  |author2=Whalley, Peter  | year = 2202 | title = Putting Work in Its Place: a Quiet Revolution
 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, NY | isbn = 978-0-8014-8952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
details the [[paradigm shift]] borne by the winders within the American employment market. As J. W. Leigh puts it: “In cultural terms, for example, he is a "multi-consumer": capable of frequenting art galleries or the screens of a public cinema, and listening to Haydn and Bach as much as Beyonce or Michael Jackson.”&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; To this regard, the winder is considered a “cultural omnivore”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Skiles, Omar Lizardo, [http://www.nd.edu/~olizardo/papers/soco-consumption.pdf Cultural consumption in the fine and popular arts realms], 2006, University of Notre Dame&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point of view, the “winder” is one of the many avatars of the ability of superior social classes to [[legitimation|legitimise]] their own situation via positive and always renewing [[value systems]].

'''Wine caves''' are subterranean structures for the [[storage (wine)|storage]] and [[aging of wine]]. They are an integral component of the wine industry worldwide. The design and construction of wine caves represents a unique application of [[underground construction]] techniques.

The storage of wine underground offers the benefits of energy efficiency and optimum use of limited land area. Wine caves naturally provide both high humidity and cool temperatures, which are key to the storage and aging of [[wine]].

==History==
The history of wine cave construction in the United States dates back to the 1860s in Sonoma, and the 1870s in the Napa Valley region. In 1857, Agoston Harazsthy founded [[Buena Vista Winery]] and in 1862, Buena Vista Winery's Press House was completed, and in 1864, a second building now called the Champagne Cellars was completed. In total, Buena Vista Winery had five caves among the two buildings in operation in 1864. Jacob Schram, a German immigrant and barber, founded [[Schramsberg Vineyards]] near [[Calistoga, California]] in 1862. Eight years later, Schram found new employment for the Chinese laborers who had recently finished constructing tunnels and grades over the Sierra Nevada Mountains for the Union Pacific Transcontinental Railroad. He hired them to dig a network of caves through the soft Sonoma Volcanics Formation rock underlying his vineyard.

Another Chinese workforce took time away from their regular vineyard work to excavate a labyrinth of wine-aging caves beneath the  Beringer Vineyards near St. Helena, California. These caves exceeded 1,200&amp;nbsp;ft (365 m) long, 17&amp;nbsp;ft (5 m) wide and 7&amp;nbsp;ft (2 m) high. The workers used pick-axes and shovels – and on occasion, chisel steel, double jacks and black powder – to break the soft rock. They worked by candlelight, and removed the excavated material in wicker baskets. At least 12 wine storage caves were constructed by these methods.

From the late 19th century to the early 1970s, the development of wine caves went through a long period of “dark ages.” No new caves were built, and many existing caves were abandoned or fell into disrepair. A “renaissance” of cave building began in 1972 when  [[Alf Burtleson Construction]] started the rehabilitation of the old Beringer wine caves, and was followed by the design and construction of new caves.

In 1982, the Far Niente Winery completed the first of these “new age” wine caves in the [[Napa Valley AVA]]. The cave was only 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18 m) long and was used exclusively to age the wine and to store empty barrels. In 1991, 1995, and 2001, the caves were expanded. New rooms and storage areas were added, featuring different crown heights and intriguing shapes. An octagonal room was constructed for a wine library and a round domed room was added in the complex’s center. Far Niente Winery caves now encompass about 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m²).

In 1991, [[Condor Earth Technologies Inc.]] joined with Alf Burtleson on the design and construction of the elaborate [[Jarvis wines|Jarvis]] Wine Cave project. Over 45,000 sq ft (4,200 m²) of underground winery and cave space was constructed, with cave spans exceeding 85&amp;nbsp;ft (25.5 m) in width. At Jarvis, the entire winery is contained within the tunneled areas, including crushing, fermentation, barrel storage, bottling, lab, office, marketing, and hospitality areas. These caves are open for public tours by appointment.

==Humidity==
High [[humidity]] minimizes [[evaporation]]. Wine makers consider humidity over 75% for reds and over 85% for whites to be ideal for wine aging and barrel storage. Humidity in wine caves ranges naturally from 70 to 90%.

In Northern California, [[wine barrel]] evaporation in a surface warehouse is on the order of 4 gallons (15.1 liters) per each 60 gallon (227 liter) barrel per year. In a wine cave, barrel evaporation is reduced to about 1 gallon (3.8 liters) per barrel per year.

Since red wines are usually barreled and aged for two years, this represents a 10% gross volume loss difference. For white wines, which are barreled and aged for about one year, a 5% loss difference is realized, a significant savings.

==Temperature==
The [[wine industry]] has long considered a constant temperature between 55&amp;nbsp;°F and 60&amp;nbsp;°F (13.0&amp;nbsp;°C and 15.5&amp;nbsp;°C) to be optimal for wine storage and aging. The air temperatures in Northern California result in a uniform underground temperature of about 58&amp;nbsp;°F (14.5&amp;nbsp;°C), optimal for wine caves. A surface warehouse requires energy to cool, heat, and humidify. While the most basic wine cave can cost over $100 per sq ft to construct, reduced energy costs result in a net savings over the long term.

==Land use==
In the Napa-Sonoma wine growing region, as in many areas of California, land values are high. Non-agricultural development is often restricted. A storage warehouse reduces the land available to grow grapes, impacts open space and natural habitats, and precludes other land uses. Land-use regulation in California places limitations on the types and locations of land development. Many land use restrictions and permitting requirements do not apply to underground space. As of 2004, there were an estimated 130 to 150 caves used for wine aging, barrel storage, and tasting rooms in Northern California.

==Marketing==
Marketing is an important component of the modern wine industry, and many caves serve varied marketing and public relations functions. Recently constructed caves contain commercial and private kitchens, wine libraries, concert and exhibit halls, staff offices, elevators, restrooms, and other amenities. Some have high-end interiors, including ceramic and stone flooring, masonry-lined walls and ceilings, sculpture and artwork, mood lighting, fountains, waterfalls, and chandeliers. At  [[Stag's Leap Wine Cellars]], a [[Foucault pendulum]] swings continuously across a bed of black sand in the central exhibit hall.

==Wine cave construction==
The challenge for the design and construction of most wine caves is to create a fairly wide span in weak rock with low cover. The size of a typical wine barrel storage cave is 13 to 18&amp;nbsp;ft (4 to 5.5 m) wide and 10 to 13&amp;nbsp;ft (3 to 4 m) high. Constructed caves, however, range up to 85&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) in width and 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15 m) in height; difficult to achieve in poor quality rock.

In areas of complex geology, good portal sites are hard to find. A typical wine cave is constructed with two or more portal sites, for safety and operational reasons. At least one portal leads directly outside, but in many cases at least one portal makes a direct connection to a winery building.

Most portals into the wine caves have rock/soil overburden heights less than 0.2 times their entrance heights and widths. The height of the portal face normally ranges from 12 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft (3.5 to 6 m). The portal areas are seldom stripped of the loose soil material and the portals are cut from the native ground surface using excavators. The side slopes of the portal are often laid back to 0.5H:1V or steeper, and the portal face is excavated to vertical or near vertical.

The construction of cave interiors can be complicated by the elaborate curves and labyrinth-style floor plans selected by some owners for their wine caves. As the ground surface slopes upward, providing more cover and usually sounder rock, caves can accommodate multiple drifts. Where possible, the cave is designed and constructed to provide at least 1.2 times their width of cover at intersections. Room and pillar layouts, similar to underground mine design, provide an economical construction arrangement. Tunnel legs are usually 30 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft (9 to 30 m) in length and pillars are typically a minimum of 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6 m) wide.

On most occasions, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method|New Austrian Tunneling Method]] (single or multiple face), also known now as Sequential Excavation Method (SEM), with minor innovative technology advances, is used to excavate and support wine caves.

The caves are typically excavated in an inverted horseshoe shape with a crown radius and with straight or curved legs. The tunnels are usually excavated using a tunnel roadheader or a milling head attachment on an excavator. The spoils behind the roadheader conveyor belt are dumped on the invert and mucked out using a rubber-tired skid loader or a load-haul-dump (LHD) mining machine.

Initially, the excavation advance is likely to be limited to 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6 m) without initial ground support. Once turned under, and depending on ground conditions, the unsupported advance may be increased to 4&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 m), 6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.8 m), and longer increments. The maximum advance without initial ground support may reach 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6 m) or more in stable volcanic ash tuff. In sheared serpentinite, deeply weathered lava rock or wet clayey ground, however, unstable ground conditions may limit the unsupported advance to less than 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6 m).

[[Shotcrete]] reinforcement and ground support is utilized at the tunnel portals and in the interior of the wine caves. At the portals, soil nail and shotcrete walls are typically used for permanent support and are constructed from the top down in lifts. Soil nails are installed 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart in the horizontal and vertical directions. The shotcrete is typically a minimum of 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) thick and reinforced with welded wire fabric. The typical 4,000 psi (28 MPa) design strength mix is applied using the wet process.

Within the caves, the initial ground support is usually fiber-reinforced [[shotcrete]]. A minimum of 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) thickness of wet mix shotcrete is applied around the exposed ground perimeter following each day’s advance. As cave dimensions and ground conditions require, additional layers of shotcrete and welded wire fabric follow on subsequent days. The shotcrete mix is a 4,000 psi (28 MPa) compressive strength design. In some cases, pattern or spot rock bolts are also installed. Where wider and taller halls are used, modeling is employed to assist with the liner design.

Interior finishing of the caves is an integral part of the construction process. [[Waterproofing]] details are important for the interiors of wine caves. Wet spots and water seeps are unsightly, and can cause maintenance and safety problems. Moisture vapor migration through the cave liner, however, is desirable to maintain humidity.

Most contractors install prefabrication drainage strips at regular intervals between the native ground and the shotcrete liner. The drain strips relieve the hydrostatic pressure, but have little effect on wet spots and water seeps. [[Xypex]] has been used for many years to mitigate seepage, either as a shotcrete admixture or spray applied, with relatively good success. Where excessive groundwater is present, membranes placed between successive shotcrete layers have been used. Many new products, including admixtures and membranes, are being evaluated and tested to improve moisture conditions. The wine cave industry in Northern California is at the forefront of waterproofing technology implementation.

After the cave complex has been completely excavated, waterproofed, and initially supported, a 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) thickness of final shotcrete or plain/colored gunite is applied to the walls and arch. Utility conduits and piping are encased within the final layer of shotcrete in the walls and arch and placed under the concrete floor slab. Reinforced concrete slabs are usually 6 in. (15&amp;nbsp;cm) thick and are underlain by subdrain.

To support their varied uses, wine cave complexes may contain as many as 13 different utility systems. These include systems for hot and cold domestic water and processing water, electric power, lighting, sound and water features, battery emergency power, compressed gas systems, communications and radio relays, automatic ventilation, and computerized sensors and climate controls.
