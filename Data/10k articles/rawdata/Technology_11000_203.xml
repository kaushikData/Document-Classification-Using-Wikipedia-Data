The APA asked [[Margaret Singer]], one of the leading proponents of theories of [[Perception management|coercive persuasion]], to chair a [[task force]] to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Describe the deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control that may limit freedom and adversely affect individuals, families, and society.
# Review the data base in the field.
# Define the implications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control for consumers of psychological services.
# Examine the ethical, educational, and social implications of this problem.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the task force had submitted its final report, the APA submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief (10 February 1987) in a case pending before the [[California Supreme Court]]. The case involved issues of [[brainwashing]] and coercive persuasion. The brief stated that Singer's hypotheses "were uninformed speculations based on skewed data." The APA subsequently withdrew from the brief, portraying its participation as premature in that DIMPAC had not yet submitted its report. (Scholars who had co-signed the brief&lt;ref&gt;
Including: [[Jeffrey Hadden]], [[Eileen Barker]], [[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[Joseph Bettis]], [[Durwood Foster]], [[William R. Garret]], [[Richard D. Kahone]], [[Timothy Miller]], [[John Young (sociologist)|John Young]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James T. Richardson]], [[Ray L. Hart]], [[Benton Johnson]], [[Franklin Littell]], [[Newton Malony]], Donald E. Miller, [[Mel Prosen]], Thomas Robbins, and [[Huston Smith]].
&lt;/ref&gt; did not withdraw.)

The task force completed its final report in November 1986. In May 1987 the APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC final report; stating that the report "lack[ed] the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA [[imprimatur]]", and also stating that the BSERP did "not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue".&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The BSERP board requested that the task-force members not distribute or publicize the report without indicating that the Board found the report unacceptable, and cautioned the members of the task force against using their past appointment to it "to imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated in the report".&lt;ref&gt;

Singer and her professional associate [[sociologist]] [[Richard Ofshe]] subsequently sued the APA in 1992 for "defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy" and lost in 1994. Subsequently, judges did not accept Singer as an expert witness in cases alleging brainwashing and [[mind control]].

&lt;/ref&gt;) included the following abstract:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Cult]]s and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of [[persuasion]] and control. These techniques can compromise [[individual freedom]], and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draft recommendations included:

* Research: "Psychologists should devote more effort toward understanding the mechanisms of action, effects, and ethical implications of social influence techniques, especially those that are deceptive and indirect... The study of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control should include study of how such techniques can be resisted and neutralized, and how those harmed by such techniques can be provided more appropriate therapy."
* Professional Ethics and Education: "The American Psychological Association ought to consider how future versions of APA's ethical code and ethical casebook material should be revised in light of the ethical implications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control used in LGATs, innovative psychotherapies, and other settings."
* Public Policy: "Because of the sometimes grave consequences of unethical application of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, psychologists ought to direct more attention to educating the [[Social engineering (political science)|public about such techniques]]{{dn|date=May 2018}}."

== The ''amicus curiæ'' brief ==
Before the task force had submitted its final report, the APA, together with a group of scholars, submitted on February 10, 1987, an ''[[amicus curiæ]]'' brief in a pending case, [[Molko v. Holy Spirit Ass'n for the Unification of World Christianity]], before the [[California Supreme Court]], involving issues of brainwashing and coercive persuasion related to the [[Unification Church]]. The brief portrayed Singer's hypotheses as uninformed speculations based on skewed data.&lt;ref&gt;

The brief characterized the theory of brainwashing as not scientifically proven and advanced the position that "this commitment to advancing the appropriate use of psychological testimony in the courts carries with it the concomitant duty to be vigilant against those who would use purportedly expert testimony lacking scientific and methodological rigor".

On March 24, 1987, the APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from this brief, as it considered the conclusion premature, in view of the ongoing work of the DIMPAC task force. The ''amicus'' as such continued because the co-signed scholars did not withdraw their signatures.  These included: [[Jeffrey Hadden]], [[Eileen Barker]], [[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[Joseph Bettis]], [[Durwood Foster]], [[William R. Garret]], [[Richard D. Kahone]], [[Timothy Miller]], [[John Young (sociologist)|John Young]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James T. Richardson]], [[Ray L. Hart]], [[Benton Johnson]], [[Franklin Littell]], [[Newton Malony]], Donald E. Miller, [[Mel Prosen]], Thomas Robbins, and [[Huston Smith]].

== The APA memorandum: dismissal of the DIMPAC report ==
On May 11, 1987, the APA ''Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology'' (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because "In general, the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur."&lt;ref name= APA_memo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=CESNUR - APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |work= |accessdate=2008-07-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the rejection memo came two letters from  external advisers to the APA who reviewed the report (the APA did not make its internal review public):

* One of the letters, from [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] of the [[University of Haifa]], stated among other comments that "lacking psychological theory, the report resorts to sensationalism in the style of certain tabloids" and that "the term 'brainwashing' is not a recognized theoretical concept, and is just a sensationalist 'explanation' more suitable to 'cultists' and revival preachers. It should not be used by psychologists, since it does not explain anything".  Beit-Hallahmi recommended not making the report public.
* The second letter, from [[Jeffrey D. Fisher]], said that the report  "[...] seems to be unscientific in tone, and biased in nature. It draws conclusions, which in many cases do not mesh well with the evidence presented. At times, the reasoning seems flawed to the point of being almost ridiculous. In fact, the report sometimes seems to be characterized by the use of deceptive, indirect techniques of persuasion and control — the very thing it is investigating".&lt;ref name= APA_memo /&gt;

The BSERP board also cautioned the members of the task force "against using their past appointment to imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated in the report", and stated that they should "not distribute or publicize the report without indicating that the report was unacceptable to the Board."&lt;ref name=APA_memo /&gt;

The memorandum concludes with "Finally, after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref name=APA_memo /&gt;

== Impact of the DIMPAC report dismissal on court cases ==
In August 1988 the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overturned the ''Kropinski v. World Plan Executive Council'' case, based on the lack of scientific support for the theories presented by Margaret Singer, during her testimony as an expert witness.&lt;ref&gt;
District of Columbia Court of Appeal, case 853 F.2d 948, Kropinski v. World Plan Executive Council.&lt;br /&gt;"Kropinski failed to provide any evidence that Dr. Singer’s particular theory, namely that techniques of thought reform may be effective in the absence of physical threats or coercion, has a significant following in the scientific community, let alone general acceptance."
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the Fourth Appellate District Court of Appeal of California, in the ''Robin George v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness'' case, rejected Singer's expert testimony on the basis that the brainwashing theory of false imprisonment constituted an attempt to premise tort liability on religious practices that the plaintiff believed to be objectionable, and that such premise appeared inconsistent with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Robin George v. [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] of California'', District Court of California Appeals, August 1989, case cited in Lewis, James R. ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', page 194, {{ISBN|0-19-514986-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 District Court Judge Lowell Jensen excluded Singer's testimony in ''United States v. [[Steven Fishman|Fishman]]'', because the Court remained unconvinced that the medical community widely accepted the application of coercive persuasion theory to religious cults and because the Court did not accept the theory of coercive persuasion in the context of cults.&lt;ref&gt;

(1999) in reference to ''United States v. Fishman'', United States District Court of California, CR–88-0616; DLG CR 90 0357 DLG
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, in the ''Patrick Ryan v. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|Maharishi Yogi]]'' case filed in the US District Court in Washington, DC, Judge Oliver Gasch refused to allow Singer to testify, based on the premises that Singer and Ofshe's theory did not enjoy substantial scientific approval and was therefore not admissible as the basis of expert opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Green and Patrick Ryan v. Maharishi Yogi'', US District Court, Washington, DC, 13 March 1991, Case #87-0015 OG&lt;/ref&gt;

== Margaret Singer, et al. v. APA, et al. (RICO lawsuit) ==
When the APA's BSERP declined to accept the DIMPAC findings, Singer sued the APA and other scholars in 1992 for "defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy", under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO), and lost in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/singer.htm Case No. 730012-8] Margaret Singer v. American Psychological Association, Court order
&lt;/ref&gt;
The lawsuit alleged that several top executives at the APA and ASA attempted to destroy careers, charging that from 1986 to 1992 they resorted to improper influence of witnesses in state court litigations, filed untrue affidavits, attempted to obstruct justice in federal litigations, deceived federal judges, and committed [[wire fraud|wire]] and [[mail fraud]]. Ofshe and Singer said that these actions damaged their reputations as forensic experts in the fields of psychology and sociology in the area of coercive persuasion, preventing their testimony against cults, and specified acts of collusion between several of the defendants and cult groups.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[court summons]] filed by Singer and [[Richard Ofshe|Ofshe]]'s lawyer described the rejection of the DIMPAC report by the APA's BSERP as a "rejection of the scientific validity of the theory of coercive persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Singer and Richard Ofshe v. American Psychological Association and others before the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Alameda, January 31, 1994,  Summons, 110, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

The court dismissed the case on the basis that the claims of defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy constituted a dispute over the application of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to a public debate over academic and professional matters. The court stated that one could characterize the parties as the opposing camps in a long-standing debate over certain theories in the field of psychology; and that the plaintiffs could not establish deceit with reference to representations made to other parties in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;
Case No. 730012-8, Margaret Singer, et al., Plaintiff v. American Psychological Association, et Al., Defendants &lt;br /&gt;'This case, which involves claims of defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy, clearly constitutes a dispute over the application of the First Amendment to a public debate over matters both academic and professional. The disputant may fairly be described as the opposing camps in a longstanding debate over certain theories in the field of psychology.
The speech of which the plaintiff's complain, which occurred in the context of prior litigation and allegedly involved the "fraudulent" addition of the names of certain defendants to documents filed in said prior litigation, would clearly have been protected as comment on a public issue whether or not the statements were made in the contest of legal briefs. The court need not consider whether the privilege of Civil Code 47 (b) extends to an alleged interloper in a legal proceeding. Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to establish any reasonable probability of success on any cause of action. In particular Plaintiffs cannot establish deceit with reference to representations made to other parties in the underlying lawsuit. Thus Defendants' Special Motions to Strike each of the causes at action asserted against them, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 425.16 is granted.'&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further ruling, James R. Lamden ordered Ofshe and Singer to pay $80,000 in attorneys' fees under California's [[SLAPP]] suit law, which penalizes those who harass others for exercising their First Amendment rights. At that time, Singer and Ofshe declared their intention to sue Michael Flomenhaft, the lawyer who represented them in the case, for malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;

== PIRI resolution ==
APA Division 36 (then ''Psychologists Interested in Religious Issues'' (PIRI), subsequently ''Psychology of Religion'') in its 1990 annual convention approved a resolution stating that insufficient consensually accepted research then scientifically supported the assertion that equated the use of "techniques of influence as typically practiced" by religious groups with "coercive persuasion", "mind control", or "brainwashing". The Executive Committee invited researchers to submit proposals to present their work on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;

An '''antenna array''' (or '''array antenna''') is a set of multiple connected [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s which work together as a single antenna, to transmit or receive [[radio wave]]s.  The individual antennas (called ''elements'') are usually connected to a single [[radio receiver|receiver]] or [[transmitter]] by [[feedline]]s that feed the power to the elements in a specific [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship.  The radio waves radiated by each individual antenna combine and [[Superposition principle|superpose]], adding together ([[constructive interference|interfering constructively]]) to enhance the power radiated in desired directions, and cancelling ([[destructive interference|interfering destructively]]) to reduce the power radiated in other directions.  Similarly, when used for receiving, the separate radio frequency currents from the individual antennas combine in the receiver with the correct phase relationship to enhance signals received from the desired directions and cancel signals from undesired directions.  More sophisticated array antennas may have multiple transmitter or receiver modules, each connected to a separate antenna element or group of elements. 

An antenna array can achieve higher [[antenna gain|gain]] ([[directivity]]), that is a narrower beam of radio waves, than could be achieved by a single element. In general, the larger the number of individual antenna elements used, the higher the gain and the narrower the beam.  Some antenna arrays (such as military [[phased array]] radars) are composed of thousands of individual antennas. Arrays can be used to achieve higher gain, to give path [[Diversity scheme|diversity]] (also called [[MIMO]])&lt;ref name="Poole1"&gt;{{cite web

The term antenna array most commonly means a ''driven array''  consisting of multiple identical [[driven element]]s all connected to the receiver or transmitter, often [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipoles]] fed in phase.  A ''parasitic array'' consists of a single driven element connected to the feedline, and other elements which are not, called [[parasitic element]]s.  It is usually another name for a [[Yagi-Uda antenna]].

A ''[[phased array]]'' usually means an ''electronically scanned array''; a driven array antenna in which each individual element is connected to the transmitter or receiver through a [[phase shifter]] controlled by a computer.  The beam of radio waves can be steered electronically to point instantly in any direction over a wide angle, without moving the antennas.  However the term "phased array" is sometimes used to mean an ordinary array antenna.&lt;ref name="Bevelacqua" /&gt;

== Description ==
Small antennas around one wavelength in size, such as [[quarter-wave antenna|quarter-wave monopole]]s and [[half-wave dipole]]s, don't have much [[directivity]] ([[antenna gain|gain]]); they are [[omnidirectional antenna]]s which radiate radio waves over a wide angle.  To create a [[high gain antenna]], which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used.  One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as [[parabolic antenna|parabolic reflectors]], [[horn antenna|horns]] or dielectric [[Electrostatic lens|lens]]es which change the direction of the radio waves by [[Signal reflection|reflection]] or [[refraction]], to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam.  This type is called an ''aperture antenna''.  A [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish]] is an example of this type of antenna.

A second technique is to use multiple antennas which are fed from the same transmitter or receiver; this is called an array antenna, or antenna array.  If the currents are fed to the antennas with the proper [[phase (waves)|phase]], due to the phenomenon of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] the spherical waves from the individual antennas combine (superpose) in front of the array to create [[plane wave]]s, a beam of radio waves traveling in a specific direction.  In directions in which the waves from the individual antennas arrive [[in phase]], the waves add together ([[constructive interference]]) to enhance the power radiated.  In directions in which the individual waves arrive [[out of phase]], with the peak of one wave coinciding with the valley of another, the waves cancel ([[destructive interference]]) reducing the power radiated in that direction.  Similarly, when receiving, the oscillating currents received by the separate antennas from radio waves received from desired directions are in phase and when combined in the receiver reinforce each other, while currents from radio waves received from other directions are out of phase and when combined in the receiver cancel each other.

The [[radiation pattern]] of such an antenna consists of a strong beam in one direction, the [[main lobe]], plus a series of weaker beams at different angles called [[sidelobe]]s, usually representing residual radiation in unwanted directions.  The larger the width of the antenna and the greater the number of component antenna elements, the narrower the main lobe, and the higher the gain which can be achieved, and the smaller the sidelobes will be.

Arrays in which the antenna elements are fed in phase are broadside arrays; the main lobe is emitted perpendicular to the plane of the elements.

The largest array antennas are [[radio interferometer]]s used in the field of [[radio astronomy]], in which multiple [[radio telescope]]s consisting of large [[parabolic antenna]]s are linked together into an antenna array, to achieve higher resolution.  Using the technique called [[aperture synthesis]] such an array can have the resolution of an antenna with a diameter equal to the distance between the antennas.  In the technique called [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) dishes on separate continents have been linked, creating "array antennas" thousands of miles in size.

== Types ==
Most array antennas can be divided into two classes based on how the component antennas' axis is related to the direction of radiation. 
*A ''broadside array'' is a one or two dimensional array in which the direction of radiation ([[main lobe]]) of the radio waves is perpendicular to the plane of the antennas.  To radiate perpendicularly, the antennas must be fed in phase.
*An ''endfire array'' is a linear array in which the direction of radiation is along the line of the antennas. The antennas must be fed with a phase difference equal to the separation of adjacent antennas.   
There are also arrays (such as [[phased array]]s) in which the direction of radiation is at some other angle to the antenna axis.



''Driven array'' - This is an array in which the individual component antennas are all "driven" - connected to the transmitter or receiver.  The individual antennas, which are usually identical, often consist of single ''[[driven element]]''s, such as [[half-wave dipole]]s, but may also be composite antennas such as [[Yagi antenna]]s or [[turnstile antenna]]s.
*''[[Collinear antenna array|Collinear array]]'' - a broadside array consisting of multiple identical dipole antennas oriented vertically in a line.  This is a high gain [[omnidirectional antenna]], often used in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band as base station antennas for land mobile services.
**''[[Batwing antenna|Superturnstile]]'' or ''Batwing'' array - specialized vertical antenna used for television broadcasting consisting of multiple [[turnstile antenna|crossed-dipole antenna]]s mounted collinearly on a mast. High gain omnidirectional radiation pattern with wide bandwidth. 
*''Planar array'' - a flat two-dimensional array of antennas.  Since an array of omnidirectional antennas radiates two beams 180° apart broadside from both sides of the antenna, it often is either mounted in front of a reflector, or is composed of directive antennas such as [[Yagi antenna|Yagi]] or [[Helical antenna|helical]] antennas, to give a unidirectional beam.
**''[[Reflective array antenna|Reflective array]]'' - a planar array of antennas, often half-wave dipoles fed in phase, in front of a flat reflector such as a metal plate or wire screen. This radiates a single beam of radio waves perpendicular (broadside) to the array.  Used as UHF [[television antenna]]s and radar antennas.
***''[[Curtain array]]'' - an outdoor wire shortwave transmitting antenna consisting of a planar array of wire dipoles suspended in front of a vertical reflector made of a "curtain" of parallel wires.  Used on HF band as long distance transmitting antenna for shortwave broadcasting stations.  May be steered as phased array.
***''[[Microstrip antenna]]'' - an array of [[patch antenna]]s fabricated on a [[printed circuit board]] with copper foil on the reverse side functioning as a reflector.  The elements are fed through [[stripline]]s made of copper foil.  Used as UHF and satellite television antennas. 
**''[[Phased array]]'' or ''electronically scanned array'' - A planar array in which the beam can be steered electronically to point in any direction over a wide angle in front of the array, without physically moving the antenna.  The current from the transmitter is fed to each component antenna through a [[phase shifter]], controlled by a computer.  By changing the relative phase of the feed currents, the beam can instantly be pointed in different directions. Widely used in military radars, this technique is rapidly spreading to civilian applications. 
***''[[Passive Electronically Scanned Array]]'' (PESA) - A phased array as described above, in which the antenna elements are fed from a single transmitter or receiver through phase shifters.
***''[[Active Electronically Scanned Array]]'' (AESA) - A phased array in which each antenna element has its own transmitter and/or receiver module, controlled by a central computer.  This second generation phased array technology can radiate multiple beams at multiple frequencies simultaneously, and is mostly used in sophisticated military radars.
**''[[Conformal antenna|Conformal array]]'' - a two-dimensional phased array which is not flat, but conforms to some curved surface.  The individual elements are driven by [[phase shifter]]s which compensate for the varying path lengths, allowing the antenna to radiate a plane wave beam. Conformal antennas are often integrated into the curving skin of aircraft and missiles, to reduce aerodynamic drag.
**''[[Smart antenna]]'', ''[[reconfigurable antenna]]'' or ''adaptive array'' - a receiving array that estimates the direction of arrival of the radio waves and electronically optimizes the radiation pattern adaptively to receive it, synthesizing a [[main lobe]] in that direction.&lt;ref name="Poole2"&gt;{{cite web

''Parasitic array'' - This is an endfire array which consist of multiple antenna elements in a line of which only one, the [[driven element]], is connected to the transmitter or receiver, while the other elements, called [[parasitic element]]s, are not.  The parasitic elements function as [[resonator]]s, absorbing radio waves from the driven element and reradiating them with a different phase, to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, increasing the power radiated in the desired direction.  Since these have only one driven element they are often called  "antennas" instead of "arrays".
*''[[Yagi-Uda antenna]]'' or Yagi antenna - this endfire array consists of multiple half-wave dipole elements in a line.  It consists of a single driven element with multiple "director" parasitic elements in the direction of radiation, and usually a single "reflector" parasitic element behind it.  They are widely used on the [[high frequency|HF]], [[very high frequency|VHF]], and [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] bands as television antennas, shortwave communication antennas, and in radar arrays.
*''[[Quad antenna]]'' - This consists of multiple [[loop antenna]]s in a line, with one driven loop and the others parasitic. Functions similarly to the Yagi antenna.

[[File:Glass wool insulation.jpg|thumb|Mineral wool insulation]]

'''Building insulation''' is any object in a building used as insulation for any purpose. While the majority of insulation in buildings is for [[thermal insulation|thermal]] purposes, the term also applies to [[acoustic insulation]], [[Fireproofing|fire insulation]], and [[Cushioning|impact insulation]] (e.g. for vibrations caused by industrial applications). Often an [[Building insulation materials|insulation material]] will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once.

==Thermal insulation==
[[Thermal insulation]] in buildings is an important factor to achieving [[thermal comfort]] for its occupants. Insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy demands of [[HVAC|heating and cooling systems]]. It does not necessarily deal with issues of adequate [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and may or may not affect the level of [[sound insulation]]. In a narrow sense insulation can just refer to the [[building insulation materials|insulation materials]] employed to slow heat loss, such as: [[cellulose]], [[glass wool]], [[rock wool]], [[polystyrene]], [[polyurethane|urethane foam]], [[vermiculite]], perlite, wood fibre, plant fibre (cannabis, flax, cotton, cork, etc.), recycled cotton denim, plant straw, animal fibre (sheep's wool), cement, and earth or soil, reflective insulation (also known as radiant barrier) but it can also involve a range of designs and techniques to address the main modes of heat transfer - conduction, radiation and convection materials. Many of the materials in this list deal with heat conduction and convection by the simple expedient of trapping large amounts of air (or other gas) in a way that results in a material that employs the low thermal conductivity of small pockets of gas, rather than the much higher conductivity of typical solids. (A similar gas-trapping principle is used in animal hair, down feathers, and in air-containing insulating fabrics).

The effectiveness of reflective insulation (radiant barrier) is commonly evaluated by the reflectivity (emittance) of the surface with airspace facing to the heat source.

The effectiveness of bulk insulation is commonly evaluated by its [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]], of which there are two - metric (SI) and US customary, the former being 0.176 times the latter. For attics, it is recommended that it should be at least R-38 (US customary, R-6.7 metric).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirhome.com/green-tips Sir Home Green Tips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209023511/http://www.sirhome.com/green-tips |date=February 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an R-value does not take into account the quality of construction or local environmental factors for each building. Construction quality issues include inadequate vapor barriers, and problems with draft-proofing. In addition, the properties and density of the insulation material itself is critical.

==Planning==
How much insulation a house should have depends on building design, climate, energy costs, budget, and personal preference. Regional climates make for different requirements. [[Building code]]s often set minimum standards for fire safety and energy efficiency, which can be voluntarily exceeded within the context of [[sustainable architecture]] for [[green (certification)|green certifications]] such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].

The insulation strategy of a building needs to be based on a careful consideration of the mode of energy transfer and the direction and intensity in which it moves. This may alter throughout the day and from season to season. It is important to choose an appropriate design, the correct combination of materials and building techniques to suit the particular situation.

===In the USA===

To determine whether you should add insulation, you first need to find out how much insulation you already have in your home and where. A qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of a whole-house [[energy audit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11350 |title=US Department of Energy - Energy Savers |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, you can sometimes perform a self-assessment in certain areas of the home, such as attics. Here, a visual inspection, along with use of a ruler, can give you a sense of whether you may benefit from additional insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insulationinstitute.org/im-a-homeowner/about-insulation/how-much-do-i-need/|title=Attic Insulation {{!}} How Much Do I Need?|website=insulationinstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial estimate of insulation needs in the United States can be determined by the US Department of Energy's [[ZIP code]] [http://www.ornl.gov/~roofs/Zip/ZipHome.html insulation calculator].

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], the availability of abundant and cheap gas has led to poorly insulated, overheated and inefficient consumption of energy. The [[Russian Center for Energy Efficiency]] found that Russian buildings are either over- or under-heated, and often consume up to 50 percent more heat and hot water than needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eceee.org/library/conference_proceedings/ACEEE_buildings/2000/Panel_3/p3_1/paper |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810123913/http://www.eceee.org/library/conference_proceedings/ACEEE_buildings/2000/Panel_3/p3_1/paper |archivedate=2016-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/1996/data/papers/SS96_Panel1_Paper04.pdf |title=Infiltration and Ventilation in Russian Multi-Family Buildings |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 53 percent of all carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions in Russia are produced through heating and generating electricity for buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowledge.allianz.com/en/globalissues/energy_co2/energy_efficiency/green_buildings_climate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605012310/http://knowledge.allianz.com/en/globalissues/energy_co2/energy_efficiency/green_buildings_climate.html |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from the former Soviet Bloc are still below their 1990 levels.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Cold climates===
[[File:Housing insulation by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|Cross-section of home insulation.|thumb|right|150px]]
In cold conditions, the main aim is to reduce heat flow out of the building.  The components of the building envelope&amp;mdash;windows, doors, roofs, walls, and air infiltration barriers&amp;mdash;are all important sources of heat loss;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Environmentandgreenerliving/Greenerhome/DG_064374|title=Green Deal: energy saving for your home - GOV.UK|work=direct.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allwoodwork.com/article/homeimprovement/reduce_your_heating_bills.html Reduce Your Heating Bills This Winter - Overlooked Sources of Heat Loss in the Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107224759/http://www.allwoodwork.com/article/homeimprovement/reduce_your_heating_bills.html|date=November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an otherwise well insulated home, windows will then become an important source of heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs18a.htm |title=Climate change Home Page &amp;#124; Department of the Environment and Energy, Australian Government|publisher=Climatechange.gov.au|date=|accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resistance to conducted heat loss for standard [[glazing(window)|glazing]] corresponds to an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of about 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;sdot;K&amp;sdot;W&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (compared to 2&amp;ndash;4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;sdot;K&amp;sdot;W&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for [[glass wool]] batts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecopink.com.au/pdf/Pink_Batts.pdf |title=Pink Batts&amp;reg; &amp; Pink Wall Batts&amp;reg;: Thermal Insulation for Ceilings and Walls|year=2004|publisher=Insulation Solutions Pty.

Losses can be reduced by good [[weatherisation]], bulk insulation, and minimising the amount of non-insulative (particularly non-solar facing) glazing.  Indoor thermal radiation can also be a disadvantage with spectrally selective (low-e, [[low-emissivity]]) glazing.  Some [[insulated glazing]] systems can double to triple R values.

===Hot climates===
In hot conditions, the greatest source of heat energy is solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;At latitudes less than 45 degrees, winter [[insolation]] rarely falls below 1kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day and may rise above 7kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day during summer. (Source:www.gaisma.com) In comparison the power output of an average domestic bar radiator is about 1kW. Therefore the amount of thermal radiation falling upon a 200m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; house could vary between 200-1400 home heaters operating continuously for one hour.&lt;/ref&gt; This can enter buildings directly through windows or it can heat the building shell to a higher temperature than the ambient, increasing the heat transfer through the building envelope.&lt;ref&gt;Re-radiation of heat into the roof space during summer can cause sol-air temperatures to reach 60C&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-CR-1220-00-es/roofing.pdf |title=Comparative Evaluation of the Impact of Roofing Systems on Residential Cooling Energy Demand in Florida |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Heat Gain Co-efficient (SHGC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wers.net/faqs#shgc Windows Energy Ratings Scheme - WERS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120132017/http://www.wers.net/faqs#shgc |date=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a measure of solar heat transmittance) of standard single glazing can be around 78-85%. Solar gain can be reduced by adequate shading from the sun, [[cool roofs|light coloured roofing]], spectrally selective (heat-reflective) paints and coatings and various [[building insulation materials|types of insulation]] for the rest of the envelope. [[Insulated glazing|Specially coated glazing]] can reduce SHGC to around 10%. [[Radiant barrier]]s are highly
effective for attic spaces in hot climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-EN-15/|title=FSEC-EN-15|work=ucf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, they are much more effective in hot climates than cold climates. For downward heat flow, convection is weak and radiation dominates heat transfer across an air space. Radiant barriers must face an adequate air-gap to be effective.

If refrigerative air-conditioning is employed in a hot, humid climate, then it is particularly important to seal the building envelope. Dehumidification of humid air infiltration can waste significant energy. On the other hand, some building designs are based on effective cross-ventilation instead of refrigerative air-conditioning to provide convective cooling from prevailing breezes.

==Orientation - passive solar design==
{{Main|Passive solar building design}}

Optimal placement of building elements (e.g. windows, doors, heaters) can play a significant role in insulation by considering the impact of [[Radiant energy|solar radiation]] on the building and the prevailing breezes. Reflective laminates can help reduce passive solar heat in pole barns, garages, and metal buildings.

==Construction==
See [[insulated glass]] for discussion of windows.

===Building envelope===
The [[building envelope|thermal envelope]] defines the conditioned or living space in a house. The attic or basement may or may not be included in this area. Reducing airflow from inside to outside can help to reduce convective heat transfer significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/whole_wall/airtight.html BERC - Airtightness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828100447/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs%2Bwalls/whole_wall/airtight.html |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuring low convective heat transfer also requires attention to building construction ([[weatherization]]) and the correct installation of insulative materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/design/integratedbuilding/buildingenvelope.html DOE Building Technologies Program: Building Envelope&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/ia/new_homes/features/VEFraming1-17-01.pdf V-E Framing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128163523/http://www.energystar.gov/ia/new_homes/features/VEFraming1-17-01.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less natural airflow into a building, the more [[Ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]] will be required to support human comfort. High [[humidity]] can be a significant issue associated with lack of airflow, causing [[condensation]], rotting construction materials, and encouraging microbial growth such as [[mould]] and [[bacteria]]. Moisture can also drastically reduce the effectiveness of insulation by creating a thermal bridge (see below). [[Heat exchanger|Air exchange]] systems can be actively or passively incorporated to address these problems.

===Thermal bridge===
Thermal bridges are points in the building envelope that allow heat conduction to occur. Since heat flows through the path of least resistance, thermal bridges can contribute to poor energy performance. A [[thermal bridge]] is created when materials create a continuous path across a temperature difference, in which the heat flow is not interrupted by thermal insulation. Common building materials that are poor insulators include [[glass]] and [[metal]].

A building design may have limited capacity for insulation in some areas of the structure. A common construction design is based on stud walls, in which thermal bridges are common in wood or steel studs and [[joist]]s, which are typically [[fastener|fastened]] with metal. Notable areas that most commonly lack sufficient insulation are the corners of buildings, and areas where insulation has been removed or displaced to make room for system infrastructure, such as electrical boxes (outlets and light switches), plumbing, fire alarm equipment, etc.

Thermal bridges can also be created by uncoordinated construction, for example by closing off parts of external walls before they are fully insulated.
The existence of inaccessible voids within the wall cavity which are devoid of insulation can be a source of thermal bridging.

Some forms of insulation transfer heat more readily when wet, and can therefore also form a thermal bridge in this state.

The heat conduction can be minimized by any of the following: reducing the [[cross sectional area]] of the bridges, increasing the bridge length, or decreasing the number of thermal bridges.

One method of reducing thermal bridge effects is the installation of an insulation board (e.g. foam board EPS XPS, wood fibre board, etc.) over the exterior outside wall. Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a thermal break inside the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glacierbay.com/dowtest.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109101659/http://www.glacierbay.com/dowtest.asp |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installation===
Insulating buildings during construction is much easier than retrofitting, as generally the insulation is hidden, and parts of the building need to be deconstructed to reach them.

==Materials==
{{Main|Building insulation materials}}

There are essentially two types of building insulation - bulk insulation and reflective insulation. Most buildings use a combination of both types to make up a total building insulation system. The type of insulation used is matched to create maximum resistance to each of the three forms of building heat transfer - conduction, convection, and radiation.

===Conductive and convective insulators===
Bulk insulators block conductive heat transfer and convective flow either into or out of a building. The denser a material is, the better it will conduct heat. Because air has such low density, air is a very poor conductor and therefore makes a good insulator. Insulation to resist conductive heat transfer uses air spaces between fibers, inside foam or plastic bubbles and in building cavities like the attic. This is beneficial in an actively cooled or heated building, but can be a liability in a passively cooled building; adequate provisions for cooling by ventilation or radiation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkcycle.org/tc-notes/note-view?topic_id=27256 Design of Low Cost Passive Cooling Systems, ThinkCycle Open Collaborative Design,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220203114/http://www.thinkcycle.org/tc-notes/note-view?topic_id=27256 |date=December 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are needed.

===Radiant heat barriers===
{{Main|Radiant barrier}}
Radiant barriers work in conjunction with an air space to reduce radiant heat transfer across the air space. Radiant or reflective insulation reflects heat instead of either absorbing it or letting it pass through. Radiant barriers are often seen used in reducing downward heat flow, because upward heat flow tends to be dominated by convection. This means that for attics, ceilings, and roofs, they are most effective in hot climates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
They also have a role in reducing heat losses in cool climates. However, much greater insulation can be achieved through the addition of bulk insulators (see above).

Some radiant barriers are spectrally selective and will preferentially reduce the flow of infra-red radiation in comparison to other wavelengths. For instance [[low-emissivity]] (low-e) windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the long-wave infra-red radiation generated by interior furnishings. Similarly, special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light, or vice versa.

Thermal emissivity values probably best reflect the effectiveness of radiant barriers. Some manufacturers quote an 'equivalent' R-value for these products but these figures can be difficult to interpret, or even misleading, since R-value testing measures total heat loss in a laboratory setting and does not control the type of heat loss responsible for the net result (radiation, conduction, convection).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A film of dirt or moisture can alter the emissivity and hence the performance of radiant barriers.

===Eco-friendly insulation===
[[Environmentally friendly|Eco-friendly]] insulation is a term used for insulating products with limited [[environmental impact]]. The commonly accepted approach to determine whether or not an insulation products, but in fact any product or service is eco-friendly is by doing a [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA). A number of studies compared the environmental impact of insulation materials in their application. The comparison shows that most important is the insulation value of the product meeting the technical requirements for the application. Only in a second order step a differentiation between materials becomes relevant. The [http://avnir.org/documentation/powerpoints_congres/5b_Peeters.pdf report] commissioned by the Belgian government to VITO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vito.be/en|title=Vision on technology for a better world|author=|date=|website=vito.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example of such a study. A valuable way to graphically represent such results is by a [https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/resources/images/cdn/cms/1210_CT_Life-Cycle5.jpg spider diagram].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15863">{{short description|Device which absorbs carbon dioxide from circulated gas }}
A '''carbon dioxide scrubber''' is a piece of equipment that absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It is used to treat [[exhaust gas]]es from [[industrial plant]]s or from exhaled air in [[life support system]]s such as [[rebreather]]s or in [[spacecraft]], [[submersible]] craft or [[airtight chamber]]s. Carbon dioxide scrubbers are also used in [[controlled atmosphere]] (CA) storage. They have also been researched for [[carbon capture]].

==Technologies==

===Amine scrubbing===
{{main|Amine gas treating}}
The primary application for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubbing is for removal of {{CO2|link=yes}} from the exhaust of coal- and gas-fired [[power plant]]s.  Virtually the only technology being seriously evaluated involves the use of various [[amine]]s, e.g. [[monoethanolamine]].  Cold solutions of these organic compounds bind CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the binding is reversed at higher temperatures:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt; + HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  
{{asof|2009}}, this technology has only been lightly implemented because of capital costs of installing the facility and the operating costs of utilizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Gary T. Rochelle |title=Amine Scrubbing for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5948 |page=1652 |year=2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1176731|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1652R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minerals and zeolites===
Several minerals and mineral-like materials reversibly bind CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sunho Choi |author2=Jeffrey H. Drese |author3=Christopher W. Jones |title=Adsorbent Materials for Carbon Dioxide Capture from Large Anthropogenic Point Sources |journal=ChemSusChem |year=2009 |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=796–854. |doi=10.1002/cssc.200900036|pmid=19731282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most often, these minerals are oxides or hydroxides, and often the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is bound as carbonate. Carbon dioxide reacts with [[quicklime]] (calcium oxide) to form [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/04/020412080812.htm |title=Imagine No Restrictions On Fossil-Fuel Usage And No Global Warming |journal=ScienceDaily |date=April 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process called carbonate looping. Other minerals include [[serpentinite]], a [[magnesium]] [[silicate]] [[hydroxide]], and [[olivine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/09/040903084832.htm |title=Natural Mineral Locks Up Carbon Dioxide |journal=Sciencedaily |date=September 3, 2004 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tececo.com/sustainability.tececo_kiln.php |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709000905/http://www.tececo.com/sustainability.tececo_kiln.php |archivedate=July 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular sieve]]s also function in this capacity.

Various scrubbing processes have been proposed to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air, or from flue gases.  These usually involve using a variant of the [[Kraft process]]. Scrubbing processes may be based on [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name="ChangNYT2008"&gt;{{cite news | author=Kenneth Chang | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html | title=Scientists would turn greenhouse gas into gasoline | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 19, 2008 | accessdate = 2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12727 |title=Chemical 'sponge' could filter CO2 from the air – environment |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is absorbed into solution, sent to lime via a process called causticization and released in a [[kiln]]. With some modifications to the existing processes, mainly an oxygen-fired kiln, the end result is a concentrated stream of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ready for storage or use in fuels. An alternative to this thermo-chemical process is an electrical one in which a nominal voltage is applied across the carbonate solution to release the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} While simpler, this electrical process consumes more energy as it splits water at the same time. Since it depends on electricity, the electricity needs to be renewable, like PV. Otherwise the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced during electricity production has to be taken into account.  Early incarnations of air capture used electricity as the energy source; hence, were dependent on a carbon-free source. Thermal air capture systems use heat generated on-site, which reduces the inefficiencies associated with off-site electricity production, but of course it still needs a source of (carbon-free) heat. [[Concentrated solar power]] is an example of such a source.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126901.200-can-technology-clear-the-air.html?full=true |title=Can technology clear the air? – environment |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sodium hydroxide====
Zeman and Lackner outlined a specific method of air capture.&lt;ref name="naoh-zeman"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. S. Zeman  |author2=K. S. Lackner |title=Capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere |journal=World Resour. Rev. |volume=16 |pages=157–172 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is absorbed by an alkaline NaOH solution to produce dissolved [[sodium carbonate]]. The absorption reaction is a gas liquid reaction, strongly exothermic, here:

:2NaOH(aq) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) → 2NaOH(aq) + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

:ΔH° = -5.3 kJ/mol

Causticization is performed ubiquitously in the [[pulp and paper industry]] and readily transfers 94% of the carbonate ions from the sodium to the calcium cation.&lt;ref name="naoh-zeman"/&gt;&lt;!-- is this it??? --&gt; Subsequently, the calcium carbonate precipitate is filtered from solution and thermally decomposed to produce gaseous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The calcination reaction is the only endothermic reaction in the process and is shown here:

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) → CaO(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

:ΔH° = + 179.2 kJ/mol

The thermal decomposition of calcite is performed in a lime kiln fired with oxygen in order to avoid an additional gas separation step. Hydration of the lime (CaO) completes the cycle. Lime hydration is an exothermic reaction that can be performed with water or steam. Using water, it is a liquid/solid reaction as shown here:

:CaO(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

:ΔH° = -64.5 kJ/mol

====Lithium hydroxide====
Other strong [[base (chemistry)|bases]] such as [[soda lime]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[potassium hydroxide]], and [[lithium hydroxide]] are able to remove carbon dioxide by [[chemically reacting]] with it. In particular, lithium hydroxide was used aboard [[spacecraft]], such as in the [[Apollo program]], to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It reacts with carbon dioxide to form [[lithium carbonate]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.R. Jaunsen |title=The Behavior and Capabilities of Lithium Hydroxide Carbon Dioxide Scrubbers in a Deep Sea Environment |journal=US Naval Academy Technical Report |volume=USNA-TSPR-157 |year=1989 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4998 |accessdate=2008-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently [[Www.spiralith.com|lithium hydroxide absorbent technology]] has been adapted for use in anesthesia machines.  Anesthesia machines which provide life support and inhaled agents during surgery typically employ a closed circuit necessitating the removal of carbon dioxide exhaled by the patient.  Lithium hydroxide may offer some safety and convenience benefits over the older calcium based products.

:2 LiOH(s) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) → 2 LiOH·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(s)
:2 LiOH·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g)

The net reaction being:

:2LiOH(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) &amp;rarr; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g)

[[Lithium peroxide]] can also be used as it absorbs more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per unit weight with the added advantage of releasing oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Petzow | first1 = G.

===Regenerative carbon dioxide removal system===
The regenerative [[carbon dioxide removal system]] (RCRS) on the [[space shuttle]] orbiter used a two-bed system that provided continuous removal of carbon dioxide without expendable products. Regenerable systems allowed a shuttle mission a longer stay in space without having to replenish its [[sorbent]] canisters. Older [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH)-based systems, which are non-regenerable, were replaced by regenerable [[metal]]-[[oxide]]-based systems. A system based on metal oxide primarily consisted of a metal oxide sorbent canister and a regenerator assembly. It worked by removing carbon dioxide using a sorbent material and then regenerating the sorbent material. The metal-oxide sorbent canister was regenerated by pumping air at approximately {{convert|400|°F|°C|abbr=on}} through it at a standard flow rate of {{convert|7.5|cuft/min|m3/s|abbr=on}} for 10 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/hsc/proddesc_display/0,4494,CLI1_DIV25_ETI5338_PRD776,00.html |title=Carbon Dioxide Removal |publisher=Hamilton Sundstrand |accessdate=2008-10-27 |quote=The new metal-oxide-based system replaces the existing non-regenerable lithium hydroxide (LiOH) carbon dioxide (CO2) removal system located in the EMU's Primary Life Support System. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031085108/http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/hsc/proddesc_display/0%2C4494%2CCLI1_DIV25_ETI5338_PRD776%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activated carbon===
[[Activated carbon]] can be used as a carbon dioxide scrubber. Air with high carbon dioxide content, such as air from fruit storage locations, can be blown through beds of activated carbon and the carbon dioxide will adsorb onto the activated carbon. Once the bed is [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] it must then be "regenerated" by blowing low carbon dioxide air, such as ambient air, through the bed. This will release the carbon dioxide from the bed, and it can then be used to scrub again, leaving the net amount of carbon dioxide in the air the same as when the process was started.

=== Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) ===
[[Metal-organic framework]]s are one of the most promising new technologies for carbon dioxide capture and sequestration via [[adsorption]]. Although no large-scale commercial technology exists nowadays, several research studies have indicated the great potential that MOFs have as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbent. Its characteristics, such as pore structure and surface functions can be easily tuned to improve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity over other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jian-Rong|date=2011|title=Carbon dioxide capture-related gas adsorption and separation in metal-organic frameworks.|url=http://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/zhou/PDF/095.pdf|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews|doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2011.02.012|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A MOF could be specifically designed to act like a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal agent in post-combustion power plants. In this scenario, the flue gas would pass through a bed packed with a MOF material, where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be stripped. After saturation is reached, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be desorbed by doing a [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure]] or temperature swing. Carbon dioxide could then be compressed to supercritical conditions in order to be stored underground or utilized in [[enhanced oil recovery]] processes. However, this is not possible in large scale yet due to several difficulties, one of those being the production of MOFs in great quantities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|last=Smit|first=Berend|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffrey R.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78326-327-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the availability of metals necessary to create MOFs. In a hypothetical scenario where these materials are used to capture all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; needed to avoid global warming issues, such as maintaining a global temperature rise less than 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C above the pre-industrial average temperature, we would need more metals than are available on Earth. For example, to synthesize all MOFs that utilize [[vanadium]], we would need 1620% of 2010 global reserves. Even if using magnesium-based MOFs, which have demonstrated a great capacity to adsorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we would need 14% of  2010 global reserves, which is a considerable amount. Also, extensive mining would be necessary, leading to more potential environmental problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a project sponsored by the DOE and operated by [[UOP LLC|UOP]] [[UOP LLC|LLC]] in collaboration with faculty from four different universities, MOFs were tested as possible carbon dioxide removal agents in post-combustion flue gas. They were able to separate 90% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gas stream using a vacuum pressure swing process. Through extensive investigation, researchers found out that the best MOF to be used was Mg/DOBDC, which has a 21.7 wt% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loading capacity. Estimations showed that, if a similar system were to be applied to a large scale power plant, the cost of energy would increase by 65%, while a [[National Energy Technology Laboratory|NETL]] baseline amine based system would cause an increase of 81% (the DOE goal is 35%). Also, each ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; avoided would cost $57, while for the amine system this cost is estimated to be $72. The project ended in 2010,estimating that the total capital required to implement such a project in a 580 MW power plant was 354 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|osti=1003992-YRfi3u/|title=Carbon Dioxide Removal from Flue Gas Using Microporous Metal Organic Frameworks|last=Willis|first=Richard|date=2010|work=Final Technical Report|last2=Lesch|first2=David A.|others=DOE Award Number: DE-FC26-07NT43092|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civilité''' type (in French: "Caractères de civilité") is a [[typeface]] invented in 1557 by the French engraver [[Robert Granjon]]. These characters imitate [[Blackletter#French cursiva|French cursiva]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} letters of the [[Renaissance]].

==History==
[[image:Civilite type.JPG|right|200px|thumb| Civilité types used in a French courtesy book (1785)]]
The first book in the new type was ''Dialogue de la vie et de la mort'', a French version of Innocenzo Ringhieri's dialogue, in the dedication of which Granjon explains his purpose in cutting the new design. He calls the typeface "lettres françaises" and suggests that France like other nations should have a type based on the national hand; his model was contemporary handwriting. The popular name for the type came from the titles of two early books in which it was used: Erasmus's ''La Civilité puerile'', Jean Bellère, Antwerp, 1559, and ''La Civile honesteté pour les enfans'', R. Breton, Paris, 1560. "Civilité" meant "good manners" and it was thought an advantage that children should learn to read from a book printed in a type resembling current handwriting. Between 1557 and 1562 Granjon printed some 20 books in this type. Two other Paris printers had typefaces made that were very similar and Granjon himself supplied his version to Guillaume Silvius and to Christophe Plantin at Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

They were mostly employed to print books in [[Flanders]], [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the type was more popular than in France but mostly in a form based on the contemporary Flemish hand which was devised by Ameet Tavernier of Bailleul by 1559.--Johnson (1966), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Vlacq, Michiel et al. (1607) ''Den nieuwen verbeterden Lust-Hof, gheplant vol uytgelesene, eerlijcke, amoreuse ende vrolijcke ghesanghen''. [with:] (''Bruylofts Bancket''. Verghemaeckt door M[ichiel]. V[acq]. binnen der Goude verriert met ... copere figusren. ... Den derden druck gebetert en veel vermeerdert''. Amstelredam: Dirck Pietersz&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]], and [[France]]. In the latter, they were used until the second half of the 19th century to print children's lesson-books teaching civility and manners from which the type got its name.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert, 1978: ''The Civilizing Process: a History of Manners''. Urizen Books, New York. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Civilité type did not win great popularity in France although used occasionally at all periods. Another version of civilité were used in one book printed in 1597 by Claude Micard, and two others in two books printed by [[Jean de Tournes (1539–1615)|Jean de Tournes]] in 1581 and 1598. In the mid 19th century Louis Perrin of Lyons printed J. Soulary's ''Sonnets humouristiques'' in civilité. Granjon's experiment cannot be said to have been a success: one of the grave disadvantages was that many ligatures were required and some letters had more than one variant.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Common Information Model''' ('''CIM''') is an [[open standard]] that defines how managed elements in an [[Information technology|IT environment]]  are represented as a common set of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] and relationships between them. The [[Distributed Management Task Force]] maintains the CIM to allow consistent [[Systems management|management]] of these managed elements, independent of their manufacturer or provider.

==Overview==
One way to describe CIM is to say that it allows multiple parties to exchange management information about these managed elements. However, this falls short in expressing that CIM not only represents these managed elements and the management information, but also provides means to actively control and manage these elements. By using a common model of information, management software can be written once and work with many implementations of the common model without complex and costly conversion operations or loss of information.

The CIM standard is defined and published by the [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF). A related standard is [[Web-Based Enterprise Management]] (WBEM, also defined by DMTF) which defines a particular implementation of CIM, including protocols for discovering and accessing such CIM implementations.

==Schema and specifications==
The CIM standard includes the '''CIM Infrastructure Specification''' and the '''CIM Schema''':

*'''CIM Infrastructure Specification'''
:The CIM Infrastructure Specification defines the architecture and concepts of CIM, including a language by which the CIM Schema (including any extension schema) is defined, and a method for mapping CIM to other information models, such as [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]. The CIM architecture is based upon [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], so it is object-oriented: The managed elements are represented as CIM [[Class (computer science)|class]]es and any relationships between them are represented as CIM [[Association (object-oriented programming)|association]]s. [[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows specialization of common base elements into more specific derived elements.

*'''CIM Schema'''
:The CIM Schema is a [[conceptual schema]] which defines the specific set of objects and relationships between them that represent a common base for the managed elements in an [[Information technology|IT environment]]. The CIM Schema covers most of today's elements in an IT environment, for example [[computer system]]s, [[operating system]]s, [[Computer network|network]]s, [[middleware]], [[Daemon (computer software)|service]]s and [[Computer storage|storage]]. The CIM Schema defines a common basis for representing these managed elements. Since most managed elements have product and vendor specific behavior, the CIM Schema is extensible in order to allow the producers of these elements to represent their specific features seamlessly together with the common base functionality defined in the CIM Schema.

CIM is the basis for most of the other DMTF standards (e.g. [[Web-Based Enterprise Management|WBEM]] or [[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]]). It is also the basis for the [[Storage Management Initiative - Specification|SMI-S]] standard for storage management.

==Versions==
Updates to the CIM Schema are published regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmtf.org/standards/cim/schemas|title=CIM Schemas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Distributed Management Task Force, Inc.|accessdate=28 September 2018|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180928222603/https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/schemas |archive-date= 28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Version 2.6 of the CIM Infrastructure Specification was published on March 31, 2010.
*Version 1.1 of the CIM Compliance Specification was published on December 15, 2003.
*Version 2.2 of the CIM Specification was published on June 14, 1999.

==Implementations==
Many vendors provide implementations of CIM in various forms:

* Some operating systems provide a CIM implementation, for example:
** the [[Windows Management Instrumentation]] (WMI) [[Application programming interface|API]] available in [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 2000]] and higher
** some [[Linux distribution|GNU/Linux distributions]] with the [[SBLIM]] (Standards Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability) project&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://sourceforge.net/projects/sblim | title = SBLIM | publisher = Sourceforge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Storage Networking Industry Association]] (SNIA) has heavily bought into using CIM and WBEM: they have defined their usage of CIM (called [[Storage Management Initiative – Specification]] or '''SMI-S''') as a standard.
* Some [[Server (computing)|server]] manufacturers collaborate in the DMTF under the [[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]] initiative to define CIM-based management of servers.
* The [[Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware|DASH]] initiative in the DMTF attempts to define CIM-based management of [[desktop computer]]s.

There is also a growing{{quantify|date=September 2014}} tools market around CIM.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===CIM-XML===
CIM-XML is a protocol for sending CIM messages on top of [[HTTP]]. It has two message types:

# operational messages, which provoke a response from the receiver ([[Remote Procedure Call|RPC]])
# export messages, which are indications/events.

CIM-XML forms part of the WBEM protocol family, and is standardised by the DMTF.

CIM-XML comprises 3 specifications:

The '''DIN 1.0/2.3 connector''' is a [[RF connector]] used for [[coaxial cable]] at microwave frequencies. They were introduced in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphenolrf.com/connectors/1-0-2-3.html&lt;/ref&gt; for telecommunication applications. They are available in 50 Ω and 75 Ω [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]] and are compatible with the most widely used cable sizes. It has a push/pull lock and release feature. The DIN 1.0/2.3 is ideally suited to applications where space limitation is a factor. In broadcasting applications the 75 Ω version is used for [[Serial Digital Interface]] video data up to maximum frequency of 4&amp;nbsp;GHz.  The 50 Ω connector can be used to a maximum of 10&amp;nbsp;GHz.

An '''embedded flashing-light system''' or an '''in-pavement flashing-light system''' is a type of device that is used at existing or new [[Pedestrian crossing|pedestrian crosswalks]] to warn drivers of oncoming pedestrian traffic. The device usually consists of [[LED]] lights that are embedded into the roadway alongside the crosswalk and are oriented to face oncoming traffic. When a pedestrian approaches the crosswalk, the system is activated and the LED lights begin to flash simultaneously. These lights are programmed to flash for a period of time that is sufficient for an average pedestrian to cross.

==History==
The concept for embedded pavement flashing light system was conceived by pilot Michael Harrison  in Santa Rosa, California in 1992 after a friend was involved in a pedestrian accident. He based it on his experience with airport runway lights embedded in pavement.

==Types==
There are two different types of embedded pavement flashing light systems, passive and active. These types differ on how the system is activated.

With a passive system, the pedestrian activates the device merely by walking up to the crosswalk. This is accomplished by using one of several motion detection devices. These include [[microwave]], motion sensors, video detection, pressure plates, or a light trip beam. With an active system, the device is usually activated by a button that a pedestrian pushes in order to cross. These active systems are generally similar to lighted pedestrian signs at traffic intersections. Because many pedestrians may not realize that they need to press a button to activate the system, it is generally recommended to install a passive system.

==Effectiveness==
Compared with other types of warning devices, the effectiveness of the embedded pavement flashing light system seem to be high. When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement flashing light system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted warning device. Also, compared to a crosswalk with no warning device, drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement flashing light system is in place.

The '''Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Association of Australasia''' (MEA) was an Australian trade union which existed between 1911 and 1988.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010.

Retrieved 6 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The union represented workers employed in milling grain.

== Formation ==
[[File:Federated Millers &amp; Mill Employees Association.tif|left|thumb|Group portrait of the Victorian branch executive of the union, taken in 1919]]
The Federation (originally the '''Federated Millers and Mill Employes' Association''') was formed as a result of a meeting in Adelaide in May 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58139020 |title=Flourmill Employes |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 May 1910 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first annual meeting held in Melbourne in March 1911, the following officers were elected: President, Mr. T. Drum (N.S.W.); vice-president, Mr. W. Bain (S.A.); general secretary, Mr. G. Lewis (N.S.W.); treasurer, Mr. J. Nealer (Vic.); trustees, [[Frank Condon (politician)|Frank Condon]] (S.A.) and J. Kebble. Apologies were received from the Western Australian branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105303269 |title=Mill Employes |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Adelaide)|Daily Herald]] |location=Adelaide |date=17 March 1911 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "employe" (or "employé") was then a common (male) spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amalgamation ==
In 1988 the M.E.A. amalgamated with the [[Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Federation of Australia]] to form the [[Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Union]]. This union then merged shortly after into the recently formed [[National Union of Workers]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

'''Flywheel energy storage''' ('''FES''') works by accelerating a rotor ([[flywheel]]) to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as [[rotational energy]].  When energy is extracted from the system, the flywheel's rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]; adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.

Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use [[mechanical energy]] are being developed.&lt;ref name="Torotrak"&gt;[http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf Torotrak Toroidal variable drive CVT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516084534/http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }}, retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites, suspended by [[magnetic bearing]]s, and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm  in a vacuum enclosure.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Main components ==
[[File:Example of cylindrical flywheel rotor assembly.png|thumb|right|The main components of a typical flywheel]]
A typical system consists of a flywheel supported by [[rolling-element bearing]] connected to a [[motor–generator]]. The flywheel and sometimes motor–generator may be enclosed in a [[vacuum chamber]] to reduce friction and reduce energy loss.

First-generation flywheel energy-storage systems use a large [[steel]] flywheel rotating on mechanical bearings. Newer systems use [[carbon-fiber]] composite [[flywheel|rotors]] that have a higher [[tensile strength]] than steel and can store much more energy for the same [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flybridsystems.com/F1System.html |title=Original F1 System - Flybrid Automotive |author=Flybrid Automotive Limited |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce [[friction]], [[magnetic bearing]]s are sometimes used instead of [[bearing (mechanical)|mechanical bearings]].

===Possible future use of superconducting bearings===
The expense of refrigeration led to the early dismissal of low-temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings.  However, [[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductor]] (HTSC) bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically.&lt;ref&gt;http://orbit.dtu.dk/fedora/objects/orbit:88109/datastreams/file_7728861/content&lt;/ref&gt;  Hybrid bearing systems are most likely to see use first.  High-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs, but can easily provide a stabilizing force.  Therefore, in hybrid bearings, permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it. The reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect [[diamagnet]]s.  If the rotor tries to drift off center, a restoring force due to [[flux pinning]] restores it. This is known as the magnetic stiffness of the bearing. Rotational axis vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping, which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets, preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications.

Since flux pinning is an important factor for providing the stabilizing and lifting force, the HTSC can be made much more easily for FES than for other uses.  HTSC powders can be formed into arbitrary shapes so long as flux pinning is strong.  An ongoing challenge that has to be overcome before superconductors can provide the full lifting force for an FES system is finding a way to suppress the decrease of levitation force and the gradual fall of rotor during operation caused by the [[flux creep]] of the superconducting material.

== Physical characteristics ==
{{see also|Flywheel#Physics}}

=== General ===
Compared with other ways to store electricity, FES systems have long lifetimes (lasting decades with little or no maintenance;&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"/&gt; full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, cycles of use),&lt;ref name="Investire"&gt;[http://www.itpower.co.uk/investire/pdfs/flywheelrep.pdf Storage Technology Report, ST6 Flywheel]&lt;/ref&gt; high [[specific energy]] (100–130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg, or 360–500 kJ/kg),&lt;ref name="Investire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pddnet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Next-gen Of Flywheel Energy Storage |url=http://www.pddnet.com/article-next-gen-of-flywheel-energy-storage/ |publisher=Product Design &amp;amp; Development |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710052927/http://www.pddnet.com/article-next-gen-of-flywheel-energy-storage/ |archivedate=2010-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and large maximum power output. The [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] (''ratio of energy out per energy in'') of flywheels, also known as round-trip efficiency, can be as high as 90%. Typical capacities range from 3&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt hour|kWh]] to 133&amp;nbsp;kWh.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"/&gt; Rapid charging of a system occurs in less than 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="Distributed Energy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vere |first=Henry |title=A Primer of Flywheel Technology |url=https://foresternetwork.com/weekly/energy-storage-solutions-weekly/a-primer-of-flywheel-technology/ |publisher=Distributed Energy |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high specific energies often cited with flywheels can be a little misleading as commercial systems built have much lower specific energy, for example 11 W·h/kg, or 40 kJ/kg.&lt;ref name="Rosseta"&gt;[http://www.rosseta.de/texte/pdat-t4.pdf rosseta Technik GmbH, Flywheel Energy Storage Model T4], retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Form of energy storage ===
: {|
|-
|  [[Moment of inertia]]: || &lt;math&gt;J_m = \int_m r^2\,\mathrm dm&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  [[Angular velocity]]: || &lt;math&gt; \omega_m = 2 \pi \cdot n_m&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  Stored [[rotational energy]]: || &lt;math&gt; W_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2} J_m\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Here &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the integral of the flywheel's mass, and &lt;math&gt;n_m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rotational speed]] (number of revolutions per second).

=== Specific energy ===
The maximal [[specific energy]] of a flywheel rotor is mainly dependent on two factors: the first being the rotor's geometry, and the second being the properties of the material being used. For single-material, [[isotropic]] rotors this relationship can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Genta |first=Giancarlo |title=Kinetic Energy Storage |date=1985 |publisher=Butterworth &amp; Co. Ltd. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{E}{I} = K\left(\frac{\sigma}{\rho}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is kinetic energy of the rotor [J],
: &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor's moment of inertia [kg.m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;],
: &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor's geometric shape factor [m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;],
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the tensile strength of the material [Pa],
: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the material's density [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;].

==== Geometry (shape factor) ====
The highest possible value for the shape factor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flywheel Kinetic Energy |url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/flywheel-energy-d_945.html |website=The Engineering Toolbox}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a flywheel rotor, is &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which can only be achieved by the theoretical ''constant-stress disc'' geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Genta |first=Giancarlo |title=Some considerations on the constant stress disc profile |journal=Meccanica |date=1989 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=235–248 |doi=10.1007/BF01556455}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constant-thickness disc geometry has a shape factor of &lt;math&gt;K = 0.606&lt;/math&gt;, while for a rod of constant thickness the value is &lt;math&gt;K = 0.333&lt;/math&gt;. A thin cylinder has a shape factor of &lt;math&gt;K = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Material properties ====
For energy storage, materials with high strength and low density are desirable. For this reason, composite materials are frequently used in advanced flywheels. The [[Specific strength|strength-to-density ratio]] of a material can be expressed in Wh/kg (or Nm/kg); values greater than 400 Wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials.

==== Rotor materials ====
Several modern flywheel rotors are made from composite materials. Examples include the carbon-fiber composite flywheel from Beacon Power Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Fiber Flywheels |url=http://beaconpower.com/carbon-fiber-flywheels/ |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''PowerThru'' flywheel from Phillips Service Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PowerThru flywheel |url=http://www.power-thru.com/flywheel_ups_technology.html |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Calnetix utilizes aerospace-grade high-performance steel in their flywheel construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kinetic Energy Storage Systems |url=https://www.calnetix.com/vdc-kinetic-energy-storage-systems |accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these rotors, the relationship between material properties, geometry and energy density can be expressed by using a weighed-average approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Janse van Rensburg |first=P. J. |title=Energy storage in composite flywheel rotors |publisher=University of Stellenbosch |hdl=10019.1/17864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tensile strength and failure modes ===
One of the primary limits to flywheel design is the tensile strength of the rotor.  Generally speaking, the stronger the disc, the faster it may be spun, and the more energy the system can store.

When the tensile strength of a composite flywheel's outer binding cover is exceeded, the binding cover will fracture, and the wheel will shatter as the outer wheel compression is lost around the entire circumference, releasing all of its stored energy at once; this is commonly referred to as "flywheel explosion" since wheel fragments can reach kinetic energy comparable to that of a bullet. Composite materials that are wound and glued in layers tend to disintegrate quickly, first into small-diameter filaments that entangle and slow each other, and then into red-hot powder; a cast metal flywheel throws off large chunks of high-speed shrapnel.

For a [[cast metal]] flywheel, the failure limit is the binding strength of the [[grain boundaries]] of the [[polycrystalline]] molded metal. Aluminum in particular suffers from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and can develop [[microfracture]]s from repeated low-energy stretching. Angular forces may cause portions of a metal flywheel to bend outward and begin dragging on the outer containment vessel, or to separate completely and bounce randomly around the interior. The rest of the flywheel is now severely unbalanced, which may lead to rapid bearing failure from vibration, and sudden shock fracturing of large segments of the flywheel.

Traditional flywheel systems require strong containment vessels as a safety precaution, which increases the total mass of the device. The energy release from failure can be dampened with a gelatinous or encapsulated liquid inner housing lining, which will boil and absorb the energy of destruction. Still, many customers of large-scale flywheel energy-storage systems prefer to have them embedded in the ground to halt any material that might escape the containment vessel.

=== Energy storage efficiency ===
Flywheel energy storage systems using mechanical bearings can lose 20% to 50% of their energy in two hours.&lt;ref name="Rosseta2"&gt;[http://www.rosseta.de/srsy.htm rosseta Technik GmbH, Flywheel Energy Storage, German], retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the friction responsible for this energy loss results from the flywheel changing orientation due to the rotation of the earth (an effect similar to that shown by a [[Foucault pendulum]]).  This change in orientation is resisted by the gyroscopic forces exerted by the flywheel's angular momentum, thus exerting a force against the mechanical bearings.  This force increases friction.  This can be avoided by aligning the flywheel's axis of rotation parallel to that of the earth's axis of rotation.{{cite needed|date=December 2018}}

Conversely, flywheels with [[magnetic bearings]] and high vacuum can maintain 97% [[mechanical efficiency]], and 85% round trip efficiency.&lt;ref name="Beacon2"&gt;[http://www.beaconpower.com/files/Flywheel_FR-Fact-Sheet.pdf Beacon Power Corp, Frequency Regulation and Flywheels fact sheet], retrieved July 11, 2011.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331042630/http://www.beaconpower.com/files/Flywheel_FR-Fact-Sheet.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of angular momentum in vehicles ===
When used in vehicles, flywheels also act as [[gyroscope]]s, since their [[angular momentum]] is typically of a similar order of magnitude as the forces acting on the moving vehicle. This property may be detrimental to the vehicle's handling characteristics while turning or driving on rough ground; driving onto the side of a sloped embankment may cause wheels to partially lift off the ground as the flywheel opposes sideways tilting forces. On the other hand, this property could be utilized to keep the car balanced so as to keep it from rolling over during sharp turns.&lt;ref&gt;''Study on Rollover prevention of heavy-duty vehicles by using flywheel energy storage systems'', Suda Yoshihiro, Huh Junhoi, Aki Masahiko, Shihpin Lin, Ryoichi Takahata, Naomasa Mukaide, Proceedings of the FISITA 2012 World Automotive Congress, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering Volume 197, 2013, pp 693-701, [[doi:10.1007/978-3-642-33805-2 57]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a flywheel is used entirely for its effects on the attitude of a vehicle, rather than for energy storage, it is called a [[reaction wheel]] or a [[control moment gyroscope]].

The resistance of angular tilting can be almost completely removed by mounting the flywheel within an appropriately applied set of [[gimbal]]s, allowing the flywheel to retain its original orientation without affecting the vehicle (see [[gyroscope#Properties|''Properties'' of a gyroscope]]). This doesn't avoid the complication of [[gimbal lock]], and so a compromise between the number of gimbals and the angular freedom is needed.

The center axle of the flywheel acts as a single gimbal, and if aligned vertically, allows for the 360 degrees of yaw in a horizontal plane. However, for instance driving up-hill requires a second pitch gimbal, and driving on the side of a sloped embankment requires a third roll gimbal.

==== Full-motion gimbals ====
Although the flywheel itself may be of a flat ring shape, a free-movement gimbal mounting inside a vehicle requires a spherical volume for the flywheel to freely rotate within. Left to its own, a spinning flywheel in a vehicle would slowly precess following the Earth's rotation, and precess further yet in vehicles that travel long distances over the Earth's curved spherical surface.

A full-motion gimbal has additional problems of how to communicate power into and out of the flywheel, since the flywheel could potentially flip completely over once a day, precessing as the Earth rotates. Full free rotation would require [[slip ring]]s around each gimbal axis for power conductors, further adding to the design complexity.

==== Limited-motion gimbals ====
To reduce space usage, the gimbal system may be of a limited-movement design, using shock absorbers to cushion sudden rapid motions within a certain number of degrees of out-of-plane angular rotation, and then gradually forcing the flywheel to adopt the vehicle's current orientation. This reduces the gimbal movement space around a ring-shaped flywheel from a full sphere, to a short thickened cylinder, encompassing for example ± 30 degrees of pitch and ± 30 degrees of roll in all directions around the flywheel.

==== Counterbalancing of angular momentum ====
An alternative solution to the problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions. They would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect. A problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque. Both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero. Strictly speaking, the two flywheels would exert a huge [[torque]]ing moment at the central point, trying to bend the axle. However, if the axle were sufficiently strong, no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the sealed container, so no torque would be noticed.

To further balance the forces and spread out strain, a single large flywheel can be balanced by two half-size flywheels on each side, or the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions. However this increases housing and bearing complexity.

== Applications ==

=== Transportation ===

==== Automotive ====

In the 1950s, flywheel-powered buses, known as [[gyrobus]]es, were used in [[Yverdon]] ([[Switzerland]]) and [[Ghent]] ([[Belgium]]) and there is ongoing research to make flywheel systems that are smaller, lighter, cheaper and have a greater capacity.  It is hoped that flywheel systems can replace conventional chemical batteries for mobile applications, such as for electric vehicles.  Proposed flywheel systems would eliminate many of the disadvantages of existing battery power systems, such as low capacity, long charge times, heavy weight and short usable lifetimes. Flywheels may have been used in the experimental [[Chrysler Patriot]], though that has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/patriot.html|title=Chrysler Patriot hybrid-electric racing car: 20 years early for F1 racing?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flywheels have also been proposed for use in [[continuously variable transmission]]s. Punch Powertrain is currently working on such a device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agoria.be/www.wsc/Punch-Powertrain-werkt-aan-revolutionaire-vliegwiel-hybride-transmissie-150269?vWebSessionID=32896&amp;vUserID=999999&amp;ENewsID=86139&amp;TopicID=8420&amp;TopicList=8420&amp;ComingFromResultTopic=5306|title=Agoria&gt;GoodNews!&gt;Archieven 2012&gt;Punch Powertrain werkt aan revolutionaire vliegwiel-hybride transmissie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, [[Rosen Motors]] developed a [[gas turbine]] powered [[series hybrid]] automotive powertrain using a 55,000 rpm flywheel to provide bursts of acceleration which the small gas turbine engine could not provide.  The flywheel also stored energy through [[regenerative braking]].  The flywheel was composed of a [[titanium]] hub with a [[carbon fiber]] cylinder and was [[gimbal]]-mounted to minimize adverse gyroscopic effects on vehicle handling.  The prototype vehicle was successfully road tested in 1997 but was never mass-produced.&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Electric Automobile: Hybrid Electric Vehicles |last=Wakefield |first=Ernest |date=1998|publisher=SAE|isbn=978-0-7680-0125-9|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] announced a flywheel system fitted to the rear axle of its S60 sedan. Braking action spins the flywheel at up to 60,000 rpm and stops the front-mounted engine. Flywheel energy is applied via a special transmission to partially or completely power the vehicle. The {{convert|20|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|6|kg|adj=on}} [[carbon fiber]] flywheel spins in a vacuum to eliminate friction. When partnered with a four-cylinder engine, it offers up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption versus a comparably performing turbo six-cylinder, providing an 80&amp;nbsp;hp boost and allowing it to reach {{convert|100|km/h}} in 5.5 seconds. The company did not announce specific plans to include the technology in its product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/volvo-flywheel-kers-testing/27273/ |title=Volvo confirms fuel savings of 25 percent with flywheel KERS |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 [[GKN]] acquired [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] Hybrid Power (WHP) division and intends to  supply 500  [[carbon fiber]] ''Gyrodrive'' electric flywheel systems to urban bus operators over the next two years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/gkn-go-ahead-group-using-f1-technology-improve-fuel-efficiency-london-buses/|title=GKN and the Go-Ahead Group using F1 technology to improve fuel efficiency of London buses|author=Webmaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the former developer name implies, these were originally designed for [[Formula one]] [[motor racing]] applications. In September 2014, [[Oxford Bus Company]] announced that it is introducing 14 ''Gyrodrive hybrid'' buses by [[Alexander Dennis]] on its Brookes Bus operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxfordbus.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/its-the-new-brookesbus/|title=It’s the New BROOKESbus!|work=Oxford Bus Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-29030173|title=BBC News - Formula One race technology to power buses in Oxford|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rail vehicles ====
Flywheel systems have been used experimentally in small [[electric locomotive]]s for shunting or [[switcher|switching]], e.g. the [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel-Oerlikon Gyro Locomotive]].  Larger electric locomotives, e.g. [[British Rail Class 70 (electric)|British Rail Class 70]], have sometimes been fitted with flywheel boosters to carry them over gaps in the [[third rail]]. Advanced flywheels, such as the 133&amp;nbsp;kWh pack of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], can take a train from a standing start up to cruising speed.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"/&gt;

The [[Parry People Mover]] is a [[railcar]] which is powered by a flywheel. It was trialled on Sundays for 12 months on the [[Stourbridge Town Branch Line]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]] during 2006 and 2007 and was intended to be introduced as a full service by the train operator [[London Midland]] in December 2008 once two units had been ordered. In January 2010, both units are in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonmidland.com/index.php/news/news_items/view/23|title=Parry People Movers for Stourbridge branch line|date=2008-01-03|accessdate=2008-03-19|publisher=[[London Midland]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110918/http://www.londonmidland.com/index.php/news/news_items/view/23 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rail electrification ====
FES can be used at the lineside of electrified railways to help regulate the line voltage thus improving the acceleration of unmodified electric trains and the amount of energy recovered back to the line during [[regenerative braking]], thus lowering energy bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/high-speed-flywheels-cut-energy-bill.html
|title=High-speed flywheels cut energy bill|date=2001-04-01|accessdate=2010-12-02|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trials have taken place in London, New York, Lyon and Tokyo,&lt;ref name=RG-KESS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/kinetic-energy-storage-wins-acceptance.html |title=Kinetic energy storage wins acceptance|date=2004-04-01|accessdate=2010-12-02|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York MTA]]'s [[Long Island Rail Road]] is now investing $5.2m in a pilot project on LIRR's [[West Hempstead Branch]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/new-york-orders-fly-wheel-energy-storage.html |title=New York orders flywheel energy storage|date=2009-08-14|accessdate=2011-02-09|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These trials and systems store kinetic energy in rotors consisting of a carbon-glass composite cylinder packed with neodymium-iron-boron powder that forms a permanent magnet. These spin at up to 37800rev/min, and each 100&amp;nbsp;kW unit can store 11 MJ of re-usable energy.&lt;ref name=RG-KESS/&gt;

=== Uninterruptible power supplies ===
Flywheel power storage systems in production {{as of|2001|lc=y}} have storage capacities comparable to batteries and faster discharge rates.  They are mainly used to provide load leveling for large battery systems, such as an [[uninterruptible power supply]] for data centers as they save a considerable amount of space compared to battery systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2007/06/26/flywheels-gain-as-alternative-to-batteries/|title=Flywheel gains as alternative to batteries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flywheel maintenance in general runs about one-half the cost of traditional battery UPS systems. The only maintenance is a basic annual preventive maintenance routine and replacing the bearings every five to ten years, which takes about four hours.&lt;ref name="Distributed Energy"/&gt; Newer flywheel systems completely levitate the spinning mass using maintenance-free [[magnetic bearing]]s, thus eliminating mechanical bearing maintenance and failures.&lt;ref name="Distributed Energy"/&gt;

Costs of a fully installed flywheel UPS (including power conditioning) are (in 2009) about $330 per [[kilowatt]] (for 15 seconds full-load capacity).&lt;ref name=Andrews2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/active-power-article-flywheel-energy-storage.html|title=Active Power Article - Flywheel energy storage - Claverton Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test laboratories ===
A long-standing niche market for flywheel power systems are facilities where [[circuit breaker]]s and similar devices are tested: even a small household circuit breaker may be rated to interrupt a current of {{val|10,000}} or more amperes, and larger units may have [[breaking capacity|interrupting ratings]] of {{val|100,000}} or {{val|1,000,000}} amperes.  The enormous transient loads produced by deliberately forcing such devices to demonstrate their ability to interrupt simulated short circuits would have unacceptable effects on the local grid if these tests were done directly from building power.  Typically such a laboratory will have several large motor–generator sets, which can be spun up to speed over several minutes; then the motor is disconnected before a circuit breaker is tested.

===Physics laboratories===
[[Tokamak]] fusion experiments need very high currents for brief intervals (mainly to power large electromagnets for a few seconds). 
*JET (the [[Joint European Torus]]) has two 775 ton flywheels (installed in 1981) that spin up to 225 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/news/detail/week-20-jet-experiments-sensitive-to-tv-schedules/? |title=Week 20: JET Experiments: sensitive to TV schedules}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each flywheel stores 3.75 GJ and can deliver at up to 400MW.&lt;ref name=JETFW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/fusion/jet-tech/jets-flywheels/ |title=Power supply }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[ASDEX Upgrade|ASDEX]] has 3 flywheel generators.
*[[DIII-D (tokamak)]] at [[General Atomics]]
*the [[Princeton Large Torus]] (PLT) at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]

Also the non-tokamak:  [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod synchrotron]] at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] had two 30 ton flywheels.

===Aircraft launching systems===
The [[Ford class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford''-class aircraft carrier]] will use flywheels to accumulate energy from the ship's power supply, for rapid release into the [[EMALS|electromagnetic aircraft launch system]]. The shipboard power system cannot on its own supply the high power transients necessary to launch aircraft. Each of four rotors will store 121&amp;nbsp;MJ at 6400&amp;nbsp;rpm. They can store 122&amp;nbsp;MJ in 45 secs and release it in 2–3 seconds.&lt;ref name=EMALS&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://carcamal.ele.cie.uva.es/CEM/articulos/Catapult.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030708024628/http://carcamal.ele.cie.uva.es/CEM/articulos/Catapult.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-07-08 |author=Michael R.

Klimowski |last-author-amp=yes |title=Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System - EMALS |format=PDF |date=1994-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flywheel energy densities are 28 kJ/kg; including the stators and cases this comes down to 18.1 kJ/kg, excluding the torque frame.&lt;ref name=EMALS/&gt;

=== NASA G2 flywheel for spacecraft energy storage  ===
This was a design funded by [[NASA]]'s Glenn Research Center and intended for component testing in a laboratory environment. It used a carbon fiber rim with a titanium hub designed to spin at 60,000 rpm, mounted on magnetic bearings. Weight was limited to 250 pounds. Storage was 525 W-hr (1.89 MJ) and could be charged or discharged at 1&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20060028492.pdf G2 Flywheel Module Design]&lt;/ref&gt; The working model shown in the photograph at the top of the page ran at 41,000 rpm on September 2, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20050217267|title=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amusement rides ===
The [[Incredible Hulk Coaster|Incredible Hulk roller coaster]] at [[Islands of Adventure|Universal's Islands of Adventure]] features a rapidly accelerating uphill launch as opposed to the typical gravity drop. This is achieved through powerful [[traction motor]]s that throw the car up the track. To achieve the brief very high current required to accelerate a full coaster train to full speed uphill, the park utilizes several motor generator sets with large flywheels. Without these stored energy units, the park would have to invest in a new substation or risk [[Brownout (electricity)|browning-out]] the local energy grid every time the ride launches.

=== Pulse power ===
Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) are found in a variety of applications ranging from grid-connected energy management to uninterruptible power supplies. With the progress of technology, there is fast renovation involved in FESS application. Examples include high power weapons, aircraft powertrains and shipboard power systems, where the system requires a very high-power for a short period in order of a few seconds and even milliseconds.
Compensated pulsed alternator (compulsator) is one of the most popular choices of pulsed power supplies for fusion reactors, high-power pulsed lasers, and hypervelocity electromagnetic launchers because of its high energy density and power density, which is generally designed for the FESS&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7065239/&lt;/ref&gt;. 
[[Compulsator]]s (low-inductance alternators) act like capacitors, they can be spun up to provide pulsed power for railguns and lasers. Instead of having a separate flywheel and generator, only the large rotor of the alternator stores energy. See also [[Homopolar generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orbitalvector.com/Power/COMPULSATORS.htm|title=COMPULSATORS|author=|date=|website=orbitalvector.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor sports ===

=== Grid energy storage ===
{{anchor|Frequency regulation}}&lt;!-- old section name after rename --&gt;
{{main|Flywheel storage power system|Grid energy storage}}
Flywheels are sometimes used as short term [[Operating reserve|
spinning reserve]] for momentary grid [[Utility frequency|frequency regulation]] and balancing sudden changes between supply and consumption. No carbon emissions, faster response times and ability to buy power at off-peak hours are among the advantages of using flywheels instead of traditional sources of energy like natural gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaconpower.com/products/EnergyStorageSystems/docs/BeaconPower_solutions_grid.pdf Flywheel-based Solutions for Grid Reliability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712140640/http://www.beaconpower.com/products/EnergyStorageSystems/docs/BeaconPower_solutions_grid.pdf |date=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation is very similar to batteries in the same application, their differences are primarily economic.

[[Beacon Power]] opened a 5 MWh (20 MW over 15 mins)&lt;ref name="Beacon2"/&gt; flywheel energy storage plant in [[Stephentown, New York]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandia.gov/ess/docs/pr_conferences/2014/Thursday/Session7/02_Areseneaux_Jim_20MW_Flywheel_Energy_Storage_Plant_140918.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; using 200 flywheels&lt;ref name=BS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beaconpower.com/stephentown-new-york/|title=Stephentown, New York  -  Beacon Power|author=|date=|website=beaconpower.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar 20 MW system at [[Hazle Township, Pennsylvania]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beaconpower.com/hazle-township-pennsylvania/|title=Hazle Township, Pennsylvania  -  Beacon Power|author=|date=|website=beaconpower.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind turbines ===
Flywheels may be used to store energy generated by wind turbines during off-peak periods or during high wind speeds.

[[Beacon Power]] began testing of their Smart Energy 25 (Gen 4) flywheel energy storage system at a wind farm in [[Tehachapi, California]]. The system is part of a wind power/flywheel demonstration project being carried out for the California Energy Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/03/beacon-connects-flywheel-system-to-california-wind-farm|title=Beacon Connects Flywheel System to California Wind Farm|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
[[Friction motor]]s used to power many [[toy car]]s, trucks, trains, action toys and such, are simple flywheel motors.

=== Toggle action presses ===
In industry, [[toggle action press]]es are still popular. The usual arrangement involves a very strong [[crankshaft]] and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press. Large and heavy flywheels are driven by electric motors but the flywheels only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated.

== Comparison to electric batteries ==

Flywheels are not as adversely affected by temperature changes, can operate at a much wider temperature range, and are not subject to many of the common failures of chemical [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpoweruk.com/lithium_failures.htm |title=Lithium Battery Failures |publisher=Mpoweruk.com |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also less potentially damaging to the environment, being largely made of [[Chemically inert|inert]] or benign materials. Another advantage of flywheels is that by a simple measurement of the rotation speed it is possible to know the exact amount of energy stored.

Unlike most batteries which only operate for a finite period (for example roughly 36 months in the case of [[lithium ion polymer batteries]]), a flywheel potentially has an indefinite working lifespan. Flywheels built as part of [[James Watt]] [[steam engines]] have been continuously working for more than two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=7177 |title=Boulton and Watt steam engine |author=Powerhouse Museum |accessdate=2 August 2012 |publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working examples of ancient flywheels used mainly in milling and pottery can be found in many locations in Africa, Asia, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Most modern flywheels are typically sealed devices that need minimal maintenance throughout their service lives. Magnetic bearing flywheels in vacuum enclosures, such as the NASA model depicted above, do not need any bearing maintenance and are therefore superior to batteries both in terms of total lifetime and energy storage capacity. Flywheel systems with mechanical bearings will have limited lifespans due to wear.

The physical arrangement of batteries can be designed to match a wide variety of configurations, whereas a flywheel at a minimum must occupy a fixed square surface area and volume. Where dimensions are a constraint for the application of an energy storage technology, (e.g. under the chassis of a train in a tunnel), a flywheel may not be a viable solution.

An '''incandescent gas mantle''', '''gas mantle''' or '''Welsbach mantle''' is a device for generating bright white light when heated by a flame.  The name refers to its original heat source in [[Gas lighting|gas light]]s, which filled the [[street lighting|streets]] of [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the late 19th century, mantle referring to the way it is hung above the flame.  Today it is still used in portable [[camping]] [[lantern]]s, [[Kerosene lamps#Pressure lantern|pressure lanterns]] and some oil lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aladdinlamps.com/ Aladdin Mantle Lamp Co.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas mantles are usually sold as fabric items, which, because of impregnation with metal nitrates, form a rigid but fragile mesh of metal oxides when heated during initial use; these metal oxides produce light from the heat of the flame whenever used. [[Thorium dioxide]] was commonly a major component; being [[radioactive]], it has led to concerns about the safety of those involved in manufacturing mantles.  Normal use, however, poses minimal health risk.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Gas mantle 01.jpg|thumb|Gas mantle in a street lamp (cold)]]
[[File:Gas mantle 02.jpg|thumb|Hot gas mantles. The lowest visible mantle has partially broken, reducing its light output.]]
[[File:Sumburgh Lighthouse Lamp.jpg|thumb|An 85&amp;nbsp;mm [[Chance Brothers]] ''Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation'', which produced the light for the [[Sumburgh Head Lighthouse]] until 1976. The lamp (made around 1914) burned vaporised [[kerosene|paraffin]]; the vaporiser was heated by a [[methylated spirit]] burner to light. When lit, some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a [[Bunsen burner]] to keep the vaporiser warm and the fuel in vapour form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn pressurised the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The "white sock" is the mantle on which the vapour burned, as yet unused.]]

The mantle is a roughly [[pear]]-shaped fabric bag, made from silk, [[ramie]]-based artificial silk, or [[rayon]].  The fibers are impregnated with [[rare-earth]] metallic salts; when the mantle is heated in a flame, the fibers burn away, and the metallic salts convert to solid oxides, forming a brittle ceramic shell in the shape of the original fabric.  A mantle glows brightly in the visible [[spectrum]] while emitting little [[infrared]] radiation.  The [[rare-earth]] oxides ([[cerium]]) and actinide ([[thorium]]) in the mantle have a low [[emissivity]] in the infrared (in comparison with an ideal [[black body]]) but have high emissivity in the [[visible spectrum]].  There is also some evidence that the emission is enhanced by [[candoluminescence]], the emission of light from the combustion products before they reach thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Ivey"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = H. F. Ivey | title = Candoluminescence and radical-excited luminescence | journal = Journal of Luminescence | year = 1974 | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–307 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2313(74)90001-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The combination of these properties yields a mantle that, when heated by a [[kerosene]] or [[liquified petroleum gas]] flame, emits intense radiation that is mostly visible light, with relatively little energy in the unwanted infrared, increasing the luminous efficiency.

The mantle aids the combustion process by keeping the flame small and contained inside itself at higher fuel flow rates than in a simple lamp.  This concentration of combustion inside the mantle improves the transfer of heat from the flame to the mantle. The mantle shrinks after all the fabric material has burned away and becomes very fragile after its first use.

== History ==
For centuries, artificial light has been generated using open [[flame]]s. [[Limelight]] was invented in the 1820s, but the temperature required to produce visible light through [[black-body radiation]] alone was too high to be practical for small lights.  In the late 19th century several inventors tried to develop an effective alternative based on heating a material to a lower temperature but using the emission of discrete [[spectral lines]] to simulate white light.

Many early attempts used [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] gauze soaked in metal [[nitrate]]s, but these were not successful because of the high cost of these materials and their poor reliability. The first effective mantle was the [[Clamond basket]] in 1881, named after its inventor. This device was made from a cleverly produced matrix of [[magnesium oxide]], which did not need to be supported by a platinum wire cage, and was exhibited in the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] exhibition of 1883.

The modern gas mantle was one of the many inventions of [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], a [[chemist]] who studied [[rare-earth element]]s in the 1880s and who had been [[Robert Bunsen]]'s student. Ignaz Kreidl worked with him on his early experiments to create the Welsbach mantle. His first process used a mixture of 60% [[magnesium oxide]], 20% [[lanthanum oxide]] and 20% [[yttrium oxide]], which he called "Actinophor" and patented in 1885.  These original mantles gave off a green-tinted light and were not very successful. Carl Auer von Welsbach's first company established a factory in [[Atzgersdorf]] in 1887, but it failed in 1889. In 1890 he discovered that thorium was superior to magnesium, and in 1891 he perfected a new mixture of 99% [[thorium dioxide]] and 1% [[cerium dioxide]] that gave off a much whiter light and produced a stronger mantle. After introducing this new mantle commercially in 1892, it quickly spread throughout Europe. The gas mantle remained an important part of street lighting until the widespread introduction of electric lighting in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[Image:Mantles in their unused flat-packed form.jpg|frame|Mantles in their unused flat-packed form]]
To produce a mantle, [[cotton]] is woven or knit into a net bag, impregnated with soluble nitrates of the chosen metals and then heated; the cotton burns away, and the nitrates are converted to nitrites, which fuse together to form a solid mesh. As the heating continues, the nitrites finally decompose into a fragile mesh of solid oxides of very high melting point.

Early mantles were sold in the unheated cotton mesh condition, since the oxide structure was too fragile to transport easily. The mantle was converted to working form when the cotton burned away on first use. Unused mantles could not be stored for very long, since the cotton quickly rotted due to the corrosive nature of the acidic metal nitrates, a problem that was later addressed by soaking the mantle in an [[ammonia]] solution to neutralize the excess acid.

Later mantles were made from guncotton ([[nitrocellulose]]) or [[collodion]] rather than ordinary cotton, since extremely fine threads of this material could be produced, but it had to be converted back to [[cellulose]] by immersion in [[ammonium sulfide]] before first use, since guncotton is highly flammable and can be explosive. Later, it was discovered that a cotton mantle could be strengthened sufficiently by dipping it in a solution of [[collodion]], which coated it with a thin layer, which would be burned off when the mantle was first used.

Mantles have a binding thread to tie them to the lamp fitting. Until it was banned due to its [[carcinogen]]icity, [[asbestos]] thread was used; modern mantles use a wire or a [[ceramic]] fiber thread.

== Safety concerns ==

=== Thorium ===
[[Thorium]] is radioactive and produces the radioactive gas [[radon]]-220 as one of its [[decay products]].  Moreover, when heated to incandescence, the thorium volatilizes its in-growth [[Radio-daughter]]s, particularly [[radium]]-224.  Despite its very short half-life, radium quickly replenishes from its radio-parent (thorium-228), and every new heating of the mantle to incandescence releases a fresh flush of radium-224 into the air. This byproduct can be inhaled if the mantle is being used indoors, and is an internal [[alpha particle|alpha-emitter]] radio-toxicity concern. Secondary decay products of thorium include [[radium]] and [[actinium]]. Because of this, there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles. Some [[nuclear safety]] agencies make recommendations about their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arpansa.gov.au/RadiationProtection/Factsheets/is_lantern.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913154015/http://www.arpansa.gov.au/radiationprotection/factsheets/is_lantern.cfm |archivedate=2010-09-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study in 1981 estimated that the dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend for a year would be {{convert|3|–|6|µSv|mrem|sigfig=1|lk=on}}, tiny in comparison to the normal annual [[background radiation]] dose of around {{convert|2.4|mSv|mrem|abbr=on|lk=on}}. A person actually ingesting a mantle would receive a dose of {{convert|2|mSv|mrem|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalunlimited.com/lanternsstoves/aladdinmantleinfo.htm Stoves - Survival Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403224859/http://www.survivalunlimited.com/lanternsstoves/aladdinmantleinfo.htm |date=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams" &gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/031205.html The Straight Dope: Are camp lanterns radioactive?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the radioactivity is a major concern for people involved with the manufacture of mantles and an issue with contamination of soil around some former factory sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/hhazweb/hhw_no_3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613095721/http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/hhazweb/hhw_no_3.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One potential cause for concern is that particles from thorium gas mantles "fall out" over time and get into the air, where they may be ingested in food or drink. These particles may also be inhaled and remain in the lungs or liver, causing long-term exposure. Also of concern is the release of thorium-bearing dust if the mantle shatters due to mechanical impact.

All of these issues have led to the use of alternatives in some countries, usually [[yttrium]] or sometimes [[zirconium]], although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Safety concerns were the subject of a federal suit against the [[Coleman Company]] (''Wagner v. Coleman''), which initially agreed to place warning labels on the mantles for this concern, and subsequently switched to using yttrium.&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/radioactive-danger-of-mantle-lamps-zmaz82ndzgoe&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001 the [[NUREG]] published a study about the ''Systematic Radiological Assessment of Exemptions for Source and Byproduct Materials''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1717/nureg-1717.pdf NUREG-1717 (section 3.14. Incandescent Mantles)]. PDF 3,1 MB].&lt;/ref&gt; stating that radioactive gas mantles are explicitly legal in the US.&lt;ref&gt;NUREG-1717 section 3.14.: "any person is exempt from the requirements for a license to the extent that the person receives, possesses, uses, or transfers any quantity of thorium contained in incandescent gas mantles. This exemption was established on March 20, 1947 (12 FR 1855), and has remained essentially unchanged since that time."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baskets Wicker.jpg|thumb|A selection of [[wicker]] hampers]]

A '''hamper''' refers to one of several related basket-like items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamper|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hamper|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primarily British usage, it refers to a [[wicker]] [[basket]], usually large, that is used for the transport of items, often food. In North America, the term generally refers to a [[household]] receptacle, often a basket, for clean (out of the dryer or off the line) or dirty [[clothing]], regardless of its composition, i.e. "a [[laundry]] hamper". Typically a laundry hamper is used for storage and will be sturdier, taller and have a lid while a laundry basket is open and used mainly for transport.

In agricultural use, a hamper is a wide-mouthed container of basketwork that may often be carried on the back during the [[harvest]]ing of fruit or vegetables by hand by workers in the field. The contents of the hamper may be [[decant]]ed regularly into larger containers or a cart, wagon, or truck.

The open ventilation and the sturdiness offered by a hamper has made it suitable for the transport of food, hence the use of the [[picnic]] hamper.

At one time it was common for laundry services to leave a large basketwork container with a [[lid (container)|lid]] which is now commonly referred to as a clothes hamper. The same type of container would be used to return clean clothing, which would be put away by the laundry service and the empty container left in place of the full container for later pickup. This type of daily or bi-daily hamper service was most common with Chinese laundry services in 19th-century England and America.

==Charitable hamper==
{{See also|Clothing bin}}

There is a long tradition of community and social [[philanthropy]] and [[alms|charity]] related to hampers, in which persons or community groups donate to needy people a hamper of [[food]], [[clothing]], [[wikt:toiletry|toiletries]], [[cleaning product]]s, or other [[wikt:household necessity|household necessities]], to assist with their family economy.

Up until the mid 20th century, in the Western tradition, the hamper was a basket that could be carried by the [[donation|donor]] and physically handed to the recipient. This limited the size of the gift to food ingredients for at most several days, or other necessities for one to two weeks. The basket itself was a useful item around the house or farm, and any cloth [[wikt:wrapping|wrapping]] for the food or [[wikt:lining|lining]] of the basket would also be usable by the recipient family.

In more recent times, the hamper would likely be a plastic bag or [[acrylic fibre]] bag of a size that can be carried, with [[wikt:tinned|tinned]] or packaged goods. A [[Christmas]] hamper is likely to be bigger and have some party or celebratory foods, or toys. Hampers can also contain related festive foods.

==Christmas hamper==
A Christmas hamper is a traditional gift containing small nonperishable food items, particularly seasonal favorites such as [[fruitcake]] or [[plum pudding]], chocolate, nuts, jams, [[cookie|biscuits]], honey, smoked or dried meats, and cheese. Some hampers containing tea, coffee, or cocoa might also include a cup and saucer, often seasonally themed or personalized. Luxury hampers may also contain high-end items such as tins of [[caviar]] or small bottles of wine. A "fresh hamper" contains perishable items such as fruits, baked goods, or flowers. The tradition of the Christmas hamper may be intended as a special holiday meal for people who might otherwise have no memorable meal to mark the occasion, or for people such as students or shut-ins who are unable to join their families for Christmas.

In the US, the Christmas hamper is more usually called a [[gift basket]] and does not necessarily contain food items. Non-food gift baskets are frequently themed, such as baskets containing luxury bath items including scented soaps and towels, or beauty baskets with skincare products, perfumes, or lotions. These gift baskets are also popular for occasions other than Christmas.

==Commercial hampers==
A number of companies exist that sell ready-made food hampers or provide customers the service of compiling a custom hamper for them, which may involve company staff going shopping for requested specific items on behalf of individual customers. Such hampers are popular [[gift]] items in the UK and Ireland. Hamper companies usually link their services to certain occasions, most particularly Christmas, and provide options for payment across the year. Grocers, [[delicatessen|delis]] and supermarkets may also stock ready-made hampers, though mostly just on a seasonal basis, and with a selection generally limited to items stocked by the store or sourced from their own suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of very large grocery chains, this may however still be a substantial selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently dietary hamper companies have sprung up which provide sufferers of diseases such as [[diabetes]] or those intolerant to foods such as [[gluten]] a selection of food which is suitable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23018">A '''head-mounted display''' (or ''[[helmet-mounted display]]'', for aviation applications), both abbreviated '''HMD''', is a display device, worn on the head or as part of a helmet, that has a small display optic in front of one ([[monocular]] HMD) or each eye (binocular HMD). A HMD has many uses, including in gaming, aviation, engineering, and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Head mounted display |journal=Displays |date=1 April 2002 |volume=23 |issue=1-2 |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1016/S0141-9382(02)00010-0 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938202000100 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en |issn=0141-9382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an [[optical head-mounted display]] (OHMD), which is a wearable display that can reflect projected images and allows a user to see through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sutherland |first1=Ivan E. |title=A head-mounted three dimensional display |date=9 December 1968 |pages=757–764 |doi=10.1145/1476589.1476686 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1476686 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HTC Vive (11).jpg|thumb|A [[HTC Vive]] headset.]]

== Overview ==
A typical HMD has one or two small displays, with lenses and semi-transparent mirrors embedded in eyeglasses (also termed ''data glasses''), a visor, or a helmet. The display units are miniaturised and may include [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT), [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[liquid crystal on silicon]] (LCos), or [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED). Some vendors employ multiple micro-displays to increase total resolution and [[field of view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jhag |first1=Pirogg |title=Gambling Trends for Online Casino |url=http://imoneyslots.com/blog/top-5-gambling-trends-for-online-casino.html |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HMDs differ in whether they can display only [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), or only live imagery from the physical world, or combination. Most HMDs can display only a computer-generated image, sometimes referred to as virtual image. Some HMDs can allow a CGI to be superimposed on real-world view. This is sometimes referred to as [[augmented reality]] or [[mixed reality]]. Combining real-world view with CGI can be done by projecting the CGI through a partially reflective mirror and viewing the real world directly. This method is often called ''optical see-through''. Combining real-world view with CGI can also be done electronically by accepting video from a camera and mixing it electronically with CGI. This method is often called ''video see-through''.

== Optical HMD ==
{{Main article|Optical head-mounted display}}
An optical head-mounted display uses an optical mixer which is made of partly silvered mirrors. It can reflect artificial images, and let real images cross the lens, and let a user look through it.

Various methods have existed for see-through HMD's, most of which can be summarized into two main families based on ''curved mirrors'' or ''[[waveguide]]s''. Curved mirrors have been used by [[Laster Technologies]], and by [[Vuzix]] in their Star 1200 product. Various waveguide methods have existed for years. These include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, and reflective optics.

== Applications ==
Major HMD applications include military, government (fire, police, etc.), and civilian-commercial (medicine, video gaming, sports, etc.).

=== Aviation and tactical, ground ===
{{Main article|Helmet mounted display}}
In 1962, [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] revealed the [[Electrocular]], a [[Cathode ray tube|compact CRT]](7" long), head-mounted monocular display that reflected a [[Television|TV]] signal in to transparent eyepiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827272,00.html|title=Science: Second Sight|date=13 April 1962|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James Miller, Fullerton, CA, research psychologist for the Ground Systems Group at Hughes, "I've Got a Secret", April 9, 1962 on [[CBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Third Eye for Space Explorers", Popular Electronics, July 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"‘Seeing Things’ with Electrocular", Science &amp; Mechanics, Aug, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruggedized HMDs are increasingly being integrated into the [[cockpit]]s of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft. These are usually fully integrated with the pilot's flying helmet and may include protective visors, [[night vision device]]s, and displays of other [[symbology (avionics)|symbology]].

Military, police, and firefighters use HMDs to display tactical information such as maps or thermal imaging data while viewing a real scene. Recent applications have included the use of HMD for [[paratrooper]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada435253|title=A Three Dimensional Helmet Mounted Primary Flight Reference for Paratroopers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Liteye HMD was introduced for ground combat troops as a rugged, waterproof lightweight display that clips into a standard US PVS-14 military helmet mount. The self-contained color monocular [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display replaces the NVG tube and connects to a mobile computing device. The LE has see-through ability and can be used as a standard HMD or for [[augmented reality]] applications. The design is optimized to provide high definition data under all lighting conditions, in covered or see-through modes of operation. The LE has a low power consumption, operating on four AA batteries for 35 hours or receiving power via standard [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/products/l/liteye-displays.htm Liteye OLED Helmet Mounted Displays] / Defence Update – Year 2005 Issue: 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) continues to fund research in [[augmented reality]] HMDs as part of the Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) Program. [[Vuzix]] is currently working on a system for PCAS that will use holographic [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguides]] to produce see-through augmented reality glasses that are only a few millimeters thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Darpa’s Hologram Goggles Will Unleash Drone Hell|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/04/holograms-bring-hell/|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=Wired.com Danger Room|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
Engineers and scientists use HMDs to provide stereoscopic views of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) schematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/Hardware/ArticleID/12699/Understanding-Virtual-Reality-Headsets.aspx|title=Understanding Virtual Reality Headsets|last=Wheeler|first=Andrew|date=July 2016|website=Engineering.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual reality, when applied to engineering and design, is a key factor in integration of the human in the design. By enabling engineers to interact with their designs in full life-size scale, products can be validated for issues that may not have been visible until physical prototyping. The use of HMDs for VR is seen as supplemental to the conventional use of [[Cave automatic virtual environment|CAVE]] for VR simulation. HMDs are predominantly used for single-person interaction with the design, while CAVEs allow for more collaborative virtual reality sessions.

Head Mounted Display systems are also used in the maintenance of complex systems, as they can give a technician a simulated ''x-ray vision'' by combining computer graphics such as system diagrams and imagery with the technician's natural vision (augmented or modified reality).

=== Medicine and research === 
There are also applications in surgery, wherein a combination of radiographic data ([[X-ray computed tomography]] (CAT) scans, and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) imaging) is combined with the surgeon's natural view of the operation, and anesthesia, where the patient vital signs are within the anesthesiologist's field of view at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/110/4/1032.full|title=Monitoring with Head-Mounted Displays in General Anesthesia: A Clinical Evaluation in the Operating Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye tracking HMD with LED illuminators and cameras to measure eye movements]]Research universities often use HMDs to conduct studies related to vision, balance, cognition and neuroscience. As of 2010, the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild [[traumatic brain injury]] was being studied. In visual tracking tests, a HMD unit with [[eye tracking]] ability shows an object moving in a regular pattern. People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with ''[[smooth pursuit]] eye movements'' and correct [[trajectory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maruta|first1=J|last2=Lee|first2=SW|last3=Jacobs|first3=EF|last4=Ghajar|first4=J|title=A unified science of concussion|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=1208|pages=58–66|pmid=20955326|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05695.x|pmc=3021720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low cost HMD devices are available for use with 3D games and entertainment applications. One of the first commercially available HMDs was the [[VFX1 Headgear|Forte VFX1]] which was announced at [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Nathan|title=VFX-1 Virtual Reality Helmet by Forte|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/GameBytes/issue21/flooks/vfx1.html|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=GameBytes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VFX-1 had stereoscopic displays, 3-axis head-tracking, and stereo headphones.

Another pioneer in this field was Sony, which released the [[Glasstron]] in 1997. It had as an optional accessory a positional sensor which permitted the user to view the surroundings, with the perspective moving as the head moved, providing a deep sense of immersion.&lt;!-- and mechwarrior 2 [[MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat]] --&gt; One novel application of this technology was in the game ''[[MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat|MechWarrior 2]]'', which permitted users of the Sony Glasstron or Virtual I/O's iGlasses to adopt a new visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft's own cockpit.

As of 2013, many brands of video glasses can be connected to video and DSLR cameras, making them applicable as a new age monitor. As a result of the glasses ability to block out ambient light, filmmakers and photographers are able to see clearer presentations of their live images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitari.co.uk/zeiss-cinemizer-oled-3d-video-glasses-white.html|title=Video Glasses Can be Connected to DSLR Cameras|date=30 May 2013|publisher=Hitari|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
A HMD system has been developed for [[Formula One]] drivers by Kopin Corp. and the [[BMW]] Group. According to BMW, "''The HMD is part of an advanced telemetry system approved for installation by the Formula One racing committee… to communicate to the driver wirelessly from the heart of the race pit.''" The HMD will display critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focusing on the track. Pit crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through two-way [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sid.org/news/archive/industrynews0210.html|title=CDT Acquires Opsys' Dendrimer OLED Business|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705205801/http://www.sid.org/news/archive/industrynews0210.html|archivedate=2008-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training and simulation ===
[[File:VR-Helm.jpg|thumb|Paratrooper training with an HMD]]
A key application for HMDs is training and simulation, allowing to virtually place a trainee in a situation that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in real-life. Training with HMDs covers a wide range of applications from driving, welding and spray painting, [[Flight simulator|flight]] and vehicle simulators, dismounted soldier training, medical procedure training, and more. However, a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of certain types of head-mounted displays, and these issues must be resolved before optimal training and simulation is feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance parameters ==
* Ability to show stereoscopic imagery. A binocular HMD has the potential to display a different image to each eye. This can be used to show [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] images. It should be borne in mind that so-called 'Optical Infinity' is generally taken by flight surgeons and display experts as about 9 metres. This is the distance at which, given the average human eye rangefinder "baseline" (distance between the eyes or Inter[[pupillary distance]] (IPD)) of between 2.5 and 3&amp;nbsp;inches (6 and 8&amp;nbsp;cm), the angle of an object at that distance becomes essentially the same from each eye. At smaller ranges the perspective from each eye is significantly different and the expense of generating two different visual channels through the ''computer-generated imagery'' (CGI) system becomes worthwhile.
* [[Interpupillary distance]] (IPD). This is the distance between the two eyes, measured at the pupils, and is important in designing head-mounted displays.
* [[Field of view]] (FOV) – Humans have an FOV of around 180°, but most HMDs offer far less than this. Typically, a greater field of view results in a greater sense of immersion and better situational awareness. Most people do not have a good feel for what a particular quoted FOV would look like (e.g., 25°) so often manufacturers will quote an apparent screen size. Most people sit about 60&amp;nbsp;cm away from their monitors and have quite a good feel about screen sizes at that distance. To convert the manufacturer's apparent screen size to a desktop monitor position, divide the screen size by the distance in feet, then multiply by 2. Consumer-level HMDs typically offer a FOV of about 30-40° whereas professional HMDs offer a field of view of 60° to 150°.
* Resolution – HMDs usually mention either the total number of pixels or the number of pixels per degree. Listing the total number of pixels (e.g., 1600×1200 pixels per eye) is borrowed from how the specifications of computer monitors are presented. However, the pixel density, usually specified in pixels per degree or in arcminutes per pixel, is also used to determine visual acuity. 60 pixels/° (1 arcmin/pixel) is usually referred to as [[Optical resolution#Ocular resolution|eye limiting resolution]], above which increased resolution is not noticed by people with normal vision. HMDs typically offer 10 to 20 pixels/°, though advances in micro-displays help increase this number.
* Binocular overlap – measures the area that is common to both eyes. Binocular overlap is the basis for the sense of depth and stereo, allowing humans to sense which objects are near and which objects are far. Humans have a binocular overlap of about 100° (50° to the left of the nose and 50° to the right). The larger the binocular overlap offered by an HMD, the greater the sense of stereo. Overlap is sometimes specified in degrees (e.g., 74°) or as a percentage indicating how much of the visual field of each eye is common to the other eye.
* Distant focus (collimation). Optical methods may be used to present the images at a distant focus, which seems to improve the realism of images that in the real world would be at a distance.
* On-board processing and operating system. Some HMD vendors offer on-board operating systems such as Android, allowing applications to run locally on the HMD, and eliminating the need to be tethered to an external device to generate video. These are sometimes referred to as ''smart goggles''. To make the HMD construction lighter producers may move the processing system to connected smart necklace form-factor that would also offer the additional benefit of larger battery pack. Such solution would allow to design lite HMD with sufficient energy supply for dual video inputs or higher frequency time-based multiplexing (see below).

== Support of 3D video formats ==
[[File:Frame sequential 3D.jpg|thumb|Frame sequential multiplexing]]
[[File:Top and bottom to FS3D.jpg|thumb|Side-by-side and top-bottom multiplexing]]

Depth perception inside an HMD requires different images for the left and right eyes. There are multiple ways to provide these separate images:
* Use dual video inputs, thereby providing a completely separate video signal to each eye
* Time-based multiplexing. Methods such as frame sequential combine two separate video signals into one signal by alternating the left and right images in successive frames.
* Side by side or top-bottom multiplexing. This method allocated half of the image to the left eye and the other half of the image to the right eye.

The advantage of dual video inputs is that it provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye. The disadvantage of dual video inputs is that it requires separate video outputs and cables from the device generating the content.

Time-based multiplexing preserves the full resolution per each image, but reduces the frame rate by half. For example, if the signal is presented at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, each eye is receiving just 30&amp;nbsp;Hz updates. This may become an issue with accurately presenting fast-moving images.

Side-by-side and top-bottom multiplexing provide full-rate updates to each eye, but reduce the resolution presented to each eye. Many 3D broadcasts, such as [[ESPN]], chose to provide side-by-side 3D which saves the need to allocate extra transmission bandwidth and is more suitable to fast-paced sports action relative to time-based multiplexing methods.

Not all HMDs provide depth perception. Some lower-end modules are essentially bi-ocular devices where both eyes are presented with the same image.

3D video players sometimes allow maximum compatibility with HMDs by providing the user with a choice of the 3D format to be used.

== Peripherals ==
* The most rudimentary HMDs simply project an image or symbology on a wearer’s visor or reticle. The image is not slaved to the real world, i.e., the image does not change based on the wearer’s head position.
* More sophisticated HMDs incorporate a [[positioning system]] that tracks the wearer’s head position and angle, so that the picture or symbology displayed is congruent with the outside world using see-through imagery.
* Head tracking – Slaving the imagery. Head-mounted displays may also be used with tracking sensors that detect changes of angle and orientation. When such data is available in the system computer, it can be used to generate the appropriate computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the angle-of-look at the particular time. This allows the user to ''look around'' a [[virtual reality]] environment simply by moving the head without the need for a separate controller to change the angle of the imagery. In radio-based systems (compared to wires), the wearer may move about within the tracking limits of the system.
* [[Eye tracking]] – Eye trackers measure the point of gaze, allowing a computer to sense where the user is looking. This information is useful in a variety of contexts such as user interface navigation: By sensing the user's gaze, a computer can change the information displayed on a screen, bring added details to attention, etc.
* Hand tracking – tracking hand movement from the perspective of the HMD allows natural interaction with content and a convenient game-play mechanism

==History==

===Origins ===
As a field, instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral psychology]], though recently [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] has influenced thinking in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=Richard E|year=1992|title=Cognition and instruction: Their historic meeting within educational psychology|url=|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=84|issue=4|pages=405–412|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Cunningham, D. J. (1996). Constructivism: Implications for the design and delivery of instruction. In D. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology (pp. 170-198). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Jonassen, D. H. (1992). Constructivism: New implications for instructional technology. In T. Duffy &amp; D. Jonassen (Eds.), Constructivism and the technology of instruction (pp. 1-16). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the way it emerged during a period when the behaviorist paradigm was dominating American psychology. There are also those who cite that, aside from behaviorist psychology, the origin of the concept could be traced back to [[systems engineering]]. The impact of each of these fields is difficult to quantify, however, it is argued that the language and the "look and feel" of the early forms of instructional design and their progeny were derived from this engineering discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Design: International Perspectives. Theory, research, and models. Vol. 1|last=Tennyson|first=Robert|last2=Dijkstra|first2=S.|last3=Schott|first3=Frank|last4=Seel|first4=Norbert|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|year=1997|isbn=0805814000|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they were linked to the training development model used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], which were based on systems approach and was explained as "the idea of viewing a problem or situation in its entirety with all its ramifications, with all its interior interactions, with all its exterior connections and with full cognizance of its place in its context."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|last2=Foshay|first2=Wellesley|publisher=Pfeiffer|year=2010|isbn=9780470190685|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

The role of systems engineering in the early development of instructional design was demonstrated during [[World War II]] when a considerable amount of training materials for the military were developed based on the principles of instruction, learning, and human behavior. Tests for assessing a learner’s abilities were used to screen candidates for the training programs. After the success of military training, psychologists began to view training as a system and developed various analysis, design, and evaluation procedures.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; In 1946, [[Edgar Dale]] outlined a hierarchy of instructional methods, organized intuitively by their concreteness.&lt;ref name="slides"&gt;Clark, B.

===1950s===
B. F. Skinner's 1954 article “''The Science of Learning and the Art of Teaching''” suggested that effective instructional materials, called programmed instructional materials, should include small steps, frequent questions, and immediate feedback; and should allow self-pacing.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
[[Robert F. Mager]] popularized the use of learning objectives with his 1962 article “''Preparing Objectives for Programmed Instruction”''. The article describes how to write objectives including desired behavior, learning condition, and assessment.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
In 1956, a committee led by [[Benjamin Bloom]] published an influential [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives|taxonomy]] with three domains of learning: cognitive (what one knows or thinks), psychomotor (what one does, physically) and [[affective]] (what one feels, or what [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] one has). These taxonomies still influence the design of instruction.&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom's Taxonomy. Retrieved from Wikipedia on April 18, 2012 at [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bloom_taxonomy.jpg|thumb|right|Bloom's Taxonomy]]

===1960s===
[[Robert Glaser]] introduced “criterion-referenced measures” in 1962. In contrast to norm-referenced tests in which an individual's performance is compared to group performance, a criterion-referenced test is designed to test an individual's behavior in relation to an objective standard. It can be used to assess the learners’ entry level behavior, and to what extent learners have developed mastery through an instructional program.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1965, Robert Gagne (see below for more information) described three domains of learning outcomes (cognitive, affective, psychomotor), five learning outcomes (Verbal Information, Intellectual Skills, Cognitive Strategy, Attitude, Motor Skills), and nine events of instruction in “''The Conditions of Learning''”, which remain foundations of instructional design practices.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Gagne’s work in learning hierarchies and hierarchical analysis led to an important notion in instruction – to ensure that learners acquire prerequisite skills before attempting superordinate ones.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1967, after analyzing the failure of training material, Michael Scriven suggested the need for formative assessment – e.g., to try out instructional materials with learners (and revise accordingly) before declaring them finalized.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the number of instructional design models greatly increased and prospered in different sectors in military, academia, and industry.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Many instructional design theorists began to adopt an information-processing-based approach to the design of instruction. David Merrill for instance developed Component Display Theory (CDT), which concentrates on the means of presenting instructional materials (presentation techniques).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html Instructional Design Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194825/http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html |date=2011-10-04 }}. Instructionaldesign.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Although interest in instructional design continued to be strong in business and the military, there was little evolution of ID in schools or higher education.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReiserPDF"&gt;Reiser, R. A. (2001).

In this process, an instructional design project is prototyped quickly and then vetted through a series of try and revise cycles.

==Robert Gagné==
Robert Gagné's work is widely used and cited in the design of instruction, as exemplified by more than 130 citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from 1985 through 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, G. J., &amp; Towers, R. L. (1992). Reference citations in selected instructional design and technology journals, 1985-1990. Educational Technology Research and Development, 40, 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism, he provided a clear template, which is easy to follow for designing instructional events. Instructional designers who follow Gagné's theory will likely have tightly focused, efficient instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, J. D. (2001). Learning and cognition. [On-Line]. Available: {{cite web |url=http://education.indiana.edu/~p540/webcourse/gagne.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109131426/http://education.indiana.edu/~p540/webcourse/gagne.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview ===

==== Taxonomy ====
Robert Gagné classified the types of learning outcomes by asking how learning might be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Gagné, R. M. (1985). The conditions of learning (4th ed.). New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; His domains and outcomes of learning correspond to standard verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Gagné, R. M., &amp; Driscoll, M. P. (1988). Essentials of learning for instruction. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive Domain
:Verbal information - is stated: state, recite, tell, declare
:Intellectual skills - label or classify the concepts
:Intellectual skills - apply the rules and principles
:Intellectual skills - problem solve by generating solutions or procedures
::Discrimination: discriminate, distinguish, differentiate
::Concrete Concept: identify, name, specify, label
::Defined Concept: classify, categorize, type, sort (by definition)
::Rule: demonstrate, show, solve (using one rule)
::Higher order rule: generate, develop, solve (using two or more rules)
:Cognitive strategies - are used for learning: adopt, create, originate
* Affective Domain
:Attitudes - are demonstrated by preferring options: choose, prefer, elect, favor
* Psychomotor Domain
:Motor skills - enable physical performance: execute, perform, carry out

==== Nine events ====
According to Gagné, learning occurs in a series of nine learning events, each of which is a condition for learning which must be accomplished before moving to the next in order. Similarly, instructional events should mirror the learning events:

# Gaining attention: To ensure reception of coming instruction, the teacher gives the learners a stimulus. Before the learners can start to process any new information, the instructor must gain the attention of the learners. This might entail using abrupt changes in the instruction.
# Informing learners of objectives: The teacher tells the learner what they will be able to do because of the instruction. The teacher communicates the desired outcome to the group.
# Stimulating recall of prior learning: The teacher asks for recall of existing relevant knowledge.
# Presenting the stimulus: The teacher gives emphasis to distinctive features.
# Providing learning guidance: The teacher helps the students in understanding (semantic encoding) by providing organization and relevance.
# Eliciting performance: The teacher asks the learners to respond, demonstrating learning.
# Providing feedback: The teacher gives informative feedback on the learners' performance.
# Assessing performance: The teacher requires more learner performance, and gives feedback, to reinforce learning.
# Enhancing retention and transfer: The teacher provides varied practice to generalize the capability.

Some educators believe that Gagné's taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over-prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, D. (1996). Gagné. [On-Line]. Available: {{cite web |url=http://education.indiana.edu/~educp540/haines1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109131428/http://education.indiana.edu/~educp540/haines1.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, using them as part of a complete instructional package can assist many educators in becoming more organized and staying focused on the instructional goals.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, L. J. (2001). Robert Gagné and the Conditions of Learning. Walden University.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence ====
Robert Gagné’s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the 1960s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military.   Among the first to coin the term “instructional design”, Gagné developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas.  These models have laid the groundwork for more present-day instructional design models from theorists like Dick, Carey, and Carey (The Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model),&lt;ref&gt;Dick, W., &amp; Carey, L. (1996). The systematic design of instruction. 4th ed.

The figure below illustrates these five ideas.&lt;ref name="instructional.com"/&gt;

Gagné's main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction.  He emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning.  His initial ideas, along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in ''Psychological Principles in Systematic Development'', written by Roberts B. Miller and edited by Gagné.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological Principles in System Development-1962.

Prior to Robert Gagné, learning was often thought of as a single, uniform process.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"&gt;Wiburg, K. M. (2003). [Web log message]. Retrieved from http://www.internettime.com/itimegroup/Is it Time to Exchange Skinner's Teaching Machine for Dewey's.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There was little or no distinction made between “learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem”.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;   Gagné  offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  Understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;
Gagné 's understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  For example, Gagné  argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short-term and long-term memory to facilitate meaningful learning.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt; This idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top-down instructional approach.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;

Gagné (1966) defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act, provided the capabilities described by specified prior units (in the sequence) have already been mastered by the learner.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"&gt;Richey, R. C. (2000). The legacy of Robert M.Gagné . Syracuse, NY: ERIC Clearinghouse on Information &amp; Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gagné  had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching, training and learning.  Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  His ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to influence education and training.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;

Gagné's work has had a significant influence on American education, and military and industrial training.&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;Gagné, R.M. (n.d.). Biographies. Retrieved April 18, 2012, from Answers.com Web site: {{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-mills-gagn |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122052956/http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-mills-gagn |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gagné was one of the early developers of the concept of instructional systems design which suggests the components of a lesson can be analyzed and should be designed to operate together as an integrated plan for instruction.&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt; In "Educational Technology and the Learning Process" (Educational Researcher, 1974), Gagné defined instruction as "the set of planned external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning".&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt;

==Learning design==
The concept of learning design arrived in the literature of technology for education in the late 1990s and early 2000s&lt;ref&gt;Conole G., and Fill K., "A learning design toolkit to create pedagogically effective learning activities". Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2005 (08).&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that "designers and instructors need to choose for themselves the best mixture of behaviourist and constructivist learning experiences for their online courses".&lt;ref&gt;Carr-Chellman A. and Duchastel P., "The ideal online course," British Journal of Educational Technology, 31(3), 229–241, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the concept of learning design is probably as old as the concept of teaching. Learning design might be defined as "the description of the teaching-learning process that takes place in a unit of learning (e.g., a course, a lesson or any other designed learning event)".&lt;ref&gt;Koper R., "Current Research in Learning Design," Educational Technology &amp; Society, 9 (1), 13–22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===ADDIE process===
Perhaps the most common model used for creating instructional materials is the [[ADDIE Model]]. This acronym stands for the 5 phases contained in the model (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate).

'''Brief History of ADDIE’s Development''' – The ADDIE model was initially developed by Florida State University to explain “the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development (ISD) program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity.”&lt;ref name="ADDIE"&gt;Branson, R. K., Rayner, G. T., Cox, J. L., Furman, J. P., King, F. J., Hannum, W. H. (1975). Interservice procedures for instructional systems development. (5 vols.) (TRADOC Pam 350-30 NAVEDTRA 106A). Ft. Monroe, VA: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, August 1975. (NTIS No. ADA 019 486 through ADA 019 490).&lt;/ref&gt;  The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and [Evaluation and] Control),&lt;ref name="ADDIE" /&gt; whose completion was expected before movement to the next phase could occur.  Over the years, the steps were revised and eventually the model itself became more dynamic and interactive than its original hierarchical rendition, until its most popular version appeared in the mid-80s, as we understand it today.

The five phases are listed and explained below:&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues"&gt;Reiser, R. A., &amp; Dempsey, J. V. (2012). Trends and issues in instructional design and technology. Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]

'''Analyze''' – The first phase of content development is Analysis. Analysis refers to the gathering of information about one’s audience, the tasks to be completed, how the learners will view the content, and the project’s overall goals.  The instructional designer then classifies the information to make the content more applicable and successful.

'''Design''' – The second phase is the Design phase. In this phase, instructional designers begin to create their project. Information gathered from the analysis phase, in conjunction with the theories and models of instructional design, is meant to explain how the learning will be acquired. For example, the design phase begins with writing a learning objective. Tasks are then identified and broken down to be more manageable for the designer. The final step determines the kind of activities required for the audience in order to meet the goals identified in the Analyze phase.

'''Develop''' – The third phase, Development, involves the creation of the activities that will be implemented. It is in this stage that the blueprints of the design phase are assembled.

'''Implement''' – After the content is developed, it is then Implemented. This stage allows the instructional designer to test all materials to determine if they are functional and appropriate for the intended audience.

'''Evaluate''' – The final phase, Evaluate, ensures the materials achieved the desired goals. The evaluation phase consists of two parts: formative and summative assessment. The ADDIE model is an iterative process of instructional design, which means that at each stage the designer can assess the project's elements and revise them if necessary.  This process incorporates [[formative assessment]], while the [[summative assessment]]s contain tests or evaluations created for the content being implemented. This final phase is vital for the instructional design team because it provides data used to alter and enhance the design.

Connecting all phases of the model are external and reciprocal revision opportunities.  As in the internal Evaluation phase, revisions should and can be made throughout the entire process.

Most of the current instructional design models are variations of the ADDIE model.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"&gt;Piskurich, G.M. (2006). Rapid Instructional Design: Learning ID fast and right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid prototyping===
An adaptation of the ADDIE model, which is used sometimes, is a practice known as [[rapid prototyping]].

Proponents suggest that through an iterative process the verification of the design documents saves time and money by catching problems while they are still easy to fix. This approach is not novel to the design of instruction, but appears in many design-related domains including software design, architecture, transportation planning, product development, message design, user experience design, etc.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saettler 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saettler, P. |year=1990 |title=The evolution of American educational technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolovitch Keeps 1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stolovitch, H.D., &amp; Keeps, E. |title= Handbook of human performance technology |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some proponents of design prototyping assert that a sophisticated understanding of a problem is incomplete without creating and evaluating some type of prototype, regardless of the analysis rigor that may have been applied up front.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, T., &amp; Littman, J. (2005). The ten faces of innovation: IDEO's strategies for beating the devil's advocate &amp; driving creativity throughout your organization. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, up-front analysis is rarely sufficient to allow one to confidently select an instructional model. For this reason many traditional methods of instructional design are beginning to be seen as incomplete, naive, and even counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Hokanson, B., &amp; Miller, C. (2009). Role-based design: A contemporary framework for innovation and creativity in instructional design. Educational Technology, 49(2), 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some consider rapid prototyping to be a somewhat simplistic type of model. As this argument goes, at the heart of Instructional Design is the analysis phase. After you thoroughly conduct the analysis—you can then choose a model based on your findings. That is the area where most people get snagged—they simply do not do a thorough-enough analysis.

===Dick and Carey===
Another well-known instructional design model is the Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Dick, Walter, Lou Carey, and James O. Carey |year=2005 |title=The Systematic Design of Instruction |edition=6th |origyear=1978 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sYQCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+systematic+design+of+instruction |pages=1–12 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |isbn=0-205-41274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1978 by Walter Dick and Lou Carey in their book entitled ''The Systematic Design of Instruction''.

[[File:Dick Carey.png|thumb|1000px|none|Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model]]

Dick and Carey made a significant contribution to the instructional design field by championing a systems view of instruction, in contrast to defining instruction as the sum of isolated parts. The model addresses instruction as an entire system, focusing on the interrelationship between context, content, learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Forest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick and Carey Instructional Model|url=http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|author=Ed Forest|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124215130/http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|archivedate=2015-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dick and Carey, "Components such as the instructor, learners, materials, instructional activities, delivery system, and learning and performance environments interact with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes".&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt; The components of the Systems Approach Model, also known as the Dick and Carey Model, are as follows:
* Identify Instructional Goal(s): A goal statement describes a skill, knowledge or attitude (SKA) that a learner will be expected to acquire
* Conduct Instructional Analysis: Identify what a learner must recall and identify what learner must be able to do to perform particular task
* Analyze Learners and Contexts: Identify general characteristics of the target audience, including prior skills, prior experience, and basic demographics; identify characteristics directly related to the skill to be taught; and perform analysis of the performance and learning settings.
* Write Performance Objectives: Objectives consists of a description of the behavior, the condition and criteria. The component of an objective that describes the criteria will be used to judge the learner's performance.
* Develop Assessment Instruments: Purpose of entry behavior testing, purpose of pretesting, purpose of post-testing, purpose of practive items/practive problems
* Develop Instructional Strategy: Pre-instructional activities, content presentation, Learner participation, assessment
* Develop and Select Instructional Materials
* Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation of Instruction: Designers try to identify areas of the instructional materials that need improvement.
* Revise Instruction: To identify poor test items and to identify poor instruction
* Design and Conduct Summative Evaluation

With this model, components are executed iteratively and in parallel, rather than linearly.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt;

===Guaranteed Learning===
The instructional design model, Guaranteed Learning, was formerly known as the Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS).&lt;ref name="Esseff &amp; Esseff 1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Esseff, Peter J. |author2=Esseff, Mary Sullivan |year=1998 |title=Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS) |edition=8th |origyear=1970 |url=http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |pages=1–12 |publisher=ESF Press |isbn=1-58283-037-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1970 by Peter J. Esseff, PhD and Mary Sullivan Esseff, PhD in their book entitled ''IDLS—Pro Trainer 1: How to Design, Develop, and Validate Instructional Materials''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html ESF, Inc. – Train-the-Trainer – ESF ProTrainer Materials – 813.814.1192] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |date=2008-11-19 }}. ESF-ProTrainer.com (2007-11-06). Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter (1968) &amp; Mary (1972) Esseff both received their doctorates in Educational Technology from the Catholic University of America under the mentorship of Dr. Gabriel Ofiesh, a founding father of the Military Model mentioned above. Esseff and Esseff synthesized existing theories to develop their approach to systematic design, "Guaranteed Learning" aka "Instructional Development Learning System" (IDLS). In 2015, Peter and Mary Esseff created an eLearning course to enable participants to take the GL course online under the direction of Dr. Esseff.

The components of the Guaranteed Learning Model are the following:
* Design a task analysis
* Develop criterion tests and performance measures
* Develop interactive instructional materials
* Validate the interactive instructional materials
* Create simulations or performance activities (Case Studies, Role Plays, and Demonstrations)

==Motivational design==
Motivation is defined as an internal drive that activates behavior and gives it direction.  The term motivation theory is concerned with the process that describe why and how human behavior is activated and directed.

===Motivation concepts===
''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation''
* Instrinsic: defined as the doing of an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some separable consequence.  When intrinsically motivated a person is moved to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than because of external rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations|url=http://www.idealibrary.com|work=Contemporary Educational Psychology|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=R. Ryan|author2=E. Deci|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109104815/http://www.idealibrary.com/|archivedate=January 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic motivation reflects the desire to do something because it is enjoyable.  If we are intrinsically motivated, we would not be worried about external rewards such as praise.
:''Examples:'' Writing short stories because you enjoy writing them, reading a book because you are curious about the topic, and playing chess because you enjoy effortful thinking
* Extrinsic: reflects the desire to do something because of external rewards such as awards, money and praise.  People who are extrinsically motivated may not enjoy certain activities.  They may only wish to engage in certain activities because they wish to receive some external reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic Motivation and Extrinsic Motivation with Examples of Each Types of Motivation|url=http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|publisher=Blue Fox Communications|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=Brad Bell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414050628/http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|archivedate=April 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Examples:'' The writer who only writes poems to be submitted to poetry contests, a person who dislikes sales but accepts a sales position because he/she desires to earn an above average salary, and a person selecting a major in college based on salary and prestige, rather than personal interest.

has devoted his career to researching and understanding motivation in instructional systems.  These decades of work constitute a major contribution to the instructional design field. First, by applying motivation theories systematically to design theory.  Second, in developing a unique problem-solving process he calls the ARCS Motivation....

=== ARCS MODEL ===
The ARCS Model of Motivational Design was created by John Keller while he was researching ways to supplement the learning process with motivation.  The model is based on Tolman's and Lewin's expectancy-value theory, which presumes that people are motivated to learn if there is value in the knowledge presented (i.e. it fulfills personal needs) and if there is an optimistic expectation for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ely|first=Donald|title=Development and Use of the ARCS Model of Motivational Design|year=1983|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model consists of four main areas: Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction.

Attention and relevance according to John Keller's ARCS motivational theory are essential to learning.  The first 2 of 4 key components for motivating learners, attention, and relevance can be considered the backbone of the ARCS theory, the latter components relying upon the former.

==== Components ====

=====Attention=====

The attention mentioned in this theory refers to the interest displayed by learners in taking in the concepts/ideas being taught.  This component is split into three categories: perceptual arousal, using surprise or uncertain situations; inquiry arousal, offering challenging questions and/or problems to answer/solve; and variability, using a variety of resources and methods of teaching.  Within each of these categories, John Keller has provided further sub-divisions of types of stimuli to grab attention. Grabbing attention is the most important part of the model because it initiates the motivation for the learners.  Once learners are interested in a topic, they are willing to invest their time, pay attention, and find out more.

=====Relevance=====

Relevance, according to Keller, must be established by using language and examples that the learners are familiar with.  The three major strategies Keller presents are goal-oriented, motive matching, and familiarity.  Like the Attention category, Keller divided the three major strategies into subcategories, which provide examples of how to make a lesson plan relevant to the learner. Learners will throw concepts to the wayside if their attention cannot be grabbed and sustained and if relevance is not conveyed.

=====Confidence=====

The confidence aspect of the ARCS model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners. The confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation and the amount of effort put forth in reaching a performance objective. For this reason, it's important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success. This can be achieved in the form of a syllabus and grading policy, rubrics, or a time estimate to complete tasks. Additionally, confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely, relevant feedback.

=====Satisfaction=====

Finally, learners must obtain some type of satisfaction or reward from a learning experience. This satisfaction can be from a sense of achievement, praise from a higher-up, or mere entertainment. Feedback and reinforcement are important elements and when learners appreciate the results, they will be motivated to learn. Satisfaction is based upon motivation, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic. To keep learners satisfied, instruction should be designed to allow them to use their newly learned skills as soon as possible in as authentic a setting as possible.

==== Motivational Design Process ====
Along with the motivational components (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) the ARCS model provides a process that can address motivational problems. This process has 4 phases (Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation) with 10 steps within the phases:

'''Step 1: Obtain course information'''

Includes reviewing the description of the course, the instructor, and way of delivery the information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 2: Obtain audience information'''

Includes collecting the current skill level, attitudes towards the course, attitudes towards the teacher, attitudes towards the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 3: Analyze audience'''

This should help identify the motivational problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 4: Analyze existing materials'''

Identifying positives of the current instructional material, as well as any problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 5:  List objectives and assessments'''

This allows the creation of assessment tools that align with the objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 6: List potential tactics'''

Brainstorming possible tactics that could fill in the motivational gaps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 7: Select and design tactics'''

Integrates, enhances, and sustains tactics from the list that fit the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 8: Integrate with instruction'''

Integrate the tactic that was chosen from the list into the instruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 9: Select and develop materials'''

Select materials, modify to fit the situation and develop new materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 10: Evaluate and revise'''

Obtain reactions from the learner and determine satisfaction level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Motivating opportunities===
Although Keller's ARCS model currently dominates instructional design with respect to learner motivation, in 2006 Hardré and Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|author2=Miller, Raymond B.|title=Toward a current, comprehensive, integrative, and flexible model of motivation for instructional design|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a need for a new design model that includes current research in human motivation, a comprehensive treatment of motivation, integrates various fields of psychology and provides designers the flexibility to be applied to a myriad of situations.

Hardré&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|title=The motivating opportunities model for Performance SUCCESS: Design, Development, and Instructional Implications|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2009|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1002/piq.20043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposes an alternate model for designers called the Motivating Opportunities Model or MOM. Hardré's model incorporates cognitive, needs, and affective theories as well as social elements of learning to address learner motivation. MOM has seven key components spelling the acronym 'SUCCESS' – Situational, Utilization, Competence, Content, Emotional, Social, and Systemic.&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"/&gt;

Instructors can also be referred to as a [[facilitator]], who may be knowledgeable and experienced in the learning material, but can also be used more for their facilitation skills and ability to deliver material to learners.

Instructors may deliver training in a [[lecture]] or [[classroom]] format, as an interactive workshop, as a demonstration with the opportunity for learners to practice, or even virtually, using [[video-conferencing]] tools; and the instructor may have facilitation and teaching skills, in which they can use different methods to engage learners and embrace different [[learning styles]].

Other learning delivery methods include [[e-learning]] which delivers [[self-paced instruction|self-paced courses]] online, and [[blended learning]] which mixes instructor-led and e-learning elements.

Instructor-led training represents overall 66% of corporate [[training and development]]; it reaches 76% in high-performing companies and 80% in high-consequence industries ([[healthcare industry]], [[pharmaceutical industry]], finance, utilities, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://membership.brandonhall.com/posts/1205763-bringing-the-classroom-into-the-21st-century |title=Bringing the Classroom into the 21st Century |publisher=Brandon Hall Group (2015) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most widely-used method for [[extended enterprise]] training, which trains customers and partners, with an 80% usage rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://go.brandonhall.com/l/8262/2017-04-03/6swyb6 |title= Extended Enterprise Learning: Generating Revenue and Adding Value|publisher=Brandon Hall Group (2017) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one in three companies who use e-learning currently deliver more than three-quarters of their training and development activities completely through face-to-face experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/learning-development_2015_tcm18-11298.pdf |title= Annual Survey Report Learning and Development |publisher=CIPD (2015) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason why [[human resources]] departments prefer instructor-led training is its high effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention: in a survey rating every training and development delivery format, in-person instructor-led classrooms are in third position, with 3.63 out of 5, whereas e-learning modules are in seventh position, with a grade of 3.05 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ddiworld.com/DDI/media/trend-research/state-of-leadership-development_tr_brandon-hall.pdf?ext=.pdf |title= State of Leadership Development 2015 Time to Act is Now |publisher=Brandon Hall Group (2015) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ILT is an effective means of delivering information, as it allows for real-time feedback, questions and answers, manipulation and changeable delivery to suit the needs of learners in a real-time environment, and a learning environment can be created by the instructor's style.

== Managing instructor-led training ==

Although instructor-led training dominates the market in terms of use because of its effectiveness, it tends to be a costlier learning delivery method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clomedia.com/2015/06/17/finding-the-right-learning-mix/ |title=Finding the right learning mix |publisher=CLO media }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiring an instructor, renting or maintaining facilities, providing hands-on tools, travel, food, and boarding can push companies on a tight budget. Additionally, classroom occupancy rates and resource use are not always maximized.

This is why streamlining logistics, scheduling and administration, managing resources, and optimizing the budget are key in managing instructor-led training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://trainingmag.com/why-lmss-are-not-built-manage-instructor-led-training%E2%80%94and-what-do-about-it |title=Why LMS's are not built to manage ILT and what to do about it |publisher=Training Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Organizations such as corporate training departments, [[corporate university]] as well as [[training companies]] generally manage this through a core [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) such as a [[training management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/april_2017_training_development/instructor-led-training-and-elearning-part-ii-whic_j15w9l2o.html |title=Instructor-Led Training and e-Learning: which technology for which learning delivery? |publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training management system optimizes ILT management by streamlining every aspect of the training process: planning (training plan and budget forecasting), logistics (scheduling and [[resource managemen]]t), financials (cost tracking, profitability), reporting, and sales for for-profit training providers. For example, a training management system can be used to schedule instructors, venues and equipment through graphical agendas, optimize resource use, create a training plan and track remaining budgets, generate reports and share data between different teams.

While training management systems focus on managing instructor-led training, they can complete an LMS. In this situation, an LMS will manage e-learning delivery and assessment, while a training management system will manage ILT and back-office budget planning, logistic and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://trainingmag.com/why-lmss-are-not-built-manage-instructor-led-training%E2%80%94and-what-do-about-it |title=Why LMS's are not built to manage ILT and what to do about it |publisher=Training Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent trends ==
{{see also|Distance education}}
Recently, there have been many trends in modernizing and optimizing instructor-led training through [[educational technology]].

Instructor-led training can be delivered within a classroom or remotely through a [[virtual classroom]], in which case it is called '''virtual instructor-led training'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.trainingindustry.com/wiki/entries/virtual-instructor-led-training-(vilt).aspx |title=Virtual Instructor-Led Training |publisher=Training Industry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructor and learners are in different locations, and a classroom environment is replicated through online tools. This type of training can be delivered synchronously or asynchronously.

Instructor-led training can also be combined with e-learning in a [[blended learning]] scenario to achieve a maximum effectiveness. In this case, some of the training is delivered live while online courses serve as refreshers between sessions. A growing type of blended learning is called the [[flipped classroom]] model, where students acquire information by watching lectures online and then engage in [[problem-solving]], discussion and group activities in class.

Training within the classroom can be also enhanced through a range of technology and collaborative tools such as [[video software]] and system to access content during the class. These tools will help the instructor monitor learners level of understanding and adapt the training pace as the session unfolds. Additionally, gamification elements can be added to the training session to elicit greater attention and engagement from learners during the session &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gameffective.com/supercharge-instructor-led-training-with-next-gen-learning-engagement |title=Supercharge Instructor Led Training with Next-Gen Learning Engagement |publisher=GamEffective.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lastly, instructor-led training [[back office]] management can be optimized through dedicated software which streamline all processes (scheduling, logistics, costs and budget management, administration, reporting, etc.) such as a training management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/march_2017_training_development/technology-enabled-learning-more-than-elearning---_izscecpc.html?s=0qNLEKGGLV4urxAv6vt |title=Technology-enabled learning, more than e-learning - Part 1: What does technology-enabled Instructor-led training look like? |publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows training organizations to improve the efficiency of their ILT and optimize their training budget.

'''Integrated Water Flow Model''' ([https://www.water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Modeling-Platforms/Integrated-Water-Flow-Model IWFM])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dogrul|first1=E.C.|title=Integrated Water Flow Model Theoretical Documentation.|url=http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/IWFM/IWFM-2015/v2015_0_260/downloadables/IWFM-2015.0.260_TheoreticalDocumentation.pdf|publisher=California Department of Water Resources|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a computer program for simulating water flow through the integrated land surface, surface water and groundwater flow systems. It is a rewrite of the abandoned software IGSM, which was found to have several programing errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dogrul|first1=E.C.|title=Integrated Water Flow Model Theoretical Documentation.|url=http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/IWFM/IWFM-2015/v2015_0_260/downloadables/IWFM-2015.0.260_TheoreticalDocumentation.pdf|publisher=California Department of Water Resources|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWFM programs and source code are freely available. IWFM is written in [[Fortran]], and can be compiled and run on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] operating systems. The [http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/IWFM/IWFM-2015/v2015_0_260/downloadables/IWFM-2015.0.260_SourceCode.zip IWFM source code] is released under the [[GNU General Public License]].

Groundwater flow is simulated using the [[finite element]] method. Surface water flow can be simulated as a simple one-dimensional flow-through network or with the [[kinematic wave]] method. IWFM input data sets incorporate a time stamp, allowing users to run a model for a specified time period without editing the input files.

One of the most useful features of IWFM is the internal calculation of water demands for each land use type. IWFM simulates four land use classes: agricultural, urban, native vegetation, and riparian vegetation. Land use areas are delineated as a time series, with corresponding evapotranspiration rates and water management parameters. Each time step, the land use process applies precipitation, calculates infiltration and runoff, calculates water demands, and determines what portion of the demands are not met by soil moisture. For agricultural and urban land use classes, IWFM then applies surface water and groundwater at specified rates, and optionally adjusts surface water and groundwater to exactly meet water demands. This automatic adjustment feature is especially useful for calculating unmeasured flow components (such as groundwater withdrawals) or for simulating proposed future scenarios such as studying the impacts of potential climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=N. L., L. L. Dale, C. F. Brush, S. D. Vicuna, T. N. Kadir, E. C. Dogrul, and F. I. Chung|title=Drought resilience of the California Central Valley surface-ground-water-conveyance system.|journal=Journal of the American Water Resources Association|date=2009|volume=45|pages=857–866|doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00329.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00329.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In IWFM, the land surface, surface water and groundwater flow domains are simulated as separate processes, compiled into individual dynamic link libraries. The processes are linked by water flow terms, maintain conservation of mass and momentum between processes, and are solved simultaneously. This allows each IWFM process to be run independently as a stand-alone model, or to be linked to other programs. This functionality has been used to create a [[Microsoft Excel]] Add-in to create workbooks from IWFM output files. The IWFM land surface process has been compiled into a stand-alone program called the IWFM Demand Calculator [https://www.water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Modeling-Platforms/Integrated-Water-Flow-Model-Demand-Calculator IDC]. The groundwater process is linked to the [https://www.water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Modeling-Platforms/Water-Resource-Integrated-Modeling-System WRIMS] modeling system and used in the water resources optimization model [https://www.water.ca.gov/Library/Modeling-and-Analysis/Central-Valley-models-and-tools/CalSim-3 CalSim]. This feature allows other models to be easily linked with IWFM, to either enhance the capabilities of the target model (for example, by adding groundwater flow to a land surface-surface water model) or to enhance the capabilities of IWFM (for example, linking an economic model to IWFM to dynamically change the crop mix based on the depth to groundwater, as the cost of pumping increases with depth to water).

Notable models developed with IWFM include the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brush|first1=C.F., Dogrul, E.C., Kadir, T.N.|title=Development and Calibration of the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSim)], Version 3.02-CG.|url=http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/C2VSim/download/C2VSim_Model_Report_Final.pdf|publisher=California Department of Water Resources|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a model of the Walla-Walla Basin in Washington and Oregon, USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petrides|first1=A.|title=Managed Aquifer Recharge and Hydrological Studies in the Walla Walla Basin to Improve River and Aquifer Conditions.|publisher=Doctoral Thesis, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherberg|first1=J., T.

A '''key''' is a specific part of a [[musical instrument]]. The purpose and function of the part in question depends on the instrument.

On instruments equipped with tuning machines, [[violin]]s and [[guitar]]s, for example, a key is part of a [[tuning machine]]. It is a worm gear with a key shaped end used to turn a cog, which, in turn, is attached to a post which winds the string. The key is used to make pitch adjustments to a string.

With other instruments, [[zither]]s and [[drum]]s, for example, a key is essentially a small wrench used to turn a tuning machine or lug.

On [[woodwind]] instruments such as a [[flute]] or [[saxophone]], keys are finger operated levers used to open or close [[tone hole]]s, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a [[pipe organ]] also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an [[accordion]] direct the air flow from a manually operated [[bellows]] across various tuned vibrating reeds.

On other [[keyboard instrument]]s, a key may be a lever which mechanically triggers a hammer to strike a group of strings, as on a [[piano]], or an [[electric switch]] which energizes an [[audio oscillator]] as on an [[electronic organ]] or a [[synthesizer]].

'''Lanedo''' is a professional [[open source software development]] consultancy based in Germany.  It operates as a European [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|company with limited liability]] based in [[Hamburg]]. The company has been involved with a number of mobile and [[Embedded system|embedded platforms]] over the years including [[Maemo]] and [[MeeGo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanedo.com/meego.html |title=Lanedo Involvement - MeeGo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[software development]] has a focus around [[Linux]] in general and targeting platforms ranging from mobile and embedded to [[desktop environment]]s.

The name 'Lanedo' is based on a roughly phonetic sounding of the letters L, N, and D.  These are mentioned as Linux, Networking, and Development respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanedo.com/about.html |title=Lanedo - About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 2003, Mikael Hallendal and Richard Hult were working together on a project management application called Planner. They founded Imendio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/8411/Interview_with_Mikael_Hallendal_Founder_of_Imendio |title=Interview with Mikael Hallendal Founder of Imendio about company inception and purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imendio.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cns|After 5 years, the founders stepped back,{{clarify|date=July 2015}} and the business and people continued in a new company called Lanedo founded by Tim Janik and Martyn Russell in early 2009. Mikael and Richard started a new company called TinyBird Interactive AB to work together and focus on OS X application development. As of February 2009 Imendio AB got split into Tinybird Interactive AB and Landeo GmbH.|date=July 2015}}

In 2011, Lanedo joined [[the Document Foundation]] TSC (Task Steering Committee)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Document-Foundation-appoints-Engineering-Steering-Committee-1248364.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208141122/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Document-Foundation-appoints-Engineering-Steering-Committee-1248364.html | archivedate=8 December 2013 | title=Document Foundation appoints Engineering Steering Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became much more involved in the future of LibreOffice.

Starting in summer 2012, Lanedo, in cooperation with ITOMIG, supported the town of Munich in the LibreOffice maintenance of the [[LiMux]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.it-director.de/nc/home/newsdetails/article/nehmen-und-geben.html |title=Nehmen und Geben (German article)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lanedo is also actively participating{{when|date=July 2015}} in implementing the [[OOXML]] support for LibreOffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h-online.com/-1644571 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207215155/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Improved-OOXML-support-for-LibreOffice-and-OpenOffice-1644571.html|archivedate=7 December 2013|title=Improved OOXML support for LibreOffice and OpenOffice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magister Musicae''' is an internet portal which hosts a digital catalogue of more than 3,000 hours of music classes, given by more than 200 of the world’s most renowned musicians.

==Project==
The project is promoted by the president of the [[Albéniz Foundation]], [[Paloma O'Shea]]. The aim is to preserve the classes that take place each day at the [[Queen Sofía College of Music]] and make them accessible to a wider audience.

In the year 2000, the Spanish Ministry for Science and Technology supported the project with a considerable donation under the aegis of the PROFIT programme. The resulting three years of research and development, which focused on the digitization, cataloguing, compression and high-quality broadcasting of the videos on the internet, gave rise to HTCMedia, a tool which manages large quantities of video information. This has been the cornerstone of the creation of Magister Musicae.

The master classes are recorded in the music schools. These lessons are scrupulously analyzed by music specialists, catalogued by work and by movement, then broken down into teaching units of no more than six minutes’ duration. This system of classification allows the visitor to the site to go directly to the section of the class that is of interest, and to be able to link with a number of classes given by various teachers.

==Participating Organizations==
The scale and ambition of the project led, in 2004, to six of the principal conservatoires and music schools joining Magister Musicae, through the European Harmos project. It offered access to their teachers and enhanced Magister Musicae’s international profile. 

*The [[Royal College of Music]] in London
*The Koninklijk Conservatorium in Brussels
*The Staatliche Musikhochschule in Stuttgart 
*The Escuela Superior de Música do Porto in Oporto 
*The Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya in Barcelona 
*The Lithuanian Academy of Music in Vilnius 
*The European Association of Conservatoires. 

The project received the financial backing of the European Commission, who called it “the model project which impacts on the policies of the Union”.

==Participants==
The following are amongst the more notable participants in the project:

*[[András Schiff]] 
*[[Zakhar Bron]] 
*[[Teresa Berganza]] 
*[[Bruno Canino]] 
*[[Silvia Marcovici]] 
*[[Tom Krause]] 
*[[Natalia Gutman]]

== Cost ==
Only the first 5 minutes are free. Videos are accessible by paying per time periods, not per videos.

== Criticism ==
Videos can only be seen using the [[Microsoft Internet Explorer]] browser. Media is stored in [[Windows Media Audio|Microsoft Windows Media]].

'''Meat and bone meal''' ('''MBM''') is a product of the [[Rendering (animal products)|rendering]] industry.  It is typically about 48–52% [[protein]], 33–35% [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]], 8–12% [[fat]], and 4–7% [[moisture]].  It is primarily used in the formulation of [[fodder|animal feed]] to improve the [[amino acid]] profile of the feed.  Feeding of MBM to cattle is thought to have been responsible for the spread of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] (mad cow disease).  In most parts of the world, MBM is no longer allowed in feed for [[ruminant]] animals. However, it is still used to feed [[monogastric]] animals.

MBM is widely used in the United States as a low-cost meat in [[dog food]] and [[cat food]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pedigree.com/really-good-food/product-page.aspx?id=1058&amp;prevPage=adult&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Europe]], some MBM is used as ingredients in petfood but the vast majority is now used as a fossil-fuel replacement for renewable energy generation, as a fuel in cement kilns, [[landfill]]ing or [[incineration]]. Meat and bone meal has around two thirds the energy value of fossil fuels such as coal; the UK in particular widely uses meat and bone meal for the generation of renewable electricity.{{fact|date=November 2012}} This was particularly prominent after many cattle were slaughtered during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] crisis. Meat and bone meal is increasingly used in cement kilns as an environmentally sustainable replacement for coal.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

== Types ==
Meat meal: Powder obtained by cooking, defatting, sterilizing, grinding, and sifting by-products of terrestrial animals. This denomination includes both meat and bone meal (MBM) and meat meal in the strict sense, less rich in minerals than MBM; it is often referred to as "processed animal protein"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;SIFCO (Syndicat des Industries Françaises des Coproduits animaux ; Syndicat interprofessionnel regroupant les transformateurs de coproduits animaux en protéines et graisses animales), ''Lexique &lt;small&gt;[archive]&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bone meal: It is produced with bones (of terrestrial animals) of second quality. The other bones can be used beforehand for the manufacture of [[gelatin]] and / or treated to produce [[dicalcium phosphate]] or [[ossein]] powder; the meal is produced by heating, defatting, drying, grinding and sieving the bones of terrestrial animals&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les farines de viandes osseuses (FVO) et les concentrés protéiques carnés (CPC) &lt;small&gt;[archive]&lt;/small&gt;, École nationale vétérinaire de Lyon&lt;/ref&gt;.

Meal from [[Skin appendage|skin appendages]]: [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[Hoof|hooves]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] (around 55,700 tons per year in France&lt;ref&gt;Sénat, Projet de loi relatif à la collecte et à l'élimination des cadavres d'animaux et des déchets d'abattoirs et modifiant le code rural &lt;small&gt;[archive]&lt;/small&gt; ; Travaux parlementaires &gt; Rapports &gt; Rapports législatifs, consulté 2013-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;) are used for example in agricultural or garden fertilizers for their sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus contents, or used in the composition of meat meal.

[[Blood meal]]: fresh and whole blood collected from slaughterhouses, coagulated and steam dried now often referred to as "animal protein transformed from blood".

Feather meal: (Fresh feathers from slaughterhouses, treated by thermal [[hydrolysis]] (chemical decomposition in the presence of pressurized water), dried and crushed.

[[Fish meal|Fishmeal]] 

== Categories ==
In Europe (before the 2002 EU Regulation), animal by-products were classified into two categories: "high risk" or "low risk" products.

Since 2002, "processed animal protein" (PAP) and other animal by-products; authorized or not for various uses are categorized into three categories (by the European Regulation 2002) according to their supposed or demonstrated level of [[Health risk assessment|health risk]]. 

# Category 1 material: those that pose a risk to [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|TSE]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ("prion-risk" meat), including "SRM" ("specified risk material") and animals suspected or declared to be infected with EST&lt;ref&gt;Encéphalopathies spongiformes transmissibles (parfois dénommées ''Encéphalopathies spongiformes subaiguës Transmissibles ou ESST'') ; famille de maladies neurodégénératives des animaux incluant notamment l'ESB et la tremblante&lt;/ref&gt;). This category also contains products contaminated by certain banned substances ([[Hormone|hormones]]) or dangerous for the environment ([[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]).
# Category 2 materials: associated with a health risk to animal [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]] and diseases other than TSEs. There are also foodstuffs seized for sanitary reasons and corpses of animals who died by other means than by being slaughtered, or products contaminated with residues of veterinary drugs.
# Category 3 material; they come from animals considered healthy and without specific risks, that is to say the carcasses have been declared fit for human consumption after health inspection. Only products in this category are allowed for the production of flours for animal feed (including pets)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16759">'''Membraneless Fuel Cells''' convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy without the use of a conducting membrane as with other types of fuel cells. In Laminar Flow Fuel Cells (LFFC) this is achieved by exploiting the phenomenon of non-mixing laminar flows where the interface between the two flows works as a proton/ion conductor. The interface allows for high diffusivity and eliminates the need for costly membranes. The operating principles of these cells mean that they can only be built to millimeter-scale sizes. The lack of a membrane means they are cheaper but the size limits their use to portable applications which require small amounts of power.

Another type of membraneless fuel cell is a Mixed Reactant Fuel Cell (MRFC). Unlike LFFCs, MRFCs use a mixed fuel and electrolyte, and are thus not subject to the same limitations. Without a membrane, MRFCs depend on the characteristics of the electrodes to separate the oxidation and reduction reactions. By eliminating the membrane and delivering the reactants as a mixture, MRFCs can potentially be simpler and less costly than conventional fuel cell systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MRFC Technology - Mantra Energy Alternatives|url = http://mantraenergy.com/mantra-energy/technology/mrfc-technology/|website = Mantra Energy Alternatives|accessdate = 2015-10-27|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of these cells is generally much higher than modern electricity producing sources.  For example, a [[Fossil fuel power station|fossil fuel power plant]] system can achieve a 40% electrical conversion efficiency while a nuclear power plant is slightly lower at 32%. [[Fuel cell]] systems are capable of reaching efficiencies in the range of 55%–70%.  However, as with any process, fuel cells also experience inherent losses due to their design and manufacturing processes.

== Overview ==
[[Image:PEM fuel cell.svg|350px|thumb|right| Fuel Cell Diagram. Note: Electrolyte can be a polymer or solid oxide]] A fuel cell consists of an electrolyte which is placed in between two electrodes – the cathode and the anode.  In the simplest case, hydrogen gas passes over the cathode, where it is decomposed into hydrogen protons and electrons.  The protons pass through the electrolyte (often NAFION – manufactured by DuPont) across to the anode to the oxygen.  Meanwhile, the free electrons travel around the cell to power a given load and then combine with the oxygen and hydrogen at the anode to form water.  Two common types of electrolytes are a [[Proton exchange membrane|proton exchange membrane(PEM)]] (also known as Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) and a ceramic or solid oxide electrolyte (often used in [[Solid oxide fuel cell]]s). Although hydrogen and oxygen are very common reactants, a plethora of other reactants exist and have been proven effective.

Hydrogen for fuel cells can be produced in many ways.  The most common method in the United States (95% of production) is via [[Fossil fuel reforming|Gas reforming]], specifically using methane,&lt;ref&gt;Ragheb, Magdi. "Steam Reforming." Lecture. Energy Storage Systems. University of Illinois, 3 Oct. 2010. Web. 12 Oct. 2010. &lt;https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20498ES%20Energy%20Storage%20Systems/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which produces hydrogen from fossil fuels by running them through a high temperature steam process.  Since fossil fuels are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen molecules of various sizes, various fossil fuels can be utilized.  For example, [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], and [[methane]] can all be used in the reforming process.  [[Electrolysis]] and high temperature combination cycles are also used to provide hydrogen from water whereby the heat and electricity provide sufficient energy to disassociate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

However, since these methods of [[hydrogen production]] are often energy and space intensive, it is often more convenient to use the chemicals directly in the fuel cell. [[Direct methanol fuel cell|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells]] (DMFC's), for example, use methanol as the reactant instead of first using reformation to produce hydrogen.  Although DMFC's are not very efficient (~25%),&lt;ref&gt;Kin, T., W. Shieh, C. Yang, and G. Yu. "Estimating the Methanol Crossover Rate of PEM and the Efficiency of DMFC via a Current Transient Analysis." Journal of Power Sources 161.2 (2006): 1183–186. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; they are energy dense which means that they are quite suitable for portable power applications.  Another advantage over gaseous fuels, as in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells, is that liquids are much easier to handle, transport, pump and often have higher specific energies allowing for greater power extraction. Generally gases need to be stored in high pressure containers or cryogenic liquid containers which is a significant disadvantage to liquid transport.

== Membraneless Fuel Cells and Operating Principles ==
The majority of fuel cell technologies currently employed are either PEM or SOFC cells. However, the electrolyte is often costly and not always completely effective. Although hydrogen technology has significantly evolved, other fossil fuel based cells (such as DMFC's) are still plagued by the shortcomings of proton exchange membranes. For example, fuel crossover means that low concentrations need to be used which limits the available power of the cell. In solid oxide fuel cells, high temperatures are needed which require energy and can also lead to quicker degradation of materials. Membraneless fuel cells offer a solution to these problems.

=== Laminar Flow ===
[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|150px|thumb|right|A [[vortex street]] around a cylinder. At the beginning of the vortex, both fluids are separate. This indicates laminar flow with minimal mixing. Picture courtesy, Cesareo de La Rosa Siqueira.]] LFFC's overcome the problem of unwanted crossover through the manipulation of the [[Reynolds number]], which describes the behavior of a fluid. In general, at low Reynolds numbers, flow is laminar whereas turbulence occurs at a higher Reynolds number. In laminar flow, two fluids will interact primarily through diffusion which means mixing is limited. By choosing the correct fuel and oxidizing agents in LFFC's, protons can be allowed to diffuse from the anode to the cathode across the interface of the two streams.&lt;ref&gt;1. E.R. Choban, L.J. Markoski, A. Wieckowski, P.J.A. Kenis, Micro-Fluidic Fuel Cell Based on Laminar Flow. J. Power Sources, 2004,128, 54–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The LFFC's are not limited to a liquid feed and in certain cases, depending on the geometry and reactants, gases can also be advantageous.  Current designs inject the fuel and oxidizing agent into two separate streams which flow side by side. The interface between the fluids acts as the electrolytic membrane across which protons diffuse. Membraneless fuel cells offer a cost advantage due to the lack of the electrolytic membrane. Further, a decrease in crossover also increases fuel efficiency resulting in higher power output.

=== Diffusion ===
Diffusion across the interface is extremely important and can severely affect fuel cell performance. The protons need to be able to diffuse across both the fuel and the oxidizing agent. The diffusion coefficient, a term which describes the ease of diffusion of an element in another medium, can be combined with [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] which addresses the effects of a concentration gradient and distance over which diffusion occurs:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;
where

* &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion flux in dimensions of [([[amount of substance]]) length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], example &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\mathrm{mol}}{ m^2\cdot s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt; measures the amount of substance that will flow through a small area during a small time interval.
* &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is the '''diffusion coefficient''' or '''[[mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]''' in dimensions of [length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;], example &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{m^2}{s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\, \phi&lt;/math&gt; (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;], example &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\mathrm{mol}}{m^3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\, x&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion length i.e. the distance over which diffusion occurs

In order to increase the diffusion flux, the diffusivity and/or concentration need to be increased while the length needs to be decreased. In DMFC's for example, the thickness of the membrane determines the diffusion length while the concentration is often limited due to crossover. Thus, the diffusion flux is limited. A membraneless fuel cell is theoretically the better option since the diffusion interface across both fluids is extremely thin and using higher concentrations does not result in a drastic effect on crossover.

In most fuel cell configurations with liquid feeds, the fuel and oxidizing solutions almost always contain water which acts as a diffusion medium. In many hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, the diffusion of oxygen at the cathode is rate limiting since the diffusivity of oxygen in water is much lower than that of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Fukada, Satoshi. "Analysis of Oxygen Reduction Rate in a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell." Energy Conversion and Management 42.9 (2000): 1121. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verhallen, P., L. Oomen, A. Elsen, and A. Kruger. "The Diffusion Coefficients of Helium, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen in Water Determined from the Permeability of a Stagnant Liquid Layer in the Quasi-steady State." Chemical Engineering Science 39.11 (1984): 1535–541. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, LFFC performance can also be improved by not using aqueous oxygen carriers.

=== Research and Development ===
The promise of membraneless fuel cells has been offset by several problems inherent to their designs. Ancillary structures are one of the largest obstacles. For example, pumps are required to maintain laminar flow while gas separators can be needed to supply the correct fuels into the cells. For micro fuel cells, these pumps and separators need to be miniaturized and packaged into a small volume (under 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Associated with this process is a so-called "packaging penalty" which results in higher costs. Further, pumping power drastically increases with decreasing size (see Scaling Laws) which is disadvantageous. Efficient packaging methods and/or self-pumping cells (see Research and Development) need to be developed to make this technology viable. Also, while using high concentrations of specific fuels, such as methanol, crossover still occurs. This problem can be partially solved by using a nanoporous separator, lowering fuel concentration&lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, Adam S., R. J. Maloney, L. J. Markoski, P. J. Kenis, R. S. Jayashree, and D. Natarajan. "Nanoporous Separator and Low Fuel Concentration to Minimize Crossover in Direct Methanol Laminar Flow Fuel Cells." Journal of Power Sources 195.11 (2010): 3523–528. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or choosing reactants which have a lower tendency towards crossover.

Date: January 2010: Researchers developed a novel method of inducing self-pumping in a membraneless fuel cell. Using formic acid as a fuel and sulfuric acid as an oxidant, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is produced in the reaction in the form of bubbles. The bubbles nucleate and coalesce on the anode. A check valve at the supply end prevents any fuel entering while the bubbles are growing. The check valve is not mechanical but [[Superhydrophobe|hydrophobic]] in nature. By creating micro structures which form specific contact angles with water, fuel cannot be drawn backwards. As the reaction continues, more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed while fuel is consumed. The bubble begins to propagate towards the outlet of the cell. However, before the outlet, a hydrophobic vent allows the carbon dioxide to escape while simultaneously ensuring other byproducts (such as water) do not clog the vent. As the carbon dioxide is being vented, fresh fuel is also drawn in at the same through the check valve and the cycle begins again. Thus, the fuel cell pumping is regulated by the reaction rate. This type of cell is not a two stream laminar flow fuel cell. Since the formation of bubbles can disrupt two separate laminar flows, a combined stream of fuel and oxidant was used. In laminar conditions, mixing will still not occur.  It was found that using selective catalysts (i.e. Not platinum) or extremely low flow rates can prevent crossover.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Meng and C.-J.

== Scaling Issues ==

Membraneless fuel cells are currently being manufactured on the micro scale using fabrication processes found in the [[Micro-electro-mechanical systems|MEMS/NEMS]] area. These cell sizes are suited for the small scale due to the limit of their operating principles. The scale-up of these cells to the 2–10 Watt range has proven difficult&lt;ref&gt;Abruna, H., and A. Stroock. "Transport Phenomena and Interfacial Kinetics in Planar Microfluidic Membraneless Fuel Cells." Hydrogen Program. U.S. Department of Energy. Web. 25 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/bes017_abruna_2010_o_web.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; since, at large scales, the cells cannot maintain the correct operating conditions.

For example, laminar flow is a necessary condition for these cells. Without laminar flow, crossover would occur and a physical electrolytic membrane would be needed. Maintaining laminar flow is achievable on the macro scale but maintaining a steady Reynolds number is difficult due to variations in pumping. This variation causes fluctuations at the reactant interfaces which can disrupt laminar flow and affect diffusion and crossover. However, self-pumping mechanisms can be difficult and expensive to produce on the macro-scale. In order to take advantage of hydrophobic effects, the surfaces need to be smooth to control the contact angle of water. To produce these surfaces on a large scale, the cost will significantly increase due to the close tolerances which are needed. Also, it is not evident whether using a carbon-dioxide based pumping system on the large scale is viable.

Membraneless fuel cells can utilize self-pumping mechanisms but requires the use of fuel which release GHG's (greenhouse gases) and other unwanted products. To use an environmentally friendly fuel configuration (such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), self pumping can be difficult. Thus, external pumps are required. However, for a rectangular channel, the pressure required increases proportional to the L&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, where L is a length unit of the cell. Thus, by decreasing the size of a cell from 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 1&amp;nbsp;cm, the required pressure will increase by 1000. For micro fuel cells, this pumping requirement requires high voltages. Although in some cases, [[Electroosmotic flow]] can be induced. However, for liquid mediums, high voltages are also required. Further, with decreasing size, [[surface tension]] effects also become significantly more important. For the fuel cell configuration with a carbon dioxide generating mechanism, the surface tension effects could also increase the pumping requirements drastically.

== Potential Applications of LFFCs ==
The thermodynamic potential of a fuel cell limits the amount of power that an individual cell can deliver. Therefore, in order to obtain more power, fuel cells must be connected in series or parallel (depending on whether greater current or voltage is desired).  For large scale building and automobile power applications, macro fuel cells can be used because space is not necessarily the limiting constraint.  However, for portable devices such as cell phones and laptops, macro fuel cells are often inefficient due to their space requirements lower run times.  LFFCs however, are perfectly suited for these types of applications.  The lack of a physical electrolytic membrane and energy dense fuels that can be used means that LFFC's can be produced at lower costs and smaller sizes. In most portable applications, energy density is more important than efficiency due to the low power requirements.

A '''milking pipeline''' or '''milk pipeline''' is a component of a [[dairy farm]] animal-milking operation which is used to transfer [[milk]] from the animals to a cooling and storage [[bulk tank]].

==Setup==
In small [[dairy farm]]s with less than 100 cows, goats or sheep, the pipeline is installed above the animals' stalls and they are then are milked in sequence by moving down the row of stalls. The [[milking machine]] is a lightweight transportable hose assembly which is plugged into sealed access ports along the pipeline.

In the United States, for farmers who participate in the voluntary Dairy Herd Improvement Association, approximately once a month the milk volume from each animal is measured using additional portable metering devices inserted between the milker and the pipeline.

In large dairy farms with more than 100 animals, the pipeline is installed within a [[milking parlor]] that the animals walk through in order to be milked at fixed stations. Because the machine is stationary, it can include additional fixed equipment such as computerized milk-metering systems to measure volume, which would be cumbersome to use with portable milkers.

In both cases the pipeline is constructed out of [[stainless steel]], which does not easily corrode and is resistant to most chemicals, though larger operations may use larger-diameter pipes in order to handle greater milk volumes.

== Transfer from pipeline to bulk tank ==
There is usually a transition point to move the milk from the pipeline under vacuum to the bulk tank, which is at normal atmospheric pressure. This is done by having the milk flow into a receiver bowl or globe, which is a large hollow glass container with electronic liquid-detecting probes in the center. As the milk rises to a certain height in the bowl, a transfer pump is used to push it through a one-way [[check valve]] and into a pipe that transfers it to the bulk tank. When the level has dropped far enough in the bowl, the transfer pump turns off. Without the check valve, the milk in the bulk tank could be sucked back into the receiver bowl when the pump is not running.

In the event of electronics or pump failure, there is also usually a secondary bowl attached to the top of receiver bowl, which contains a float and a [[diaphragm valve]]. If the main receiver bowl overflows due to pump failure, the rising milk lifts the float in the secondary bowl, which will cut off vacuum to the entire milk pipeline and will prevent the milk or wash water from being sucked into the vacuum pump.

Some milk handling systems eliminate the receiver bowl and transfer pump by having rubber seals on the bulk tank covers, to permit the entire tank to be under vacuum until milking is finished. Milk can then just flow directly by gravity from the pipeline into the bulk tank.

== Pipeline cleaning ==
[[File:Milk pipeline washing ff 0.25 320x240 vid 3 aud 1.ogv|frame|320x240, 170 kilobit video of the pipeline cleaning process for a small 35-cow dairy farm, that has a traditional stanchion barn with haymow. The automatic washing system shown is a 1970s [[Bender Machine Works]] "Trol-O-Matic 5570", and the pipeline receiver and pump were made by [[Sta-Rite]]. See [[:File:Milk pipeline washing ff 0.25 320x240 vid 3 aud 1.ogv|file description]] for larger and higher quality versions of this video.]]
The pipeline and all milk handling systems are cleaned after every milking session using a washing system that first rinses out the remaining milk and then flushes cleaning solution through the piping to kill bacteria and remove ''milkstone'', a layer of scale mainly formed by [[cations]] like calcium and magnesium. The entire washing mechanism is operated very much like a household [[dishwasher]] with an automatic fill system, soap dispenser, and automatic drain opener.

The pipeline is usually set up so that the vacuum in the system that lifts milk up can also be used to drive the cleaning process. Rather than having a single line run to the bulk tank, typically a pair of lines transport milk by gravity flow to the receiver bowl and transfer pump. The high ends of these two lines are joined together to form a complete loop back to the receiver bowl.

Cleaning is accomplished by inserting a choke plug into one of the lines leading to the transfer pump, and sucking large volumes of water from a wash-water supply tank into the choked line. This choke plug is mounted on a rod, and is inserted into the line before cleaning, and pulled out for regular milking. Due to the choke, the water, which is sufficient to completely fill the pipe, is sucked up one side of the pipeline, over the high point joining the two pipeline sections, and then flows back to the receiver bowl and transfer pump through the unchoked line. The transfer pump is then used to move the cleaning solution from the receiver bowl back to the wash-water supply tank to restart the process.

Typically, the inlet ports on the receiver globe are designed so that large slugs of wash water moving at high speed will enter on a tangent to the sides of the globe and rapidly spin around inside to assist in vigorous cleaning of the globe's interior. It is normal for wash water to overflow out the top of the globe and for some wash water to be sucked into the overflow chamber to also flush it out. During cleaning the bottom of the overflow chamber is connected to a drain channel on the receiver globe to permit water to flow out.

For the small-farm pipeline, portable milkers are inserted into this cleaning loop usually by sucking the cleaning solution out of the wash supply tank through the milker claw and outputting from the milker hoses into the choked end of the line. When the water returns to the receiver bowl, the transfer pump returns the water back to the milker's water pickup tank.

'''Open Virtualization Format''' ('''OVF''') is an [[open standard]] for packaging and distributing [[virtual appliance]]s or, more generally, [[software]] to be run in [[virtual machine]]s.

The standard describes an "open, secure, portable, efficient and extensible format for the packaging and distribution of software to be run in [[virtual machine]]s". The OVF standard is not tied to any particular [[hypervisor]] or [[instruction set architecture]]. The unit of packaging and distribution is a so-called ''OVF Package'' which may contain one or more ''virtual systems'' each of which can be deployed to a virtual machine.

In September 2007 [[VMware]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]] and [[XenSource]] submitted to the [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF) a proposal for OVF, then named "Open Virtual Machine Format".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dmtf.org/newsroom/pr/view?item_key=3b542cbc5e6fc9ede97b9336c29f4c342c02c4e9 | title = DMTF Press Release on OVF submission 9/2007 | accessdate = 2008-09-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916094658/http://www.dmtf.org/newsroom/pr/view?item_key=3b542cbc5e6fc9ede97b9336c29f4c342c02c4e9 | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DMTF subsequently released the OVF Specification V1.0.0 as a preliminary standard in September, 2008, and V1.1.0 in January, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/ | title = DMTF Published Documents page | accessdate = 2008-09-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703062530/http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, DMTF released the second version of the standard, OVF 2.0 which applies to emerging cloud use cases and provides important developments from OVF 1.0 including improved network configuration support and package encryption capabilities for safe delivery.

[[ANSI]] has ratified OVF 1.1.0 as ANSI standard INCITS 469-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=INCITS+469-2010 | title = INCITS 469-2010 Information Technology - Open Virtualization Format (OVF) Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OVF 1.1 was adopted as an International Standard in August 2011 by the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dmtf.org/news/pr/2011/8/dmtf-gains-international-recognition-two-isoiec-standards | title = DMTF Gains International Recognition with Two ISO/IEC Standards | accessdate = 2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OVF 2.0 brings an enhanced set of capabilities to the packaging of virtual machines, making the standard applicable to a broader range of cloud use cases that are emerging as the industry enters the cloud era. The most significant improvements include support for network configuration along with the ability to encrypt the package to ensure safe delivery.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmtf.org/about/faq/ovf_faq&lt;/ref&gt;




== Design ==

An OVF package consists of several files placed in one directory. An OVF package always contains exactly one OVF descriptor (a file with extension .ovf). The OVF descriptor is an XML file which describes the packaged virtual machine; it contains the [[metadata]] for the OVF package, such as name, hardware requirements, references to the other files in the OVF package and human-readable descriptions. In addition to the OVF descriptor, the OVF package will typically contain one or more [[disk image]]s, and optionally [[Public key certificate|certificate]] files and other auxiliary files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0243_1.1.0.pdf | title = Open Virtualization Format Specification, V1.10 | accessdate = 2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire directory can be distributed as an [[Virtual appliance|Open Virtual Appliance]] (OVA'')'' package, which is a [[tar (computing)|tar]] archive file with the OVF directory inside.

== Industry support ==

An '''optical amplifier''' is a device that amplifies an [[optical]] [[signal (information theory)|signal]] directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An optical amplifier may be thought of as a [[laser]] without an [[optical cavity]], or one in which [[feedback]] from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in [[optical communication]] and [[laser physics]].  They are used as [[optical repeater]]s in the long distance [[fiberoptic cable]]s which carry much of the world's telecommunication links.

There are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, [[stimulated emission]] in the amplifier's [[gain medium]] causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), [[electron]]-[[electron hole|hole]] [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] occurs. In [[Raman amplifier]]s, [[Raman scattering]] of incoming light with [[phonon]]s in the lattice of the gain medium produces [[photon]]s coherent with the incoming photons. [[Parametric amplifier]]s use parametric amplification.

==Laser amplifiers==
Almost any laser [[active gain medium]] can be [[laser pumping|pumped]] to produce [[Gain (laser)|gain]] for light at the wavelength of a laser made with the same material as its gain medium. Such amplifiers are commonly used to produce high power laser systems. Special types such as [[regenerative amplifier]]s and [[Chirped-pulse amplification|chirped-pulse amplifiers]] are used to amplify [[ultrashort pulse]]s.

=== Solid-state amplifiers ===
'''Solid-state amplifiers''' are optical amplifiers that uses a wide range of doped [[Solid-state laser|solid-state]] materials (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, Ti:Sa) and different geometries (disk, slab, rod) to amplify optical signals. The variety of materials allows the amplification of different wavelength while the shape of the medium can distinguish between more suitable for energy of average power scaling.&lt;ref name="Catch the Peak"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Catch the Peak| publisher=wiley|doi=10.1002/latj.201500001/abstract|doi-broken-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside their use in fundamental research from [[gravitational wave]] detection&lt;ref name="Single-frequency laser amplifiers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Fundamental mode, single-frequency laser amplifier for gravitational wave detectors| url= https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?id=125472| publisher=OSA| accessdate=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to high energy physics at [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]] they can also be found in many today’s [[Ultrashort pulse laser|ultra short pulsed lasers]].

=== Doped fiber amplifiers ===
[[Image:Doped fibre amplifier.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic diagram of a simple Doped Fiber Amplifier]]
'''Doped fiber amplifiers''' (DFAs) are optical amplifiers that use a [[dopant|doped]] [[optical fiber]] as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They are related to [[fiber laser]]s.  The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping [[ions]]. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where the core of a silica fiber is doped with trivalent [[erbium]] ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at a wavelength of 980 [[nanometre|nm]] or 1,480&amp;nbsp;nm, and exhibits gain in the 1,550&amp;nbsp;nm region.

An ''erbium-doped waveguide amplifier'' (''EDWA'') is an optical amplifier that uses a [[waveguide]] to boost an optical signal.

Amplification is achieved by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the doped fiber.  The pump laser excites ions into a higher energy from where they can decay via stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level.  The excited ions can also decay spontaneously (spontaneous emission) or even through nonradiative processes involving interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass matrix. These last two decay mechanisms compete with stimulated emission reducing the efficiency of light amplification.

The ''amplification window'' of an optical amplifier is the range of optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window is determined by the spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.

Although the electronic transitions of an isolated ion are very well defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into the glass of the optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened.  This broadening is both [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the [[Stark effect]]. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent erbium ion (Er&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and in the presence of an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm wavelength. The gain spectrum of the EDFA has several peaks that are smeared by the above broadening mechanisms. The net result is a very broad spectrum (30&amp;nbsp;nm in silica, typically). The broad gain-bandwidth of fiber amplifiers make them particularly useful in 
[[wavelength-division multiplexing|wavelength-division multiplexed]] communications systems as a single amplifier can be utilized to amplify all signals being carried on a fiber and whose wavelengths fall within the gain window.

===Basic principle of EDFA===
A relatively high-powered beam of light is mixed with the input signal using a wavelength selective coupler (WSC). The input signal and the excitation light must be at significantly different wavelengths.
The mixed light is guided into a section of fiber with erbium ions included in the core.
This high-powered light beam excites the erbium ions to their higher-energy state.
When the photons belonging to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited erbium atoms, the erbium atoms give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state.
A significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual – when an atom “lases” it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser.  The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.

===Noise===
The principal source of noise in DFAs is [[Amplified Spontaneous Emission]] (ASE), which has a spectrum approximately the same as the gain spectrum of the amplifier. [[Noise figure]] in an ideal DFA is 3&amp;nbsp;dB, while practical amplifiers can have noise figure as large as 6–8&amp;nbsp;dB.

As well as decaying via stimulated emission, electrons in the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level.  Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted in a direction that falls within the [[numerical aperture]] of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber.  Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission.  The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified in the same manner as the signals, hence the term ''Amplified Spontaneous Emission''.  ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance.  Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.

===Gain saturation===
Gain is achieved in a DFA due to [[population inversion]] of the dopant ions.  The inversion level of a DFA is set, primarily, by the power of the pump wavelength and the power at the amplified wavelengths.  As the signal power increases, or the pump power decreases, the inversion level will reduce and thereby the gain of the amplifier will be reduced.  This effect is known as gain saturation – as the signal level increases, the amplifier saturates and cannot produce any more output power, and therefore the gain reduces.  Saturation is also commonly known as gain compression.

To achieve optimum noise performance DFAs are operated under a significant amount of gain compression (10&amp;nbsp;dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller input signal powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.

The leading edge of the pulse is amplified, until the saturation energy of the gain medium is reached. In some condition, the width ([[FWHM]]) of the pulse is reduced.&lt;ref name="Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paschotta|first=Rüdiger| title=Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers| url=http://www.rp-photonics.com/tutorial_fiber_amplifiers.html| publisher=RP Photonics| accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inhomogeneous broadening effects===
Due to the inhomogeneous portion of the linewidth broadening of the dopant ions, the gain spectrum has an inhomogeneous component and gain saturation occurs, to a small extent, in an inhomogeneous manner.  This effect is known as ''[[spectral hole burning]]'' because a high power signal at one wavelength can 'burn' a hole in the gain for wavelengths close to that signal by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened ions.  Spectral holes vary in width depending on the characteristics of the optical fiber in question and the power of the burning signal, but are typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;nm at the short wavelength end of the C-band, and a few nm at the long wavelength end of the C-band. The depth of the holes are very small, though, making it difficult to observe in practice.

===Polarization effects===
Although the DFA is essentially a polarization independent amplifier, a small proportion of the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically &lt; 0.5&amp;nbsp;dB). This is called Polarization Dependent Gain (PDG).
The absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites.  The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. 
In an ideal doped fiber without [[birefringence]], the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to [[polarization mode dispersion]]) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG is very difficult to observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).

=== Erbium-doped optical fiber amplifiers ===

The erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most deployed fiber amplifier as its amplification window coincides with the third transmission window of silica-based optical fiber.

Two bands have developed in the third transmission window – the ''Conventional'', or C-band, from approximately 1525&amp;nbsp;nm – 1565&amp;nbsp;nm, and the ''Long'', or L-band, from approximately 1570&amp;nbsp;nm to 1610&amp;nbsp;nm.  Both of these bands can be amplified by EDFAs, but it is normal to use two different amplifiers, each optimized for one of the bands.

The principal difference between C- and L-band amplifiers is that a longer length of doped fiber is used in L-band amplifiers.  The longer length of fiber allows a lower inversion level to be used, thereby giving at longer wavelengths (due to the band-structure of Erbium in silica) while still providing a useful amount of gain.

EDFAs have two commonly used pumping bands – 980&amp;nbsp;nm and 1480&amp;nbsp;nm.  The 980&amp;nbsp;nm band has a higher absorption cross-section and is generally used where low-noise performance is required.  The absorption band is relatively narrow and so wavelength stabilised laser sources are typically needed.  The 1480&amp;nbsp;nm band has a lower, but broader, absorption cross-section and is generally used for higher power amplifiers.  A combination of 980&amp;nbsp;nm and 1480&amp;nbsp;nm pumping is generally utilised in amplifiers.

Gain and lasing in Erbium-doped fibers were first demonstrated in 1986–87 by two groups; one including [[David N. Payne]], [[Robert J. Mears|R. Mears]], I.M Jauncey and L. Reekie, from the [[University of Southampton]]&lt;ref&gt;Mears, R.J. and Reekie, L. and Poole, S.B. and Payne, D.N.: "Low-threshold tunable CW and Q-switched fiber laser operating at 1.55µm", Electron. Lett., 1986, 22, pp.159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Mears, L. Reekie, I.M. Jauncey and D. N. Payne: “Low-noise Erbium-doped fiber amplifier at 1.54µm”, Electron. Lett., 1987, 23, pp.1026–1028&lt;/ref&gt; and one from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, consisting of E. Desurvire, P. Becker, and J. Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;E. Desurvire, J. Simpson, and P.C. Becker, High-gain erbium-doped traveling-wave fiber amplifier," Optics Letters, vol. 12, No. 11, 1987, pp. 888–890&lt;/ref&gt; The dual-stage optical amplifier which enabled Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM,) was invented by Stephen B. Alexander at Ciena Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent Office #5696615; “Wavelength division multiplexed optical communication systems employing uniform gain optical amplifiers.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/george.gilder.essays/coming.of.the.fibersphere|format=TXT|title=Subject: Into the Fibersphere|website=Massis.lcs.mit.edu|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doped fiber amplifiers for other wavelength ranges===
[[Thulium]] doped fiber amplifiers have been used in the [[S-band]] (1450–1490&amp;nbsp;nm) and [[Praseodymium]] doped amplifiers in the 1300&amp;nbsp;nm region.  However, those regions have not seen any significant commercial use so far and so those amplifiers have not been the subject of as much development as the EDFA. However, [[Ytterbium]] doped fiber lasers and amplifiers, operating near 1 micrometre wavelength, have many applications in industrial processing of materials, as these devices can be made with extremely high output power (tens of kilowatts).

==Semiconductor optical amplifier==&lt;!--Semiconductor optical amplifier redirects here--&gt;
Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are amplifiers which use a semiconductor to provide the gain medium.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Connolly, Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers. Boston, MA: Springer-Verlag, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-7657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These amplifiers have a similar structure to [[Fabry–Pérot]] [[laser diodes]] but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted [[wave guide]] and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which is greater than the gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry in order to reduce the power density on the output facet.

Semiconductor optical amplifiers are typically made from group III-V compound semiconductors such as [[GaAs]]/AlGaAs, [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/[[InGaAs]], [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InGaAsP and [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InAlGaAs, though any direct band gap semiconductors such as II-VI could conceivably be used. Such amplifiers are often used in telecommunication systems in the form of fiber-pigtailed components, operating at signal wavelengths between 0.85&amp;nbsp;µm and 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm and generating gains of up to 30&amp;nbsp;dB.

The semiconductor optical amplifier is of small size and electrically pumped. It can be potentially less expensive than the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear]]ity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and [[four wave mixing]]) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh|first1=B.|last2=Mukhopadhyay|first2=S.|title=All-Optical Wavelength encoded NAND and NOR Operations exploiting Semiconductor Optical Amplifier based Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Wavelength Converter and Phase Conjugation System|journal=Optics and Photonics Letters|volume=4|issue=2|pages=1–9|year=2011|doi=10.1142/S1793528811000172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This originates from the short nanosecond or less upper state lifetime, so that the gain reacts rapidly to changes of pump or signal power and the changes of gain also cause phase changes which can distort the signals.
This nonlinearity presents the most severe problem for optical communication applications. However it provides the possibility for gain in different wavelength regions from the EDFA. "Linear optical amplifiers" using gain-clamping techniques have been developed.

High optical nonlinearity makes semiconductor amplifiers attractive for all optical signal processing like all-optical switching and wavelength conversion. There has been much research on semiconductor optical amplifiers as elements for optical signal processing, wavelength conversion, clock recovery, signal demultiplexing, and pattern recognition.

===Vertical-cavity SOA===
A recent addition to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers ([[VCSEL]]s). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically on the order of a few percent) and also a very large [[free spectral range]] (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In addition to boosting the total signal gain, the use of the [[resonant cavity]] structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.

Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are resonant cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In addition to their small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads to a number of advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still in the early stages of research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~memsucsb/Research/MT-VCSOA/MT-VCSOA.html|title=MEMS-Tunable Vertical-cavity SOA|website=Engineering.ucsb.edu|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.

===Tapered amplifiers===
For high output power and broader wavelength range, tapered amplifiers are used. These amplifiers consist of a lateral single-mode section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.

Typical parameters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanel-photonics.com/tapered_amplifier.html |title=Tapered amplifiers – available wavelengths and output powers |publisher=Hanel Photonics |accessdate=Sep 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* wavelength range: 633 to 1480&amp;nbsp;nm
* input power: 10 to 50&amp;nbsp;mW
* output power: up to 3 Watt

== Raman amplifier ==
{{Main|Raman amplification}}
In a Raman amplifier, the signal is intensified by [[Raman amplification]]. Unlike the EDFA and SOA the amplification effect is achieved by a nonlinear interaction between the signal and a pump laser within an optical fiber.  There are two types of Raman amplifier: distributed and lumped. A distributed Raman amplifier is one in which the transmission fiber is utilised as the gain medium by multiplexing a pump wavelength with signal wavelength, while a lumped Raman amplifier utilises a dedicated, shorter length of fiber to provide amplification.  In the case of a lumped Raman amplifier, a highly nonlinear fiber with a small core is utilised to increase the interaction between signal and pump wavelengths, and thereby reduce the length of fiber required.

The pump light may be coupled into the transmission fiber in the same direction as the signal (co-directional pumping), in the opposite direction (contra-directional pumping) or both. Contra-directional pumping is more common as the transfer of noise from the pump to the signal is reduced.

The pump power required for Raman amplification is higher than that required by the EDFA, with in excess of 500&amp;nbsp;mW being required to achieve useful levels of gain in a distributed amplifier.  Lumped amplifiers, where the pump light can be safely contained to avoid safety implications of high optical powers, may use over 1 W of optical power.

The principal advantage of Raman amplification is its ability to provide distributed amplification within the transmission fiber, thereby increasing the length of spans between amplifier and [[Signal regeneration|regeneration]] sites.  The amplification bandwidth of Raman amplifiers is defined by the pump wavelengths utilised and so amplification can be provided over wider, and different, regions than may be possible with other amplifier types which rely on dopants and device design to define the amplification 'window'.

Raman amplifiers have some fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, which provides a cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines can be used to increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification is that it is a relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth &gt; 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.&lt;ref name="Optical Amplifier Tutorial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiberstore.com/Optical-Amplifier-Tutorial-aid-359.html|title=Optical Amplifier Tutorial - FS.COM|first=FiberStore|last=Team|website=Fiberstore.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of challenges for Raman amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.&lt;ref name="Optical Amplifier Tutorial"/&gt;

== Optical parametric amplifier ==
An [[optical parametric amplifier]] allows the amplification of a weak signal-impulse in a [[Centrosymmetry|noncentrosymmetric]] nonlinear medium (e.g. [[Beta barium borate]] (BBO)). In contrast to the previously mentioned amplifiers, which are mostly used in telecommunication environments, this type finds its main application in expanding the frequency tunability of ultrafast [[solid-state laser]]s (e.g. [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]). By using a [[Collinear|noncollinear]] interaction geometry optical parametric amplifiers are capable of extremely broad amplification bandwidths.

== Recent achievements ==
The adoption of high power [[fiber laser]]s as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing for several years and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (&lt;5&amp;nbsp;kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed in the last few years from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the adoption of stimulated [[brillouin scattering]] (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now deliver power levels exceeding what is available from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nufern.com/library/item/id/380/|title=Nufern &gt; Library&gt; Article|website=Nufern.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
There are several simulation tools that can be used to design optical amplifiers. Popular commercial tools have been developed by Optiwave Systems and VPI Systems.

[[File:Polygone scientifique - Grenoble.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Polygone Scientifique in 2008.]]
The '''Polygone Scientifique''' (en: Scientific Polygon) is a neighborhood of the city of [[Grenoble]] in [[France]]. It includes a significant number of research centers in a [[presque-isle]] between [[Isère (river)|Isère]] and [[Drac (river)|Drac]].

== History ==
Polygon hosts in 1956 the first [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|French Atomic Energy Commission]] (CEA) outside Paris and created by Professor [[Louis Néel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grenoble-isere.com/en/national-research-centers grenoble-isere.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, it hosts a campus [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. In 1967, the [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information]] was founded by CEA and became one of the world’s largest organizations for applied research in [[microelectronics]] and [[nanotechnology]].

Three international organizations are implanted between 1973 and 1988 with the [[Institut Laue–Langevin]], the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] and one of the five branches of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]]. In 2006, the complex [[Minatec]] specializing in [[nanotechnology]] opens on the Polygon and in 2007, the [[Institut Néel]], specializing in [[condensed matter physics]], is founded.

[[LNCMI|National Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields]] has also numerous collaborations in terms of technical and technological innovations with these institutions.

In 2008, the new innovation campus is called GIANT (Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france-science.org/GIANT-French-American-Workshop,3090.html france-science.org, GIANT French-American Workshop 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7370-547a nature.com, France: Peak of potential.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.grenoble-em.com/giant-innovation-campus grenoble-em.com, GIANT Innovation Campus.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Clinatec]] is founded on Polygone Scientifique by the professor [[Alim-Louis Benabid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-medical.net/news/20141216/Clinatec-chairman-receives-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-for-breakthrough-research-on-Parkinsons-disease.aspx news-medical.net Clinatec chairman receives Lifetime Achievement Award for breakthrough research on Parkinson's disease.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141110006060/en/Clinatec-Chairman-Alim-Louis-Benabid-Wins-3-Million businesswire.com Clinatec Chairman Alim-Louis Benabid Wins $3 Million 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for Parkinson’s Disease Work.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prepaid service cards in Germany (2).jpg|thumb|Range of prepaid service cards in a German supermarket]]
'''Prepaid''' refers to services paid for in advance. Examples include [[postage stamp]]s, [[LegalShield|attorneys]], [[toll (road usage)|toll]]s, [[public transit]] cards like the [[Greater London]] [[Oyster card]], pay as you go [[cell phone]]s, and [[stored-value card]]s such as [[gift card]]s and  preloaded [[credit card]]s.

Prepaid services and goods are sometimes targeted to marginal customers by [[retail]]ers.  Prepaid options can have substantial cost reductions over [[postpaid]] counterparts because they allow customers to monitor and budget usage in advance.

Unlike [[postpaid]] or [[contract]] based services, prepaid accounts can be obtained with cash. As a result, they can be established by people who have minimal [[Identity document|identification]] or poor [[credit rating]]s. [[minor (law)|Minor]]s, [[immigrant]]s, [[student]]s, defaulters, and those on low incomes are typical prepaid customers.

==Prepaid mobile phones==
{{Main| Prepaid mobile phone}}
{{See also| Prepaid telephone calls| Telephone card}}

Recent statistics (OECD ''Communications Outlook'' 2005) indicate that 40% of the total mobile phone market in the [[OECD]] region consists of prepaid accounts. This service was invented by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] provider [[Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais|TMN]], while researching for a means to increase penetration of mobile technology by allowing anyone to buy a fully working (usually requiring a quick and simple activation process) mobile phone on any supermarket or electronics store. By removing the complications inherent to the contract system, this allowed the mobile communications user base to grow incredibly fast. In many countries this type of service became the predominant one, shortly after introduction, by providing both consumers and service providers with considerable advantages over the traditional method. In some countries, such as Italy or Mexico, market share of prepaid can be as high as 90%.  In other countries, such as Finland or South Korea, the figure drops to about 2%.

A Prepaid Call (or even Calling Card) is actually established through two calls, and the first is either through an 800 Toll Free Number, and even some from the big telephone companies have them available with international toll free numbers, or you will find many that offer calling through a local phone number, usually printed on the back that offer cheaper rates but the first call costs are passed on to you, the consumer.

You place this first call to get to the providers platform, and once connected you are authenticated via a PIN or as seen in Europe or around other parts of the world the card may have an electronic chip on it, like you may have seen on the American Express Blue card. If you use the local number provided from your home or cell phone you pay for the cost of the first call, you can see this on your bills even if you don't get connected. The reason that 800 toll free is more expensive is because the Prepaid Calling Card Company pays for the attempts and even when you just call to check your balance, you only pay when you are actually connected.  Many Local Telephone Companies don't show local usage so you may not see that you are paying for a local call every time you make an attempt. This is not true when you call a toll free number from a land line but with Cell phones you do use air time. With most local phone companies you can get call detail to support this.

Once you are authenticated you are usually presented with your balance then prompted for your destination number (the second call), and usually given the time left on your card based on the number you just dialed. Then you are connected.

With smaller companies beware the hidden charges when the rates are too low to be true.  They mave have hidden fees or poorly advertised fees, like 3 minute rounding, connection fees, monthly, weekly, daily, or even maintenance fees.  Look around when you buy these smaller name brands to make sure you know what you are buying.

The [[pseudonymity]] enabled by prepaid services has recently become a concern with law enforcement agencies that consider it a safe haven for criminals and terrorists.  As a result, a number of countries including Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, [[Mozambique]], Norway, Singapore, [[South Africa]], Switzerland, and Thailand have passed laws to require that all prepaid customers register their personal information with their mobile carrier.

In some countries the law requires that customers notify their mobile carrier when transferring ownership of a prepaid phone or [[SIM card]].

In Australia, the prepaid registration policy is part of a larger law enforcement initiative that includes the creation and maintenance of an [[Integrated Public Number Database]].

== Energy ==
In 1999, Texas deregulated the energy industry by allowing third-party affiliates to offer electricity services.  As a result, a handful of Texas companies are offering the ability to prepay your electricity, with the balance going toward the posted kilowatt hours rate. This system is now common in China and Indonesia, as a way to forestall non-payment of bills.

==Insurance==
[[Insurance]] premiums are usually paid at or before the start of the insurance period, the period of cover, but the premium may at times be payable in instalments during the insurance period.

A '''rotaxane''' is a [[mechanically interlocked molecular architectures|mechanically interlocked molecular architecture]] consisting of a "dumbbell shaped molecule" which is threaded through a "[[macrocycle]]" (see graphical representation). The name is derived from the Latin for wheel (rota) and axle (axis). The two components of a rotaxane are kinetically trapped since the ends of the dumbbell (often called stoppers) are larger than the internal diameter of the ring and prevent [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (unthreading) of the components since this would require significant distortion of the covalent bonds.

Much of the research concerning rotaxanes and other mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as [[catenane]]s, has been focused on their efficient synthesis or their utilization as artificial molecular machines. However, examples of rotaxane substructure have been found in naturally occurring peptides, including: [[cystine knot]] peptides, [[cyclotide]]s or lasso-peptides such as microcin J25.

The earliest reported synthesis of a rotaxane in 1967 relied on the [[statistical probability]] that if two halves of a dumbbell-shaped molecule were reacted in the presence of a [[macrocycle]] that some small percentage would connect through the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Synthesis of a stable complex of a macrocycle and a threaded chain |year= 1967 |journal= [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] |volume= 89 |issue= 22 |pages= 5723–5724 |doi= 10.1021/ja00998a052 |last1= Harrison |first1= Ian Thomas. |last2= Harrison |first2= Shuyen. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a reasonable quantity of rotaxane, the macrocycle was attached to a [[solid-phase synthesis|solid-phase support]] and treated with both halves of the dumbbell 70 times and then severed from the support to give a 6% yield. However, the synthesis of rotaxanes has advanced significantly and efficient yields can be obtained by preorganizing the components utilizing [[hydrogen bond]]ing, metal coordination, [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic forces]], [[covalent bond]]s, or [[Coulomb force|coulombic interactions]]. The three most common strategies to synthesize rotaxane are "capping", "clipping", and "slipping",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Aricó, F. |title= Templated Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules |year= 2005 |journal= Topics in Current Chemistry |volume= 249 |pages= 203–259 |doi= 10.1007/b104330|isbn= 978-3-540-23087-8 |hdl= 10278/33611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though others do exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Threading-Followed-by-Shrinking Protocol for the Synthesis of a [2]Rotaxane Incorporating a Pd(II)-Salophen Moiety |year= 2004 |journal= [[J.

[[File:DNA origami rotaxanes.jpg|thumb|860px|center|(a) A rotaxane is formed from an open ring (R1) with a flexible hinge and a dumbbell-shaped [[DNA origami]] structure (D1). The hinge of the ring consists of a series of strand crossovers into which additional [[thymine]]s are inserted to provide higher flexibility. Ring and axis subunits are first connected and positioned with respect to each other using 18 [[nucleotide]] long, complementary sticky ends 33 nm away from the center of the axis (blue regions).

===Capping===
[[Image:Rotaxanes-synthesis-methods.png|thumbnail|350px|Rotaxane synthesis can be carried out via a "capping," "clipping, "slipping" or "active template" mechanism]]
Synthesis via the capping method relies strongly upon a thermodynamically driven template effect; that is, the "thread" is held within the "macrocycle" by non-covalent interactions, for example rotaxinations with cyclodextrin macrocycles involve exploitation of the hydrophobic effect. This dynamic complex or pseudorotaxane is then converted to the rotaxane by reacting the ends of the threaded guest with large groups, preventing disassociation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-RiMRO6Y|website=youtube.com|title=Rotaxane by capping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clipping===
The clipping method is similar to the capping reaction except that in this case the dumbbell shaped molecule is complete and is bound to a partial macrocycle. The partial macrocycle then undergoes a [[ring closing reaction]] around the dumbbell-shaped molecule, forming the rotaxane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romero|first1=Antonio|title=Rotaxane by capping 3d|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_-RiMRO6Y|website=Rotaxane by capping 3d|publisher=3D video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slipping===
The method of slipping is one which exploits the thermodynamic &lt;ref&gt;"The Nature of the Mechanical Bond: From Molecules to Machines
Di Carson J. Bruns,J. Fraser Stoddart, https://books.google.it/books?id=xShUDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=rotaxane+slippage+thermodynamic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vUHhNsDkCc&amp;sig=YDq4LhZy7yHcLn4K6aQnSBb-dCI&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiodDfl-DUAhXLPFAKHdNDCC8Q6AEIODAE "&lt;/ref&gt; stability of the rotaxane. If the end groups of the dumbbell are an appropriate size it will be able to reversibly thread through the macrocycle at higher temperatures. By cooling the dynamic complex, it becomes kinetically trapped as a rotaxane at the lower temperature.

==="Active template" methodology===
Leigh and co-workers recently began to explore a strategy in which template ions could also play an active role in promoting the crucial final covalent bond forming reaction that captures the interlocked structure (i.e., the metal has a dual function, acting as a template for entwining the precursors and catalyzing covalent bond formation between the reactants).

The [[macrocycle]] can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another.

Potential application as long-lasting dyes is based on the enhanced stability of the inner portion of the dumbbell-shaped molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Rotaxane-encapsulated cyanine dyes: enhanced fluorescence efficiency and photostability |year= 2000 |journal= [[Chem.

D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced stability of rotaxane dyes is attributed to the insulating effect of the [[macrocycle]], which is able to block interactions with other molecules.

=== Nanorecording ===
In a nanorecording application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Stable, Reproducible Nanorecording on Rotaxane Thin Films |year= 2005 |journal= [[J. Am. Chem.

When a positive [[voltage]] is applied with the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to a different part of the dumbbell and the resulting new [[conformational isomerism|conformation]] makes the molecules stick out 0.3 [[nanometer]] from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a [[memory dot]]. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film.

== Nomenclature ==
Accepted nomenclature is to designate the number of components of the rotaxane in brackets as a prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Nomenclature for Rotaxanes and Pseudorotaxanes (IUPAC Recommendations 2008) |first1= Andrey |last1= Yerin |first2= Edward S. |last2= Wilks |first3= Gerard P. |last3= Moss |first4= Akira |last4= Harada |journal= Pure and Applied Chemistry |year= 2008 |volume= 80 |issue= 9 |pages= 2041–2068 |doi= 10.1351/pac200880092041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the a rotaxane consisting of a single dumbbell-shaped axial molecule with a single macrocycle around its shaft is called a [2]rotaxane, and two [[cyanostar]] molecules around the central phosphate group of dialkylphosphate is a [3]rotaxane.

[[Image:Compas de proportion 1.jpg|thumb|Photo of a sector]]
[[Image:Compas de proportion 2.jpg|thumb|The other side of the same sector]]

The '''sector''', also known as a '''proportional compass''' or '''military compass''', was a major calculating instrument in use from the end of the sixteenth century until the nineteenth century. It is an instrument consisting of two rulers of equal length joined by a hinge. A number of scales are inscribed upon the instrument which facilitate various mathematical calculations. It was used for solving problems in [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], [[trigonometry]], [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], and for various functions, such as [[square root|squares]] and [[cube root]]s. Its several scales permitted easy and direct solutions of problems in [[gun]]nery, [[surveying]] and [[navigation]]. The sector derives its name from the fourth proposition of the sixth book of [[Euclid]], where it is demonstrated that [[similar triangles]] have their like sides proportional. It has four parts, two legs with a pivot (the articulation), a quadrant and a clamp (the curved part at the end of the leg) that enables the compass to function as a [[artillery|gunner]]'s quadrant.

==History==
[[File:Galileo's geometrical and military compass in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|Galileo's geometrical and military compass, thought to have been made c. 1604 by Mazzoleni]]The sector was invented, essentially simultaneously and independently, by a number of different people prior to the start of the 17th century.
[[File:Gallucci, Giovanni Paolo – De fabrica et usu cuiusdam instrumenti ad omnia horarum genera describenda, 1592 – BEIC 3937801.jpg|thumb|''De fabrica et usu menti ad omnia horarum genera describenda'' (1592), where [[Giovanni Paolo Gallucci]] is among the first to describe the sector]]

[[File:Henrion - Usage du compas de proportion, 1637 - BEIC 218820 F.jpg|thumb|[[Clément Cyriaque de Mangin]], ''Usage du compas de proportion'', 1637]]

[[Fabrizio Mordente]] (1532 – ca 1608) was an Italian mathematician who is best known for his invention of the "proportional eight-pointed compass" which has two arms with cursors that allow the solution of problems in measuring the circumference, area and angles of a circle. In 1567 he published a single sheet treatise in Venice showing illustrations of his device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Camerota, Filippo |date=2012 |title= Mordente, Fabrizio |work= Biographical Dictionary of Italians |volume=76 |language =Italian |url= http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/fabrizio-mordente_Dizionario-Biografico/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1585 [[Giordano Bruno]] used Mordente's compass to refute [[Aristotle]]'s hypothesis on the incommensurability of infinitesimals, thus confirming the existence of the "minimum" which laid the basis of his own atomic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Figuratio Aristotelici Physici auditus|date=1585|author=Bruno, Giordano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit for the invention is often given to either [[Thomas Hood (mathematician)|Thomas Hood]], a British mathematician, or to the Italian mathematician and astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]]. Galileo, with the help of his personal instrument maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]], created more than 100 copies of his military compass design and trained students in its use between 1595 and 1598. Of the credited inventors, Galileo is certainly the most famous, and earlier studies usually attributed its invention to him.

== The scales ==
The following is a description of the instrument as it was constructed by Galileo, and for which he wrote a popular manual. The terminating values are arbitrary and varied from manufacturer to manufacturer.

===The Arithmetic Lines===

The innermost scales of the instrument are called the Arithmetic Lines from their division in [[arithmetical progression]], that is, by equal additions which proceed out to the number 250. It is a [[linear scale]] generated by the [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f(n) = Ln/250&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is an integer between 1 and 250, inclusive, and ''L'' is the length at mark 250.

===The Geometric Lines===

The next scales are called the Geometric Lines and are divided in [[geometric progression]] out to 50. The lengths on the geometric lines vary as the [[square root]] of the labeled values. If ''L'' represents the length at 50, then the generating function is: &lt;math&gt;f(n) = L(n/50)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.

===The Stereometric Lines===

The Stereometric Lines are so called because their divisions are according to the [[ratio]]s of solid bodies, out to 148. One of this scale's applications is to calculate, when given one side of any solid body, the side of a similar one that has a given [[volume]] ratio to the first. If ''L'' is the scale length at 148, then the scale-generating function is: &lt;math&gt;f(n) = L(n/148)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is a positive integer less than or equal to 148.

===The Metallic Lines===

These lines have divisions on which appeared these symbols: Au, Pb, Ag, Cu, Fe, Sn, Mar, Sto, ([[gold]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[tin]], [[marble]], and [[Rock (geology)|stone]]). From these you can get the ratios and differences of [[specific weight]] found between the materials. With the instrument set at any opening, the intervals between any correspondingly marked pair of points will give the [[diameter]]s of balls (or sides of other solid bodies) similar to one another and equal in weight.

===The Polygraphic Lines===

From the given information, the side length and the number of sides, the Polygraphic lines yield the radius of the [[circle]] that will contain the required [[regular polygon]]. If the polygon required has ''n'' sides, then the central angle opposite one side will be&amp;nbsp;360/''n''.

===The Tetragonic Lines===

Tetragonic Lines are so called from their principal use, which is to square all regular areas and the circle as well. The divisions of this scale use the function: &lt;math&gt;f(n) = L(3^{1/2}\tan(180/n)/n)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, between the values of 3 and 13.&lt;!-- Either 13 or 31 probably needs to be changed to the other, and needs an indication of which variable ranges from 3 to 13 (or 31). --&gt;

===The Added Lines===

These Added Lines are marked with two series of numbers, of which the outer series begins at a certain mark called ''D'' followed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on out to 18. The inner series begins from this mark ''D'', going on then to 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, also out to 18. They were used in conjunction with the other scales for a number of complex calculations.

== Use ==
[[File:Sector with dividers, probably Dresden, c. 1630 - Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon, Dresden - DSC08048.JPG|thumb|right|Sector with dividers, probably Dresden, c. 1630]]
The instrument can be used to graphically solve questions of proportion, and relies on the principle of similar triangles. Its vital feature is a pair of jointed legs, which carry paired geometrical scales. In use, problems are set up using a pair of dividers to determine the appropriate opening of the jointed legs and the answer is taken off directly as a dimension using the dividers. Specialised scales for area, volume and trigonometrical calculations, as well as simpler arithmetical problems were quickly added to the basic design.

Different versions of the instrument also took different forms and adopted additional features. The type publicised by Hood was intended for use as a surveying instrument, and included not only sights and a mounting socket for attaching the instrument to a pole or post, but also an arc scale and an additional sliding leg. Galileo's earliest examples were intended to be used as gunner's levels as well as calculating devices.

'''Separation of content and presentation''' (or '''separation of content and style''') is the [[separation of concerns]] design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content. Under this principle, visual and design aspects (presentation and style) are separated from the core material and structure (content) of a document.&lt;ref name="ALA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alistapart.com/article/separationdilemma|title=Separation: The Web Designer’s Dilemma|work=[[A List Apart]]|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = USPTO | last1 = Ferrel| first1 = P.J.| last2 = Meyer| first2 = R.F.| last3 = Millet| first3 = S.J.| last4 = Shewchuk| first4 = J.P.| last5 = Smith| first5 = W.W.| title = Method for delivering separate design and content in a multimedia publishing system| date = March 6, 2001|id=Patent #6199082}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=June 2017}} A typical analogy used to explain this principle is the distinction between the human skeleton (as the structural component) and human flesh (as the visual component) which makes up the body's appearance. Common applications of this principle are seen in [[Web design]] ([[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]])&lt;ref name="SFU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/165/common/study-guide/content/css-separate.html|title=Separating Content and Appearance|work=[[Simon Fraser University]]|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Dave|year=2007|title=Content Management and the Separation of Presentation and Content|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–60|issn=1057-2252|doi=10.1080/10572250701588624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and markup language (see [[LaTeX]]).

== Use in Web design ==
This principle is not a rigid guideline, but serves more as [[best practice]] for keeping appearance and structure separate. In many cases, the [[Web design|design]] and [[Web development|development]] aspects of a project are performed by different people, so keeping both aspects separated ensures both initial production accountability and later maintenance simplification, as in the ''[[don't repeat yourself]]'' (DRY) principle.

== Use in writing ==

[[LaTeX]] is a document markup language that focuses primarily on the content and structure of a document. With this methodology, [[Academic writing|academic writings]] and publication can be structured and styled with minimal effort by the creator, and can be quickly reformatted for different purposes.

[[File:Technikmuseum Stade, 12.jpg|thumb|A combination Tefifon player and radio]]

The '''Tefifon''' is a German-developed and manufactured audio playback format that utilizes cartridges loaded with an endlessly looped reel of plastic tape (much like the later [[4-track cartridge|4-track]] and [[8-track tape|8-track]] magnetic audio tape cartridges) with grooves embossed on it, similar to the ones on a phonograph record. The grooves were embossed in a helical fashion across the width of the tape, much similar to [[Dictaphone]]'s [[Dictabelt]] format, and are read with a stylus and amplified pickup in the player's [[transport (recording)|transport]]. A Tefifon cartridge can hold up to four hours of music; therefore, most releases for the format are usually compilations of popular hits or dance music, operas and operettas. Tefifon players were not sold by television and radio dealers in Germany, but rather sold directly by special sales outlets affiliated with Tefi (the manufacturer of the format).  

==History==
===1930s===
The Tefifon format was developed by the German entrepreneur Dr. [[Karl Daniel]] and his "Tefi" company in 1936. Although a few years earlier, devices using phonographic grooved tape like the Tefifon were produced by Tefi for special purposes, mainly for the military, and were designed for voice recording. Prior to the Tefifon's introduction, Tefi introduced a device capable of recording and playback under the name "Tefiphon" (note the alternate spelling) and another device only capable of playback under the name "Teficord". Both use loose tape, unlike the cartridge-loaded tape of the Tefifon.

===1940s===
The first Tefifon players and cartridges for home use came available in the German market towards the end of the 1940s, but couldn't compete with the popular phonographic disc format readily already available at the time. One reason was that well-known artists were committed exclusively by contract to major record companies, most of which had no interest in offering their artists' albums on Tefifon tapes. As a result, most Tefifon releases were of relatively unknown bands and artists. In addition, the Tefifon saw competition from phonographs equipped with [[record changers]], some of which could allow for up to three hours of music without interruption.

===1950s===
The Tefifon was offered in the 1950s as a standalone device, but also in combination with various types of radios, including portable and home models. The chassis of the radio sets were often purchased ready-made from third parties, with a Tefifon playback transport being added to it as a finished product. The sound quality of Tefifon tapes is much superior to 78 rpm records made of shellac, but is still less than that of 33 rpm LP records made of vinyl. In addition, the mechanical stress on the stylus and supporting cantilever is quite strong, so this wears out relatively quickly.

===1960s===
The last innovation of the Tefifon format was in 1961, with the introduction of stereo sound, but this was not commercially successful. Tefifon production at its main plant in [[Porz am Rhein]] was halted in 1965. Afterward, the rights to the name were acquired by the [[Neckermann]] mail-order company, which also took over the sale of existing Tefifon products. Even though the Tefifon was little-known outside of Germany, it was imported and sold in the United States for a very short time by [[Western Electric]]'s Westrex division from 1963-1964 under the "Westrex" name.

'''''The Big Bang Theory''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] created by [[Chuck Lorre]] and [[Bill Prady]], both of whom serve as [[executive producer]]s on the series, along with [[Steven Molaro]]. All three also serve as head writers. The show premiered on [[CBS]] on September 24, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/big-bang-theory/cast/288041 "The Big Bang Theory: Cast &amp; Details"]. ''[[TV Guide]]''.

The show is filmed in front of a live audience and is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[Chuck Lorre Productions]]. ''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Later seasons saw a return to a lukewarm reception, with the show being criticized for a decline in comedic quality. Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] from 2011 to 2014 and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] four times for [[Jim Parsons]]. It has so far won 7 Emmy Awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series]] in 2011. The series has so far won 56 awards from 216 nominations. It has also spawned a prequel series in 2017 based on Parsons' character, Sheldon Cooper, named ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which originally aired on [[CBS]].

==Production==
[[File:The Big Bang Theory Logo.png|thumb|left|Series' logo used for print]]
The show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the [[2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–07 television season]] but never aired. The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]) and Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]), who are named after [[Sheldon Leonard]], a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor.

Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used [[Thomas Dolby]]'s hit "[[She Blinded Me with Science]]" as its theme song.

Although the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the evolution of the show, [[Chuck Lorre]] said, "We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal." As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, "Wow, that would be something. We will see.

===Theme song===
[[Image:Barenaked Ladies - Big Bang Theory Theme (Official Single Cover).png|thumb|right|upright=.91|Single cover for "Big Bang Theory Theme" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] (2007)]]
The Canadian [[alternative rock]] band [[Barenaked Ladies]] wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer [[Ed Robertson]] was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read [[Simon Singh]]'s book ''[[Big Bang (book)|Big Bang]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/11/02/barenaked-ladies-ed-robertson-talks-big-bang-theory-theme-song|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707131758/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/11/02/barenaked-ladies-ed-robertson-talks-big-bang-theory-theme-song|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 7, 2012|title=Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson talks "Big Bang Theory" theme song|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imbatman.org/interviews/barenaked-ladies-talk-about-big-bang-theme-song|title=Barenaked Ladies Talk about Big Bang Theme Song|date=April 2, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410042246/http://imbatman.org/interviews/barenaked-ladies-talk-about-big-bang-theme-song/|archivedate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XKMQZY|title=Big Bang Theory Theme|author=Barenaked Ladies|publisher=Amazon Digital Services, Inc.|accessdate=October 21, 2007}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some unofficial pages identify the song title as "History of Everything,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/history-of-everything-lyrics-barenaked-ladies.html|title=History Of Everything Lyrics|website=''metrolyrics.com''|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cover art for the single identifies the title as "Big Bang Theory Theme."

===Actors' salaries===
For the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/11/23/the-big-bang-theory-salary-renegotiations/|title='The Big Bang Theory' salary renegotiations: Do they all deserve the same pay?|first=Lynette|last=Rice|date=November 23, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dead-salary&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Big Bang Theory' Stars Score Huge Paydays After Hardball Bargaining; Jim Parsons Told 'Take It Or Leave It' Today|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/09/big-payday-for-the-big-bang-theory-stars|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=October 1, 2011|date=September 15, 2010|quote=That effectively adds another $50,000 to their per-episode paycheck over the life of the deal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000–$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/big-bang-theory-mayim-bialik-melissa-rauch-pay-raises/|title='Big Bang' Co-Stars Mayim Bialik &amp; Melissa Rauch Get Major Salary Bumps As Show Faces License Fee &amp; More Cast Negotiations|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.&lt;ref name="S8Pay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/big-bang-theory-cast-contract-negotiations-production-near/|title='The Big Bang Theory' Production Start In Limbo As Cast Contract Negotiations Drag On|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 16, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year.

===Scientist cameos===
{{see also|List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Guest stars appearing as themselves}}
As the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and Nobel laureate [[George Smoot]] had a [[cameo appearance]] in the second season.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/02/23_physawards.shtml|title=Cosmologist George Smoot meets TV's 'Big Bang' nerds|last=Sanders|first=Robert|date=February 23, 2009|publisher=University of California Berkley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theoretical physics|Theoretical physicist]] [[Brian Greene]] appeared in the fourth season, as well as astrophysicist, science populizer, and [[physics outreach]] specialist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], who also appeared in the twelfth season.

==Recurring themes and elements==

===Science===
Much of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the [[cold open|start of the show]]), and make science-related jokes.

Science has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for [[string theory]] rather than [[loop quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Codpiece Topology|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep19|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 29, 2008|season=2|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time when their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Gorilla Experiment|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep50|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 7, 2009|season=3|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Zazzy Substitution|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep66|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 7, 2010|season=4|number=3|minutes=12:00|quote=I move our relationship terminate immediately}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Saltzberg]], who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-season-6-finale-behind-scenes-set-visit-505624|title='Big Bang Theory': A Behind the Scenes Diary of the Sweet Season 6 Finale|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=May 19, 2013|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/09/tv-fact-checker-big-bang-theory/|title=TV Fact-Checker: Dropping Science on The Big Bang Theory|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|work=Wired|date=September 22, 2011|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;

===Science fiction media===
[[File:6.29.13WilWheatonByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' actor [[Wil Wheaton]] has a recurring role as a fictional version of himself on the show.]]
The four main male characters are all avid [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.

''[[Star Trek]]'' in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of [[Spock]], so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by [[Leonard Nimoy]] as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude ("I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep28|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 15, 2008|season=2|number=11|time=18:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' cast member [[George Takei]] has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' cast members [[Brent Spiner]] and [[LeVar Burton]] have had cameos as themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Russian Rocket Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep92|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2011|season=5|number=5|time=19:48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Toast Derivation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep80|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 24, 2011|season=4|number=17|minutes=20:47}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Wil Wheaton]] has a recurring role as a [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Wil Wheaton|fictionalized version of himself]].

They are also fans of ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In the episode "The Ornithophobia Diffusion", when there is a delay in watching ''Star Wars'' on Blu-ray, Howard complains, "If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in "The Hot Troll Deviation", [[Katee Sackhoff]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'' appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Large Hadron Collision|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep15|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 8, 2010|season=3|number=15|minutes=12:02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="sheldonbegs"&gt;During season 5, episode 21 ("The Hawking Excitation"), Raj states that Sheldon had begged three times before: he begged the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] not to cancel ''Firefly'', he begged [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] to cancel ''Babylon 5'', and when he got food poisoning, he begged a deity he does not believe in to end his life quickly.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak [[Sindarin]], one of the two [[Elvish languages|Elvish]] languages from ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Wednesday night is the group's designated "comic book night"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Hofstadter Isotope|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep20|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=April 13, 2009|season=2|number=20|minutes=1:01}}&lt;/ref&gt; because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spock]], [[Fourth Doctor|The Doctor]], [[Green Lantern]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Middle-Earth Paradigm|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep6|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 29, 2007|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as [[Catwoman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batgirl]], and [[Supergirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Wheaton Recurrence|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep59|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=April 12, 2010|season=3|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]] announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2012/05/04/did-you-notice-sheldon’s-green-lantern-t-shirt-last-night Did You Notice Sheldon's Green Lantern T-Shirt Last Night? | DC Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', [[Donkey Kong]], etc.), including fictional games like ''Mystic Warlords of Ka'a'' (which became a reality in 2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2011/09/23/big-bang-theory-fake-game-turns-real "Big Bang Theory" Fake Game Turns Real], Chris Marlow, Digital Media Wire, September 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock]].

===Leonard and Penny's relationship===
One of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in "[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]".

Penny, who admits to missing Leonard in "[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]", accepts his request to renew their relationship in "[[The Beta Test Initiation]]". After Penny suggests having sex in "The Launch Acceleration", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says "no" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in "The Tangible Affection Proof". In the sixth-season episode, "The 43 Peculiarity", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in "The Bon Voyage Reaction". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode "The Gorilla Dissolution", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.

===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===
In the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In "The Agreement Dissection", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says "fascinating" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition". The same night he draws up "The Relationship Agreement" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his "Roommate Agreement" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.

In the episode "The Launch Acceleration", Amy tries to use her "neurobiology bag of tricks" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode "The Countdown Reflection", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode "The Date Night Variable", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that "it's a possibility" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in "The Love Spell Potential". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.&lt;ref&gt;The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, "The Love Spell Potential.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Locomotive Manipulation" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in "The Prom Equivalency", he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.

In the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.

In the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh season finale.

===Soft Kitty===
{{main|Soft Kitty}}
In the show, the song "Soft Kitty" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill. Its repeated use in the series popularized the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Seidman|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/16/cbs-com-launches-soft-kitty-contest-inspired-by-popular-song-from-cbs-hit-the-big-bang-theory/72269/ |title=CBS.com Launches "Soft Kitty" Contest Inspired by Popular Song From CBS Hit 'The Big Bang Theory' |work=TV by the Numbers |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scene depicting the origin of the song in Sheldon's childhood is depicted in an episode of ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which aired on February 1, 2018. It shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the [[influenza|flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tyler|title='Young Sheldon' reveals the origin story of the 'Soft Kitty' song|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=February 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202032842/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|archivedate=February 2, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard's mother===
In scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by [[Carol Ann Susi]] until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Countdown Reflection|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep24|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24|minutes=19:54}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reflects the [[Jewish mother stereotype]] in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and "grounds" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.&lt;ref name="Episode4.16"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Formulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep16|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 17, 2011|season=4|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Maternal Capacitance|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep15|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 9, 2009|season=2|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Apology Insufficiency|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep7|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=November 4, 2010|season=4|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.

===Apartment building elevator===
In the apartment building where Sheldon, Leonard and Penny (and later Amy) live, the elevator has been out of order throughout the first 11 seasons, forcing characters to have to use the stairs. Stairway conversations between characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition between longer scenes. A season 3 episode reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with rocket fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-Big-Bang-Theory-elevator-be-fixed|title=When will the Big Bang Theory elevator be fixed?|publisher=Quora.com|date=May 2, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vanity cards===
Like most shows created by Chuck Lorre, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ends by showing for one second a [[vanity card]] written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php|title=Chuck Lorre Productions – Vanity Cards|publisher=Chucklorre.com|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Initial reception for the series was mixed. The [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 52% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 23 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Big Bang Theory'' brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''The Big Bang Theory'': Season 1 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-big-bang-theory/s01/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''The Big Bang Theory'': Season 1 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-big-bang-theory |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |first2=Matt |last2=Roush |title=''TV Guide Magazine''{{'}}s 60 Best Series of All Time |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ |website=[[TV Guide]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. standard ratings===
''The Big Bang Theory'' started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=22817|title=CBS opens the new season with a big bang 'The Big Bang Theory' Premieres with its largest audience ever and highest adult 3–12 rating|publisher=Cbspressexpress.com|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–2011 schedule]], to be in direct competition with [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Comedy Block]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[American Idol]]'' (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/cbs-moves-big-bang-theory-thursday-nights-fall-challenge-shows-article-1.463680|title=CBS moves 'The Big Bang Theory' to Thursday nights this fall to 'challenge' other shows|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=July 29, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2013|location=New York|work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. However, in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Modern Family]]''. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707|title=Thursday Finals: 'Big Bang Theory,' 'The X Factor,' 'Parks &amp; Recreation' and 'Whitney' Adjusted Up|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011|author=Seidman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in [[Broadcast syndication#Off-netowork syndication|off-network syndication]], particularly on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], while Michael Schneider of ''[[TV Guide]]'' attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.&lt;ref name=TVGuide1.28.13&gt;Schneider, Michael (January 28, 2013).

By the end of the 2012–13 television season, ''The Big Bang Theory'' had dethroned ''Judge Judy'' as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, ''Judy'' descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/495309-Syndication_Ratings_At_Syndie_Season_s_End_Phil_Judy_ET_Wheel_Big_Bang_on_Top.php |title=Syndication Ratings: At Syndie Season's End, 'Phil,' 'Judy,' 'ET,' 'Wheel,' 'Big Bang' on Top – September 4, 2013 17:41:39 &amp;#124; Broadcasting &amp; Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908075852/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/495309-Syndication_Ratings_At_Syndie_Season_s_End_Phil_Judy_ET_Wheel_Big_Bang_on_Top.php |archivedate=September 8, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Big Bang Theory'' did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013–14 television season, beaten out by ''Judge Judy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/syndication-ratings-judge-judy-years-top-show-while-dr-phil-leads-talk/133634|title=Syndication Ratings: 'Judge Judy' Year's Top Show, While 'Dr. Phil' Leads Talk |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=September 3, 2014|accessdate=September 7, 2014 | first=Paige | last=Albiniak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK distribution and ratings===
The show made its United Kingdom debut on [[Channel 4]] on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes|publisher=Barb.co.uk|date=July 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014705/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011, at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, ''[[Perfect Couples]]''. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a382321/big-bang-theory-returns-to-form-for-e4-with-14m.html|title='Big Bang Theory' returns to form for E4 with 1.4m|website=Digital Spy|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011.

==Offshoots==
===Plagiarized series===
Through the use of his [[Production logo|vanity cards]] at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] by a show produced and aired in [[Belarus]]. Officially titled ''Теоретики'' (''The Theorists''), the show features "clones" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Margaret (February 9, 2010). [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/02/09/big-bang-theory-belarus/ "'The Theorists': 'Big Bang Theory'{{'}}s big Belarusian rip-off"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorre, Chuck]] (February 8, 2010). [http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php?p=277 "Vanity Card #277"]. "The Official Vanity Card Archives". Chuck Lorre Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers canceled it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charter97.org/ru/news/2010/2/18/26493/ "STV canceled the pirated show 'The Theorists'"]. Xaptbir97. February 18, 2010. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, "Seva") said in an interview, "I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of ''The Big Bang Theory'' started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show".&lt;ref&gt;[http://charter97.org/ru/news/2010/2/12/26330/ "'The Theorists' actors don't want to stay with a stolen project"]. Xaptbir97. April 28, 2017. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Young Sheldon}}Spin-off series===
{{main|Young Sheldon}}

In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of ''The Big Bang Theory'' centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as "a ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''-esque [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] family comedy" would be executive-produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the [[2017–18 United States network television schedule|2017–18 season]] alongside ''The Big Bang Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/the-big-bang-theory-sheldon-spinoff-prequel-series-cbs-1201849838/|title='The Big Bang Theory' Eyes Young Sheldon Spinoff Prequel Series On CBS|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-sheldon-prequel-series-works-at-cbs-944826|title='Big Bang Theory' Sheldon Prequel Series in the Works at CBS|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers.&lt;ref name="YoungSheldonCast" /&gt; In early March 2017, [[Iain Armitage]] was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory''.&lt;ref name="YoungSheldonCast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/the-big-bang-theory-sheldon-spinoff-iain-armitage-zoe-perry-cast-1202034391/|title='Big Bang' Sheldon Spinoff Inches Closer With Iain Armitage &amp; Zoe Perry Castings|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 2, 2017|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off ''Young Sheldon'' series. [[Jon Favreau]] directed and executive produced the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, [[Lance Barber]] stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and [[Montana Jordan]] as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/young-sheldon-spinoff-prequel-the-big-bang-theory-cbs-series-order-cast-jon-favreau-chuck-lorre-steven-molaro-1202042417/|title='The Big Bang Theory' Spinoff 'Young Sheldon' Gets CBS Series Order, Rounds Out Cast; Jon Favreau Set To Direct|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 13, 2017|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's pilot episode premiered on September 25, 2017.

[[File:MongolsBesiegingACityInTheMiddleEast13thCentury.jpg|thumb|300px|13th century depiction of Mongols using a counterweight trebuchet]]

A '''trebuchet'''{{refn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|b|ə|ʃ|ɛ|t}} {{respell|TREB|ə-shet}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|r|ɛ|b|j|ʊ|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|t}} {{respell|TREB|yuu|SHET}};&lt;ref&gt;OED, Random House Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled '''trebucket''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|iː|b|ʌ|k|ɪ|t}} {{respell|TREE|buk|it}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|r|ɛ|b|j|ʊ|ˈ|k|ɛ|t}} {{respell|TREB|yuu|KET}}&lt;ref&gt;Random House Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} (French ''trébuchet'') is a type of [[catapult]],{{sfn|Janin|2014|p=41}} a common type of [[siege engine]] which uses a swinging arm to throw a projectile.

The '''traction trebuchet''', also referred to as a [[mangonel]] at times, first appeared in Ancient China during the 4th century BC as a siege weapon. It spread westward, probably by the Avars, and was adopted by the Byzantines in the mid 6th century AD. It uses manpower to swing the arm.

The later '''counterweight trebuchet''', also known as the '''counterpoise trebuchet''', uses a counterweight to swing the arm. It appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the 12th century, and made its way back to China via Mongol conquests in the 13th century.

== Basic design ==
[[File:Trebuchet2.png|thumb|Side view of counterweight trebuchet]]

The trebuchet is a [[compound machine]] that makes use of the [[mechanical advantage]] of a [[lever]] to throw a projectile. They are typically large constructions (up to {{convert|30|m|-1|sp=us}} in height or more) made primarily of wood, usually reinforced with metal, leather, rope, and other materials. They are usually immobile and must be assembled on-site, possibly making use of local lumber with only key parts brought with the army to the site of the siege or battle.

A trebuchet consists primarily of a long beam attached by an [[axle]] suspended high above the ground by a stout frame and base, such that the beam can rotate vertically through a wide arc (typically over 180°). A [[sling (weapon)|sling]] is attached to one end of the beam to hold the projectile. The projectile is thrown when the beam is quickly rotated by applying [[force]] to the opposite end of the beam. The mechanical advantage is primarily obtained by having the projectile end of the beam much longer than the opposite end where the force is applied – usually four to six times longer.{{sfn|Saimre|2007|p=65}}

Counterweight trebuchets are powered by gravity; [[potential energy]] is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached by a hinged connection to the shorter end of the beam, and releasing it on command. Traction trebuchets are human powered; on command, men pull ropes attached to the shorter end of the trebuchet beam. The difficulties of coordinating the pull of many men together repeatedly and predictably makes counterweight trebuchets preferable for the larger machines, though they are more complicated to engineer.{{sfn|Saimre|2007|p=64}} Further increasing their complexity is that either [[winch]]es or [[treadwheel]]s, aided by [[block and tackle]], are typically required to raise the more massive counterweights. So while counterweight trebuchets require significantly fewer men to operate than traction trebuchets, they require significantly more time to reload. In a long siege, reload time may not be a critical concern.

When the trebuchet is loosed, the force causes [[rotational acceleration]] of the beam around the axle (the [[:wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] of the lever). These factors multiply the acceleration transmitted to the throwing portion of the beam and its attached sling. The sling starts rotating with the beam, but rotates farther (typically about 360°) and therefore faster, transmitting this increased speed to the projectile. The length of the sling increases the mechanical advantage, and also changes the [[trajectory]] so that, at the time of release from the sling, the projectile is traveling in the desired [[Ballistics|speed and angle]] to give it the range to hit the target. Adjusting the sling's release point is the primary means of fine-tuning the range, as the rest of the trebuchet's actions are difficult to adjust after construction.

The rotation speed of the throwing beam increases smoothly until it reaches maximum rotation speed. Then the arm continues to rotate, slowing, coming to rest at the end of the rotation rather smoothly as momentum is transferred to the sling and its projectile. This is unlike the violent sudden stop inherent in the action of other siege engine designs such as the [[Onager (weapon)|onager]], which loses energy thereby. This key difference also makes the trebuchet much more durable, allowing for larger and more powerful machines.

A trebuchet projectile can be almost anything, even debris, corpses, or [[Early thermal weapons|incendiaries]], but is typically a large stone. Dense stone, or even metal, specially worked to be round and smooth, gives the best range and predictability. When attempting to breach enemy walls, it is important to use materials that will not shatter on impact; projectiles were sometimes brought from distant quarries to get the desired properties.{{sfn|Saimre|2007|p=73}}

==History==

[[File:Wheeled trebuchet wjzy.jpg|thumb|Wheeled whirlwind traction trebuchet from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]''.]]

=== Traction trebuchet ===
{{see also|Chinese siege weapons}} 
The traction trebuchet, also referred to as a [[mangonel]] in some sources, is thought to have originated in ancient China.&lt;ref name="Chevedden"&gt;Chevedden, Paul E.; et al. (July 1995). "The Trebuchet". Scientific American: 66–71. [http://static.sewanee.edu/physics/PHYSICS103/trebuchet.pdf. Original version.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trebuchet&gt;[http://www.medievalists.net/2013/01/13/the-trebuchet/ The Trebuchet], Citation: "The trebuchet, invented in China between the fifth and third centuries B.C.E., reached the Mediterranean by the sixth century C.E. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAUL&gt;Paul E. Chevedden, [http://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/dumbarton-oaks-papers/dop54/dp54ch4.pdf The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610032737/http://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/dumbarton-oaks-papers/dop54/dp54ch4.pdf |date=2014-06-10 }}, pp. 71, 74, See citation:"The traction trebuchet, invented by the Chinese sometime before the fourth century B.C." in p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Torsion-based siege weapons such as the [[ballista]] and [[onager (weapon)|onager]] are not known to have been used in China.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=86}}

The first recorded use of traction trebuchets was in ancient China. They were probably used by the [[Mohist]]s as early as 4th century BC, descriptions of which can be found in the [[Mozi|''Mojing'']] (compiled in the 4th century BC).&lt;ref name=Trebuchet/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAUL/&gt; In Chapter 14 of the ''Mojing'', the traction trebuchet is described hurling hollowed out logs filled with burning charcoal at enemy troops.{{sfn|Liang|2006}} The trebuchet was carried westward by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and appeared next in the eastern Mediterranean by the late 6th century AD, where it replaced torsion powered siege engines such as the ballista and onager due to its simpler design and faster rate of fire.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=366}}&lt;ref name="Chevedden"/&gt;{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=141}} The Byzantines adopted the traction trebuchet possibly as early as 587, the Persians in the early 7th century, and the Arabs in the second half of the 7th century.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=86}} The [[Franks]] and [[Saxons]] adopted the weapon in the 8th century.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=367}}

{{quotation|The catapult, the account of which has been translated from the Greek several times, was quadrangular, with a wide base but narrowing towards the top, using large iron rollers to which were fixed timber beams "similar to the beams of big
houses", having at the back a sling, and at the front thick cables, enabling the arm to be raised and lowered, and which threw "enormous blocks into the air with a terrifying noise".{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=30}}|Peter Purton}}

West of China, the traction trebuchet remained the primary siege weapon until the 12th century when it was replaced by the counterweight trebuchet.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=29}} In China the traction trebuchet continued to be used until the counterweight trebuchet was introduced during the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]]. In 617 [[Li Mi (Sui dynasty)]] constructed 300 trebuchets for his assault on [[Luoyang]], in 621 [[Li Shimin]] did the same at Luoyang, and onward into the [[Song dynasty]] when in 1161, trebuchets operated by [[Song dynasty]] soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur against the ships of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] navy during the [[Battle of Caishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Military technology: The Gunpowder Epic, Volume 5, Part 7|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Herbert|last=Franke|editor=Denis C.

====Terminology====
The term "traction trebuchet" is a modern invention and was not used by contemporary users of the weapon. The term was created mainly to distinguish it from the ''onager'', a torsion powered artillery weapon which is often confused with another name for the traction trebuchet, the ''mangonel'', a generic medieval term for stone throwing artillery. Confusion between the onager and mangonel in terminology has led some historians today to use ''traction trebuchet'' instead.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=365}}{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=410}} The mangonel is called ''al-manjanīq'' in Arabic. In China the traction trebuchet was called the ''pào'' (砲).{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=411}}

&lt;/center&gt;

=== Hand-trebuchet ===
The hand-trebuchet ({{lang-el|cheiromangana}}) was a [[fustibalus|staff sling]] mounted on a pole using a [[lever]] mechanism to propel projectiles. Basically a one-man traction trebuchet, it was used by emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] around 965 to disrupt enemy formations in the open field. It was also mentioned in the [[Tactica of Nikephoros Ouranos|Taktika]] of general [[Nikephoros Ouranos]] (c. 1000), and listed in ''De obsidione toleranda'' (author anonymous) as a form of artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid trebuchet===
According to Paul E. Chevedden, a hybrid trebuchet existed that used both counterweight and human propulsion. However no illustrations or descriptions of the device exist from the time when they were supposed to have been used. The entire argument for the existence of hybrid trebuchets rests on accounts of increasingly more effective siege weapons. Peter Purton suggests that this was simply because the machines became larger. The earliest depiction of a hybrid trebuchet is dated to 1462, when trebuchets had already become obsolete due to cannons.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=382}}

=== Counterweight trebuchet ===


The earliest known description and illustration of a counterweight trebuchet comes from a commentary on the conquests of [[Saladin]] by [[Mardi ibn Ali al-Tarsusi]] in 1187.&lt;ref name="Bradbury 1992"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bradbury |first= Jim |title= The Medieval Siege |publisher= The Boydell Press |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-85115-312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/weaponry-the-trebuchet.htm |title=Arms and Men: The Trebuchet |publisher=Historynet.com |accessdate=2016-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest solid reference to counterweight trebuchets in European sources dates to the siege of [[Castelnuovo Bocca d'Adda]] in 1199. They were used in [[Germany]] from around 1205, in [[England]] at least by 1217, and in [[Iberia]] shortly after 1218. By the 1230s the counterweight trebuchet was a common item in siege warfare.{{sfn|Purton|2009|p=387}}

Paul E. Chevedden argues that counterweight trebuchets appeared even earlier in Europe based on what might have been counterweight trebuchets in earlier sources. The 12th century [[Byzantine]] historian [[Niketas Choniates]] may have been referring to a counterweight trebuchet when he described one equipped with a [[windlass]], which is only useful to counterweight machines, at the siege of Zevgminon in 1165.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Siege of Nicaea]] in 1097 the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] reportedly invented new pieces of heavy artillery which deviated from the conventional design and made a deep impression on everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|pp=76–86; 110f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible references to counterweight trebuchets also appear for the [[Venetian Crusade#Siege of Tyre|second siege of Tyre in 1124]], where the crusaders reportedly made use of "great trebuchets".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chevedden argues that given the references to new and better trebuchets that by the 1120–30s, the counterweight trebuchet was being used in a variety of places by different peoples such as the crusader states, the [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Normans of Sicily]] and the [[Seljuks]].&lt;ref name="Chevedden 2000, 104f."&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|pp=104f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterweight trebuchets do not appear with certainty in Chinese historical records until about 1268 when the Mongols laid siege to Fancheng and Xiangyang. After failing to take the twin cities of Fancheng and Xiangyang for several years, collectively known as the [[Battle of Xiangyang|Siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang]], the [[Mongol]] army brought in two Persian engineers to build hinged counterweight trebuchets. Known as the Huihui trebuchet (回回砲, where "[[Hui people|huihui]]" is a loose slang referring to any Muslims), or Xiangyang trebuchet (襄陽砲) because they were first encountered in that battle. [[Ismail (mangonel expert)|Ismail]] and [[Al al-Din|Al-aud-Din]] arrived travelled to South China from [[Iraq]] and mangonels and trebuchets for the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOiGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=These+siege+engines+could+accurately+lob+huge+missiles+capable+of+demolishing+stone+castles+and+they+quickly+knocked+down+Xianyang%27s+mud+walls&amp;q=xianyang+foreign+engineers+persia+mangonels+catapults|title=City of heavenly tranquility: Beijing in the history of China|author=Jasper Becker|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=978-0195309973|page=64|pages=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese and Muslim engineers operated artillery and siege engines for the Mongol armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=mongols+chinese+general+baghdad#v=snippet&amp;q=chinese%20engines%20artillery%20chinese%20muslim%20engineers&amp;f=false|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia|author=René Grousset|year=1970|publisher=Rutgers University Press|edition=reprint|location=|isbn=978-0813513041|page=283|pages=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterweight trebuchet, known as the Muslim trebuchet in China, replaced the traction version after its introduction in the late 13th century. Its greater range was however, somewhat countered by the fact that it had to be constructed close to the site of the siege unlike traction trebuchets, which were easier to take apart and put back together again where necessary.{{sfn|Turnbull|2001|p=33}}

The counterweight trebuchet remained in use in China for roughly two centuries, at which point it was well on its way to obsolescence.{{sfn|Turnbull|2001|p=36}}

===Couillard===
The '''couillard''' is a smaller version of a counterweight trebuchet with a single frame instead of the usual double "A" frames. The counterweight is split into two halves to avoid hitting the center frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehurricanesracing.com/trebuchet.docx.html|title = Trebuchet Design Factors|date = 19 May 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Max|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150604144937/http://www.thehurricanesracing.com/trebuchet.docx.html|archivedate = 4 June 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of military use===
With the introduction of [[gunpowder]], the trebuchet began to lose its place as the siege engine of choice to the [[cannon]]. Trebuchets were still used both at the [[Siege of Burgos (1475)|siege of Burgos]] (1475–1476) and [[siege of Rhodes (1480)|siege of Rhodes]] (1480). One of the last recorded military uses was by [[Hernán Cortés]], at the 1521 [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|siege of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán]]. Accounts of the attack note that its use was motivated by the limited supply of gunpowder. The attempt was reportedly unsuccessful: the first projectile landed on the trebuchet itself, destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
[[File:Couillard-Calmont d olt.jpg|thumb|300px|A couillard]]

===Recreation and education===

Most trebuchet use in recent centuries has been for recreational or educational, rather than military purposes. New machines have been constructed and old ones restored by [[living history]] enthusiasts, for [[historical re-enactment]]s, and use in other historical celebrations. As their construction is substantially simpler than modern weapons, trebuchets also serve as the object of engineering challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelep.org.uk/teachers/events/view/54 |title=Thelep.org.uk |publisher=Thelep.org.uk |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052819/http://www.thelep.org.uk/teachers/events/view/54 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.wright.edu/trebuchet/ |title=Wright.edu |publisher=Engineering.wright.edu |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trebuchet's technical constructions were lost at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1984, the French engineer Renaud Beffeyte made the first modern reconstruction of a trebuchet, based on documents from 1324.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armedieval.fr|title=armedieval - le trebuchet et les machines civiles et militaires médiévales|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest currently-functioning trebuchet in the world is the 22-tonne machine at [[Warwick Castle]], England, constructed in 2005. Based on historical designs, it stands {{convert|18|m}} tall and throws missiles typically 36&amp;nbsp;kg (80&amp;nbsp;lbs) up to {{convert|300|m}}. The trebuchet gained significant interest from numerous news sources when in 2015 a burning missile fired from the siege engine struck and damaged a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era]] [[boathouse]] situated at the River Avon close by, inadvertently demonstrating the weapon's power. It is built on the design of a similar trebuchet at [[Middelaldercentret]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name="reconstruct"&gt;June 14, 2005 [http://archive.archaeology.org/online/interviews/vemming/index.html Reconstructing Medieval Artillery]. archive.archaeology.org. Retrieved 12 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Middelaldercentret became the first place in the modern era to have a working trebuchet.&lt;ref name="reconstruct"/&gt;

Trebuchets compete in one of the classifications of machines used to hurl pumpkins at the annual [[pumpkin chucking]] contest held in [[Sussex County, Delaware]], U.S. The record-holder in that contest for trebuchets is the Yankee Siege II from [[New Hampshire]], which at the 2013 WCPC Championship tossed a pumpkin 2835.8&amp;nbsp;ft (864.35 metres). The {{convert|51|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, {{convert|55000|lb|adj=on}} trebuchet flings the standard {{convert|8|-|10|lb|adj=on}} pumpkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkinchunkin.com/current-world-record |title=World Championship Punkin Chunkin – Current World Records |publisher=punkinchunkin.com |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; specified for all entries in the WCPC competition.

A large trebuchet has recently been tested in Belfast as part of the set for the television series ''Game of Thrones.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://winteriscoming.net/2017/11/06/game-thrones-season-8-filming-trebuchet-tested-titanic-studios/ |title=Season 8 Filming: Watch a trebuchet test at Titanic Studios |publisher=winteriscoming.net |accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments===
Although rarely used as a weapon today, trebuchets maintain the interest of professional and hobbyist engineers. One modern technological development, especially for the competitive pumpkin-hurling events, is the "[[Floating arm trebuchet|floating arms]]" design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=November 24, 2010 |title=Punkin Chunkin 2010- Tired Iron |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmZHnqhOHcs |access-date=March 7, 2015 |format=Youtube |time=1:17 |location=Hancock, NH |publisher=The Science Channel |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using the traditional axle fixed to a frame, these devices are mounted on wheels that roll on a track parallel to the ground, with a counterweight that falls directly downward upon release, allowing for greater efficiency by increasing the proportion of energy transferred to the projectile.&lt;ref name=FAT&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trebuchet.com/firstfat | title = The Original Floating Arm Trebuchet | website = Trebuchet.com | location = New Braunfels, TX | author = RLT Industries | accessdate = May 3, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100503211719/http://www.trebuchet.com/firstfat | archivedate = May 3, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in activism and insurgency===
In 2013, during the [[Syrian civil war]], rebels were filmed using a trebuchet in the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2013)|Battle of Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmKCWjh-FZM|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trebuchet was used to project explosives at government troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qYdCHtJIho|title=Syrian opposition use medieval 'trebuchet' to launch bombs |date=22 February 2013|publisher=Truthloader|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, during the [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots|Hrushevskoho street riots]] in Ukraine, rioters used an improvised trebuchet to throw bricks and [[molotov cocktails]] at the [[Berkut (special police force)|Berkut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/ukrainian-protesters-built-a-giant-catapult-to-fight-the-rio|title=Ukrainian Protesters Built A Giant Catapult To Fight The Riot Police|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=20 January 2014|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13676">[[image:General Microwave VCO.png|thumb|right|A microwave (12–18{{nbsp}}GHz) voltage-controlled oscillator]]
A '''voltage-controlled oscillator''' ('''VCO''') is an [[electronic oscillator]] whose [[oscillation]] [[frequency]] is controlled by a [[voltage]] input. The applied input voltage determines the instantaneous oscillation frequency.  Consequently, a VCO can be used for [[frequency modulation]] (FM) or [[phase modulation]] (PM) by applying a [[modulation|modulating]] signal to the control input.  A VCO is also an integral part of a [[phase-locked loop]].

A '''voltage-to-frequency converter''' ('''VFC''') is a special type of VCO designed to be very linear in frequency control over a wide range of input control voltages.

==Types of VCO==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
VCOs can be generally categorized into two groups based on the type of waveform produced.

* ''Linear'' or ''[[harmonic oscillator]]s'' generate a sinusoidal waveform.  Harmonic oscillators in electronics usually consist of a resonator with an amplifier that replaces the resonator losses (to prevent the amplitude from decaying) and isolates the resonator from the output (so the load does not affect the resonator). Some examples of harmonic oscillators are [[LC oscillator]]s and [[crystal oscillator]]s. In a voltage-controlled oscillator, a voltage input controls the resonant frequency. A [[varactor diode]]'s capacitance is controlled by the voltage across the diode. Varactor is used to change the capacitance (and hence the frequency) of an LC tank. A varactor can also change loading on a crystal resonator and pull its resonant frequency.
* ''[[Relaxation oscillator]]s'' can generate a sawtooth or triangular waveform. They are commonly used in [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs). They can provide a wide range of operational frequencies with a minimal number of external components.

==Frequency control==
[[File:Voltage controlled oscillator.svg|thumb|350px|right|Schematic of an audio-frequency voltage-controlled oscillator]]

A voltage-controlled capacitor is one method of making an LC oscillator vary its frequency in response to a control voltage. Any reverse-biased [[semiconductor diode]] displays a measure of voltage-dependent capacitance and can be used to change the frequency of an oscillator by varying a control voltage applied to the diode.  Special-purpose variable-capacitance [[varactor]] diodes are available with well-characterized wide-ranging values of capacitance. 

For low-frequency VCOs, other methods of varying the frequency (such as altering the charging rate of a capacitor by means of a voltage controlled [[current source]]) are used (see [[function generator]]).

The frequency of a [[ring oscillator]] is controlled by varying either the supply voltage, the current available to each inverter stage,  or the capacitive loading on each stage.

===Phase-domain equations===
&lt;!-- this is still messed up --&gt;
VCOs are used in analog applications such as [[frequency modulation]] and [[frequency-shift keying]]. The functional relationship between the control voltage and the output frequency for a VCO (especially those used at [[radio frequency]]) may not be linear, but over small ranges, the relationship is approximately linear, and linear control theory can be used. A voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) is a special type of VCO designed to be very linear over a wide range of input voltages.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

Modeling for VCOs is often not concerned with the amplitude or shape (sinewave, triangle wave, sawtooth) but rather its instantaneous phase. In effect, the focus is not on the time-domain signal {{math|''A'' sin(''&amp;omega;t''+''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} but rather the argument of the sine function (the phase). Consequently, modeling is often done in the phase domain.

The instananeous frequency of a VCO is often modeled as a linear relationship with its instantaneous control voltage. The output phase of the oscillator is the integral of the instantaneous frequency.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       f(t) &amp;= f_0 + K_0 \cdot \ v_\text{in}(t) \\
  \theta(t) &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^t f(\tau)\,d\tau \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator at time {{mvar|t}} (not the waveform amplitude)
::* &lt;math&gt;f_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the quiescent frequency of the oscillator (not the waveform amplitude)
::* &lt;math&gt;K_0 &lt;/math&gt; is called the oscillator sensitivity, or gain. Its units are hertz per volt.
::* &lt;math&gt;f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the VCO's frequency
::* &lt;math&gt;\theta(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the VCO's output phase
::* &lt;math&gt;v_\text{in}(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the time-domain control input or tuning voltage of the VCO

For analyzing a control system, the Laplace transforms of the above signals are useful.&lt;!-- missing impulse; scaling wrong; need to move constant --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       F(s) &amp;= K_0 \cdot \ V_\text{in}(s) \\
  \Theta(s) &amp;= {F(s) \over s} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

==VCO design and circuits==
Tuning range, tuning gain and phase noise are the important characteristics of a VCO. Generally low phase noise is preferred in the VCO. The noise present in the control signal and the tuning gain affect the phase noise; high noise or high tuning gain imply more phase noise. Other important elements that determine the phase noise are the transistor's [[flicker noise]] (1/''f'' noise),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=product&amp;prd=481 Wideband VCO] from [[Herley Industries|Herley - General Microwave]] - "For optimum performance, the active element used is a silicon bipolar transistor. (This is in lieu of GaAs FETs which typically exhibit 10-20 dB poorer phase noise performance)"&lt;/ref&gt; the output power level, and the loaded Q of the resonator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rhea |first=Randall W. |title=Oscillator Design &amp; Computer Simulation |edition=Second |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-052415-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Leeson's equation]]). The low frequency flicker noise affects the phase noise because the flicker noise is heterodyned to the oscillator output frequency due to the active devices non-linear transfer function. The effect of flicker noise can be reduced with negative feedback that linearizes the transfer function (for example, [[common emitter#Emitter degeneration|emitter degeneration]]).

Leeson's expression&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Leeson |first= D. B. |title=A Simple Model of Feedback Oscillator Noise Spectrum |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=February 1966 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=329&amp;ndash;330 |doi=10.1109/PROC.1966.4682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for single-sideband (SSB) phase noise in dBc/Hz (decibels relative to output level per Hertz) is&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhea|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the output frequency, Q&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is the loaded Q, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the offset from the output frequency (Hz), ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the 1/''f'' corner frequency, ''F'' is the noise factor of the amplifier&lt;!-- check --&gt;, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature in Kelvins, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the oscillator output power.

Commonly used VCO circuits are the [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] and [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]] oscillators. The more widely used oscillator of the two is Colpitts and these oscillators are very similar in configuration.

VCOs generally have the lowest [[Q-factor]] of the used oscillators, and so suffer more jitter than the other types.  The jitter can be made low enough for many applications (such as driving an ASIC), in which case VCOs enjoy the advantages of having no off-chip components (expensive) or on-chip inductors (low yields on generic CMOS processes).  These oscillators also have larger tuning ranges than the other kinds, which improves yield and is sometimes a feature of the end product (for instance, the dot clock on a graphics card which drives a wide range of monitors).

=== Voltage-controlled crystal oscillators ===
[[File:Skymaster DT 500 - TLSI T73227-91730.jpg|thumb|27{{nbsp}}MHz VCXO clock generator IC (TLSI T73227), used in a [[DVB-T]] set-top box.]]
A clock generator is an oscillator that provides a timing signal to synchronize operations in digital circuits. VCXO clock generators are used in many areas such as digital TV, modems, transmitters and computers. Design parameters for a VCXO clock generator are tuning voltage range, center frequency, frequency tuning range and the timing jitter of the output signal. Jitter is a form of [[phase noise]] that must be minimised in applications such as radio receivers, transmitters and measuring equipment.

A ''voltage-controlled [[crystal oscillator]]'' (''VCXO'') is used for fine adjustment of the operating frequency. The frequency of a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator can be varied a few tens of parts per million (ppm) over a control voltage range of typically 0 to 3 volts, because the high [[Q factor]] of the crystals allows "pulling" over only a small range of frequencies. When a wider selection of clock frequencies is needed the VCXO output can be passed through digital divider circuits to obtain lower frequencies or be fed to a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL). ICs containing both a VCXO (for external crystal) and a PLL are available. A typical application is to provide clock frequencies in a range from 12&amp;nbsp;kHz to 96&amp;nbsp;kHz to an audio [[digital-to-analog converter]].

There are two reasons for using a VCXO:
* To adjust the output frequency to match or perhaps be some exact multiple of an accurate external reference.
* Where the oscillator drives equipment that may generate radio-frequency interference, adding a varying voltage to its control input can disperse the interference spectrum to make it less objectionable (see [[spread spectrum clock]]).
[[File:SMD Cystal Oscillator TCXO.png|miniature|thumb|A 26{{nbsp}}MHz TCVCXO]] 
A ''temperature-compensated VCXO'' (TCVCXO) incorporates components that partially correct the dependence on temperature of the [[resonance|resonant frequency]] of the crystal. A smaller range of voltage control then suffices to stabilize the oscillator frequency in applications where [[temperature]] varies, such as [[heat]] buildup inside a [[transmitter]].

Placing the oscillator in a temperature-controlled "oven" at a constant but higher-than-ambient temperature is another way to stabilize oscillator frequency. High stability crystal oscillator references often place the crystal in an oven and use a voltage input for fine control.&lt;ref&gt;For example, an HP/Agilent 10811 reference oscillator&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature is selected to be the ''turnover temperature'': the temperature where small changes do not affect the resonance. The control voltage can be used to occasionally adjust the reference frequency to a [[NIST]] source. Sophisticated designs may also adjust the control voltage over time to compensate for crystal aging.&lt;!-- quadratic curve fit of frequency drift.

== Applications ==
VCOs are used in [[function generator]]s, [[phase-locked loop]]s including [[frequency synthesizer]]s used in communication equipment and the production of [[electronic music]], to generate variable tones in [[synthesizer]]s.

Function generators are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, square, and triangle waves. Monolithic function generators are voltage-controlled.

Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in [[phase-locked loop]]s for radio receivers. Phase noise is the most important specification in this application.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Audio frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, sweep range, linearity, and distortion are often the most important specs. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, [[digitally controlled oscillator]]s (DCOs), due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. From the 1990s on, pure software is the primary sound-generating method, but VCOs have become popular again often thanks to their imperfections.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Voltage-to-frequency converters are voltage-controlled oscillators with a highly linear relation between applied voltage and frequency.  They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a digital signal for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. VCOs in this application may have sine or square wave outputs.

The WDR paper computer or Know-How computer  was a "computer" that could be easily assembled from a sheet of paper and individual matches. This would allow anyone interested to learn how to program without having an electronic computer at their disposal. Thus, this "computer" served as an educational aid in the field of computer science. The know-how computer was developed by Wolfgang Back and Ulrich Rohde and first presented in the television program [[WDR Computerclub]] in 1983.

He was also published in [[Germany|German]] magazines [[MC (magazine)|MC]] and {{ill|PC Magazin|de}}.

The "computer" worked on paper; Matches were used as information units. Only five commands were enough to represent all mathematical functions. This exercise computer on paper was sent in over 400,000 copies and belonged at that time to the computers with the widest circulation. An implementation as a computer program is available on Wolfgang Back's website.

The method of operation is based on [[register machine]], but is more to the approach of Shepherdson and Sturgis.

A derived version of the "Paper Computer" is used as a "know how computer" in [[Namibia|Namibian]] school education.

'''Walter Bradford Cannon''' (October 19, 1871 – October 1, 1945) was an American [[physiologist]], professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at [[Harvard Medical School]]. He coined the term [[fight or flight response]], and he expanded on [[Claude Bernard]]'s concept of [[homeostasis]]. He popularized his theories in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'', first published in 1932. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Cannon as the 81st most cited scholar of the 20th century in technical psychology journals, introductory psychology textbooks, and survey responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/steven.haggbloom/Table4.htm|last=Haggbloom|first=Steven J.|title=Steven J. Haggbloom - Psychology - WKU|publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Cannon was born on October 19, 1871 in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the son of Colbert Hanschett Cannon and his wife Wilma Denio.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''The Way of an Investigator'', Cannon counts himself among the descendents of [[Jacques de Noyon]], a [[French Canadian]] explorer and [[coureur des bois]]. His [[Calvinist]] family was intellectually active, including readings from [[James Martineau]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)]], and [[James Freeman Clarke]]. Cannon's curiosity also led him to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Tyndall]], [[George Henry Lewes]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]].&lt;ref&gt;''Way of an Investigator'', pp. 16–7&lt;/ref&gt;  A high school teacher, Mary Jeannette Newson, became his [[mentorship|mentor]]. "Miss May" Newson motivated and helped him take his academic skills to [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul Benison, A. Clifford Barger, Elin L. Wolfe (1987) ''Walter B. Cannon: the Life and Times of a Young Scientist''. pp.16–32, [[Belknap Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, his first year at Harvard Medical School, he started working in [[Henry Pickering Bowditch|Bowditch's Lab]],&lt;ref name= "APS"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/presidents/introwbc.html |title=Walter Bradford Cannon |publisher=[[American Physiological Society]] |website=Presidents |accessdate=22 March 2015 |quote=6th APS President (1914-1916) }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1900 he received his medical degree.

After graduation, Cannon was hired by [[William Townsend Porter]] at Harvard as an instructor in the Department of Physiology.&lt;ref name="aps"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barger|first1=A. Clifford|title=William Townsend Porter|url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Education/Minority-Program/Educational-Projects/Porter-Physiology-Development-Fellowship/About-the-Porter-Fellowship/Porter-Physiology-Development-History.pdf|website=American Physiological Society|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of the physicist [[G. W. Pierce]]; they founded the [[Wicht Club]] with other young instructors for social and professional purposes. In 1906 Cannon became Higginson Professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at [[Harvard Medical School]], a position he held until 1942. From 1914 to 1916 he was also President of the [[American Physiological Society]].&lt;ref name= "APS"/&gt;

He was married to [[Cornelia James Cannon]], a best-selling author and feminist reformer. Although not mountaineers, during their honeymoon in Montana the couple were the first, on July 19, 1901, to reach the summit of the unclimbed southwest peak (2657 m or 8716&amp;nbsp;ft) of Goat Mountain, between [[Lake McDonald]] and [[Logan Pass]] in what is now [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]. The peak was subsequently named [[Mount Cannon]] by the [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.summitpost.org/mount-cannon-mt/152331 | title=Mount Cannon (MT) | publisher=SummitPost | date=June 19, 2011 | accessdate=May 10, 2012 | author=Fred Spicker, Moni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had five children. One son was Dr. [[Bradford Cannon]], a military plastic surgeon and radiation researcher. The daughters are Wilma Cannon Fairbank (Mrs. [[John K. Fairbank]]), Linda Cannon Burgess, Helen Cannon Bond and [[Marian Cannon Schlesinger]], a painter and author living in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Walter Cannon died on October 1, 1945 in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dr. W.B. Cannon, 73, Neurologist, Dead.

== Work ==
[[File:Walter Bradford Cannon2.jpg|thumb|270px|Walter Bradford Cannon]]
Walter Cannon began his career in science as a Harvard undergraduate in the year 1892. [[Henry Pickering Bowditch]], who had worked with [[Claude Bernard]], directed the laboratory in physiology at Harvard. Here Cannon began his research: he used the newly discovered [[X rays]] to study the mechanism of swallowing and the [[motility]] of the [[stomach]]. He demonstrated [[deglutition]] in a goose at the APS meeting in December 1896 and published his first paper on this research in the first issue of the ''American Journal of Physiology'' in January 1898.&lt;ref name= "APS"/&gt;

In 1945 Cannon summarized his career in physiology by describing his focus at different ages:&lt;ref&gt;On page 218 of his book ''The Way of an Investigator'',&lt;/ref&gt;
* Age 26 – 40: digestion and the [[bismuth]] meal
* Age 40 – 46: bodily effects of emotional excitement
* Age 46 – 51: wound shock investigations
* Age 51 – 59: stable states of the organism
* Age 59 – 68: chemical mediation of nerve impulses (collaboration with [[Arturo Rosenblueth]])
* Age 68 + : chemical sensitivity of nerve-isolated organs

=== Scientific contributions ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
;Use of salts of heavy metals in X-Rays
:He was one of the first researchers to mix [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[heavy metals]] (including [[bismuth]] subnitrate, bismuth oxychloride, and [[barium]] sulfate) into foodstuffs in order to improve the contrast of [[X-ray]] images of the digestive tract. The [[barium meal]] is a modern derivative of this research.

;Fight or flight
:In 1915, he coined the term ''[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]'' to describe an animal's response to threats in ''Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage: An Account of Recent Researches into the Function of Emotional Excitement''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cannon |first1=Walter |title=Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage: An Account of Recent Researches Into the Function of Emotional Excitement |date=2010 |publisher=FQ Legacy Books |pages=326 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Bodily-Changes-Pain-Hunger-Fear/dp/B004QO9W00}}&lt;/ref&gt; . He asserted that [http://www.brainimmune.com/walter-cannon-homeostasis-the-fight-or-flight-response-the-sympathoadrenal-system-and-the-wisdom-of-the-body/ not only physical emergencies, such as blood loss from trauma, but also psychological emergencies], such as antagonistic encounters between members of the same species, evoke release of adrenaline into the bloodstream. 
As per Cannon, adrenaline exerts several important effects in different body organs, all of which, from Cannon’s point of view, maintain homeostasis in fight-or-flight situations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldstein |first1=David |title=Walter Cannon: Homeostasis, the Fight-or-Flight Response, the Sympathoadrenal System, and the Wisdom of the Body. |url=http://www.brainimmune.com/walter-cannon-homeostasis-the-fight-or-flight-response-the-sympathoadrenal-system-and-the-wisdom-of-the-body/ |website=BrainImmune}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in the skeletal muscle of the limbs, adrenaline relaxes blood vessels, increasing local blood flow. Adrenaline constricts blood vessels in the skin, minimizing blood loss from physical trauma. Adrenaline also releases the key metabolic fuel, glucose, by the liver into the bloodstream, etc. 
However, the fact that aggressive attack and fearful escape both involve adrenaline release into the bloodstream does not imply an equivalence of “fight” with “flight” from a physiological or biochemical point of view. 

;Wound shock
:As a military physician in World War I he discovered that the blood of shocked men was acidic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Kloot |first1=William |title=William Maddock Bayliss's therapy for wound shock |journal=Not. Rec. Roy. Soc. |date=2010 |volume=64 |pages=271-286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a member of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|British Medical Research Council's]] Special Committee on Shock and Allied Conditions he advocated treating [[Shock (circulatory)|shocked wounded]] by infusing [[sodium bicarbonate]] to neutralize the acid.  He and [[William Bayliss]] infused acid into an anesthetized cat, which died.   However, a second trial  done with Bayliss and [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]] failed to produce shock. Shock was successfully treated by infusing saline containing some larger molecules.          

;Homeostasis
:He developed the concept of [[homeostasis]] from the earlier idea of [[Claude Bernard]] of [[milieu interieur]], and popularized it in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'',1932. Cannon presented four tentative propositions to describe the general features of homeostasis:
:#Constancy in an open system, such as our bodies represent, requires mechanisms that act to maintain this constancy. Cannon based this proposition on insights into the ways by which steady states such as glucose concentrations, body temperature and acid-base balance were regulated.
:#[[Steady-state]] conditions require that any tendency toward change automatically meets with factors that resist change. An increase in [[blood sugar]] results in thirst as the body attempts to dilute the concentration of sugar in the extracellular fluid.
:#The regulating system that determines the homeostatic state consists of a number of cooperating mechanisms acting simultaneously or successively. Blood sugar is regulated by insulin, glucagons, and other hormones that control its release from the liver or its uptake by the tissues.
:#Homeostasis does not occur by chance, but is the result of organized self-government.

;The Sympathoadrenal System
Cannon’s proposed the existence and functional unity of the [[Sympathoadrenal_system|sympathoadrenal]] (or “sympathoadrenomedullary” or “sympathico-adrenal”) system. He theorized [http://www.brainimmune.com/walter-cannon-homeostasis-the-fight-or-flight-response-the-sympathoadrenal-system-and-the-wisdom-of-the-body/ that the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal gland work together as a unit to maintain homeostasis in emergencies]. To identify and quantify adrenaline release during stress, beginning in about 1919 Cannon exploited an ingenious experimental setup. He would surgically excise the nerves supplying the heart of a laboratory animal such as a dog or cat. Then he would subject the animal to a stressor and record the heart rate response. With the nerves to the heart removed, he could deduce that if the heart rate increased in response to the perturbation, then the increase in heart rate must have resulted from the actions of a hormone. Finally, he would compare the results in an animal with intact adrenal glands with those in an animal from which he had removed the adrenal glands. From the difference in the heart rate between the two animals, he could infer further that the hormone responsible for the increase in heart rate came from the adrenal glands. Moreover, the amount of increase in the heart rate provided a measure of the amount of hormone released. Cannon became so convinced that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland functioned as a unit that in the 1930s he formally proposed that the sympathetic nervous system uses the same chemical messenger—adrenaline—as does the adrenal gland.  [http://www.brainimmune.com/walter-cannon-homeostasis-the-fight-or-flight-response-the-sympathoadrenal-system-and-the-wisdom-of-the-body/ Cannon’s notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system persists to this day]. Researchers in the area have come to question the validity of the notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system, although clinicians often continue to lump together the two components. 

;Cannon-Bard theory
:Cannon developed the [[Cannon-Bard theory]] with physiologist Philip Bard to try to explain why people feel emotions first and then act upon them.

;Dry mouth
:He put forward the Dry Mouth Hypothesis, stating that people get thirsty because their mouths get dry. He did an experiment on two dogs. He made incisions in their throats and inserted small tubes. Any water swallowed would go through their mouths and out by the tubes, never reaching their stomachs. He found out that these dogs would lap up the same amount of water as control dogs.

[[Image:Interference of two waves.svg|frame|upright=1.4|The interference of two waves. When [[in phase]], the two lower waves create [[constructive interference]] (left), resulting in a wave of greater amplitude. When 180° [[out of phase]], they create [[destructive interference]] (right).]]

In [[physics]], '''interference''' is a phenomenon in which two [[wave]]s [[Superposition principle|superpose]] to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same [[amplitude]]. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same [[frequency]]. Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, [[Light wave|light]], [[Radio wave|radio]], [[sound wave|acoustic]], [[surface wave|surface water wave]]s or [[matter wave]]s.

[[File:3D Interference of Laser Light Through 2 Pinholes Animation.webm|thumb|thumbtime=3|Cropped tomography scan animation of laser light interference passing through two pinholes (side edges).]]

The [[superposition principle#Wave interference|principle of superposition of waves]] states that when two or more propagating waves of same type are incident on the same point, the resultant [[amplitude]] at that point is equal to the [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] of the amplitudes of the individual waves.&lt;ref&gt;Ockenga, Wymke. [http://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/phase-contrast/ Phase Contrast]. Leika Science Lab, 09 June 2011. "If two waves interfere, the amplitude of the resulting light wave will be equal to the vector sum of the amplitudes of the two interfering waves."&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[Crest (physics)|crest]] of a wave meets a crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point, then the amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes—this is constructive interference. If a crest of one wave meets a trough of another wave, then the amplitude is equal to the difference in the individual amplitudes—this is known as destructive interference.

[[File:Interference colours in soap film 1.jpg|thumb|A magnified image of a coloured interference pattern in a soap film. The "black holes" are areas of almost total destructive interference (antiphase).]]

Constructive interference occurs when the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] difference between the waves is an '''even multiple''' of π (180°) , whereas destructive interference occurs when the difference is an '''odd multiple''' of π. If the difference between the phases is intermediate between these two extremes, then the magnitude of the displacement of the summed waves lies between the minimum and maximum values.

Consider, for example, what happens when two identical stones are dropped into a still pool of water at different locations. Each stone generates a circular wave propagating outwards from the point where the stone was dropped. When the two waves overlap, the net displacement at a particular point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. At some points, these will be in phase, and will produce a maximum displacement. In other places, the waves will be in anti-phase, and there will be no net displacement at these points. Thus, parts of the surface will be stationary—these are seen in the figure above and to the right as stationary blue-green lines radiating from the centre.

Interference of light is a common phenomenon that can be explained classically by the superposition of waves, however a deeper understanding of light interference requires knowledge of    [[wave-particle duality]] of light which is due to [[quantum mechanics]].  Prime examples of light interference are the famous [[double-slit experiment]], [[laser speckle]], [[anti-reflective coating]]s and [[interferometer]]s.    Traditionally the classical wave model is taught as a basis for understanding optical interference, based the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

===Derivation===
The above can be demonstrated in one dimension by deriving the formula for the sum of two waves.  The equation for the amplitude of a [[sinusoid]]al wave traveling to the right along the x-axis is
:&lt;math&gt;W_1(x,t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; is the peak amplitude, &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi/\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]] and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the wave.  Suppose a second wave of the same frequency and amplitude but with a different phase is also traveling to the right    
:&lt;math&gt;W_2(x,t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t + \phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; is the phase difference between the waves in [[radian]]s.  The two waves will [[Superposition principle|superpose]] and add: the sum of the two waves is
:&lt;math&gt;W_1 + W_2 = A[\cos(kx - \omega t) + \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi)]\,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the [[trigonometric identity]] for the sum of two cosines: &lt;math&gt;\cos a + \cos b = 2\cos\Bigl({a-b \over 2}\Bigr)\cos\Bigl({a+b \over 2}\Bigr)\,&lt;/math&gt;, this can be written
:&lt;math&gt;W_1 + W_2 = 2A\cos\Bigl({\phi \over 2}\Bigr)\cos\Bigl(kx - \omega t + {\phi \over 2}\Bigr)\,&lt;/math&gt;
This represents a wave at the original frequency, traveling to the right like the components, whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of &lt;math&gt;\phi/2&lt;/math&gt;. 
*''Constructive interference'': If the phase difference is an even multiple of pi: &lt;math&gt;\phi = ...-4\pi, -2\pi, 0, 2\pi, 4\pi,...&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\cos(\phi/2)| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;, so the sum of the two waves is a wave with twice the amplitude
::&lt;math&gt;W_1 + W_2 = 2A\cos(kx - \omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
*''Destructive interference'': If the phase difference is an odd multiple of pi: &lt;math&gt;\phi = ...-3\pi,\, -\pi,\, \pi,\, 3\pi,\, 5\pi,...&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\cos(\phi/2) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, so the sum of the two waves is zero
::&lt;math&gt;W_1 + W_2 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Between two plane waves===
[[Image:interference of plane waves 3.svg|right|thumb|250px|Geometrical arrangement for two plane wave interference]][[Image:Interferences plane waves.jpg|right|thumb|Interference fringes in overlapping plane waves]]
A simple form of interference pattern is obtained if two [[plane wave]]s of the same frequency intersect at an angle. 
Interference is essentially an energy redistribution process. The energy which is lost at the destructive interference is regained at the constructive interference.
One wave is travelling horizontally, and the other is travelling downwards at an angle θ to the first wave.  Assuming that the two waves are in phase at the point '''B''', then the relative phase changes along the ''x''-axis. The phase difference at the point '''A''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \varphi = \frac {2 \pi d} {\lambda} = \frac {2 \pi x \sin \theta} {\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the two waves are in phase when

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {x \sin \theta} {\lambda} = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;,

and are half a cycle out of phase when

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {x \sin \theta} {\lambda} = \pm \frac {1}{2}, \pm \frac {3}{2}, ...&lt;/math&gt;

Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, and destructive interference when they are half a cycle out of phase.  Thus, an interference fringe pattern is produced, where the separation of the maxima is

:&lt;math&gt; d_f = \frac {\lambda} {\sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''d&lt;sub&gt;f''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is known as the fringe spacing.  The fringe spacing increases with increase in [[wavelength]], and with decreasing angle {{math|θ}}.

The fringes are observed wherever the two waves overlap and the fringe spacing is uniform throughout.

=== Between two spherical waves ===
[[Image:wavepanel.png|right|thumb|Optical interference between two point sources that have different wavelengths and separations of sources.]]

A [[point source]] produces a spherical wave.  If the light from two point sources overlaps, the interference pattern maps out the way in which the phase difference between the two waves varies in space. This depends on the wavelength and on the separation of the point sources.  The figure to the right shows interference between two spherical waves.  The wavelength increases from top to bottom, and the distance between the sources increases from left to right.

When the plane of observation is far enough away, the fringe pattern will be a series of almost straight lines, since the waves will then be almost planar.

===Multiple beams===
Interference occurs when several waves are added together provided that the phase differences between them remain constant over the observation time.

It is sometimes desirable for several waves of the same frequency and amplitude to sum to zero (that is, interfere destructively, cancel). This is the principle behind, for example, [[three-phase electric power|3-phase power]] and the [[diffraction grating]].  In both of these cases, the result is achieved by uniform spacing of the phases.

It is easy to see that a set of waves will cancel if they have the same amplitude and their phases are spaced equally in angle.  Using [[phasor]]s, each wave can be represented as &lt;math&gt;A e^{i \varphi_n}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; waves from &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n = N-1&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n - \varphi_{n-1} = \frac{2\pi}{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} A e^{i \varphi_n} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

one merely assumes the converse, then multiplies both sides by &lt;math&gt; e^{i \frac{2\pi}{N}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]] uses interference between multiple reflections.

A [[diffraction grating]] can be considered to be a multiple-beam interferometer; since the peaks which it produces are generated by interference between the light transmitted by each of the elements in the grating; see [[interference vs. diffraction]] for further discussion.

== Optical interference ==
[[Image:Optical flat interference.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Creation of interference fringes by an [[optical flat]] on a reflective surface.  Light rays from a monochromatic source pass through the glass and reflect off both the bottom surface of the flat and the supporting surface.   The tiny gap between the surfaces means the two reflected rays have different path lengths. In addition the ray reflected from the bottom plate undergoes a 180° phase reversal.  As a result, at locations '''''(a)''''' where the path difference is an odd multiple of λ/2, the waves reinforce.   At locations '''''(b)''''' where the path difference is an even multiple of λ/2 the waves cancel.  Since the gap between the surfaces varies slightly in width at different points, a series of alternating bright and dark bands, ''interference fringes'', are seen.  ]]

Because the frequency of light waves (~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz) is too high to be detected by currently available detectors, it is possible to observe only the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of an optical interference pattern. The intensity of the light at a given point is proportional to the square of the average amplitude of the wave.  This can be expressed mathematically as follows. The displacement of the two waves at a point {{math|'''r'''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;U_1 (\mathbf r,t) = A_1(\mathbf r) e^{i [\varphi_1 (\mathbf r) - \omega t]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U_2 (\mathbf r,t) = A_2(\mathbf r) e^{i [\varphi_2 (\mathbf r) - \omega t]}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|A}} represents the magnitude of the displacement, {{math|φ}} represents the phase and {{math|ω}} represents the [[angular frequency]].

The displacement of the summed waves is

:&lt;math&gt;U (\mathbf r,t) = A_1(\mathbf r) e^{i [\varphi_1 (\mathbf r) - \omega t]}+A_2(\mathbf r) e^{i [\varphi_2 (\mathbf r) - \omega t]}&lt;/math&gt;

The intensity of the light at {{math|'''r'''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt; I(\mathbf r) = \int U (\mathbf r,t) U^* (\mathbf r,t) dt \propto A_1^2 (\mathbf r)+ A_2^2 (\mathbf r) + 2 A_1 (\mathbf r) A_2 (\mathbf r) \cos {[\varphi_1 (\mathbf r)-\varphi_2 (\mathbf r)]}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed in terms of the intensities of the individual waves as

:&lt;math&gt; I(\mathbf r) =  I_1 (\mathbf r)+ I_2 (\mathbf r) + 2 \sqrt{ I_1 (\mathbf r) I_2 (\mathbf r)} \cos {[\varphi_1 (\mathbf r)-\varphi_2 (\mathbf r)]}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the interference pattern maps out the difference in phase between the two waves, with maxima occurring when the phase difference is a multiple of 2π. If the two beams are of equal intensity, the maxima are four times as bright as the individual beams, and the minima have zero intensity.

The two waves must have the same [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to give rise to interference fringes since it is not possible for waves of different polarizations to cancel one another out or add together. Instead, when waves of different polarization are added together, they give rise to a wave of a different [[polarization (waves)#Polarization state|polarization state]].

=== Light source requirements ===
The discussion above assumes that the waves which interfere with one another are monochromatic, i.e. have a single frequency—this requires that they are infinite in time.  This is not, however, either practical or necessary. Two identical waves of finite duration whose frequency is fixed over that period will give rise to an interference pattern while they overlap.  Two identical waves which consist of a narrow spectrum of frequency waves of finite duration, will give a series of fringe patterns of slightly differing spacings, and provided the spread of spacings is significantly less than the average fringe spacing, a fringe pattern will again be observed during the time when the two waves overlap.

Conventional light sources emit waves of differing frequencies and at different times from different points in the source. If the light is split into two waves and then re-combined, each individual light wave may generate an interference pattern with its other half, but the individual fringe patterns generated will have different phases and spacings, and normally no overall fringe pattern will be observable.  However, single-element light sources, such as [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] or [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s have emission lines with quite narrow frequency spectra.  When these are spatially and colour filtered, and then split into two waves, they can be superimposed to generate interference fringes.&lt;ref&gt;WH  Steel, ''Interferometry'', 1986, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; All interferometry prior to the invention of the laser was done using such sources and had a wide range of successful applications.

A [[laser beam]] generally approximates much more closely to a monochromatic source, and it is much more straightforward to generate interference fringes using a laser. The ease with which interference fringes can be observed with a laser beam can sometimes cause problems in that stray reflections may give spurious interference fringes which can result in errors.

Normally, a single laser beam is used in interferometry, though interference has been observed using two independent lasers whose frequencies were sufficiently matched  to satisfy the phase requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfleegor | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Mandel | first2 = L. | year = 1967 | title = Interference of independent photon beams | doi = 10.1103/physrev.159.1084 | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 159 | issue = 5| pages = 1084–1088 | bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1084P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This has also been observed for widefield interference between two incoherent laser sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=R.|author2=Achamfuo-Yeboah, S. |author3=Light R.|author4=Clark M.|title=

[[Image:Soap bubble sky.jpg|thumb|right|White light interference in a [[soap bubble]]. The [[iridescence]] is due to [[thin-film interference]].]]
It is also possible to observe interference fringes using white light.  A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a 'spectrum' of fringe patterns each of slightly different spacing. If all the fringe patterns are in phase in the centre, then the fringes will increase in size as the wavelength decreases and the summed intensity will show three to four fringes of varying colour.  Young describes this very elegantly in his discussion of two slit interference. Since white light fringes are obtained only when the two waves have travelled equal distances from the light source, they can be very useful in interferometry, as they allow the zero path difference fringe to be identified.&lt;ref name = "Born and Wolf"&gt;[[Max Born]] and Emil Wolf, 1999, ''Principles of Optics'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical arrangements ===
To generate interference fringes, light from the source has to be divided into two waves which have then to be re-combined. Traditionally, interferometers have been classified as either amplitude-division or wavefront-division systems.

In an amplitude-division system, a [[beam splitter]] is used to divide the light into two beams travelling in different directions, which are then superimposed to produce the interference pattern. The [[Michelson interferometer]] and the [[Mach-Zehnder interferometer]] are examples of amplitude-division systems.

In wavefront-division systems, the wave is divided in space—examples are [[Young's double slit experiment|Young's double slit interferometer]] and [[Lloyd's mirror]].

Interference can also be seen in everyday phenomena such as [[iridescence]] and [[structural coloration]].  For example, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and back surfaces of the thin soap film.  Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.

== Applications ==
{{Main|Interferometry}}

=== Optical interferometry ===
{{Main|Optical interferometry}}
Interferometry has played an important role in the advancement of physics, and also has a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurement.

[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s double slit interferometer in 1803 demonstrated interference fringes when two small holes were illuminated by light from another small hole which was illuminated by sunlight.  Young was able to estimate the wavelength of different colours in the spectrum from the spacing of the fringes.  The experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.&lt;ref name = "Born and Wolf"/&gt; 
In quantum mechanics, this experiment is considered to demonstrate the inseparability of the wave and particle natures of light and other quantum particles ([[wave–particle duality]]). [[Richard Feynman]] was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.&lt;ref name="Greene_1999"&gt;{{cite book|last =Greene|first =Brian|authorlink =Brian Greene|title =[[The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]] |publisher =W.W. Norton|location =New York|year =1999|pages = 97–109|isbn =0-393-04688-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] are generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the theory of a [[luminiferous aether]] and in favor of [[special relativity]].

Interferometry has been used in defining and calibrating [[Length measurement|length standards]].  When the metre was defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar, [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Michelson]] and Benoît used interferometry to measure the wavelength of the red [[cadmium]] line in the new standard, and also showed that it could be used as a length standard. Sixty years later, in 1960, the metre in the new [[SI]] system was defined to be equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum.  This definition was replaced in 1983 by defining the metre as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a specific time interval. Interferometry is still fundamental in establishing the [[calibration]] chain in length measurement.

Interferometry is used in the calibration of [[Gauge block|slip gauges]] (called gauge blocks in the US) and in [[coordinate-measuring machine]]s. It is also used in the testing of optical components.&lt;ref&gt;RS Longhurst,  ''Geometrical and Physical Optics'', 1968, Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio interferometry===
{{main|Astronomical interferometer}}

[[Image:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Very Large Array]], an [[interferometer|interferometric array]] formed from many smaller [[telescope]]s, like many larger [[radio telescope]]s.]]
In 1946, a technique called [[Astronomical interferometer|astronomical interferometry]] was developed. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of parabolic dishes or two-dimensional arrays of omni-directional antennas. All of the telescopes in the array are widely separated and are usually connected together using [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. Interferometry increases the total signal collected, but its primary purpose is to vastly increase the resolution through a process called [[Aperture synthesis]]. This technique works by superposing (interfering) the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is equivalent in resolution (though not in sensitivity) to a single antenna whose diameter is equal to the spacing of the antennas furthest apart in the array.

===Acoustic interferometry===
An [[acoustic interferometer]] is an instrument for measuring the physical characteristics of sound wave in a [[gas]] or liquid. It may be used to measure [[velocity]], wavelength, [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. A vibrating [[crystal]] creates the ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed  parallel to the crystal. The waves are then reflected back to the source and measured.

If a system is in state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, its [[wavefunction]] is described in Dirac or [[bra–ket notation]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi \rang = \sum_i |i\rangle \langle i| \psi \rangle= \sum_i |i\rang \psi_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; |i\rang&lt;/math&gt;s specify the different quantum "alternatives" available (technically, they form an [[eigenvector]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]) and the &lt;math&gt;\psi_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[probability amplitude]] coefficients, which are [[complex numbers]].

The probability of observing the system making a [[Atomic electron transition|transition]] or [[Quantum state|quantum leap]] from state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to a new state &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the square of the modulus of the [[scalar product|scalar]] or [[inner product]] of the two states:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{prob}(\psi \Rightarrow \varphi) = |\lang \psi |\varphi \rang|^2 = |\sum_i\psi^*_i \varphi_i |^2
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
= \sum_{ij} \psi^*_i \psi_j \varphi^*_j\varphi_i= \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2|\varphi_i|^2 + \sum_{ij;i \ne j} \psi^*_i \psi_j \varphi^*_j\varphi_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \psi_i = \lang i|\psi \rang &lt;/math&gt; (as defined above) and similarly &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i = \lang i|\varphi \rang &lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the final state of the system. * is the [[complex conjugate]] so that &lt;math&gt; \psi_i^* = \lang \psi|i \rang &lt;/math&gt;, etc.

Now let's consider the situation classically and imagine that the system transited from &lt;math&gt;|\psi \rang&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;|\varphi \rang&lt;/math&gt; via an intermediate state &lt;math&gt;|i\rang&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we would ''classically'' expect the probability of the two-step transition to be the sum of all the possible intermediate steps.  So we would have
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{prob}(\psi \Rightarrow \varphi) = \sum_i \operatorname{prob}(\psi \Rightarrow i \Rightarrow \varphi)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
= \sum_i |\lang \psi |i \rang|^2|\lang i|\varphi \rang|^2 = \sum_i|\psi_i|^2 |\varphi_i|^2
&lt;/math&gt;,

The classical and quantum derivations for the transition probability differ by the presence, in the quantum case, of the extra terms &lt;math&gt;\sum_{ij;i \ne j} \psi^*_i \psi_j \varphi^*_j\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt;; these extra quantum terms represent ''interference'' between the different &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt; intermediate "alternatives". These are consequently known as the ''quantum interference terms'', or ''cross terms''. This is a purely [[quantum effect]] and is a consequence of the non-additivity of the probabilities of quantum alternatives.

The interference terms vanish, via the mechanism of [[quantum decoherence]], if the intermediate state &lt;math&gt; |i\rang&lt;/math&gt; is measured or coupled with its environment{{clarify|date=October 2018}}. &lt;ref name="zurek91"&gt;[[Wojciech H.

'''Whirlwind I''' was a [[Cold War]]-era [[List of vacuum tube computers|vacuum tube computer]] developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Servomechanisms Laboratory for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. It was among the first digital electronic computers that operated in real-time for output, and the first that was not simply an electronic replacement of older mechanical systems.

It was one of the first computers to calculate in parallel (rather than serial), and was the first to use magnetic core memory.

Its development led directly to the Whirlwind II design used as the basis for the [[United States Air Force]] [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air defense system, and indirectly to almost all business computers and [[minicomputer]]s in the 1960s.

==Background==
During World War II, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] approached MIT about the possibility of creating a computer to drive a [[flight simulator]] for training [[bomber]] crews. They envisioned a fairly simple system in which the computer would continually update a simulated instrument panel based on control inputs from the pilots. Unlike older systems like the [[Link Trainer]], the system they envisioned would have a considerably more realistic [[aerodynamics]] model that could be adapted to any type of plane. This was an important consideration at the time, when many new designs were being introduced into service.

The Servomechanisms Lab in MIT building 32&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |format=pdf transcript of vocal recording |title=An Interview with DOUGLAS T. ROSS |url=http://purl.umn.edu/107610 |access-date=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a short survey that concluded such a system was possible. The Navy decided to fund development under ''Project Whirlwind'', and the lab placed [[Jay Forrester]] in charge of the project. They soon built a large [[analog computer]] for the task, but found that it was inaccurate and inflexible. Solving these problems in a general way would require a much larger system, perhaps one so large as to be impossible to construct.

In 1945, [[Perry Crawford (computing)|Perry Crawford]], another member of the MIT team, saw a demonstration of [[ENIAC]] and suggested that a digital computer was the solution. Such a machine would allow the accuracy of the simulation to be improved with the addition of more code in the [[computer program]], as opposed to adding parts to the machine. As long as the machine was fast enough, there was no theoretical limit to the complexity of the simulation.

Until this point, all computers constructed were dedicated to single tasks, and run in [[batch mode]]. A series of inputs were set up in advance and fed into the computer, which would work out the answers and print them. This was not appropriate for the Whirlwind system, which needed to operate continually on an ever-changing series of inputs. Speed became a major issue: whereas with other systems it simply meant waiting longer for the printout, with Whirlwind it meant seriously limiting the amount of complexity the simulation could include.

==Technical description==

===Design and construction===
By 1947, Forrester and collaborator [[Robert Everett (computer scientist)|Robert Everett]] completed the design of a high-speed [[stored-program computer]] for this task. Most computers of the era operated in [[serial computer|''bit-serial'' mode]], using single-bit arithmetic and feeding in large words, often 48 or 60 bits in size, one bit at a time. This was simply not fast enough for their purposes, so Whirlwind included sixteen such math units, operating on a complete 16-bit word every cycle in ''bit-parallel'' mode. Ignoring memory speed, Whirlwind ("20,000 single-address operations per second" in 1951)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last=Everett |author-first=R. R. |title=The Whirlwind I computer |journal=Papers and discussions presented at the December 10–12, 1951, joint AIEE-IRE computer conference: Review of electronic digital computers |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |pages=70–74 |doi=10.1145/1434770.1434781 |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/Computer_Structures__Readings_and_Examples/00000157.htm |access-date=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was essentially sixteen times as fast as other machines. Today, almost all CPUs perform arithmetic in "bit-parallel" mode.

The word size was selected after some deliberation. The machine worked by passing in a single address with almost every instruction, thereby reducing the number of memory accesses. For operations with two operands, adding for instance, the "other" operand was assumed to be the last one loaded. Whirlwind operated much like a [[reverse Polish notation]] [[calculator]] in this respect; except there was no operand stack, only an [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]. The designers felt that 2048 words of memory would be the minimum usable amount, requiring 11 bits to represent an address, and that 16 to 32 instructions would be the minimum for another five bits&amp;nbsp;— and so it was 16 bits.&lt;ref name="EverettSwain"&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/whirlwind/R-series/R-127_Whirlwind_I_Computer_Block_Diagrams_Volume_1_Sep47.pdf |title=Report R-127 Whirlwind I Computer Block Diagrams |author-first1=R.

The Whirlwind design incorporated a [[control store]] driven by a master clock. Each step of the clock selected one or more signal lines in a [[diode matrix]] that enabled gates and other circuits on the machine. A special switch directed signals to different parts of the matrix to implement different instructions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In the early 1950s, Whirlwind I "would crash every 20 minutes on average."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |format=pdf transcript of vocal recording |title=An Interview With Fernando J. Corbató |url=http://purl.umn.edu/107230 |access-date=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes.&lt;!-- from Legacy section below --&gt;

Whirlwind construction started in 1948, an effort that employed 175 people. including 70 engineers and technicians. In the third quarter of 1949 the computer was advanced enough to solve an equation and display its solution on an oscilloscope,&lt;ref name="ProjectWhirlwind" /&gt;{{Rp|11.13}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1950-01-01|title=2.

After three years the Navy had lost interest. However, during this time the Air Force had become interested in using computers to help the task of [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|ground controlled interception]], and the Whirlwind was the only machine suitable to the task. They took up development under ''Project Claude''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The memory subsystem===
The original machine design called for 2048 (2K) words of 16 bits each of random-access storage. The only two available memory technologies in 1949 that could hold this much data were [[delay line memory|mercury delay line]]s and [[storage tube|electrostatic storage]].

A mercury delay line consisted of a long tube filled with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], a mechanical transducer on one end, and a microphone on the other end, much like a [[spring reverb]] unit later used in audio processing. Pulses were sent into the mercury delay line at one end, and took a certain amount of time to reach the other end. They were detected by the microphone, amplified, reshaped into the correct pulse shape, and sent back into the delay line. Thus, the memory was said to recirculate.

Mercury delay lines operated at about the speed of sound, so were very slow in computer terms, even by the standards of the computers of the late 1940s and 1950s. The speed of sound in mercury was also very dependent on temperature. Since a delay line held a defined number of bits, the frequency of the clock had to change with the temperature of the mercury. If there were many delay lines and they did not all have the same temperature at all times, the memory data could easily become corrupted.

The Whirlwind designers quickly discarded the delay line as a possible memory—it was both too slow for the envisioned flight simulator, and too unreliable for a reproducible production system, for which Whirlwind was intended to be a functional prototype.

The alternative form of memory was known as "electrostatic". This was a cathode ray tube memory, similar in many aspects to an early [[television|TV]] [[Cathode ray tube|picture tube]] or [[oscilloscope]] tube. An [[electron gun]] sent a beam of electrons to the far end of the tube, where they impacted a screen. The beam would be deflected to land at a particular spot on the screen. The beam could then build up a negative charge at that point, or change a charge that was already there. By measuring the beam current it could be determined whether the spot was originally a zero or a one, and a new value could be stored by the beam.

There were several forms of [[Selectron tube|electrostatic memory tube]]s in existence in 1949. The best known today is the [[Williams tube]], developed in England, but there were a number of others that had been developed independently by various research labs. The Whirlwind engineers considered the Williams tube, but determined that the dynamic nature of the storage and the need for frequent [[memory refresh|refresh cycle]]s was incompatible with the design goals for Whirlwind I. Instead, they settled on a design that was being developed at the [[MIT]] [[Radiation Laboratory]]. This was a dual-gun electron tube. One gun produced a sharply-focused beam to read or write individual bits. The other gun was a "flood gun" that sprayed the entire screen with low-energy electrons. As a result of the design, this tube was more of a [[static RAM]] that did not require refresh cycles, unlike the [[dynamic RAM]] Williams tube.

In the end the choice of this tube was unfortunate. The Williams tube was considerably better developed, and despite the need for refresh could easily hold 1024 bits per tube, and was quite reliable when operated correctly. The MIT tube was still in development, and while the goal was to hold 1024 bits per tube, this goal was never reached, even several years after the plan had called for full-size functional tubes. Also, the specifications had called for an [[access time]] of six microseconds, but the actual access time was around 30 microseconds. Since the basic cycle time of the Whirlwind I processor was determined by the memory access time, the entire processor was slower than designed.

===Magnetic core memory===

Jay Forrester was desperate to find a suitable memory replacement for his computer. Initially the computer only had 32 words of storage, and 27 of these words were [[read-only memory|read-only]] registers made of [[toggle switch]]es. The remaining five registers were [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] storage, with each of the five registers being made from more than 30 [[vacuum tube]]s. This "test storage", as it was known, was intended to allow checkout of the processing elements while the main memory was not ready. Main memory was so late that the first experiments of tracking airplanes with live [[radar]] data were done using a program manually set into test storage. Forrester came across an advertisement for a new magnetic material being produced by a company. Recognizing that this had the potential to be a data storage medium, Forrester obtained a workbench in the corner of the lab, and got several samples of the material to experiment with. Then for several months he spent as much time in the lab as he did in the office managing the entire project. 

At the end of those months he had invented the basics of [[magnetic core memory]] and demonstrated that it was likely to be feasible. His demonstration consisted of a small core plane of 32 cores, each three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Having demonstrated that the concept was practical, it needed only to be reduced to a workable design.  In the fall of 1949, Forrester enlisted graduate student William N. Papian to test dozens of individual cores, to determine those with the best properties.&lt;ref name="ProjectWhirlwind"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_mitwhirlwirlwindACaseHistoryInContemporaryTechnolo_14582082 |title=Project Whirlwind |author-last1=Redmond |author-first1=Kent C. |author-last2=Smith |author-first2=Thomas M. |date=November 1975 |publisher=The MITRE Corporation |page=11.6 |access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papian's work was bolstered when Forrester asked student [[Dudley Allen Buck]]&lt;ref&gt;http://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/38908/MC665_r04_E-504.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/39012/MC665_r04_E-460.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/dudley-bucks-forgotten-cryotron-computer&lt;/ref&gt; to work on the material and assigned him to the workbench, while Forrester went back to full-time project management. (Buck would go on to invent the [[cryotron]] and [[content-addressable memory]] at the lab.)

After approximately two years of further research and development, they were able to demonstrate a core plane that was made of 32 by 32, or 1024 cores, holding 1024 bits of data. Thus, they had reached the originally intended storage size of an electrostatic tube, a goal that had not yet been reached by the tubes themselves, only holding 512 bits per tube in the latest design generation. Very quickly a 1024-word core memory was fabricated, replacing the electrostatic memory. The electrostatic memory design and production was summarily canceled, saving a good deal of money to be reallocated to other research areas. Two additional core memory units were later fabricated, increasing the total memory size available.

==Air defense networks==
After connection to the experimental Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar at [[Hanscom Field]] using Jack Harrington's equipment and commercial phone lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |format=Google Books |author-last=Jacobs |author-first=John F. |year=1986 |title=The SAGE Air Defense System: A Personal History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDMhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=whirlwind |publisher=MITRE Corporation |access-date=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft were tracked by Whirlwind I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author-last1=Lemnios |author-first1=William Z. |author-last2=Grometstein |author-first2=Alan A. |title=Overview of the Lincoln Laboratory Ballistic Missile Defense Program |url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol13_no1/13_1overview.pdf |page=10 |access-date=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Cape Cod System]] subsequently demonstrated computerized [[air defence]] covering southern [[New England]].{{Specify|did this use a Whirlwind I?|date=December 2012}} Signals from three long range (AN/FPS-3) radars, eleven gap-filler radars, and three height-finding radars were transmitted over [[telephone line]]s to the Whirlwind I computer in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Whirlwind II design for a larger and faster machine (never completed) was the basis for the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air defense system IBM [[AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central]].

==Legacy==
The Whirlwind used approximately 5,000 [[vacuum tube]]s.  An effort was also started to convert the Whirlwind design to a transistorized form, led by [[Ken Olsen]] and known as the [[TX-0]]. TX-0 was very successful and plans were made to make an even larger version known as TX-1. However this project was far too ambitious and had to be scaled back to a smaller version known as [[TX-2]]. Even this version proved troublesome, and Olsen left in mid-project to start [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). DEC's [[PDP-1]] was essentially a collection of TX-0 and TX-2 concepts in a smaller package.{{dubious|date=September 2017}}

After supporting SAGE, Whirlwind I was rented ($1/yr) from June 30, 1959, until 1974 by project member, Bill Wolf. 

[[Ken Olsen]] and [[Robert Everett (computer scientist)|Robert Everett]] saved the machine, which became the basis for the [[The Computer Museum, Boston|Boston Computer Museum]] in 1979.  It is now in the collection of the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]].

As of February 2009, a core memory unit is displayed at the [[Charles River Museum of Industry &amp; Innovation]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. One plane{{clarify|of memory?|date=July 2018}}, on loan from the [[Computer History Museum]], is on shown as part of the Historic Computer Science displays at the [[Gates Computer Science Building, Stanford]].

The building which housed Whirlwind was until recently home to MIT's campus-wide IT department, Information Services &amp; Technology and in 1997–1998, it was restored to its original exterior design.&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1998/n42-0114.html |title=Plenty of computing history in N42 |author-first=Alice C. |author-last=Waugh |publisher=MIT News Office |date=January 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
