The '''77th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 77 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[North America]]. It is the northernmost integral parallel that passes through continental mainland (namely the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] of Siberia).

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 77° north passes through:

[[File:Крубер Александр Александрович.jpg|thumb|Alexander Kruber]]
'''Alexander Alexandrovich Kruber''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Александрович Крубер}}; {{OldStyleDate|August 22|1871|August 8}} – December 15, 1941) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[geographer]], [[professor]], the founder of the Russian and Soviet [[karstology]].

Alexander Kruber was born in [[Istra, Istrinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Istra]] (formerly Voskresensk), [[Russia]]. He graduated from the [[Moscow University]] in 1897. He became chairman of the Geography Department of the Moscow University in 1919 and director of the Scientific Research Institute of Geography during 1923-1927. Since 1927 he could no longer work due to grave health problems.

He studied [[karst]] structures of the [[East European Plain]], [[Crimea]], and [[Caucasus]].

A [[mountain]] [[ridge]] on the [[Iturup Island]] ([[Kruber Ridge]]), a carst cavity in the [[Karabi-Yayla Plateau]] ([http://travel.org.ua/rus/library/library.php?book=6&amp;p=14 Караби-яйла]), Crimea, and a karst [[cave]] in Caucasus ([[Krubera-Voronya Cave]]) are named after him.

Kuwait is divided into [[Governorates of Kuwait|six governorates]], in each there are several '''areas''' ({{lang-ar|مناطِق}}).

Areas, due to their small area which does not exceed {{convert|5|km²|0|abbr=on}}, are sometimes called towns. However they are officially translated to ''areas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticlePrintPage.aspx?id=2144192&amp;language=en Kuwait National News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moi.gov.kw/portal/venglish/ShowPage.aspx?newsID=3671 Ministry of Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mew.gov.kw/en/?com=content&amp;act=view&amp;id=55 Ministry of Electricity and Water]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word for area, ''[[wiktionary:منطقة|Mantaqa]] منطقة'' can mean both mean ''area'' and ''region''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english-arabic/area Cambridge English-Arabic dictionary, ''Area'' translatation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english-arabic/region Cambridge English-Arabic dictionary, ''Region'' translatation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each area in Kuwait has an official governmental facility called '''co-op society''' or just '''society''' ({{lang-ar|جمعية}}). For example, in Surra, it's called ''Surra Co-op Society''. Societies are mainly supermarkets that provide foods and produces, and they may take part in maintaining some on the areas' landmarks like parks and schools, but they're not legally obliged to. Societies have elected members who manage them. Only residents of the area can vote for their society membership.

[[File:Atlas Van der Hagen-KW1049B13 057-BARBARIA.jpeg|thumb|400px|A 17th-century map by the Dutch cartographer [[Jan Janssonius]] showing the Barbary Coast, here "Barbaria"]]

The term '''Barbary Coast''' or '''Berbery''' or '''Berber Coast''' was used by [[European ethnic groups|European]]s from the 16th to early 19th century to refer to much of the collective land of the [[Berber people]].

The term ''Barbary Coast'' emphasizes the Berber coastal regions and cities throughout the middle and western coastal regions of [[North Africa]] – what is now modern nations of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]]. The English term "Barbary" (and its European varieties: ''Barbaria'', ''Berbérie'', etc.) referred mainly to the entire Berber lands including non-coastal regions, deep into the [[Africa]]n continent, as seen in European geographical and political maps published during the 17th–20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.antiquemaps.com/maps2/africa/# Maps of Barbary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033833/http://www.antiquemaps.com/africa/nafrica.htm |date=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the [[Berber people]] of  [[North Africa]] (from [[Greek language|greek]] ''Bàrbaroi'', Βάρβαροι, "barbaric"). In the [[Western world|West]], the name commonly evoked the [[Barbary pirate]]s and [[Barbary Slave Trade|Barbary slave traders]] based on that coast—who attacked ships and coastal settlements in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and eastern [[North Atlantic Ocean]], and captured and traded slaves or goods from [[Europe]], [[United States|America]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. These actions finally provoked the [[Barbary Wars]] of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Robert| last=Carver| title=Not so easy alliances: Two Faiths, One Banner: when Muslims marched with Christians across Europe’s battlegrounds (book review)| url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| work=| publisher=The Tablet| location=| pages=24| date=25 April 2009| id=| accessdate=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620191835/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| archive-date=2017-06-20| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves and goods were being traded and sold throughout the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]] or to the Europeans themselves.

==History==
[[File:Ex Voto of a Naval Battle between a Turkish ship from Alger and a ship of the Order of Malta under Langon 1719.jpg|thumb|[[Ex-Voto]] of a naval battle between a Turkish ship from [[Algiers]] (front) and a ship of the [[Order of Malta]] under [[Langon, Ille-et-Vilaine|Langon]], 1719.]]
''Barbary'' was not always a unified political entity.  From the 16th century onwards, it was divided into the political entities of the [[Regency of Algiers]], [[Tunis Province, Ottoman Empire|Tunis]], and [[Tripolitania]] ([[Tripoli]]).  Major rulers petty monarchs during the times of the Barbary states' plundering parties included the [[Pasha]] or [[Dey]] of [[Algiers]], the [[Bey]] of [[Tunis]] and the [[Bey]] of [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates|volume=3|pages=383–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before then, the territory was usually divided between [[Ifriqiya]], Morocco, and a west-central Algerian state centered on [[Tlemcen]] or [[Tiaret]].  Powerful Berber dynasties such as the [[Almohad]]s (12th century) and briefly thereafter the [[Hafsids]], occasionally unified it for short periods.  From a European perspective, Tripoli in modern-day [[Libya]], was considered its ''capital'' or chief city—though [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco was the largest and most important Berber city at the time. Some{{by whom|date=February 2015}} saw Algiers in Algeria, or [[Tangiers]] in Morocco as the ''capital''.

[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|Purchase of Christian captives in the Barbary States.]]
The first [[United States]] military land action overseas, executed by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], was the [[Battle of Derna (1805)|Battle of Derna]], Tripoli (a coastal town in modern eastern Libya) in April 1805. It formed part of an effort to destroy all of the Barbary pirates, to free American slaves in captivity, and to put an end to [[piracy]] acts between these warring tribes on the part of the Barbary states, which were themselves member states of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The opening line of the ''[[Marines' Hymn]]'' refers to this action: "From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli..." This was the first time the [[United States Marine Corps]] took part in offensive actions outside of the United States.

The modern word ''[[razzia (disambiguation)|razzia]]'' is, via Italian and French, from [[Algerian Arabic]] ''[[Ghazw|ghaziya]]'' (غزية "raiding"), originally  referring to [[slave raid]]s conducted by [[Barbary pirates]].

'''Christmas traditions''' vary from country to country. [[Christmas]] celebrations for many nations include the installing and lighting of [[Christmas tree]]s, the hanging of [[Advent wreath]]s, [[Christmas stocking]]s, [[candy cane]]s, and the creation of [[Nativity scene]]s depicting the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Christmas carol]]s may be sung and stories told about such figures as the [[Baby Jesus]], [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]], [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Christkind]] or [[Ded Moroz|Grandfather Frost]]. The sending and exchange of [[Christmas card]] greetings, observance of [[fasting]] and special religious observances such as a midnight [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Vespers]] on [[Christmas Eve]], the burning of a [[Yule log]], and the [[History of Christmas Gift Giving|giving and receiving of presents]]. Along with [[Easter]], Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as [[Advent]], the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], [[St Nicholas Day]], [[St. Stephen's Day]], [[New Year]]'s, and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Christmas.aspx|title=Christmas|publisher=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethiopia and Eritrea ====

Christmas Day is a [[Public holidays in Eritrea|public holiday in Eritrea]] that is celebrated on January 7 or on 27 Tahsas of the [[Ethiopian calendar]]. Christmas is called ''Ledet'' (ልደት) in Eritrea or ''Gena'' (ገና) in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbBm2WpVwUkC&amp;pg=PA33 |title= Ethiopia |page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who are Christian in the two countries fast for 40 days (it is called fast of the prophets). They then head to church at dawn on Christmas morning. On Christmas Day, there will be colorful musical celebrations which involve the priests dressed in their best robes performing rituals, including dancing and playing drums and other instruments. Early in the morning at dawn, everyone dresses in white and head to the nearby church. Late in the afternoon there will be the traditional game of Gena, a kind of hockey. According to an Ethiopian legend, the game was being played by the shepherds who were tending their flocks on the night that Jesus was born. The game is attended by the leader of the community. A prize is awarded to the winner of the Gena game. Most Ethiopians don a traditional Shamma, a thin, white cotton wrap with brightly colored stripes across the ends.The holiday is followed up by the three-day festival Timkat starting on January 19 and celebrating the baptism of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/travel/2012/01/06/an_ethiopian_christmas.html|title=An Ethiopian Christmas|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneagetour.com/attractions/festivals-in-ethiopia/leddet-ethiopian-christmas|title=Leddet (Ethiopian Christmas) – Stone Age Ethiopia Tours –  Ethiopia Travel – Holiday in Ethiopia – Tour Package to Ethiopia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====

Christmas Day is a [[Public holidays in Nigeria|public holiday in Nigeria]] which is always marked by the emptying of towns and cities as Nigerians that have been successful returning to their ancestral villages to be with family and to bless those less fortunate.&lt;ref name=afokansi1&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], introduction paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afokansi5&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Visits from not relations and friends"&lt;/ref&gt; As the towns and cities empty, people jam the West African markets to buy and transport live chickens, goats and cows that will be needed for the Christmas meals.&lt;ref name=afokansi2&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Abundance of food and drinks"&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Eve, traditional meals are prepared according to the traditions of each region. Nigerians as a whole tend to prepare various meats in large quantities.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; In the south, a dish called [[Jollof rice]] is served with stews of various meats along with boiled beans and fried plantains; in the north, Rice and Stew as well as ''Tuwon Shinkafa'', a rice pudding served with various meat stews, is preferred. In the North several local desserts are also made which is hardly ever found in other parts of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; An alternative in both regions (but more favored in the south) is a pepper soup with fish, goat, or beef which may also be served with [[Fufu]] (pounded yam).&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt; Served with this food are an array of mainly alcoholic drinks such as the traditional [[palm wine]] or various local and imported beers and wines; children and women may be served locally-made soft-drink equivalents instead.&lt;ref name=afokansi2/&gt;

Gift giving in Nigeria often involves money and the flow of gifts from the more fortunate to the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=afokansi6&gt;[[#Afokansi|Afokansi]], "Financial donations"&lt;/ref&gt; After the "successful" visitors have come from their towns, cities, and even overseas, they are given time to settle in. Afterwards, local relatives begin approaching them asking for assistance of some kind, whether financial or not.&lt;ref name=afokansi6/&gt; Financial donations and elaborately wrapped gifts may be given out at lavish parties, weddings, and ceremonies; sometimes the money is scattered in the air to be grabbed by the others or stuck onto the sweaty foreheads of those dancing.&lt;ref name=afokansi6/&gt;

[[Religion in Nigeria]] is about equally divided between Christians and Muslims. There are occasional outbreaks of religious conflict. The Islamic sect [[Boko Haram]] has attacked Christian churches with bombings on Christmas 2011.

==== South Africa ====

Christmas in South Africa is a public holiday celebrated on December 25.&lt;ref name="publicholidays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/holidays.htm |title=Public holidays |publisher=Government Communication and Information Service |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101165214/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/holidays.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European traditions are maintained despite the distance from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/events/public-holidays/Christmas-Day-Public-Holiday/2012-12-25/130_37_2812 |title=Christmas Day (Public Holiday) |work=Cape Town Magazine |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas trees are set up in homes and the children are given presents in their stockings.&lt;ref name="Christmas in South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/south_africa.shtml|title=Christmas in South Africa|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional 'fir' Christmas trees are popular and children leave a stocking or milk and cookies out for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The gift bearer is Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Towns and cities have [[Carols by Candlelight]] in the beginning of the festive season where groups of people come together to sing Christmas carols and donate toys and clothing to needy children.

The Christmas meal is mince pies, turkey, gammon, beef tongue, turducken, corned beef, green salad,roast beef or a barbecue outdoors. The meal is finished with Christmas Pudding, Ice cream or trifle. [[Christmas crackers]] are used to make noise.&lt;ref name="Christmas in South Africa"/&gt;

Despite Christmas occurring at the height of the Southern Hemisphere summer, wintry motifs common to the Northern Hemisphere are popular.

[[File:HK Sheung Wan Fook Sing Court Parkn Shop Christmas snow.JPG|thumb|upright|Christmas 2012 in China]]

In China, December 25 is not a legal holiday. However, it is still designated as a public holiday in China's special administrative regions of [[Public holidays in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Public holidays in Macau|Macau]], both former colonies of Western powers with nominal Christian cultural heritage.

In the mainland, the small percentage of Chinese citizens who [[Christianity in China|consider themselves Christians]] unofficially, and usually privately, observe Christmas.&lt;ref name="lovetoknow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christmas.lovetoknow.com/How_Christmas_Started_in_China |title=How Christmas Started in China – LoveToKnow Christmas |publisher=Christmas.lovetoknow.com |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other individuals celebrate Christmas-like festivities even though they do not consider themselves Christians. Many customs, including sending cards, exchanging gifts, and hanging stockings are very similar to Western celebrations.&lt;ref name="lovetoknow" /&gt; Commercial Christmas decorations, signs, and other symbolic items have become increasingly prevalent during the month of December in large urban centres of mainland China, reflecting a cultural interest in this Western phenomenon, and, sometimes, retail marketing campaigns as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/china.htm|title=Christmas in China|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Hong Kong ======

In Hong Kong, where Christmas is a public holiday,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkfastfacts.com/Chinese%20Festivals/christmas-in-hong-kong.htm |title=Hong Kong: Christmas |publisher=Hkfastfacts.com |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; many buildings facing [[Victoria Harbour]] will be decorated with Christmas lights. Christmas trees are found in major malls and other public buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.12hk.com/festivals/Christmas/Christmas.shtml |title=Christmas in Hong Kong |publisher=12hk.com |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some homes as well, despite the small living area. Catholics in Hong Kong can attend Christmas Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/hongkongchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Hong Kong: Around the World at Santa's Net |publisher=Santas.net |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Macau ======
Christmas is a public holiday in Macau. Its traditions are mostly influenced by the Portuguese since the territory was a colony of Portugal until December 20, 1999. Casinos in Macau remain open on Christmas Day. Christmas masses in Macau's Catholic churches are held in either Chinese or Portuguese.

===== Japan =====

[[File:Santa Claus kobe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Santa Claus]] in [[Kobe]], Japan]]

Encouraged by commerce, the secular celebration of Christmas is popular in Japan, though Christmas is not a national holiday. Gifts are sometimes exchanged.&lt;ref name=AboutJapan/&gt; Christmas parties are held around Christmas Day; Japanese [[Christmas cake]], a white sponge cake covered with cream and decorated with strawberries, is often consumed and Stollen cake, either imported or made locally, is widely available. Christmas lights decorate cities, and Christmas trees adorn living areas and malls.&lt;ref name=AboutJapan&gt;Shizuko Mishima, About.com guide. [http://gojapan.about.com/cs/christmasinjapan/a/chrismasinjapan.htm Christmas in Japan], Japan travel section of About.com. Retrieved January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas Eve has become a holiday for couples to spend time together&lt;ref name=AboutJapan/&gt; and exchange gifts. A successful advertising campaign in the 1970s made eating at [[KFC]] around Christmas a national custom. Its chicken meals are so popular during the season that stores take reservations months in advance.&lt;ref name="whipp20101219"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/the-kfc-christmas-connection-in-japan |title=All Japan wants for Christmas is Kentucky Fried Chicken |author=Whipp, Lindsay |work=Japan Today |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ARTELLIGENT CHRISTMAS Roppngi Hills 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Christmas lights in [[Tokyo]]]]

The first recorded Christmas in Japan was a Mass held by Jesuit Missionaries in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] in 1552. Some believe that unrecorded celebrations were held before this date, starting in 1549 when [[Saint Francis Xavier]] arrived in Japan. Christianity was banned throughout Japan in 1612. However, a small enclave of [[Kakure Kirishitan]] ("hidden Christians") continued to practice underground over the next 250&amp;nbsp;years.

[[Christianity in Japan]] along with Christmas reemerged in the [[Meiji period]]. Influenced by America, Christmas parties were held and presents were exchanged. The practice slowly spread, but its proximity to the [[Japanese New Year|New Year]]'s celebrations makes it a smaller focus of attention. During [[World War II]], all celebrations, especially American, were suppressed. From the 1960s, with an expanding economy, and influenced by American TV, Christmas became popular. Many songs and TV series present Christmas as romantic, for example "[[Last Christmas]]" by [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]]. The birthday of the current emperor, [[Akihito]], on December 23 is a national holiday. Businesses soon close for the New Year's holidays, reopening after January 3.

===== South Korea =====

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in South Korea|public holiday]] in South Korea.&lt;!-- I remember that the Santa in blue was a marketing gimmick from some company: According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Korean version of Santa Claus (''Santa Haraboji'', which means Santa Grandfather) can sometimes wear a blue suit instead of a red suit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/24/10-foreign-christmas-traditions-that-americans-might-want-to-adopt/ 10 foreign Christmas traditions that Americans might want to adopt] Rick Noack, The Washington Post, December 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

As Christmas is totally banned in North Korea, South Koreans living near the [[DMZ]] are not allowed to put an outdoor Christmas tree or decorations.

In many of the schools that are run by the Christian missionaries, the children actively participate in Christmas programs. Also in many non-religious schools, there is tradition of Christmas celebration.

===== Pakistan =====
[[File:Christmas Tree at Pakistan Monument Night view.JPG|thumb|left|Christmas Tree at Pakistan Monument Night view]]
[[Christianity in Pakistan]] constitutes the second largest religious minority community in Pakistan after Hindus. The total number of Christians is approximately 2,800,000 in 2008, or 1.6% of the population. Of these, approximately half are Roman Catholic and half Protestant. Christians celebrate Christmas by going from house to house singing carols, and in return the family offers something to the choir.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/pakistan.shtml|title=Christmas in Pakistan|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly the money collected from such carols is used for charity works or is given to the church. Their homes are decorated with local Christmas handicrafts while artificial stars signifying the Star of Bethlehem are hung on rooftops. Christmas celebrations are also popular with the urban middle class in the country with hotels, cafes, restaurants and theme parks hosting festivities and special events.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Pakistan"/&gt;

===== Brunei =====
As of December 22, 2015, Christmas is totally banned in Brunei&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Sehmer |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/brunei-cancels-christmas-sultan-warns-those-celebrating-could-face-up-to-five-years-in-jail-a6782561.html |title=Brunei bans Christmas: Sultan warns those celebrating could face up to five years in jail |publisher=The Independent |date=December 22, 2015 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but for its expatriate and local Christian community, it is still celebrated as usual privately amongst themselves), which includes putting up Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, Nativity plays, festive greeting, and even dressing as Santa Claus. About 20 percent of the population are non-Muslims and anyone caught will face up to five years in jail. Before the Sharia law was passed in 2014, non-Muslim expats were free to celebrate Christmas in Brunei.

Most local television channels will broadcast Christmas musical concerts and annual national Christmas celebrations like concerts and Christmas shows which are held by the government. Like other countries, on Christmas Eve, people will go to church for [[Mass (liturgy)|''Misa'']] and will go to church again the next morning, and exchanging gifts is a usual tradition for [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christians in Indonesia]].

[[File:Weihnachten 2010 Malaysia x-mas teddys.jpg|thumb|Colourful Christmas greetings in Malaysia]]

Although Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Malaysia|public holiday in Malaysia]], much of the public celebration is commercial in nature and has no overt religious overtones. Occasionally, Christian activist groups do buy newspaper advertorials on Christmas or Easter but this is largely only allowed in English newspapers and permission is not given every year. The advertorials themselves are usually indirect statements. There has been controversy over whether or not the national government has exerted pressure on Malaysian Christians not to use Christian religious symbols and hymns that specifically mention Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/32072 |title=Rev Lim: Excluding carols with Jesus' name is scandalous |publisher=Malaysiakini.com |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parols For Sale.png|thumb|left|[[Parol]]s are an iconic display in the Philippines during its long Christmas season]]

Christmas in the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/philippines.shtml|title=Christmas in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being [[East Timor]]), is one of the biggest holidays on the calendar and is widely celebrated. The country has earned the distinction of celebrating the world's longest Christmas season, with Christmas carols heard as early as September 1 when the "'''Ber Months'''" season kicks off traditionally. The season is officially ushered in by the nine-day dawn [[Mass (Liturgy)|Mass]]es that start on December 16. Known as the ''[[Misas de Aguinaldo]]'' (Gift Masses) or ''[[Misa de Gallo]]'' (Rooster's Mass) in the traditional Spanish, these Masses are more popularly known in Tagalog as the ''Simbang Gabi'', and are held in Catholic parishes and chapels nationwide. Usually, aside from the already [[Public holidays in the Philippines|legal holidays]] which are [[Rizal Day]] (December 30) and New Year's Eve (December 31), other days in close proximity such as Christmas Eve (December 24), ''Niños Inocentes'' (December 28), and the Epiphany (traditionally, January 6 but now on the first Sunday of January) are also declared non-working days.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/philippine_articles/longest_christmas.html |title=Christmas in the Philippines |publisher= |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035950/http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/philippine_articles/longest_christmas.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many East Asian countries, secular Christmas displays are common both in business establishments and in public, including lights, Christmas trees, depictions of Santa Claus despite the tropical climate, and Christmas greetings in various foreign languages and various [[Philippine languages]]. Occasionally such displays are left in place even in summer for example the ''[[parol]]'' representing the "Star of Bethlehem" which led the Three Kings to the newborn Baby Jesus.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"/&gt;

[[File:UST at Christmas2007.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Santo Tomas]] main building illuminating the nights of December 2007]]

For Filipinos, Christmas Eve (Tagalog: ''Bisperas ng Pasko''; Spanish: ''Víspera del Día de Navidad'') on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and immediately after, the much-anticipated Noche Buena – the traditional Christmas Eve feast. Family members dine together around 12 midnight on traditional [[Nochebuena]] fare, which may include: ''[[queso de bola]]'' (English: "ball of cheese"; this is actually [[edam cheese]]), ''tsokolate'' (a hot chocolate drink), and ''[[jamón]]'' (Christmas ham), ''[[lechon|lechón]]'', roast chicken or turkey, pasta, ''relleno'' (stuffed ''[[Milkfish|bangus]]'' or chicken), ''[[pan de sal]]'', and various desserts including cakes and the ubiquitous fruit salad. Some would also open presents at this time.

On December 31, New Year's Eve (Tagalog: ''Bisperas ng Bagong Taon''; Spanish: ''Víspera del Año Nuevo''), Filipino families gather for the Media Noche or midnight meal – a feast that is also supposed to symbolize their hopes for a prosperous New Year. In spite of the campaign against firecrackers, many Filipinos still see these as the traditional means to greet [[the New Year]]. The loud noises and sounds of merrymaking are also supposed to drive away bad spirits. Safer methods of merrymaking include banging on pots and pans and blowing on car horns. Folk beliefs also include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight in the belief that they will grow up tall, displaying circular fruit and wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolize money, eating twelve grapes at 12 midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year, and opening windows and doors during the first day of the New Year to let in good luck.

Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Three Kings (''Tres Reyes'' in Spanish or ''Tatlong Hari'' in Tagalog), also known as the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] (Spanish: ''Fiesta de Epifanía''). The Feast of the Three Kings was traditionally commemorated on January 6 but is now celebrated on the first Sunday after the New Year. Some children leave their shoes out, in the belief that the Three Kings will leave gifts like candy or money inside. But the celebrations do not end there, since 2011, as mandated by the Catholic Church, they are on the second Sunday of January in honor of the Lord Jesus's baptism in the Jordan (the Solemnity of the Lord's Baptism or in Spanish ''Solemnidad de Bautismo del Señor''). The final salvo of these celebrations is marked by the feast of the [[Black Nazarene]] every January 9 in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, but can also, due to the celebrations in honor of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]] in the third and fourth Sundays of January in some places, can even extend till the final weeks of that month.&lt;ref name="Christmas in the Philippines"/&gt;

The famous Singaporean shopping belt [[Orchard Road]], as well as the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] area will feature lights and other decorations from early November till early January (the 2014 part is November 14, 2014 all the way until January 5, 2015). The Christmas light-up and decorated shopping malls along Orchard Road often attract numerous visitors, locals and tourists alike. Other than the light-up, other activities such as caroling, concerts and parades can also be experienced in Orchard Road. In addition, companies in Singapore usually arrange gift exchange programs on the last working day before Christmas.

===== Vietnam =====
Christmas is not a national holiday but is becoming increasingly popular in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="commuvietnam" &gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/religon-aside-christmas-gains-popularity-in-communist-vietnam/2566206.html Religion Aside, Christmas Gains Popularity in Communist Vietnam].

Retrieved January 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The ever-wealthier Vietnamese are embracing Christmas precisely because of its non-religious glamor and commercial appeal.&lt;ref name="commuvietnam" /&gt; Locals also are more exposed to Western culture, though their style of celebrating Christmas might seem unrecognizable to some Westerners. Vietnamese may be more accepting of corporate influence because for many, Christmas was never based on personal values to begin with.&lt;ref name="commuvietnam" /&gt; It's not a time to have dinner at home with family and show thanks for one another. Instead, it's a time to go out on the town, shop, and take pictures with friends in front of colorful displays, especially on December 24.&lt;ref name="commuvietnam" /&gt;

===== Armenia =====
Armenians usually celebrate Christmas on January 6. The reason for this unusual date emerges from ancient history. "In the fourth century Roman Catholic Church, officials established the date of Christmas as December 25th." &lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulevich|first1=Tanya|title=Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world|date=2000|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit|isbn=0780803876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that time, Armenians celebrated Christmas (''surb tsnunt'', Սուրբ Ծնունդ, meaning "Holy Birth") on January 6&lt;ref&gt;Hratch Tchilingirian. ''Why Armenians Celebrate Christmas on January 6''. Western Diocese, 2008, January 2&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Public holidays in Armenia|public holiday in Armenia]]. It also coincides with the Epiphany. The Armenians denied the new Roman mandate regarding Christmas, and continued to celebrate both the Nativity and Jesus’ baptism on January 6. When the Gregorian calendar was implemented in 1582, the Armenians rejected the reformed calendar and remained following the Julian Calendar. But today, only Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem still uses the Julian Calendar. Since the Julian calendar is thirteen days ahead of the Gregorian Calendar, when the Armenians of Jerusalem celebrate Christmas on January 6 according to the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar counts the day as January 19.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt;

Traditionally, Armenians fast during the week leading up to Christmas avoiding all meat, eggs, and dairy products.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt; Devout Armenians may even refrain from food for the three days leading up to the Christmas Eve, in order to receive the Eucharist on a "pure" stomach. Christmas Eve is particularly rich in traditions. Families gather for the Christmas Eve dinner (''khetum'', Խթում), which generally consists of: rice, fish, ''nevik'' (նուիկ, a vegetable dish of green chard and chick peas), and yogurt/wheat soup (''tanabur'', թանապուր). Dessert includes dried fruits and nuts, including ''rojik'', which consists of whole shelled walnuts threaded on a string and encased in grape jelly, ''bastukh'' (a paper-like confection of grape jelly, cornstarch, and flour), etc. This lighter menu is designed to ease the stomach off the week-long fast and prepare it for the rather more substantial Christmas Day dinner. Children take presents of fruits, nuts, and other candies to older relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/armenia.shtml|title=Christmas in Armenia|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "On the eve of the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany of The Lord Jesus Christ, the Jrakalouyts Divine Liturgy (the lighting of the lamps service) is celebrated in honor of the manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God (theophany)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nativity and Theophany of Our Lord "Overview"|url=http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/feastschristmas/about/|website=www.armenianchurch-ed.net|publisher=Armenian Church|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Christmas tree (''tonatsar'', Տօնածառ), Armenians (particularly in the Middle East) also erect the Nativity scene. Christmas in the Armenian tradition is a purely religious affair. Santa Claus does not visit the nice Armenian children on Christmas, but rather on New Year's Eve. The idea of Santa Claus existed before the Soviet Union and he was named '' kaghand papik'' (Կաղանդ Պապիկ), but the Soviet Union had a great impact even on Santa Claus. Now he goes by the more secular name of Grandfather Winter (''dzmerr papik'', Ձմեռ Պապիկ).

===== Assyrians =====

[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh8.JPG|thumb|Traditional ceremony during an Assyrian Christmas celebration in Alqosh, northern Iraq]]

The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], the indigenous people of northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey that belong to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] today celebrate Christmas on December 25. Assyrians colloquially call Christmas ''Eda Zora,'' meaning "little holiday." It is officially called ''Eda d'Yalde'' which means "birthday holiday." Traditionally, Assyrians fast (''sawma'') from December 1 until Christmas Day. In Iraq, for instance, on Christmas Eve, Assyrian families congregate outside of their house and hold lighted candles while a child reads aloud the nativity story. Then they all sing psalms over a bonfire made of thorn bushes. Folklore says that if the thorns burn to ashes, the family will have good luck. After the fire has been reduced to ashes, the family members will jump three times over the ashes and make a wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|title=Christmas Traditions|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207065201/http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|archivedate=December 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on Christmas, "as another bonfire burns in the churchyard, the bishops lead the service while carrying a figure of the baby Jesus. He blesses one person with a touch. That person touches the next person and the touch passes around until all have felt the touch of peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-4WhilzYkQC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=%22chaldean+Christmas%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e4k3E1GgSE&amp;sig=wPnLEzz_jcDjdSvqLgLZVwT4Quw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js97VMvKAaa1sQTRnoGYAw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false/|title=Once Upon a Time in Baghdad|author=Margo Kirtikar|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Assyrians will attend the ''Shaharta,'' or midnight vigil before Christmas. On Christmas Day, when families gather together after the ''Shaharta'' or morning mass, ''raza d'mowlada d'maran,'' the fast is broken by eating traditional Assyrian foods such as ''pacha/reesh-aqle'' (meaning "from the head to the tail"), which is a boiled soup made of sheep or cow intestines, tongue, stomach, legs, and spices or ''harissa'', a porridge made of ground wheat and chicken (both dishes are prepared usually overnight). These two dishes are only made twice a year: on Christmas and Easter. Traditional desserts eaten after the main course include Killeche, a date and walnut-stuffed cookie, and Kadeh, another stuffed pastry. After the feast is finished, Assyrians will visit the houses of family and friends to exchange Christmas greetings, saying, "''Eedokhon breekha,''" meaning "May your feast be blessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-ix-assyrian/|title=FESTIVALS ix.Assyrian|author=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the host will serve tea, Turkish coffee, and Killeche and Kadeh to guests. Although Christmas is celebrated in a much more religious fashion, in recent years, families put up a small Christmas tree in the house.

===== Lebanon =====

Christmas is an official holiday in Lebanon. Lebanese celebrate Christmas on December 25, except for [[Armenians in Lebanon|Armenian Lebanese]] who celebrate Christmas on January 6 which is also an official holiday in Lebanon. Lebanese families come together and butcher a sheep for a Christmas Eve feast, in honor of the birth of The Shepherd Jesus Christ. On that night the head of the house passes around a piece of coal representing the sins before Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/lebanon.shtml|title=Christmas in Lebanon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the piece of coal has been passed around it is then set on fire.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/lebanon_public_holidays/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703104723/http://www.ameinfo.com/lebanon_public_holidays/ |archive-date=July 3, 2003 |dead-url=yes |title=Lebanon Public Holidays &amp;#124; AME Info Country Guide &amp;#124; AMEinfo.com |accessdate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dinner, Christian Lebanese attend midnight mass.

===== Canada =====

[[File:Rideau Canal, UNESCO World Heritage.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas in [[Ottawa]], Canada]]

In the Canadian provinces where English is the predominant language, Christmas traditions are largely similar to those of the United States, with some lingering influences from the United Kingdom and newer traditions brought by immigrants from other European countries. [[Mince pie]]s, [[plum pudding]], and [[Christmas cake]] are traditionally served as Christmas dinner desserts, following the traditional meal of roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, and winter vegetables. [[Christmas cracker|Christmas table crackers]] are not uncommon and, in some parts of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]], Christmas traditions include [[mummers play|mummers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/travel/39050-mummers-fest-just-part-rocking-yuletide|title=Mummers fest just part of rocking Yuletide|work=The Chronicle Herald|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeasahuman.com/2010/arts-culture/creativity/mummering-in-nova-scotia/|title=Mummering in Nova Scotia|work=LIFE AS A HUMAN|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American influences on Christmas are evident in the hanging of stockings on Christmas Eve, to be filled by Santa Claus. However, Canadian children believe that the home of Santa Claus is located at the North Pole, in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/12/22/santa-claus-a-canadian-immigration-minister-reaffirms/|title=Santa Claus a Canadian, Immigration Minister Confirms|author=Kenyon Wallace|date=December 22, 2010|work=National Post|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, through [[Canada Post]], address thousands of letters to Santa Claus each year, using the [[Postal codes in Canada|postal code]] designation ''H0H 0H0''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/12/03/santa-canada-post-20-million_n_1126273.html|title=Canada Post's Santa Mail Expecting 20&amp;nbsp;Millionth Letter Soon|date=December 3, 2011|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decorated Christmas trees, either fresh cut or artificial, were introduced to Canada in 1781, originally by German soldiers stationed in Quebec during the American Revolution, and are now common in private homes and commercial spaces throughout most of Canada.

As Canada is a cold, dark country in winter, lights are often put up in public places and on commercial and residential buildings in November and December. Many communities have celebrations that include light events, such as the [[Cavalcade of Lights Festival]] in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/special_events/cavalcade_lights/2012/index.htm |title=Special Events Office – Festivals and Events – Living In Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |date=November 30, 2013 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312203027/http://www.toronto.ca/special_events/cavalcade_lights/2012/index.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Montreal]] Christmas Fireworks, or the Bright Nights in [[Stanley Park]], [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/bright-nights-train.aspx |title=Bright Nights Christmas Train in Stanley Park |publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national program, Christmas Lights Across Canada, illuminates Ottawa, the national capital, and the 13 provincial and territorial capitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2011/11/26/canadian-christmas-region-by-region/ Canadian Christmas Region by Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129001829/http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2011/11/26/canadian-christmas-region-by-region/ |date=November 29, 2011 }}, Ottawa Citizen, November 26, 2011, Retrieved November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Christmas Message]] from the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] is televised nationwide in Canada, the occasion being an observance which unites Canadians with citizens of the other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] worldwide. The observation of [[Boxing Day]] on the day following Christmas Day is a tradition practiced in Canada, as it is in many other Anglophone countries, although not in the United States. In Canada, Boxing Day is a day (or the beginning of a few days) of deeply discounted sale prices at retail stores which attract large numbers of shoppers in search of bargains.

===== Mexico =====
{{see also|Christmas in Mexico}}

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Mexico|statutory holiday in Mexico]] and workers can have the day off with pay. Mexico's
Christmas is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion of when the parents of the unborn baby Jesus Christ looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a candy-filled [[piñata]].

Mexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the feast of La Guadalupana ([[Virgin of Guadalupe]]), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas season into what is known as the [[Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon]]. At midnight on Christmas, many families place the figure of baby Jesus in their ''nacimientos'' ([[Nativity scene]]s), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole. In the center and south of Mexico, children receive gifts on Christmas Eve and on January 6, they celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men (3 Wizard Kings) brought gifts to Bethlehem for Jesus Christ. Santa Claus (or Santa Clos, as he's known in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/mexicanchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Mexico |work=Santas.net |publisher=Australian Media Pty Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is who brings the children their gifts, but traditionally the Three Wise Men will fill the children's shoes with candies, oranges, tangerines, nuts, and sugar cane, and sometimes money or gold. For the Three Wise Men gave Baby Jesus Gold for his future.

The [[Christmas and holiday season]] begins around the end of November with a major shopping kickoff on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the day after the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving]], though Christmas decorations and music playing in stores sometimes extend into the period between [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving. Many schools and businesses are closed during the period between Christmas and the [[New Year's Day]] holiday, which is a time commonly used to spend time with family and close friends, return unwanted gifts at stores, and shop after-Christmas sales. Most decorations are taken down by New Years or Epiphany. Other observances considered part of the season (and potentially included in non-denominational [[holiday greetings]] like "Happy Holidays") include [[Hanukkah]], [[Yule]], Epiphany, [[Kwanzaa]], and [[winter solstice]] celebrations.

The interior and exterior of houses are decorated during the weeks leading up to Christmas Eve. Christmas tree farms in the [[Christmas tree cultivation in the United States|United States]] and [[Christmas tree production in Canada|Canada]] provide families with trees for their homes, many opting for [[Artificial Christmas tree|artificial ones]], but some for [[Christmas tree|real ones]]. The Christmas tree usually stands centrally in the home, decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights, with an angel or a star symbolizing the [[Star of Bethlehem]] at the top.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofchristmas.com"/&gt;

Christmas Eve is popularly described as "[['Twas the Night Before Christmas|the night before Christmas]]" in the poem actually titled "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]". Better known as [[Santa Claus]], he is said to visit homes while children are sleeping during the night before Christmas morning. The [[fireplace]]s in many homes have been replaced by [[electric fireplace]]s, but the [[yule log]] has remained a tradition. [[Christmas stockings]] are hung on the [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]] for Santa Claus to fill with little gifts ("stocking stuffers"). It is tradition throughout the United States for children to leave a glass of milk and plate of [[Christmas cookies]] for Santa Claus nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allhomemadecookies.com/articles/christmastraditions.htm |title=Christmas Traditions and Holiday Cookies |author=Hart Dowd |publisher=allhomemadecookies.com |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presents the family will exchange are wrapped and placed near the tree, including presents to be given to pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/business-headlines/ci_16886888?nclick_check=1 |title=A very furry Christmas |publisher=Contracostatimes.com |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends exchange wrapped presents and tell each other not to open presents before Christmas. Grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, siblings and occasionally guests from out of town are entertained in the home or else visited. Wrapped presents are most commonly opened on the morning of Christmas Day; however, some families choose to open all or some of their presents on Christmas Eve, depending on evolving family traditions, logistics, and the age of the children involved; for example, adults might open their presents on Christmas Eve and minor children on Christmas morning, or everyone might open their gifts on Christmas morning. Others follow the tradition of opening family-exchanged gifts on Christmas Eve night, followed by opening of the presents Santa brought on Christmas morning. Children are normally allowed to play with their new toys and games afterwards.

The traditional Christmas dinner usually features either roasted [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[Stuffed turkey|stuffing]] (sometimes called dressing), [[ham]], or [[roast beef]]. Potatoes, squash, roasted vegetables and [[cranberry sauce]] are served along with [[Soft drink|tonics]] and [[sherry|sherries]]. A variety of sweet [[pastry]] and [[egg nog]] sprinkled with [[cinnamon]] and [[nutmeg]] are served in the United States. Certain dishes such as [[casserole]]s and desserts are prepared with a [[Family cookbooks|family recipe]] (usually kept a secret{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}). Sometimes, families also partake in a religious tradition, such as the consumption of a [[Christmas wafer]] in Christian families of European ancestry.

Other traditions include a special church service on the Sunday before Christmas and [[Midnight Mass]] on Christmas Eve. Candlelight services are held earlier in the evening for families with children. A re-enactment of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] called a [[Nativity play]] is another tradition.

Christmas-related tourist attractions, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree and elaborate animated [[department store]] [[Christmas window]]s in [[New York City]] are heavily visited by tourists from all over the world. [[Christmas music]] can be heard in the background. The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] is one whose annual carol singing is well-recognized. Christmas [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]] and choral presentation such as [[Handel's Messiah|Handel's ''Messiah'']] and performances of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' ballet are attended.

Of particular note is the observance of Christmas for military families of soldiers and sailors serving abroad, on both sides of the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–U.S. border]]. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] have made it a tradition, since they relocated from [[Minneapolis]] prior to the [[1960-61 NBA season]], to have a home game on Christmas.

===== El Salvador =====
Christmas for El Salvador still carries a strong meaning that brings families together. Despite the business on the streets and the red, green and white colors flooding the environment, Salvadoran people try to honor what they consider to be the true meaning of Christmas, the birth of Jesus.
In El Salvador children celebrate Christmas by playing with [[firecracker]]s, fountains, such as the small ''volcancitos'' ("little volcanos") and sparklers, ''estrellitas'' ("little stars"). Teenagers and young adults display bigger [[fireworks]] or [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman Candle]]s. Families also have parties in which they dance and eat. 
Santa Claus is known for appearing in TV and print ads, but people ask children if they already wrote a letter to little baby Jesus. Traditional Salvadoran Christmas dishes are sauteed turkey sandwiches in a baguette with lettuce and radishes, [[Salvadoran Tamales]], and sweet bread for dessert. Drinks include [[hot chocolate]], [[pineapple]] juice, Salvadoran [[horchata]], Cherry Salvadoran horchata, and coffee. At 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 25 everyone gathers around the [[Christmas tree]] and opens their presents.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Ibira at cnight.jpg|thumb|left|[[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]'s Christmas Tree and water fountains at [[Ibirapuera Park]]]]

Christmas Day on December 25 is a [[Public holidays in Brazil|national holiday in Brazil]]. But because Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, Brazilians celebrate Christmas in the summer. In the small cities in the entire country, as well as in the largest cities, like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Brasília, Manaus, Belém, Natal and Belo Horizonte, the celebrations resemble in many ways the traditions in Europe and North America, with the Christmas tree, the exchanging of gifts and Christmas cards, the decoration of houses and buildings with electric lights and the nativity scene. Despite the warm tropical summer weather, some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon. In some cities like [[Guarapuava]], there are decoration contests, when judges go to houses to look at the decorations, inside or outside of the house, and decide the most beautiful house. Christmas Eve is the most important day. Unlike in the North American and Anglo-Saxon tradition, Christmas takes action mainly near midnight, usually with big family dinners, opening of gifts and the celebration of the "Missa do Galo" (the rooster's mass) in churches throughout the nation.

Many Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree, there is no rule, the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a Nativity scene as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called "[[rabanada]]". Along with their meals, Brazilians typically drink champagne, wine, and fruit punch. Typically after they eat, many Brazilians attend a Midnight Mass service or watch the Pope's television broadcast celebration of "Midnight Mass in Rome" with family and friends.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1159225.Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|title=Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|publisher=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Colombia =====

[[File:Christmas2004inMedellín.JPG|thumb|[[Medellín River]] during the [[Christmas lights in Medellín|Lighting of Medellin]]]]

Christmas is a [[Public holidays in Colombia|public holiday in Colombia]] and is primarily a religious celebration. Presents are brought by ''El Niño Jesus / Niño Dios'' (Baby Jesus).

While Christmas decorations may be put up as early as the beginning of November, the unofficial start of Colombian Christmas festivities takes place on December 7, [[Día de las Velitas]], or "Day of the Candles." At night, the streets, sidewalks, balconies, porches, and driveways are decorated with candles and paper lanterns, which illuminate cities and towns in a yellow glow to honor the Immaculate Conception on the following day, December 8. In many cities, and even in small rural towns, neighborhoods get together and decorate their whole neighborhood or street, turning streets into virtual "tunnels of light." Many radio stations and local organizations hold contests for the best display of lights, making the competition for the best light show a serious event. The city of Medellín has become a popular tourist destination during the holiday season because of its [[Christmas lights in Medellín|Christmas lights]]. Activities such as musical events and firework displays are planned by cities and held during this time. Individually launched fireworks were a common item during the Christmas season in Colombia, often going on at any time of the day in many cities. However, a recent ban has decreased the individual use of fireworks, and now only cities or towns are able to hold firework displays.

December 16 is the first day of the Christmas [[Novena]], a devotion consisting of prayer said on nine successive days, the last one held on Christmas Eve. The Novena is promoted by the Catholic Church as a staple of Christmas, and is very similar to the [[Las Posadas|posadas]] celebrated in Mexico. It is a call for an understanding of the religious meaning of Christmas, and a way to counter the commercialism of the Christmas season. Individual traditions concerning the Novena may vary, but most families set up a "pesebre" (manger scene), sing religious Christmas carols called [[villancicos]] accompanied by tambourines, bells, and other simple percussion instruments, and read verses from the Bible as well as an interpretation which may change from year to year. Novenas serve as beautiful religious gatherings as well as learning environments for young children since kids have a central and active role in the celebration of the Novenas (they read prayers, sing, and play instruments guided by their family). From December 16 to 24, games called "aguinaldos"&lt;ref name="aguinaldos-colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|title=Colombia Aprende – A jugar aguinaldos|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are played after having made a "pinky promise" deciding the prize for the winner and the punishment for the loser. The games include "Hablar y no contestar" (Talk but don't answer), "Dé pero no reciben" (Give but don't receive), "Pajita en boca" (Straw in the mouth), "Tres pies" (Three feet), "Beso robado" (Stolen kisses), and "Si y al no" (Yes or no). Churches offer dawn and nightly masses during the nine days of the novena, culminating with the [[Misa de Gallo]] (Rooster's Mass) on Christmas Eve at midnight.

Christmas Eve is the most important day of Christmas in Colombia. Families and friends get together to pray the last Novena and wait until midnight to open the presents, parties are held until sunrise on [[Christmas Day]], kids stay up late playing with their new presents, and fireworks fill the skies. Families gather around meals, music, and singing. Because Christmas Eve is the most important day, little occurs on December 25. Families join Christmas Day mass although it is not nearly as festive as Christmas Eve.

The "Dia de los Santos Inocentes", or the [[Day of the Innocents]], falls in the Christmas season, on December 28. The day commemorates the innocent infants (called the innocent ones) who were said to have been killed by [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in fear of the power of the newborn baby, Jesus. January 6, the day of the Revelation of the Magi (Epiphany), is called "Reyes Magos" (from [[The Three Magi]]), used to be a day of gift giving, but is celebrated less now since gifts are given mostly around Christmas Eve today. Some families still give presents, and it is also the day when godparents give Christmas presents.

===== Venezuela =====

[[File:Paradura del niño, Baruta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Different moments of [[Paradura del Niño]], Venezuelan tradition celebrated on February 2]]

In Venezuela, Christmas is celebrated as a religious occasion. As in Colombia, the presents are brought by "El Niño Jesus" (Baby Jesus) instead of "Papá Noél" (Santa Claus), that still has an important role during this season.

The unofficial start of the Christmas festivities is after the celebrations of "[[Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá#Annual Celebration|Feria de la Chinita]]", the second half of November. The origin of this festival is the cult to Virgin Mary of [[Chiquinquirá]], when various religious activities, processions, and music in the typical "[[Gaita (music style)|Gaita style]]" to honor "La [[Chinita]]" (nickname of this Virgin). This event takes place in the Zulia Region, specifically in Maracaibo (the regional capital). After this, other cities join in the festivities and many activities take place including musical events and firework displays.

In many cities, small rural towns and neighborhoods get together for the "patinatas" night festivals where children go and play with skateboards, roller blades and bicycles. These events are usually sponsored by the local church, where neighbors organize themselves and sell typical Christmas food, hot chocolate, [[hallaca]], cookies, etc. Also still in some neighborhoods there is the "[[Parranda]]" where people go from one house to house with music and Christmas songs. The singers stops at neighbors' houses to get some food and drinks. Also in the Venezuelan Andes there is the same tradition of this kind of event but they carry an image of "baby Jesus" and this is called "[[Paradura del Niño]]." Children write request letters to Baby Jesus. The presents are sent by Baby Jesus at midnight, and most people have a party, which goes on until sunrise.

==== Caribbean ====

===== Bahamas =====
[[Junkanoo]] festivals are held from Christmas Day morning until sunrise on December 27 after Boxing Day and held again on New Year's Day. It is a carnival featuring parading bands in colorful costumes, singing, dancing, and decorations.

Bahamian Christmas foods include black cake, imported apples, pepper pot, pickled onions and ham. Drinks like ginger-beer, sorrel, mauby, and sweet potato fly are served on Christmas.

===== Cuba =====
Cuba had a long tradition of celebrating Christmas. Families used to gather at the dining table, and used to go to mass after dinner.
The Communist Regime led by Fidel Castro abolished the paid Christmas holiday in 1969, citing that workers were needed to continue the sugar harvest. In 1998, the Regime declared December 25 a leisure day, as requested by Pope John Paul II as a condition to visit the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cuba-ends-its-30year-ban-on-christmas-1193525.html|title=Cuba ends its 30-year ban on Christmas|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a one-day public holiday and it is celebrated only in the evening.

===== Jamaica =====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Radio stations play Christmas carols as early as October, reggae style and some international. Jamaicans paint their houses and hang new curtains for Christmas. Pepper lights, the local name for Christmas lights, go up even on trees.

[[Junkanoo]] or John Canoe is a traditional Christmas celebration in Jamaica, influenced by African ancestors. This includes street dancing and a great parade through the streets with Jamaicans dressed in colorful masquerade costumes in which masks are worn.

The traditional Jamaican Christmas meal includes [[ackee]], saltfish, breadfruit, fried plantains, boiled bananas, freshly squeezed fruit juice and tea for breakfast; chicken, [[curried goat]], stewed oxtail, rice and [[gungo peas]] for dinner. For dessert, [[sorrel drink]] and a Jamaican rum fruitcake along with red wine are served in many homes.

Many people attend church for Christmas Eve or Christmas morning worship service.

Sometimes on Christmas Eve people or children to go the Grand Market where you walk with family and friends and buy whatever you want and you go home 2:00 or 3:00&amp;nbsp;am Christmas Day.

Some British Christmas traditions have stayed in Jamaica, like Father Christmas, roast beef or lamb dinners, Boxing Day, etc.

=== Europe ===

==== Central Europe ====
{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Adventskranz von oben.jpg|thumb|Christmas wreath]]

In countries of Central Europe (for this purpose, roughly defined as the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and possibly other places) the main celebration date for the general public is Christmas Eve (December 24). The day is usually a fasting day; in some places children are told they'll see a ''golden pig'' if they hold fast until after dinner. When the evening comes preparation of Christmas Dinner starts. Traditions concerning dinner vary from region to region, for example, in Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, the prevailing meal is fried [[carp]] with potato salad and fish (or cabbage) soup. However, in some places the tradition is porridge with mushrooms (a modest dish), and elsewhere the dinner is exceptionally rich, with up to 12 dishes. This in fact reveals that when Christmas comes around all the kids get presents from neighbours and house guest. Even the house pet got a little something to gnaw on.

After the dinner comes the time for gifts. Children usually find their gifts under the Christmas Tree, with name stickers. An interesting example of complicated history of the region is the "fight" between Christmas beings. During communism, when countries of Central Europe were under Soviet influence, communist authorities strongly pushed Russian traditional ''Ded Moroz'' ("Grandfather Frost") in the place of Little Jesus won. Now [[Santa Claus]] is attacking, by means of advertising and Hollywood film production. Many people, Christians as well as people with just a Christian background, go to [[Roman Catholic]] midnight mass celebration.

Other common attributes of Christmas in Central Europe include Christmas trees, mistletoe, Christmas garlands, and Bethlehem cribs.

In many areas of Central Europe, St. Nicholas (Hungarian: Mikulás, Czech: Mikuláš, Polish: Mikołaj, Slovak: Mikuláš, Slovene: Miklavž), or Santa Claus, does not come for Christmas. He visits families earlier, on the dawn of St. Nicholas Day on December 6, and for the well-behaved children he has presents and candy-bags to put into their well polished shoes that were set in the windows the previous evening. Although he neither parks his sleigh on rooftops nor climbs chimneys, his visits are usually accompanied by a diabolic-looking servant named Krampusz (in Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia: Krampus, in Czech and Slovak regions he is simply "čert", i.e. devil, without any name) who gives golden coloured birches for so called badly behaved children. Actually all children get both gifts and golden birches (Hungarian: ''virgács'') in their shoes, no matter how they behaved themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |title=Hungarian Heritage Museum |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815122913/http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Austria and Germany =====
{{Main article|Weihnachten}}

[[File:Advent Bowl Rusch.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Advent bowl]]

In some German-speaking communities, in the  German-speaking Europe; particularly in Catholic regions of western and southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, South Tyrol and Liechtenstein, as well as in other Catholic regions of Central Europe, the ''[[Christkind]]'' (literally "Christ child") brings the presents on the evening of December 24 (Holy Evening or Heiliger Abend).&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: a candid history, University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68–79}} The Christkind is invisible; thus he is never seen by anyone. However, he rings a bell just before he leaves in order to let children know that the Christmas tree and the presents are ready.

It is a tradition to lavishly decorate a Christmas tree in the days directly before Christmas or on the morning of Christmas Eve. On late Christmas Eve, after the bell rings, the tree is shown to the children and presents are exchanged.

In [[Protestant church]]es, there is a service in the late afternoon intended to immediately precede the [[Christmas Eve]] meal and the exchanging of gifts. This service, called ''Christvesper'', consists most often of scriptural readings, the Christmas Gospel from Luke 2, a ''Krippenspiel'' (nativity play), favourite Christmas carols and festive music for organ and choirs. In some regions the tradition of ''[[Quempas]] singing'' is still popular. Some Lutheran churches also celebrate a candlelight service at midnight besides the Christmas Vespers in the afternoon or early evening.

Many Catholic churches also have a first Mass of Christmas, called ''Christmette'', on "Heiliger Abend" about 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. for the children and parents to attend before the families return home for their meal. The crib is a very important part of the celebrations in Catholic areas especially [[Bavaria]].

====== Austria ======

[[File:Wien Rathaus Christkindlmarkt Dez2006B.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas market in front of the town hall in [[Vienna]], Austria]]

In the largely Catholic Austria, [[Christmas markets]] are a long-standing tradition. In [[Vienna]], for instance, the market is held in the large square in front of City Hall. [[Innsbruck]] opens its romantic Christmas market in the narrow medieval square at the foot of the Golden Roof. In [[Salzburg]], the Christmas market takes over the square in front of the Cathedral with its picturesque stalls, while the tree vendors occupy Residenzplatz on the side of the huge Cathedral. However almost every small town has its own Christmas market.

In Austria, Christmas trees play a very important part of Christmas celebrations. Every town sets up its own huge tree on the main square all decorated with candles, ornaments and candies and frequently there will be an extra one, adorned with bread crumbs, for the birds. In families the tree is decorated with gold and silver ornaments or stars made out of straw, sweets and candy wrapped in tinfoil, gilded nuts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austria.info/us/people-and-traditions/christmas-season-in-austria-1084204.html|title=Christmas Season in Austria|work=austria.info|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast of [[St Nicholas]] marks the beginning of Christmas in Austria. On Christmas Eve (December 24) the tree is lit for the first time and the whole family gathers to sing [[Christmas carols]] like "Silent Night, Holy Night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/austria.shtml|title=Christmas in Austria|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts that are placed under the tree are opened after dinner on Christmas Eve. Austrian Christmas tradition has it that it is the Christ Child himself who decorates the Christmas tree on [[Christmas Eve]] and brings the children their Christmas presents, and it is to him that their letters and wish lists are addressed in the weeks before Christmas. The Christmas Eve dinner is the main event of the night often served with fried carp. The famous [[sachertorte]] and different kinds of chocolates are served as dessert. The Austrians also have special crescent shaped cookies served during Christmas time.

====== Germany ======

[[File:2014-12 Engel+Bergmann beleuchtet.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Traditional [[Miner's figure]]s as Christmas  light bearers ]]

In Germany Christmas traditions vary by region. Till the reformation [[Saint Nicholas Day#St. Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' Day]], December 6, Saint Nicholas was the main provider of Christmas presents. Nikolaus still puts goodies in children's shoes on that day. Sometimes St. Nicholas visits children in kindergarten, schools or at public events. They have to recite a short poem or sing a song in order to get sweets or a small gift. "[[Knecht Ruprecht]]" (the servant Ruprecht) – dressed in dark clothes with devil-like traits (usually noted as a long, bright red tongue and with a stick or a small whip in the hand) – sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. His duty is to punish those children who haven't behaved during the year. Usually he doesn't have much to do. He merely stands near St. Nicholas as a warning to be good and polite. Nikolaus  as well for some Glühwein for adults, there are some traditions connected with local firefighters, riders associations and church congregations.

The [[Sorbs]], a minority in Saxony and parts of Brandenbuerg with a language similar to Polish, have some specific traditions. E.g. in [[Jänschwalde]], the ''Bescherkind'' [[Janšojski bog]] ("presents kid") is visiting the neighbors, a girl dressed in local costume and veil and goes around with two companions at the Wednesday before Christmas. It provides smaller presents like sweets, similar to the Nikolaus and provides blessings, stays however silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|title=Deutsche Botschaft Bern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition in Saxony is related to the [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains]], especially [[Seiffen]] provides Christmas related decorations like [[Christmas pyramid]] and toys around the year. [[Letters to Santa|Christmas letters]] may be addressed e.g. to [[Engelskirchen]] (Angel's church) or [[Himmelpforten]] (Heaven's gate) or some other in municipalities with matching names. After privatization, [[Deutsche Post]] kept the tradition of dedicated Christmas offices, one in each state, answering letters and requests from children.

Currently the actual Christmas gift-giving (German: "Bescherung") usually takes place on [[Christmas Eve]]. This tradition was introduced by [[Protestant Reformation|Reformator]], [[Martin Luther]], as he as of the opinion that one should put the emphasis on Christ's birth and not on a saint's day and do away with the connotation that gifts have to be earned by good behavior. The gifts should be seen as a symbol for the gift of God's grace in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Eugen: Weihnachten im Wandel der Zeiten, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2. Aufl. Darmstadt 2000, pp. 34 – 35&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition quickly became common in predominantly Catholic regions as well.

Gifts may be brought by the ''Weihnachtsmann'' (translation, "Christmas man"), who resembles either St. Nicholas or the [[American Santa Claus]], or by ''[[Christkind]]l'', a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;{{rp|68–79}} Till 1930, there was sort of south north divide between the realms of southern and silesian Christkind and Nordic Weihnachtsmann. After the gifts are opened the children often stay up as late as they like, often till the early hours of the morning.

The Christmas Tree is first put up and decorated on the morning of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is standing, lights the candles and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still a custom to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening up the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service "Christmette" after the evening meal and gift-giving.

The culinary feast either takes place at supper on Christmas Eve or on the first day of Christmas. Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blcmasvoc.htm |title=German Christmas Vocabulary |publisher=German.about.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potato salad with frankfurter or wiener-sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a [[fast day]], is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Pomerania]], many families prefer [[kale]] with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat [[fondue]] or [[raclette]]. In almost all families in all parts of Germany you find a wide variety of Christmas cookies baked according to recipes typical for the family and the region.

"Lüttenweihnachten" describes the hunting and forestry custom of providing a Christmas tree with food decorated for animals.

===== Czech Republic and Slovakia =====

[[File:Christmas in Prague's Old Town Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Town Square]] in Prague, Czech Republic – Christmastime]]

{{Main article|Czech Christmas Mass}}

Christmas Eve (December 24) is celebrated as ''Štědrý den/Štedrý deň'', which means "Generous Day", when the gifts are given in the evening. The December 25 and 26 are [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic]] and [[Public holidays in Slovakia|in Slovakia]], but ''Vánoce/Vianoce'' (Christmas), is most commonly associated with the 24th.

According to tradition, gifts are brought by ''Ježíšek/Ježiško'', or "baby Jesus". Fish soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad are a traditional dish for the dinner. In Slovakia, before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other by sharing a piece of Christmas wafer (Oblátky) with honey and walnuts. Traditional dinner depends on region, but common Christmas dinner is cabbage soup (Kapustnica) or lentil soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad or hand made gnocchi with poppy (šúľanky s makom). The gifts are surreptitiously placed under the Christmas tree (usually a [[spruce]] or [[pine]] and lately fir), usually just before or during dinner. Children have to wait for the ringing of a Christmas bell (one of the decorations on the Christmas tree) – the sign that ''Ježíšek/Ježiško'' (little Jesus) has just passed by – to run for the presents. That happens at the end of their Christmas dinner. There is a rich tradition of hard baked Christmas sweets (''Cukroví/vianočné koláče'').

Other Czech and Slovak Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise: if a perfect star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, distorted star means a bad year or illness, while a cross may suggest death. Girls throw shoes over their shoulders – if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married soon. Another tradition requires pouring some molten lead into water and guessing a message from its shapes.

In Catholic Slovakia, the tradition of [[Jasličkári]] involves young men dressed as shepherds or angels visiting their neighbors and presenting recitations and songs about the story of the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ball2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjI9YQBFDGYC&amp;pg=PA271|accessdate=November 20, 2015|year=2003|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=9780879739102|pages=271–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hungary =====
{{Main article|Christmas in Hungary}}
The Christmas and gift-giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, [[Mikulás|Mikulás (or Szent Miklós)]] traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of December 5, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, December 6.

Although the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before St. Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for Mikulás to come by and fill it with treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/hungary/ |title=St. Nicholas Around the World: Hungary |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, celebrations begin with Christmas tree decoration and gift packaging during daytime on December 24, then comes a family dinner with traditional Christmas meals. In some parts of Hungary, a traditional supper called [[fish soup]] ''halászlé'' is served at Christmas Eve meal, although it is also consumed at other times of the year. The day is otherwise a fast-day.

[[File:Budapest-Baumkuchen 6361.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kürtőskalács]] in Budapest]]

In the evening (Christmas Eve, in Hungarian: Szenteste) the Angel or the Little (Baby) Jesus (Hungarian: Kisjézus or Jézuska) delivers the presents. This is the most intimate moment of Christmas, featuring warmly lit Christmas tree and candles, soft Christmas music, family singing of Christmas or religious songs and gift pack openings. There is also a popular folk custom during December and especially on Christmas Eve, in which children or adults present the birth of Jesus. The custom is called 'playing Bethlehem' (Hungarian: Betlehemezés), and it is an acting performance, where the 'actors' are wearing costumes, and telling stories about the three kings, the shepherds, Mary, Joseph and of course the birth of the Holy Child. A Christmas crib and a church are used as the scene. The actors go from house to house, and they receive gifts for their performance.

[[File:Kolędnicy 2008.JPG|thumb|Carollers walk from house to house receiving treats along the way]]

In the largely Roman Catholic Poland, Christmas Eve begins with a day of fasting and then a night of feasting. The traditional Christmas meal is known as [[Wigilia]] ("The [[Vigil]]"), and being invited to attend a Wigilia dinner with a family is considered a high honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/poland.htm |title=Christmas traditions in Poland |publisher=Thehistoryofchristmas.com |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the night of Christmas Eve, the appearance of the first star in the sky is watched for, in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of "the little star" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, "The star has come!" After the first star appearance is declared, the family members sit down to a dinner table.&lt;ref name="pmkamsterdam" /&gt;

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. The dinner contains twelve dishes, one for each Apostle. In many homes, an extra place setting is set. The empty setting is symbolically left at the table for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, an angel, the [[Baby Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit should appear to share the feast.

Before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other. The supper begins with the breaking of the [[opłatek]]. By sharing a piece of [[Christmas wafer]] (''Opłatki''), when everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The opłatek is usually blessed by the presiding Bishop, and stamped with a religious image, such as the nativity scene, they then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.

A traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[barszcz]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (translated as "little ears", also known as meatless ravioli). The most common dishes are fish soup, with potato salad, [[pierogi]], [[gołąbki]] filled with [[kasza]], pickled [[herring]] and fruit [[kompot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/poland.shtml |title=Christmas in Poland |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, herring fillets, herring in [[aspic]] and for dessert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. etc. Dishes beside fish are usually [[cabbage]]-, forest mushroom- (like [[boletus]]) and [[poppyseed]]-based, with herring being very important. After supper the Star Man arrives attended by the Star Boys. They are dressed as Wise Men or animals or other figures. The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.
The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that "The Little Star" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity.&lt;ref name="pmkamsterdam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |title=Boże Narodzenie i polskie tradycje, |publisher= |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses.

The following day is often spent visiting friends.

The giftbearer varies. In some regions it is Święty Mikołaj (Saint Nicholas), in others Święty Mikołaj gives his gifts on December 6 and the giftbringer of the Christmas Eve is Gwiazdor ("star man"), Aniołek ("little angel") or Dzieciątko ("baby Jesus").

===== Romania and Moldova =====

[[File:Sibiu Christmas Market opening 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Christmas market in Sibiu, Romania]]

Christmas (Romanian: ''Crăciun'') in Romania is on December 25 and is generally considered the second most important religious [[Public holidays in Romania|Romanian holiday]] after Easter.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In Moldova, although Christmas is celebrated on December 25 like in Romania, January 7 is also recognized as an [[Public holidays in Moldova|official holiday]]. Celebrations begin with the decoration of the Christmas tree during daytime on December 24, and in the evening (Christmas Eve, in Romanian: Ajunul Crăciunului) ''Moş Crăciun'' (Father Christmas) delivers the presents.

The singing of carols is a very important part of Romanian Christmas festivities. On the first day of Christmas, many carolers walk through the streets of the towns and villages, holding a star made of cardboard and paper on which are depicted various scenes from the Bible. Romanian tradition has the smallest children going from house to house, singing carols and reciting poems and legends during the whole Christmas season. The leader of the group carries with him a star made of wood, covered with metal foil and decorated with bells and coloured ribbons. An image of the Nativity is painted on the star's centre, and this piece of handiwork is attached to the end of a broom or other long stick.

Romanian food served during the holidays is a hearty multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro}} [http://jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/recurs-la-romania/ignat-sarbatoare-insangerata-112680.html Ignat, sărbătoare insăngerată], December 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====

Since the 1880s, the Christmas customs of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] countries have included a similar character known as ''[[Ded Moroz]]'' ("Grandfather Frost"). According to legend, he travels in a magical ''sanki'' — a decorated [[sleigh]] drawn by reindeer (or three white horses). With his young, blond assistant ''[[Snegurochka]]'' (the "Snow Maiden", said to be his granddaughter) at his side, he visits homes and gives gifts to good children (not true for former Yugoslavian countries). He only delivers presents to children while they are asleep, and unlike Santa, he does not travel down chimneys, coming instead to the front door of children's homes. It is traditional for children to leave food for Ded Moroz.

This Ded Moroz (in Russia, ''Ded Moroz'') is not identified nor in any way associated with [[Saint Nicholas of Myra]] ([[feast day]], December 6), who is very widely revered in Eastern Europe for his clerical and charitable works as a bishop. In all likelihood, Ded Moroz is actually in Slavic tradition like Santa Claus, any connection to the original saint having long since disappeared.

===== Georgia =====

[[File:Alilo 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Children at the Alilo march in the streets of [[Tbilisi]]]]

On [[Public holidays in Georgia|calendars in Georgia]], Christmas ({{lang-ka|შობა}}, ''shoba'') is celebrated on January 7 (December 25 on the Julian calendar). It is traditional in Georgia to go on [[Alilo]] (a modified pronunciation of Alleluia), a mass walk in the streets, dressed in special clothing to celebrate and congratulate each other. Most members of the Alilo march are children and they are given sweets by the adults. The Alilo carols vary across the [[mkhare|provinces]] of Georgia. In most songs these words are used: "ოცდახუთსა დეკემბერსა, ქრისტე იშვა ბეთლემსაო'" (''otsdakhutsa dekembersa qriste ishva betlemsao'') – "on 25th December Christ was born in Bethlehem". A local variant of the Christmas tree, called [[Chichilaki]], is made of soft wooden material with curled branches. Sometimes it is hazelnut branch which is carved into a [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]-like shape and decorated with fruits and sweets. The Western custom of a Christmas tree (''nadzvis khe'') is also popular and has been imported through Russia. The Georgian equivalent of "Santa Claus" is known as ''tovlis papa'' (or ''tovlis babua'' in western [[Georgian dialects]]), literally meaning a "Grandfather snow", and is traditionally portrayed with long white beard, dressed in national costume "[[chokha]]" and wearing a fur cloak "nabadi".

===== Russia =====
{{Main article|Christmas in Russia}}

[[File:Place pres de la gare Moscou.jpg|thumb|New Year decorations in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]]]

As in some other Eastern Orthodox countries, and due to the 13-day difference between the newer Gregorian, and older Julian Calendars, Christmas is celebrated on January 7. Unlike its Western counterparts, Christmas is mainly a religious event in Russia. On Christmas Eve (January 6), there are several long services, including the [[Royal Hours]] and Vespers combined with the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve "[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Holy Supper]]", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honor each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the "всеночная" [[All Night Vigil]]. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the "заутренняя" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a [[Public holidays in Russia|national holiday in Russia]], as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.

During the Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the officially atheist state. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, the Christmas tradition was adopted as part of the secular [[New Year's Eve#Russia|New Year]] celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or "ёлка" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving "Ded Moroz" (Дед Мороз "[[Grandfather Frost]]") and his granddaughter, "Snegurochka" (Снегурочка "[[The Snowmaiden]]"). Many of these were brought to Russia by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] after his Western travels in the late 17th century. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===== Ukraine =====
{{Main article|Christmas in Ukraine}}

[[File:Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper.jpg|thumb|right|Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, [[Ukraine]]]]

''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' or "Holy Supper" is the central tradition of the Christmas Eve celebrations in Ukrainian homes and takes place in most parts of the country on January 6. In Western Ukraine, especially in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], due to historical multi-culturism, Christmas can be observed twice—on December 25 and January 7, often irrespective of whether the family belongs to [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the (Roman) Catholic Church, one of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (disambiguation)|Ukrainian Orthodox Churches]], or one of the Protestant denominations. The Western Ukrainian tradition of two Christmas celebrations, since 2017, are also celebrated nationwide as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ukraine-seeks-distance-from-moscow-with-new-christmas-holiday/article/507753|title=Ukraine seeks distance from Moscow with new Christmas holiday|website=m.digitaljournal.com|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-42008437|title=Рада зробила 25 грудня вихідним днем|date=November 16, 2017|work=BBC Україна|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, which symbolizes the trek of the Three Wise Men, the Sviata Vechera may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means literally "grandfather spirit" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. The dinner table sometimes has a few wisps of hay on the embroidered table cloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. A prayer is said and the father says the traditional Christmas greeting, "Chrystos rodyvsya!" which is translated to "Christ is born!", which is answered by the family with "Slavite Yoho!" which means "Let us glorify him!". In some families the Old Slavic form "Сhrystos rozhdayetsya!" is used. At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings Ukrainian Christmas Carols. In many communities the old Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.

Traditionally, Christmas Day opens for Ukrainian families with attendance in church services (Mass, worship service or Divine Liturgy). Ukrainian churches offer services starting before midnight on Christmas Eve and on Christmas morning. Christmas supper, without Lenten restrictions, does not have as many traditions connected with it as Sviata Vechera. The old tradition in Ukraine of giving gifts to children on St. Nicholas Day, December 19, has generally been replaced by the Christmas date and it is the Father Frost who visits all the children in a sleigh pulled by only three reindeer. (In Western Ukraine the St. Nicholas Day is marked there on December 6.)

==== Northern Europe ====
{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2011}}

In much of Northern Europe Christmas is celebrated on December 24 and is referred to as ''Jul'' (see [[Yule]]), while December 25 is a relaxed day for visiting relatives. "Yule" may come from the Norse word hweol, jól, meaning wheel, and [[Old English]] [[géol]]. The Norse believed that the sun was a great wheel of fire that rolled towards and then away from the earth.

===== Denmark =====
{{Main article|Jul (Denmark)}}

[[File:Julemiddag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional [[Danish people|Danish]] Christmas dinner]]

Danes celebrate on December 24, which is referred to as ''Juleaften'' (literally "Yule evening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|title=Traditions in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evening meal with the family consists of either roast pork, roast duck or roast goose and eaten with potatoes, plenty of gravy, and red cabbage or finely chopped kale boiled in butter. Also caramelized potatoes is an important part of the Dane's Christmas dinner. For dessert rice pudding is traditionally served – composed largely of whipped cream and accompanied by lashings of black cherry sauce. The rice pudding also contains chopped peeled almonds, and a single whole peeled almond. Whoever finds the whole almond will have good luck for the coming year, and the lucky finder is entitled to a small gift, ''Mandelgave''.
After the meal is complete, the family gathers around the Christmas tree and sings Christmas songs and hymns while holding hands and dancing in circles, and may even tour the house, still holding hands and singing. When the singing is complete, traditions vary. In some traditions, the family will select one child to hand out the presents. All children take turns handing out presents in other traditions.
Alternatively "Santa Claus", the [[Julemanden]], will appear at the door in full costume with a large sack of presents over his shoulder. He will then distribute the presents, with the assistance of any children present, to their recipients. He should be offered suitable drink to keep him warm and cheerful on his onward journey, but do not expect loquacity – utterances are normally limited to loud and hearty laughs. Meanwhile, the presents are opened and this is followed by more snacks, candy, chips and, sometimes, a traditional Christmas drink called ''[[Gløgg]].''

The Danish are somewhat famous for their ''Julefrokost,'' literally meaning "Christmas lunch", which includes various traditional Danish dishes, potentially accompanied by beer and [[Snaps]]. These Julefrokoster are popular and held within families, as well as by companies and other social groups. They would traditionally have taken place leading up to Christmas, but due to time constraints and stress during the Christmas month they are nowadays commonly held during November and January as well. The family Julefrokoster however are normally held on Christmas Day and/or The Second day of Christmas (December 26).

[[File:Adventkalender andrea.JPG|thumb|[[Advent calendar]]]]

Another more recent Danish tradition is the concept of television ''Julekalendere'', special Christmas-themed, advent calendar-type television programmes with a daily episode shown on each of the first 24&amp;nbsp;days of December, thus culminating on ''Juleaften''. Several television stations produce their own, most, but not all of which are targeted at child viewers. Some of the television advent calendars become extremely popular and go on to be reprised in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/denmark.shtml|title=Christmas in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, Santa Claus is known as [[Julemanden]] (literally "the Yule Man") and is said to arrive in a sleigh drawn by reindeer, with presents for the children. He is assisted with his Yuletide chores by elves known as julenisser (or simply nisser), who are traditionally believed to live in attics, barns or similar places. In some traditions, to maintain the favour and protection of these nisser, children leave out saucers of milk or rice pudding or other treats for them and are delighted to find the food gone on Christmas morning.

===== Estonia =====

[[File:Jõuluvanade XIII konverents.IMG 6103 by Ave Maria Mõistlik.JPG|thumb|left|Christmas Santas]]

In the weeks preceding Christmas or ''jõulud'', children place a slipper in their windows and receive a piece of candy or some other sweets from visiting elves (''päkapikud''). Estonians celebrate Christmas on December 24, which is referred to as ''jõululaupäev'' ("Christmas Saturday"){{clarify|reason=Of course this day does not always fall on a Saturday|date=January 2011}} and is by act of Parliament a [[Public holidays in Estonia|public holiday in Estonia]]. Each year on this day, the President of Estonia declares the Christmas Peace and attends a Christmas service. The tradition was initiated by the order of [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] of Sweden in the 17th century. Estonian children are visited by ''[[jõuluvana]]'' ("Santa Claus") on Christmas Eve, and must sing songs or recite Christmas poems before receiving their gifts.

The evening meal typically includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes, white and blood sausage, potato salad with red beet, and pāté. For dessert, Estonians eat gingerbread (''piparkoogid'') and marzipan. The most highly regarded drinks during this time have been beer and mulled wine or ''[[glögi]]'' and ''hõõgvein'' ("glowing wine"). Estonians leave the leftover food from Christmas dinner on the table overnight, in hopes that the spirits of family, friends, and loved ones will visit and also have something to eat. It is also customary to visit graveyards and leave candles for the deceased.

December 25 or ''jõulupüha'' is a relaxed day for visiting relatives.

===== Finland =====
{{main|Christmas in Finland}}
[[File:Christmas presents and a tree.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas presents and a tree in Finland]]
[[File:Joulukinkku.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas ham]]

Christmas is an extensively prepared celebration centering on the family and home, although it has a religious dimension also. The Christmas season starts from December or even in late November, when shops began advertising potential Christmas gifts. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears, and children count days to Christmas with [[Advent calendar]]s. Schools and some other places have the day before Christmas Eve (''aatonaatto'', December 23) as a holiday, but at the latest on the Christmas Eve (''jouluaatto'', December 24), shops close early and stay closed until December 26. The main Christmas festivities are held on Christmas Eve on December 24, while Christmas Day (''joulupäivä'') and the following day (''Tapaninpäivä'', "St. Stephen's Day") are mandatory [[public holidays in Finland]]&lt;ref name="Christmas in Finland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/finland.shtml|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools continue holidays up to the New Year.

The Declaration of [[Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. It is a custom in many towns and cities. The most famous one of these declarations is on the Old Great Square of [[Turku]], the former capital of Finland, at noon on Christmas Eve. It is broadcast on Finnish radio (since 1935) and television, and nowadays also in some foreign countries. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]'') by a band of the [[Finnish Navy]] and a male choir and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll, in both Finnish and Swedish, the country's two official languages:

: Tomorrow, God willing, is the most gracious feast of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, and therefore a general Christmas peace is hereby declared, and all persons are directed to observe this holiday with due reverence and otherwise quietly and peacefully to conduct themselves, for whosoever breaks this peace and disturbs the Christmas holiday by any unlawful or improper conduct shall be liable, under aggravating circumstances, to whatever penalty is prescribed by law and decree for each particular offence or misdemeanour. Finally, all citizens are wished a joyous Christmas holiday.

The ceremony ends with trumpets playing the Finnish [[national anthem]] ''[[Maamme]]'' and ''[[Björneborgarnas marsch|Porilaisten marssi]]'', with the crowd usually singing when the band plays ''Maamme''. Recently, there is also a declaration of Christmas peace for forest animals in many cities and municipalities, so there is no hunting during Christmas.

[[File:Hundreds of candles and a Christian Cross at a cemetery on Christmas eve.jpg|thumb|It is traditional in Finland to bring candles to the graves of loved ones on Christmas Eve and [[All Saints Day]].]]

Finnish people clean their homes well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which is placed in the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is traditionally decorated using apples and other fruit, candies, paper flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to [[Christmas ornaments]] such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed at the top of the tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas [[sauna]]. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Finland"/&gt;

Afterwards, they dress up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or [[joulupöytä]], which is usually served between 5pm and 7pm, or traditionally with the appearance of the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably [[Christmas Ham]], roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of [[casserole]]s, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include [[lutefisk|boiled codfish]] (soaked beforehand in a lye solution for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled [[herring]] and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=180237&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but ''[[Joulupukki]]'' visits the household, maybe with a ''[[tonttu]]'' to help him distribute the presents.

Christmas Day services begin early at six in the morning and people visit families and reunions are arranged on this day.

Boxing Day, or ''tapaninpäivä'' ([[St. Stephen]]'s Day) is traditionally set aside for driving around the village (''tapaninajot''), to counterbalance the solemn and family-oriented part of Christmas.

===== Iceland =====
{{Main article|Jól (Iceland)}}

The Christmas or [[Yule]] ([[Jól (Iceland)|Jól]] in Icelandic)&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/iceland.shtml|title=Christmas in Iceland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration in Iceland starts four Sundays before Christmas proper, which begins on December 24 (Advent) and ends thirteen days later on January 6. Traditionally, one candle is lit each Sunday until four candles are lit on the 24th. At 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Church bell]]s ring to start the Christmas celebration. The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the [[Icelandic cuisine#Christmas dishes|Yule holidays most often eat]] Most popular dishes are smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular.

Thirteen days before December 24 the [[Yule Lads]] children will leave their shoes by the window so that the Yule Lads can leave small gifts in their shoes.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"/&gt; The Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or eating the candles). The Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit.

Each home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil skate on the 23rd. The day is called Saint Thorlak Mass (Þorláksmessa).

During the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making Laufabrauð (Leafbread), which is a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique.

The end of year is divided between two days – the Old Year's Day (Gamlársdagur) and the New Year's Day (Nýársdagur). At the night of the former and morning of the latter Icelanders shoot up fireworks blowing the old year away and welcoming the new one.

Thirteen days after the 24th Icelanders say goodbye to the Yule Lads and other mystical creatures such as elves and trolls. There are bonfires held throughout the country while the elves, Yule Lads, and Icelanders dance together before saying goodbye until the next Christmas.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Iceland"/&gt;

===== Norway =====
{{Main article|Jul (Norway)}}

[[File:Juletræslys.jpg|thumb|[[Christmas tree]] with a [[candle]]]]

[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|Christmas [[gifts]]]]

The major day of celebration in Norway, as in most of Northern Europe, is December 24. Although it is legally a regular workday until 16:00,&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/norway.shtml|title=Christmas in Norway|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; most stores close early. Church bells chime in the Christmas holiday between 17:00 and 18:00. In some families the Christmas story from Luke 2 will be read from the old family Bible. The main Christmas meal is served in the evening. Common main dishes include pork rib, "[[pinnekjøtt]]" (pieces of lamb rib steamed on a grid of birch wood). Many people also eat "[[lutefisk]]" or fresh, poached cod. Rice porridge is also popular (but most commonly served as an early lunch rather than for the main Christmas dinner), an almond is often hidden in the porridge, and the person who finds it wins a treat or small gift. In some parts of Norway it is common to place porridge outside (in a barn, outhouse or even in the forest) to please "Nissen". In many families, where the parents grew up with different traditions, two different main dishes are served to please everyone. If children are present (and they have behaved well the last year), "Julenissen" (Santa Claus) pays a visit, otherwise gifts are stored under the Christmas tree.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"/&gt;

For a lot of Norwegians, especially families, television is an important part of the earlier hours of Christmas Eve. Many Norwegians do not feel the Christmas spirit until they have watched the Czech-German fairy tale ''[[Tři oříšky pro Popelku|Three Nuts for Cinderella]]'' (Norwegian title: ''Tre nøtter til Askepott''), the Disney Christmas cavalcade ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html|title=Christmas in Norway fairytale|author=TVparty|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Norwegian fairytale movie ''Reisen til Julestjernen'' or the comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]''. Attending one of the many stage productions of ''[[Putti Plutti Pott and Santa's Beard]]'' is also a very popular tradition.

December 25 is a very quiet and relaxed day. Church services are well attended. The old tradition of a very early morning service before breakfast has been replaced in most areas by a service in the later morning. Afterward many families get together for a large festive meal.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Norway"/&gt;

December 26 is also a day of many festivities. Cinemas, night clubs and bars are full, and there are lots of private gatherings and parties, where all kinds of traditional [[Christmas cookies]] and sweets are enjoyed. Fatty, tasty dinners are also part of it. The time between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve is called [[:wikt:romjul|romjul]]. During this time children in some parts of Norway dress up as "nisser" and go "Julebukk" – "Christmas goat" – in their neighbourhoods and sing Christmas carols to receive treats, much the same way as in the American [[Halloween]]. January 6 (13th day of Christmas) is commonly regarded as the end of Christmas, while some end Christmas on the 20th day, and some even at Candlemas.

The pre-Christian holiday of [[Yule]], or ''jól'', was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Sweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/sweden.shtml|title=Christmas in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the observance of the [[winter solstice]], and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the [[Advent]] and [[Christmas]] celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. Swedish Christmas celebrations begin with the first of [[Advent]]. [[Saint Lucy's Day]] (locally known as ''Luciadagen'') which is the first major Christmas celebration before Christmas itself. The eldest daughter arising early and wearing her Lucy garb of white robe, red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs with nine lighted candles fastened in it awakens the family, singing "Santa Lucia", serving them coffee and [[saffron bun]]s ([[St. Lucia buns]]), thus ushering in the Christmas season.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|title=Matthews, Jeff.

Schools elect a Lucia and her maids among the students and a national Lucia is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucias will visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out ''pepparkakor'' [[gingerbread]] cookies.

Boys take part in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called ''stjärngossar'' (star boys); some may be dressed up as "[[tomte]]nissar", carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as [[gingerbread man|gingerbread men]]. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually ''Staffan Stalledräng'', which tells the story about [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]], caring for his five horses.
Electric candles and glowing stars are placed in almost every window in the month of December in Sweden. Although December 25 (''juldagen'') is a [[Public holidays in Sweden|Swedish public holiday]], December 24 is the day when Santa Claus ''Jultomte'' (or simply ''[[Tomte]]'') brings the presents. Although not a public holiday, Christmas Eve is a ''de facto'' holiday in the sense that most workplaces are closed, and those who work, for instance in shops or care homes, get extra wages as a compensation. (''See also: [[Public holidays in Sweden]] for further explanation of this concept.'')

The Jultomte was originally a small invisible Christmas house gnome or dwarf from the Nordic mythology, who watched over the house and its inhabitants. An old superstition still calls for feeding the Tomte on Christmas Eve with a small bowl of porridge. If a bowl of porridge is not laid out for him somewhere in or outside the house, he will bring bad luck to everyone in the house the next year. The modern "Tomten", nowadays is a version of Santa Claus in red cloth and white beard, except that he doesn't enter the house through the chimney, but knocks on the door and asks "finns det några snälla barn här?" ("are there any nice children here?")

Christmas is, as everywhere else, an occasion celebrated with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|title=Traditions in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas [[smörgåsbord]] (''[[julbord]]''), a display of several Christmas food items. Almost all julbord has Christmas ham, (''[[julskinka]]'') accompanied by other Christmas dishes, such as small [[wikt:meatball|meatball]]s, [[pickled herring]], [[spareribs]], small hot dogs, [[lutfisk]], pork sausage, salmon, [[Janssons frestelse]] (potato casserole with anchovy), and [[rice pudding]]. The Christmas julbord is served with [[julmust]] and beverage like mulled wine, Christmas beer or [[snaps]]. A Scandinavian speciality is the ''[[glogg|glögg]]'' (mulled and spiced wine with almonds and raisins), which is served hot in small cups. The different dishes of the julbord may vary throughout Sweden, from South to North. Businesses traditionally invite their employees to a julbord dinner or lunch the weeks before Christmas, and people go out privately to restaurants which also customarily offer julbord during December.

Examples of candies and treats associated with Christmas are [[marzipan]], toffee, [[knäck]] (quite similar to butterscotch), nuts and fruits: figs, chocolate, dates and oranges decorated with cloves.

Television also plays a big role, many families watch the Disney Christmas special ''Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton]]'' (animated short), or a re-run of the ''[[Svensson, Svensson]]'' episode ''God Jul!'' (''Merry Christmas'') on the TV channel [[SVT1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://slate.com/id/2239252/ |title=Nordic Quack: Sweden's bizarre tradition of watching Donald Duck cartoons on Christmas Eve |author=Jeremy Stahl |work=Slate |date=December 22, 2009 |quote="At 3&amp;nbsp;o'clock in the afternoon, you can't to do anything else, because Sweden is closed"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the julbord on December 24, the presents are distributed, either by Jultomten or a family member, and usually from a sack or from under the Christmas tree where they have been lying all day or for several days.

[[File:Orange pomander.jpg|thumb|left|Around Christmas people hang oranges decorated with cloves in the window or place it on the table.]]

Many Swedes still adhere to the tradition that each present should have a rhyme written on the wrapping paper, to hint at the contents without revealing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/12/22/sweden.christmas/|title=With food, drink and candles, Sweden embraces Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408012151/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/12/22/sweden.christmas/|archivedate=April 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older days a [[yule goat]] was an alternative to Jultomten, nowadays it is used as an ornament, ranging from sizes of 10&amp;nbsp;cm to huge constructions like the giant straw Christmas [[Gävle goat]], famous for frequently being vandalised or burnt down. If one has two families to celebrate Christmas with, it is common that one of the families move their celebrations to Christmas Day or the day before Christmas Eve (commonly referred to as ''little Christmas Eve'').

After December 24, the Christmas celebrations have more or less come to an end. Some people attend the [[julottan]], an early morning church service on December 25. This particular service was the main service of Christmas historically—nowadays, the [[Midnight Mass]] has become increasingly popular. Others attend a simpler service called ''Christmas Prayer'' in the afternoon of Christmas Eve; however, many Swedes do not attend church at all during Christmas as the country is very [[secular]]. Even so, most families do set up a ''Julkrubba'' (''[[Nativity scene|Christmas Crib]]''). On January 13 (locally known as ''knutdagen'' or ''tjugondag knut'', English = twentiethday Christmas), 20&amp;nbsp;days after Christmas, the Christmas celebrations come to an end and all Christmas decorations are removed.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Sweden"/&gt;

===== Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia =====

[[File:Bozicna psenica.jpg|thumb|upright|Croatian wheat grass, planted on St. Lucy's, used for Christmas candles]]

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, Christmas (Croatian: ''Božić'', Slovene: ''Božič'') is celebrated mainly as a religious holiday. The festivities begin on [[Saint Nicholas]]'s Day on December 6 (in Slovenia) or [[St. Lucy]]'s on December 13 depending on what region (in Croatia). St. Lucy or St. Nicholas brings children presents, and St. Nicholas is said to be accompanied by [[Krampus]] who steals away the presents of bad children. This "anti-Santa" is said to have one cloven hoof, a handful of heavy chains, and a sack on his back to collect naughty children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardstore.com/christmas-around-the-world |title=How is Christmas Celebrated Around the World |work=CardStore.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Croatia on St. Lucy's, families will plant wheat seeds in a bowl of shallow water, which will grow several inches by Christmas and are then tied together with a red, blue and white ribbon called ''trobojnica'.

On Christmas Eve (Croatian: ''Badnjak'', Slovene: ''Sveti večer'' (holy eve)), three candles representing the [[Trinity]] are lit and placed in the middle of the wheat, the glow symbolizes the soul of each person. On this day, the tree is decorated, the home is decked with greenery and the women already beginning to prepare the Christmas meal. They also bake special types of bread: one is round inscribed with a cross on top known as the ''cesnica'', another is made with honey, nuts and dried fruit called the Christmas Eve Bread (Croatian: ''Badnji Kruh'', Slovene: ''Božični kruh''). In many villages, straw (which symbolizes Christ's birth in the manger) is spread around the floors of the home for the Christmas Eve dinner. As is customary with Catholic people, meat is not consumed in Croatia, while in Slovenia it is. Instead of meat in Croatia and with other food in Slovenia, salad and fish is served, many choosing to eat the [[Dalmatia]]n specialty ''bakalar'', dried cod fish. The family then sprinkle holy water on their [[Yule log]] (''badnjak'') which they light and watch. In villages, the badnjak is freshly cut that very morning by the father of the household while reciting traditional prayers. At the end of the meal, a piece of the ''cesnica'' is cut and dipped in wine and used to sprinkle on the candles to extinguish them, while reciting the [[Trinitarian formula]] ("In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen").

Many families will go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve and often another on Christmas Day. It is common for Christmas presents to be placed under the tree, to suggest that the Angel or the Baby Jesus (''Mali Isus'') leaves them there while others are attending midnight mass. Presents are opened after the mass. Christmas is a day of celebrating with family; a large feast is prepared and traditional foods such as stuffed cabbage, turkey, pot roast, pita and smoked meat are served, along with various desserts such as [[fritule]], [[potica]] (especially in Slovenia), [[strudel]], and cookies.

Slovenes are also visited by another one of their ''trije dobri možje'' (three good guys), who bring presents in December: Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus and Dedek Mraz ("Grandfather Frost"). Families mostly celebrate New Year's Eve at home with extended family members, friends, and sometimes neighbours. Women prepare [[sarma (food)|cabbage sarma]], which they will eat on January 1 to symbolize good fortune, and [[steak tartare]], which they eat on New Year's Eve on toast with butter. At midnight, people go outdoors to watch fireworks, while Dedek Mraz leaves presents under the tree. Epiphany on January 6 marks the end of the Christmas season.

===== Bulgaria =====

[[File:Sofia TZUM night.JPG|thumb|left|TZUM department store at Christmastime, [[Sofia]], Bulgaria]]

In Bulgaria, Christmas ({{lang-bg|Коледа}}, ''[[Koleda]]'' or more formally Рождество Христово, ''Rozhdestvo Hristovo'', "Nativity of Jesus") is celebrated on December 25 and is preceded by Christmas Eve (Бъдни вечер, ''Badni vecher''). Traditionally, Christmas Eve would be the climax of the [[Nativity Fast]], and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/bulgarianchristmas.htm|title=Bulgarian Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits – a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a [[Bulgarian budnik]] is set alight. On Christmas, however, meat dishes are already allowed and are typically served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/bulgariatravel/a/bulgariachristmastraditions.htm|title=Bulgaria's Christmas Traditions|publisher=Aboutcom|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Bulgarian Christmas traditions is [[Koledari (Bulgarian)|koleduvane]], which involves boy carolers (коледари, ''koledari'') visiting the neighbouring houses starting at midnight on Christmas Eve, wishing health, wealth and happiness. Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf (пита, ''[[pita]]''). The pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member, a valuable possession, and a piece for God. A coin is hidden inside the pita and whoever gets the coin, he or she will have luck, health, and prosperity in the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indobase.com/holidays/christmas/world/christmas-in-bulgaria.html|title=Christmas in bulgaria|publisher=Indobase|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated. The local name of Santa Claus is Dyado Koleda (Дядо Коледа, "Grandfather Christmas"), with Dyado Mraz (Дядо Мраз, "Grandfather Frost") being a similar Russian-imported character lacking the Christian connotations and thus popular during the Communist rule. However, it has been largely forgotten after 1989, when Dyado Koleda again returned as the more popular figure.

===== Greece and Cyprus =====

[[File:Athens Christmas Tree.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree at [[Syntagma Square]], Athens, Greece]]

The festive period lasts from November 30 to January 6 (Epiphany) on the [[Public holidays in Greece|Greek calendar]]. December 25 and 26 is a [[Public holidays in Greece|public holiday in Greece]]. In [[Greek Language|Greek]], Christmas is known as Christougena (Χριστούγεννα) and people wish Merry Christmas to each other saying Kala Christougenna (Καλά Χριστούγεννα). Most families set up Christmas trees and shops have decorations and lights. Presents are placed under the Christmas tree and are opened on January 1, St Basil's Day. In Greek tradition, [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil's (of Caesarea)]] name was given to Father Christmas and is supposed to visit children and give presents on January 1 (when Basil's memory is celebrated), unlike other European traditions, where this person is Saint Nicholas and comes every Christmas. Carol singing is another tradition on Christmas and New Year's Eve. The Christmas meal usually includes lamb or pork and desserts such as [[kourabies]] (κουραμπιές) and [[melomakarona]] (μελομακάρονα). Other Christmas and new year foods include 'Baklava' (sweet pastry), Kataifi (pastry), Theeples (a kind of fried pastry).

[[File:Smallhoneycake.JPG|thumb|left|Small honeycakes]]

Christmas Eve on December 24 and 23 housewives make the Christmas cake with a cross in the middle and avgokouloures which are subsequently offered to the elderly and children. Children singing carols from house to house either before or on Christmas Day. People go to church early the morning of Christmas on December 25. Christmas morning after church there is the practice to become the "pork batches," served with wine to open the appetite, and "thick," done by Eve, which is boiled pork with plenty of lemon that is left to clot overnight. The pork-food is in the hallmark of Greek Christmas. In many Greek cities and ports like [[Thessaloniki]], [[Volos]], [[Patras|Patra]], the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]] etc., it is decorated the traditional Christmas boat. And in many central squares of the country a big Christmas tree, where  many of the Christmas festivals take place.

Some of the Christmas Festivals in Greece are "Ρουγκατσάρια" ''Rugatsariα'', where all the residents of the city of [[Kastoria]] are delivered in a separate [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] revelry, with the accompaniment of folk melodies bodies all traditional musical sounds of the area. This ancient habit, whose origin is lost in time.
In [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] there are beliefs about demonic and other supernatural beings, who come from the Twelve Days of Christ as the Epiphany. These are the goblins and say that they are the descendants [[Pan (god)|God Pan]] or [[Satyrs]], who jumped from the [[mythology]] in the Christian life.

Some modern takes on this holiday involve them hanging [[vultures]] to symbolize the cleaning of their spirits.

[[Saint Lucy's Day]] (Italian: Giorno di Santa Lucia) is celebrated as a Catholic holiday in [[Sicily]] and Northern regions of Italy on the supposed [[Shortest day]] of the year which is December 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/milleldred/donnenocturnal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027042302/http://www.geocities.com/milleldred/donnenocturnal.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Lucy]] is the patron saint of the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] better known as ''[[Santa Lucia]]'' as she is called in the traditional [[Canzone Napoletana|Neapolitan song]]. Evening candlelight processions called the parade of light are conducted and are followed by the Feast of St. Lucy. Sicilians pay tribute to a miracle performed by St Lucy during a famine in 1582. At that time, she brought a flotilla of grain-bearing ships to starving Sicily, whose citizens cooked and ate the wheat without taking time to grind it into flour. Thus, on St. Lucy's Day, Sicilians do not eat anything made with wheat flour. Instead they eat cooked wheat called [[cuccìa]].

It is quite common to attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve and practice the custom not to eat any meat.

Traditions regarding the exchanging of gifts vary from region to region, as this might take place either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. Presents for children are left underneath the Christmas tree either by Santa Claus (called [[:it:Babbo Natale|Babbo Natale]]) or, according to older traditions, by Baby Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/italy.htm|title=Christmas traditions in Italy|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions children receive gifts earlier (at St. Lucy's Day) or later (on Epiphany).

December 26, (St. Stephen's Day, in Italian Giorno di Santo Stefano), is also a public holiday in Italy. Festivities extend to the end of the year and then to the Epiphany.

On January 6 (Epiphany, in Italian Epifania) decorations are usually taken down, and in some areas female puppets are burned on a pire (called "''[[Bonfire|falò]]''"), to symbolize, along with the end of the Christmas period, the death of the old year and the beginning of a new one.&lt;ref name="trevisoinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trevisoinfo.com/bonfires-veneto.htm |title=Traditional Bonfires of Veneto in winter solstice northeast italy winter solstice fires treviso traditions of veneto |publisher=Trevisoinfo.com |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While gifts are now given at Christmas by an American style Santa Claus as well, Italy holds fast to its tradition of native gift-givers.

===== Malta =====
{{see also|Christmas Eve Procession}}

Christmas ({{lang-mt|Il-Milied}}) in [[Malta]] is mostly secular, with a number of Christian-related themes.

Midnight Masses are popular amng the older generations, and Christmas processions take place on Christmas Eve with a statue of the baby Jesus in towns and villages, led by the [[Society of Christian Doctrine]].

A [[Public holidays in Malta|public holiday in Malta]], Christmas Day is celebrated on December 25. Christmas lunch usually consists of turkey served with potatoes and vegetables (Malta is a former [[British colony]]). The island has adopted other popular secular customs and traditions such as the Christmas tree and Father Christmas.

Presents are normally generally exchanged either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. A local seasonal food is the "Qaghaq ta' l-Ghasel" (Honey Ring). These Maltese Christmas sweets are eaten as a dessert during the Christmas season but can also be purchased all year round. Christmas cribs are a popular and are seen in most homes.

Another Christmas tradition is the planting of [[common vetch]] seeds in flat-bottomed pots. They are planted around the beginning of December, normally placed on white cotton and watered every day whilst being kept in the dark all the time. They are usually taken out just before Christmas, and resemble long white spaghetti-like strands of leaves (since they would have grown in the dark).

===== Portugal =====

[[File:Christmas decorations in Braga (6).JPG|thumb|Christmas decorations in Braga]]

Christmas, an [[Public holidays in Portugal|official holiday in Portugal]], is widely celebrated and is associated with family gatherings. People who have moved to the main cities, like [[Lisbon]] or [[Porto]], or even those who have emigrated to other countries, still travel to their home towns and villages to spend Christmas Eve with their families. After the ''Missa do galo'' (Rooster's Mass) that celebrates the birth of Christ, families gather around the ''Consoada'', the late supper held on Christmas Eve. The traditional dish is ''bacalhau com todos'' (dried codfish boiled with vegetables), although, in northern Portugal, the bacalhau is often replaced by octopus. The Christmas dinner usually ends with ''fatias douradas'' (golden slices), ''filhoses'' and ''sonhos'' (dreams), all desserts based on fried flour or fried bread. Another traditional cake is the [[Bolo Rei|king cake]] served on Epiphany. Nowadays, although Santa Claus (''Pai Natal'') is more popular, in some regions people still believe that it is the ''Menino Jesus'' (Baby Jesus) who brings presents to children.

===== Serbia and Montenegro=====

[[File:Christmas-Serbian Ortodox Česnica.jpg|thumb|Serbian Orthodox Christmas bread]]

{{Main article|Serbian Christmas traditions|Badnjak (Serbian)}}

In [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], Christmas ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Божић, ''Božić'' or more formally Рождество Христово, Rozhdestvo Hristovo, "Nativity of Christ") is celebrated for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] uses the traditional Julian calendar, per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls on January 7. This day is called the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with "Christ is Born," which should be responded to with "Truly He is Born." The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name for Christmas is ''Božić'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Божић, {{IPA-sh|boʒitɕ|pron}}), which means the young or little God.

This holiday surpasses all the others celebrated by Serbs, with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household.

In the morning of Christmas Eve a young, straight oak tree is selected and felled by the head of the household. A log is cut from it and is referred to as the [[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]]. In the evening, the badnjak is ceremoniously put on the domestic fire that burns on the house's fireplace called ''ognjište'', whose hearth is without a vertical surround. The burning of the ''badnjak'' is accompanied by prayers to God so that the coming year may bring much happiness, love, luck, riches, and food. Since most houses today have no ''ognjište'' on which to burn a ''badnjak'', it is symbolically represented by several leaved oak twigs. For the convenience of people who live in towns and cities, they can be bought at marketplaces or received in churches.

The dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighbourhood, congratulating each other, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. The Serbs also take a bundle of straw into the house and spread it over the floor, and then put walnuts on it. Before the table is served for the Christmas Eve dinner, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The head of household makes the [[Sign of the Cross]], lights a candle, and [[Censer|cense]]s the whole house. The family members sit down at the table, but before tucking in they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the [[Troparion]] of the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the dinner young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. Christmas and other songs are sung, while the elderly narrate stories from the olden times.

On Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork of a pig which they cook whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. Even though gift-giving is not necessarily a part of the tradition, a [[Santa Claus]] inspired character called Božić Bata (translated as Christmas friend) sometimes takes his during gift giving, as Santa Claus is more traditionally connected to New Years celebrations. Gift-giving is, nevertheless, connected with the celebrations, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days.

Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. The course of these celebrations can be typically divided into three parts: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of going and cutting down the tree to be used as the ''badnjak'', taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes [[Vespers]], placing the ''badnjak'' on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the ''badnjak'', and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the ''badnjak'' not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of getting together around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration, however, has its own specificities which reflect traditions of the local community, and other local factors.

In [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] Christmas is celebrated on January 7. This is a result of their [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches marking Christmas Day based on the [[Julian calendar]], which is now 13&amp;nbsp;days behind the internationally used Gregorian calendar.

===== Spain =====

[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Porta.Angel.Navidad.jpg|thumb|Avinguda Portal de l'Àngel, at Christmas time, [[Barcelona]], Spain]]
Christmas and St Stephen's Day are [[Public holidays in Spain|officially recognized holidays in Spain]]. In most of Spain, the Christmas period, referred to as "Navidad", lasts from Christmas Eve referred to as "Nochebuena" or "the Good Night." on December 24 to Epiphany on January 6. Many homes and most churches display a [[Nativity scene]], a [[Christmas tree]], or both. The ''pesebre'' (nativity scene) is present in many homes, schools and stores. On the 26th, ''Sant Esteve'' (Saint Stephen) is celebrated with a family gathering.

A large family dinner is celebrated on Christmas Eve (Nochebuena) and can last until 6&amp;nbsp;o'clock in the morning. There is a wide variety of typical foods one might find on plates across Spain on this particular night, and each [[Regional food|region]] has its own distinct specialities. It is particularly common, however, to start the meal with a seafood dish such as prawns or salmon, followed by a bowl of hot, homemade soup. The main meal will commonly consist of [[Lamb (food)|roast lamb]], or seafood, such as cod or shellfish. For dessert, there is quite a spread of delicacies, among them are [[turrón]], a dessert made of honey, egg and almonds that is Arabic in origin. Special dishes and desserts include Mariscos y Pescado (shellfish and fish), [[marzipan]], Pavo Trufado de Navidad (turkey with [[truffles]]), and [[polvorones]] (shortbread made of almonds, flour and sugar).

Even though there is still the traditional [[Misa del Gallo]] at midnight, few Spaniards continue to follow the old custom of attending.

Children usually receive one or two presents on Christmas Day (December 25), brought by "Papá Noel" (Father Noel), which is a non-traditional imitation of the American Santa Claus, but in some regions there are other more traditional characters, for example, the [[Olentzero]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. There is a special Christmas dance called the Jota which has been performed for centuries in Spain during Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/spanishchristmas.htm|title=Christmas Traditions in Spain,|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31 (Nochevieja) there is also a large family feast. Some young people go out in "cotillón", a very big feast in bars and pubs and the drink and dance until January 1 morning, when they have [[Churros|churros with chocolate]] for breakfast. On January 5 a huge parade (La Cabalgata or [[cavalcade]]) welcomes the Three Kings to the city. Children put their shoes in the window on January 5 in the hope that the Three Wise Men will deliver them presents.&lt;ref&gt;''Christmas.'' World Book Encyclopedia 2003 edition. Volume Ch.

===== France =====

Christmas in France (Noël on the [[Public holidays in France|French calendar]])&lt;ref&gt;"Christmas" World Book Encyclopedia 2003 edition. The french word for Christmas is noel Volume "Ch" P. 530&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated mainly in a religious manner, though secular ways of celebrating the occasion also exist, such as Christmas decorations and carols. Children do not hang Christmas stockings but put their shoes by the fireplace or under the Christmas tree so ''Père Noël'' (Father Christmas or Santa Claus) can give them gifts (a practice also among [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]]). Some families also attend midnight mass and decorate their homes with Nativity Scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. Additional ''Santons'' (little saints) may be added in the nativity scenes.

In France and in other [[francophone|French-speaking]] areas (see French Canada), a long family dinner, called a ''[[réveillon]]'', is held on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |title=Réveillon |publisher=VirtualMuseum.ca |date=December 1, 1995 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523234250/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2001 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this dinner is based on the word ''réveil'' (meaning "waking"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. Réveillon is generally of an exceptional or luxurious nature. [[Appetizer]]s may include [[lobster]], [[oyster]]s, [[escargot]]s or [[foie gras]], etc. One traditional dish is [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[chestnut]]s. Réveillons in [[Quebec]] will often include some variety of [[tourtière]]. Dessert may consist of a ''[[bûche de Noël]]''. In [[Provence]], the tradition of the ''13 desserts'' is followed, almost invariably including: ''pompe à l'huile'' (a flavoured bread), [[date (fruit)|date]]s, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or similar [[sparkling wine]]s as a conclusion. Christmas carols may also be sung.

===== United Kingdom =====

[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas Carols - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Tree and carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London]]
In the United Kingdom Christmas decorations are put up in shops and town centres from early November. Many towns and cities have a public event involving a local or regional celebrity to mark the switching on of Christmas lights. Decorations in people's homes are commonly put up from early December, traditionally including a Christmas tree, cards, and lights both inside and outside the home. Every year, Norway donates a giant Christmas tree for the British to raise in Trafalgar Square as a thank you for helping during the [[Second World War]]. Christmas carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London sing around the tree on various evenings up until Christmas Eve and Christmas decorations are traditionally left up until the evening of January 5 (the night before Epiphany); it is considered bad luck to have Christmas decorations up after this date. In practice, many Christmas traditions, such as the playing of Christmas music, largely stop after Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Woodlands-Junior.Kent.sch.uk|url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|title=British Christmas: introduction, food, customs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220220018/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|archivedate=February 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mince pie]]s are traditionally sold during the festive season and are a popular food for Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/dinner.html|title=Christmas dinner|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in many UK households for children and adults to put up advent calendars in their homes, which may either contain chocolates or Christmas scenes behind their doors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A common feature of the Christmas season is the Nativity play which is practiced in most primary and some secondary schools across the UK. This practice is becoming less common, and Christmas pantomimes may be performed instead.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Midnight Mass is also celebrated by Anglicans, Catholics, and other denominations, and services take place in nearly all Church of England parishes on Christmas Eve.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On Christmas Eve, presents are supposedly delivered in stockings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/day.html|title=Project Britain Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the Christmas tree by [[Father Christmas]], who previously had been something like [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]] in Charles Dickens' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843), but who has now become mainly conflated with [[Santa Claus]]. The two names are now used interchangeably and are equally known to British people, though some distinctive features still remain. Many families tell their children stories about Father Christmas and his reindeer. One tradition is to put out a plate of carrots for the reindeer, and [[mince pie]]s and sherry for Father Christmas to help him on his way.

The majority of families open their presents on the morning of Christmas Day, the [[Royal family]] being a notable exception, as they open their gifts on Christmas Eve, following German tradition introduced by the [[Hanoverians]]. [[Queen Victoria]] as a child made note of it in her diary for Christmas Eve 1832; the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote, "After dinner&amp;nbsp;... we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room&amp;nbsp;... There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees..".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The girlhood of [[Queen Victoria]]: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries|page=61|publisher= Longmans, Green &amp; Co./University of Wisconsin|date= 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first commercial [[Christmas card]] was produced in London in 1843, cards are sent in the weeks leading up to Christmas, many of which contain the English festive greeting ''[[Merry Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Buday, György &amp; Buday, George |date=1992|title=The history of the Christmas card|page=8|publisher= Omnigraphics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day, a [[Public holidays in the United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]], nearly the whole population has the day off to be with their family and friends, so they can gather round for a traditional [[Christmas dinner]], traditionally comprising a [[domestic turkey|turkey]] with cranberries, brussels sprouts, parsnips, [[Yorkshire pudding]] and roast potatoes, quite like the [[Sunday roast]], and followed by a [[Christmas pudding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Karen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHN2RKmI3gC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Turkey+-+Christmas+16th+century+England&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=srEXTYDwMJGzhAfpk-S2Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turkey%20-%20Christmas%2016th%20century%20England&amp;f=false |title=More than a meal: the turkey in history, myth, ritual, and reality|publisher= Lantern Books|date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/christmas-pudding-1|title=Christmas pudding: Icons of England|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316042429/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/christmas-pudding-1|archivedate=March 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meal, [[Christmas crackers]], containing toys, jokes, and a paper hat are pulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimpton, Peter |title=Tom Smith's Christmas crackers: an illustrated history|publisher= Tempus|date= 2005|isbn= 0-7524-3164-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at a Christmas Day [[church service]] has become less popular in modern times, with fewer than 3&amp;nbsp;million now attending a Christmas Day Church of England service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/004185.html |title=Church of England statistics |last=Owen |first=Peter |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Speech]] on TV is a tradition that can be important in many households on Christmas Day, typically averaging 7&amp;nbsp;million viewers and sometimes being the most watched show of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42484128 |title=Christmas Day TV: Queen's message wins TV ratings battle |publisher=BBC News |date=2017-12-26 |accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regent Street Christmas Lights - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas lights on [[Regent Street]], London]]
The Celebration of [[Boxing Day]], on the day after Christmas Day, is a tradition practiced in the UK. It is a [[bank holiday]], and if it happens to fall on a weekend then a special [[Bank Holiday Monday]] will occur. Also, depending on the day of the week, it is often a day when football matches are played in the professional leagues and many people go to watch their team play.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Other traditions include carol singing – many carols are sung by children on people's doorsteps and by professional choirs – and sending Christmas cards. In public, there are decorations and lights in most shops, especially in town centres, and even in Indian and Chinese restaurants. Churches and [[cathedral]]s across the country hold masses, with many people going to midnight mass or a service on Christmas morning. Even though church attendance has been falling over the decades some people who do not go to church often think it is still important to go at Christmas, so Church attendance increases. Most theatres have a tradition of putting on a Christmas [[pantomime]] for children. The pantomime stories are traditionally based on popular children's stories such as ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and ''[[Aladdin]]'', rather than being directly concerned with Christmas as such, although there is sometimes a link. Television is widely watched: for many television channels, Christmas Day is the most important day of the year in terms of ratings.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In England, telling ghost stories, local legends, and other strange, bizarre, and fantastic "winter stories" (as Charles Dickens – author of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' -termed them) is a centuries-old tradition, to which [[Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]] contributed with ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (1623) but which was well known even before Shakespeare's time.

Christmas in Scotland was traditionally observed very quietly, because the [[Church of Scotland]] – a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church – for various reasons never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival; although in Catholic areas people would attend Midnight Mass or early morning Mass before going to work.&lt;ref name="Scottish Christmas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/scottishchristmas.htm|title=Scottish Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition derives from the Church of Scotland's origins including St Columba's monastic tradition, under which every day is God's day and there is none more special than another.

Christmas in Ireland is the largest celebration on the [[Public holidays in the Republic of Ireland|calendar in Ireland]] and lasts from December 24 to January 6, although many view December 8 as being the start of the season; and schools used to close on this day, making it a traditional Christmas shopping time, this is no longer compulsory and many stay open.

Almost the entire workforce is finished by lunchtime on Christmas Eve, or often a few days beforehand. Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day are public holidays, and many people do not return to work until after New Year's Day. Irish people spend more and more money each year on celebrating Christmas. In 2006, the total amount spent in Ireland to celebrate Christmas was €16&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/index.php3?ca=43&amp;issue_id=11790 |title=News Ireland &amp;#124; Irish News Paper &amp;#124; Free News Stories Online from The Irish Independent Newspaper – Independent.ie |last=Black |first=Rebecca |publisher=Unison.ie |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which averages at approximately €4,000 for every single person in the country.

It is extremely popular on Christmas Eve to go for "the Christmas drink" in the local pub, where regular punters are usually offered a Christmas drink. Many neighbours and friends attend each other's houses for Christmas drinks and parties on the days leading up to and after Christmas Day. Although religious devotion in Ireland today is considerably less than it used to be, there are huge attendances at religious services for Christmas Day, with Midnight Mass a popular choice. Most families arrange for their deceased relatives to be prayed for at these Masses as it is a time of remembering the dead in Ireland. It is traditional to decorate graves at Christmas with a wreath made of holly and ivy. Even in the most undevout of homes in Ireland the traditional crib takes centre stage along with the Christmas tree as part of the family's decorations. Some people light candles to signify symbolic hospitality for [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. Therefore, it is usual to see a white candle, or candle set, placed in several windows around people's homes. The candle was a way of saying there was room for [[Jesus]]'s parents in these homes even if there was none in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name="CID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasindublin.com/traditions.html |title=Irish Christmas Traditions |publisher=ChristmasinDublin.com |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810083446/http://christmasindublin.com/Traditions.html |archivedate=August 10, 2003 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional to leave a [[mince pie]] and a bottle or a glass of [[Guinness]] for [[Santa Claus]] along with a carrot for [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|Rudolph]] on Christmas Eve.

Santa Claus, often known in Ireland simply as Santy or ''Daidí na Nollag'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], brings presents to children in Ireland, which are opened on Christmas morning. Family and friends also give each other gifts at Christmas. The traditional Christmas dinner consists of turkey or goose and ham with a selection of vegetables and a variety of potatoes, as potatoes still act as a staple food in Ireland despite the popularisation of staples such as rice and pasta. Dessert is a very rich selection of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, and mince pies with equally rich sauces such as brandy butter.

Christmas celebrations in Ireland finish with the celebration of [[Little Christmas]] also known as Oíche Nollaig na mBan in Irish on January 6. This festival, which coincides with Epiphany, is also known as ''Women's Christmas'' in [[County Cork|Cork]] &amp; [[County Kerry|Kerry]].

===== Netherlands and Flanders =====

Christmas traditions in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/holland.shtml|title=Christmas in Holland / The Netherlands|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are almost the same as the ones in Dutch speaking parts of Belgium (Flanders). The Dutch recognize two days of Christmas as public holidays in the Netherlands, calling December 25 Eerste Kerstdag ("first Christmas day") and December 26 Tweede Kerstdag ("second Christmas day"). In families, it is customary to spend these days with either side of the family.

In Catholic parts of the country, it used to be common to attend Christmas Eve midnight mass; this custom is upheld, but mostly by the elder generation and by fewer people every year. Christmas Eve is these days a rather normal evening without any special gatherings or meals. On Christmas Day, throughout both Flanders and the Netherlands elaborated meals are prepared by the host or together as a family. Also meals of which every participant / guest is preparing one dish are very common. The week before Christmas is important to the retail trade, because this is the biggest sales week in the country. Christmas songs are heard everywhere. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven are the busiest cities in terms of entertainment on Christmas Day. Many people do not exchange gifts on Christmas, since this is already done during a separate holiday ([[Sinterklaas]]) a few weeks before Christmas. In [[Twente]] people will blow the mid-winter horns around Christmas.

The Christmas season wraps up after the new year with Epiphany, or "Driekoningen". On January 6 children especially in the north of the Netherlands dress up as the Three Wise Men and travel in groups of three carrying lanterns, re-enacting the Epiphany and singing traditional songs for their hosts. In return they are rewarded with cakes and sweets. This practice is less common south of the great rivers. In the south and east of the Netherlands it is common practice to burn the Christmas trees of the community on a big pile on January 6 to celebrate the end of Christmas and the start of the new year.

In Australia, as with all of the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas occurs during the height of the summer season. Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 25–26) are recognized as [[Public holidays in Australia|national public holidays in Australia]], and workers are therefore entitled to a day off with pay.

The Australian traditions and decorations are quite similar to those of the United Kingdom and North America, and similar wintry iconography is commonplace. This means a red fur-coated Santa Claus riding a sleigh, carols such as ''Jingle Bells'', and various snow-covered Christmas scenes on Christmas cards and decorations appear in the middle of summer. As novelties, some Australian songwriters and authors have occasionally depicted Santa in "Australian"-style clothing including an [[Akubra]] hat, with warm-weather clothing and [[flip-flops|thongs]], and riding in a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] pulled by [[kangaroo]]s, (e.g. ''Six White Boomers'' by [[Rolf Harris]]) but these depictions have not replaced mainstream iconography.

Christmas Day and Boxing Day are both [[Public holidays in New Zealand|statutory holidays in New Zealand]]. While Boxing Day is a standard statutory holiday, Christmas Day is one of the three-and-a-half days of the year where all but the most essential businesses and services must close. Many of New Zealand's Christmas traditions are similar to those of Australia in that they are a mix of United Kingdom traditions conducted in summer. New Zealand celebrates Christmas with very little traditional northern hemisphere winter imagery, mixed with local imagery. The [[Metrosideros excelsa|pohutukawa]] (''Metrosideros excelsa''), which produces large crimson flowers in December, is an often used symbol for Christmas in New Zealand, and subsequently the pohutukawa has become known as the ''New Zealand Christmas tree''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/pohutukawa-flowers |title=Pohutukawa trees |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Heritage (New Zealand) |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed span|1=For the Christmas gift-bringer's name, New Zealand uses a variety of names, from Father Christmas to Saint Nick. However as the country becomes more bilingual the [[Te Reo|Maori]] name Hana Koko (say Hah-nah- Kor-Kor) is used much more. Hana Koko is not usually depicted in red, however- a green shirt, small black [[Stubbies (brand)|stubbies]], a mixed-race appearance and a cone-shaped hat decorated with [[Metrosideros excelsa|pohutukawa]] blossoms. Traditionally people eat a variety of cold foods, combined with a barbecue or [[Hāngi]].|date=October 2018|reason=I searched for the term "Hana Koko" and found nothing about it}}

'''Farhad-beg-yailaki''' is an [[archaeological]] site on the [[Silk Road]] in what was the [[Kingdom of Khotan]] which is located 60 miles east of its affiliated city, [[Hotan, China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|year=2004|publisher=Facts On File|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==

Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born early British archaeologists and explorer, investigated the remains of numerous centers of [[Buddhism]] during the early 1900s through three expeditions to the Silk Road. One of the sites Stein uncovered was the Buddhist shrines at Farhad-beg-yailaki, dated to around the fourth to sixth century [[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|year=2004|publisher=Facts On File|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist Imagery==

Several Buddhist statues found within the shines are wearing robes covered in bright floral designs with a mound of fabric at their feet, which are thought to symbolize worship offerings. Additionally, Stein found various [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] at the site that he believed were evidence of Farhad-beg-yailaki's relations with various differing cultures.

Within the site there are several murals and statues displaying two significant Buddhist [[mythological]] figures. One being the mother of demons, [[Hariti]], and the other is the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokitesvara]], both of which are portrayed wearing fabrics with [[Sassanian]] motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Aurel Stein and the Silk Road finds, Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-finds-maps-3/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural containing the figure of Hariti from Farhad-beg-yailaki is thought to specifically demonstrate the [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotanese]] school of painting style, which was highly admired in contemporary [[China]] and was in high demand during the late [[Sui Dynasty]]. This style of painting was also regarded highly in [[Tibet]] and is thought to have had a significant impact on Tibetan culture during the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Puri|first=Baj Nath|title=Buddhism in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|pages=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artefacts and Collections==

During Sir Stein's three Silk Road expeditions, he uncovered clay seal impressions along with [[terracotta]] pottery fragments, both displaying classical mythological images, such as the Trojan prince [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] and depictions of winged horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Aurel Stein and the Silk Road finds, Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-finds-maps-3/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these fragmented terracotta vessels, along with fragments of woven plant fiber, [[silk]], and [[wool]] obtained during these expeditions are on loan from the Government of [[India]] to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[British Museum]], and the [[British Library]], all in [[London, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Silk Road &amp; the V&amp;A Stein collection, Victoria and Albert Museum|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-silk-road-and-the-v-and-a-stein-collection/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GPS puck''' has two meanings.

It is a term for the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] on [[GPS navigation device]]s, which receives GPS signals from [[GPS satellite]]s.  The early antennas were round, and thus had the appearance of a [[puck (sports)|hockey puck]].

Alternatively, a GPS puck is a full puck-sized GPS system (receiver and antenna).

The '''Galápagos Islands''' (official name: {{lang|es|Archipiélago de Colón}}, other [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name: {{lang|es|Las Islas Galápagos}}, {{IPA-es|laz ˈihlah ɣaˈlapaɣoh}}), part of the [[Ecuador|Republic of Ecuador]], are an [[archipelago]] of [[high island|volcanic islands]] distributed on either side of the [[equator]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] surrounding the centre of the [[Western Hemisphere]], {{convert|906|km|abbr=on}} west of continental Ecuador. The islands are known for their large number of [[Endemism|endemic species]] and were studied by [[Charles Darwin]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']]. His observations and collections contributed to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]].

The Galápagos Islands and their surrounding waters form the [[Galápagos Province]] of Ecuador, the [[Galápagos National Park]], and the [[Galápagos Marine Reserve]]. The principal language on the islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of slightly over 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inec.gov.ec/estadisticas/ |title=Censo 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211190111/http://www.inec.gov.ec/estadisticas/ |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535, when [[Fray Tomás de Berlanga]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Panamá|Bishop of Panamá]], was surprised with this undiscovered land during a voyage to [[Peru]] to arbitrate in a dispute between [[Francisco Pizarro]] and [[Diego de Almagro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quasarex.com/galapagos/history-and-charles-darwin|title=History Of The Galapagos Islands Facts &amp; Charles Darwin History|website=www.quasarex.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. De Berlanga eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them. The group of islands was shown and named in [[Abraham Ortelius]]'s atlas published in 1570. The first crude [[map]] of the islands was made in 1684 by the [[buccaneer]] [[Ambrose Cowley]], who named the individual islands after some of his fellow [[pirate]]s or after British royalty and noblemen. These names were used in the authoritative [[navigation chart]]s of the islands prepared during the ''Beagle'' survey under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], and in Darwin's popular book ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''. The new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832, and subsequently gave them official Spanish names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/GalapagosWWW/Discovery.html Discovery], [http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/GalapagosWWW/Darwin.html Darwin and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; The older names remained in use in English-language publications, including [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[The Encantadas]]'' of 1854.

==Geology==
{{See also|Volcanoes of the Galápagos Islands}}
[[Volcanism]] has been continuous on the Galápagos Islands for at least 20 [[myr]], and perhaps even longer. The [[mantle plume]] beneath the east-ward moving [[Nazca Plate]] (51&amp;nbsp;km/myr) has given rise to a 3-kilometre-thick platform under the [[Archipelago|island chain]] and [[seamount]]s. Besides the Galápagos [[Archipelago]], other key [[tectonics|tectonic features]] in the region include the Northern Galápagos Volcanic Province between the archipelago and the Galápagos [[Mid-ocean ridge|Spreading Center]] (GSC) 200&amp;nbsp;km to the north at the boundary of the Nazca Plate and the [[Cocos Plate]]. This spreading center truncates into the [[East Pacific Rise]] on the west and is bounded by the Cocos Ridge and Carnegie Ridge in the east. Furthermore, the Galápagos [[hotspot (geology)|Hotspot]] is at the northern boundary of the Pacific [[Large low-shear-velocity provinces|Large Low Shear Velocity Province]] while the Easter Hotspot is on the southern boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mittlestaedt|first1=Eric|last2=d'Ozouville|first2=Noemi|last3=Harpp|first3=Karen|last4=Graham|first4=David|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Introduction, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=1–3, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harpp|first1=Karen|last2=Hall|first2=Paul|last3=Jackson|first3=Matthew|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Galapagos and Easter: A Tale of Two Hotspots, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geist&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geist|first1=Dennis|last2=Bergantz|first2=George|last3=Chadwick|first3=William|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Galapagos Magma Chambers, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galápagos Archipelago is characterized by numerous contemporaneous volcanoes, some with plume magma sources, others from the [[asthenosphere]], possibly due to the young and thin [[oceanic crust]]. The GSC caused structural weaknesses in this thin [[lithosphere]] leading to eruptions forming the Galápagos Platform. Fernandina and Isabela in particular are aligned along these weaknesses. Lacking a well-defined [[rift zone]], the islands have a high rate of [[tectonic uplift|inflation]] prior to eruption. Sierra Negra on Isabela Island experienced a 240&amp;nbsp;cm uplift between 1992 and 1998, most recent eruption in 2005, while Fernandina on Fernandina Island indicated an uplift of 90&amp;nbsp;cm, most recent eruption in 2009. Alcedo on Isabela Island had an uplift of greater than 90&amp;nbsp;cm, most recent eruption in 1993. Additional characteristics of the Galápagos Archipelago are closer volcano spacing, smaller volcano sizes, and larger [[caldera]]s. For instance, Isabela Island includes 6 major volcanoes, Ecuador, Wolf, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negraa and Cerro Azul, with most recent eruptions ranging from 1813 to 2008. The neighboring islands of Santiago and Fernandina last erupted in 1906 and 2009, respectively. Overall, the 9 active volcanoes in the archipelago have erupted 24 times between 1961 and 2011. The shape of these volcanoes is that of an "overturned soup bowl" as opposed to the "overturned saucer plate" of the Hawaiian Islands. The Galápagos's shape is due to the pattern of radial and circumferential [[fracture (geology)|fissure]], radial on the flanks, but circumferential near the caldera summits. It is the circumferential fissures which give rise to stacks of short [[lava flow]]s.&lt;ref name=Poland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poland|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Contrasting Volcanism in Hawai'i and the Galapagos, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=5–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volcanoes at the west end of the archipelago are in general, taller, younger, have well developed calderas, and are mostly composed of [[tholeiitic basalt]], while those on the east are shorter, older, lack calderas, and have a more diverse composition. The ages of the islands, from west to east are 0.05 [[Year#Megaannus|Ma]] for Fernandina, 0.65 Ma for Isabela, 1.10 Ma for Santiago, 1.7 Ma for Santa Cruz, 2.90 Ma for Santa Fe, and 3.2 Ma for San Cristobal. The calderas on Sierra Negra and Alcedo have active [[fault (geology)|fault systems]]. The Sierra Negra fault is associated with a [[sill (geology)|sill]] 2&amp;nbsp;km below the caldera. The caldera on Fernandina experienced the largest basaltic volcano collapse in history, with the 1968 [[phreatomagmatic eruption]]. Fernandina has also been the most active volcano since 1790, with recent eruptions in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2009, and the entire surface has been covered in numerous flows since 4.3 [[Year|Ka]]. The western volcanoes have numerous [[tuff]] [[volcanic cone|cones]].&lt;ref name=Poland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merlen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merlen|first1=Godfrey|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Plate Tectonics, Evolution, and the Survival of Species: A Modern Day Hotspot, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurz|first1=Mark|last2=Rowland|first2=Scott|last3=Curtice|first3=Joshua|last4=Saal|first4=Alberto|last5=Naumann|first5=Terry|editor1-last=Harpp|editor1-first=Karen|editor2-last=Mittelstaedt|editor2-first=Eric|editor3-last=d'Ozouville|editor3-first=Noemi|editor4-last=Graham|editor4-first=David|title=Eruption Rates for Fernandina Volcano: A New Chronology at the Galapagos Hotspot Center, in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for the Earth Sciences|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781118852415|pages=41–44, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geist/&gt;

Volcán Wolf on Isabela is the highest point, with an elevation of {{convert|1707|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The group consists of 18 main islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and [[islet]]s. The islands are located at the [[Galapagos Triple Junction]]. The archipelago is located on the [[Nazca Plate]] (a tectonic plate), which is moving east/southeast, diving under the South American Plate at a rate of about {{convert|2.5|in|cm}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Key to Ecuador and the Galápagos|year=1999|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkeley|author=Pearson, David L., David W.

While the older islands have disappeared below the sea as they moved away from the mantle plume, the youngest islands, Isabela and [[Fernandina Island|Fernandina]], are still being formed. In April 2009, lava from the volcanic island Fernandina started flowing both towards the island's shoreline and into the center caldera.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

In late June 2018, Sierra Negra, one of five volcanoes on Isabela and one of the most active in the Galapagos archipelago, began erupting for the first time since 2005. Lava flows made their way to the coastline, prompting the evacuation of about fifty nearby residents and restricting tourist access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mack |first1=Eric |title=Galapagos Volcanoes Keep Erupting Around One Of The World's Most Incredible Islands |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2018/07/02/galapagos-sierra-negra-volcano-erupting-in-ecuador/#2a625a8f2db3 |website=Forbes.com |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=12 August 2018 |archiveurl=http://archive.li/dLUio |archivedate=12 August 2018 |date=2 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Baltra Island|Baltra (South Seymour) Island]] – Baltra is a small flat island located near the centre of the Galápagos. It was created by geological uplift. The island is very arid, and vegetation consists of salt bushes, prickly pear cacti and palo santo trees. Until 1986, [[Seymour Airport|Baltra (Seymour) Airport]] was the only airport serving the Galápagos. Now, there are two airports which receive flights from the continent; the other is located on [[San Cristóbal Island]]. Private planes flying to Galápagos must fly to Baltra, as it is the only airport with facilities for planes overnight. On arriving in Baltra, all visitors are immediately transported by bus to one of two docks. The first dock is located in a small bay, where the boats cruising Galápagos await passengers. The second is a ferry dock, which connects Baltra to the island of Santa Cruz. During the 1940s, scientists decided to move 70 of Baltra's [[Galápagos land iguana|land iguanas]] to the neighboring [[North Seymour Island]] as part of an experiment. This move proved unexpectedly useful when the native iguanas became extinct on Baltra as a result of the island's military occupation in [[World War II]]. During the 1980s, iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] as part of a breeding and repopulation project, and in the 1990s, land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. As of 1997, scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra; 13 of which had hatched on the islands.
* [[Bartolomé Island|Bartolomé (Bartholomew) Island]] – Bartolomé Island is a volcanic islet just off the east coast of Santiago Island in the Galápagos Islands group. it is one of the "younger" islands in the Galápagos archipelago. This island, and neighbouring Sulivan Bay on Santiago (James) island, are named after lifelong friend of Charles Darwin, [[Bartholomew Sulivan|Sir Bartholomew James Sulivan]], who was a lieutenant aboard [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. (2009). [http://darwiningalapagos.com/reviews ''Darwin in Galápagos: Footsteps to a New World.''] Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Sulivan Bay is often misspelled Sullivan Bay. This island is one of the few that are home to the [[Galápagos penguin]] which is the only wild penguin species to live on the equator. The [[green turtle]] is another animal that resides on the island.
* [[Darwin Island|Darwin (Culpepper) Island]] – This island is named after Charles Darwin. It has an area of {{convert|1.1|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|168|m}}. Here fur seals, frigates, [[marine iguanas]], swallow-tailed gulls, sea lions, whales, marine turtles, and red-footed and Nazca boobies can be seen.
*[[Española Island|Española (Hood) Island]] – Its name was given in honor of Spain. It also is known as ''Hood'', after [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Viscount Samuel Hood]]. It has an area of {{convert|60|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|206|m}}. Española is the oldest island at around 3.5&amp;nbsp;million years, and the southernmost in the group. Due to its remote location, Española has a large number of endemic species. It has its own species of lava lizard, mockingbird, and [[Galápagos tortoise]]. Española's [[marine iguanas]] exhibit a distinctive red coloration change between the breeding season. Española is the only place where the [[waved albatross]] nests. Some of the birds have attempted to breed on [[Genovesa Island|Genovesa (Tower) Island]], but unsuccessfully. Española's steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these birds, which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru. Española has two visitor sites. Gardner Bay is a swimming and snorkelling site, and offers a great beach. Punta Suarez has migrant, resident, and endemic wildlife, including brightly colored [[marine iguana]]s, Española lava lizards, [[hood mockingbird]]s, [[swallow-tailed gull]]s, [[Blue-footed booby|blue-footed boobies]], [[Nazca booby|Nazca boobies]], [[red-billed tropicbird]]s, Galápagos hawks, three species of Darwin's finches, and the waved albatross.
* [[Fernandina Island|Fernandina (Narborough) Island]] – The name was given in honor of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who sponsored the voyage of Columbus. Fernandina has an area of {{convert|642|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|1494|m|abbr=on}}. This is the youngest and westernmost island. On 13 May 2005, a new, very eruptive process began on this island, when an ash and water vapor cloud rose to a height of {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr =on}} and lava flows descended the slopes of the volcano on the way to the sea. Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of marine iguanas gather, largely on black lava rocks. The famous [[flightless cormorant]]s inhabit this island, as do [[Galápagos penguin]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[Galápagos sea lion]]s and [[Galápagos fur seal]]s. Different types of [[lava]] flows can be compared, and the [[mangrove]] forests can be observed.
* [[Floreana Island|Floreana (Charles or Santa María) Island]] – It was named after [[Juan José Flores]], the first [[President of Ecuador]], during whose administration the government of Ecuador took possession of the archipelago. It is also called Santa Maria, after [[Santa Maria (ship)|one of the caravels of Columbus]]. It has an area of {{convert|173|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum elevation of {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}}. It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history, and one of the earliest to be inhabited. [[Flamingo]]s and green sea turtles nest (December to May) on this island. The ''patapegada'' or [[Dark-rumped petrel|Galápagos petrel]], a sea bird which spends most of its life away from land, is found here. At Post Office Bay, where 19th-century [[Whaling|whalers]] kept a [[Barrel (storage)|wooden barrel]] that served as a post office, mail could be picked up and delivered to its destinations, mainly Europe and the United States, by ships on their way home. At the "Devil's Crown", an underwater [[volcanic cone]] and [[coral]] formations are found.
* [[Genovesa Island|Genovesa (Tower) Island]] – The name is derived from [[Genoa]], Italy, the birthplace of Christopher Columbus. It has an area of {{Convert|14|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|76|m|abbr=on}}. This island is formed by the remaining edge of a large [[caldera]] that is submerged. Its nickname of "the bird island" is clearly justified. At Darwin Bay, [[frigatebird]]s and [[swallow-tailed gull]]s, the only nocturnal species of gull in the world, can be seen. Red-footed [[booby|boobies]], noddy [[tern]]s, lava gulls, tropic birds, [[dove]]s, [[storm petrel]]s and [[Darwin's finches|Darwin finches]] are also in sight. Prince Philip's Steps is a bird-watching [[plateau]] with Nazca and red-footed boobies. There is a large Palo Santo forest.
* [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela (Albemarle) Island]] – This island was named in honor of Queen Isabela. With an area of {{Convert|4640|km2|abbr=on}}, it is the largest island of the Galápagos. Its highest point is Volcán Wolf, with an altitude of {{Convert|1707|m|abbr=on}}. The island's [[seahorse]] shape is the product of the merging of six large volcanoes into a single land mass. On this island, Galápagos penguins, flightless cormorants, marine iguanas, pelicans and [[Percnon gibbesi|Sally Lightfoot crab]]s abound. At the skirts and calderas of the volcanoes of Isabela, land iguanas and Galápagos tortoises can be observed, as well as Darwin finches, Galápagos hawks, Galápagos doves and very interesting lowland vegetation. The third-largest human settlement of the archipelago, [[Puerto Villamil]], is located at the southeastern tip of the island. It is the only island to have the [[equator]] run across it. It is also the only place in the world where a penguin can be in its natural habitat in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

* [[Marchena Island|Marchena (Bindloe) Island]] – Named after Fray Antonio Marchena, it has an area of {{convert|130|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|343|m|abbr=on}}. [[Galapagos hawk]]s and sea lions inhabit this island, and it is home to the [[Microlophus habelii|Marchena lava lizard]], an endemic animal.
* [[North Seymour Island]] – Its name was given after an English nobleman, [[Lord Hugh Seymour]]. It has an area of {{Convert|1.9|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|28|m|abbr=on}}. This island is home to a large population of blue-footed boobies and swallow-tailed gulls. It hosts one of the largest populations of frigate birds. It was formed from geological uplift.
* [[Pinzón Island|Pinzón (Duncan) Island]] – Named after the Pinzón brothers, captains of the Pinta and Niña caravels, it has an area of {{convert|18|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|458|m|abbr=on}}.
* [[Pinta Island|Pinta (Louis) Island]] – Named after the Pinta caravel, it has an area of {{convert|60|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|777|m|abbr =on}}. Sea lions, Galápagos hawks, giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and dolphins can be seen here. Pinta Island was home to the last remaining Pinta tortoise, called [[Lonesome George]]. He was moved from Pinta Island to the [[Charles Darwin Foundation|Charles Darwin Research Station]] on Santa Cruz Island, where scientists attempted to breed from him. However, Lonesome George died in June 2012 without producing any offspring.
* [[Rábida Island|Rábida (Jervis) Island]] – It bears the name of the convent of Rábida, where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas. It has an area of {{convert|4.95|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|367|m|abbr=on}}. The high amount of iron contained in the lava at Rábida gives it a distinctive red colour. White-cheeked pintail ducks live in a saltwater lagoon close to the beach, where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests. Until recently, flamingos were also found in the lagoon, but they have since moved on to other islands, likely due to a lack of food on Rábida. Nine species of finches have been reported in this island.
* [[San Cristóbal Island|San Cristóbal (Chatham) Island]] – It bears the name of the patron saint of seafarers, "[[St. Christopher]]". Its English name was given after [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. It has an area of {{Convert|558|km2|abbr=on}} and its highest point rises to {{Convert|730|m|abbr=on}}. This is the first island in the Galápagos Archipelago Charles Darwin visited during his voyage on the ''Beagle''. This islands hosts [[Frigatebird|frigate birds]], sea lions, giant tortoises, blue- and red-footed [[booby|boobies]], tropicbirds, [[marine iguana]]s, dolphins and [[swallow-tailed gull]]s. Its vegetation includes ''Calandrinia galapagos'', ''Lecocarpus darwinii'', and trees such as ''Lignum vitae''. The largest freshwater lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in the [[Highland (geography)|highland]]s of San Cristóbal. The capital of the [[Galápagos Province|province of Galápagos]] is [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]], which lies at the southern tip of the island, and is close to [[San Cristóbal Airport]].

* [[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island]] – Given the name of the Holy Cross in Spanish, its English name derives from the British vessel [[HMS Indefatigable (1784)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']]. It has an area of {{convert|986|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|864.5|m|abbr=on}}. Santa Cruz hosts the largest human population in the archipelago, the town of [[Puerto Ayora]]. The [[Charles Darwin Foundation|Charles Darwin Research Station]] and the headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service are located here. The GNPS and CDRS operate a tortoise breeding centre here, where young tortoises are hatched, reared, and prepared to be reintroduced to their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The Highlands of Santa Cruz offer exuberant flora, and are famous for the lava tunnels. Large tortoise populations are found here. Black Turtle Cove is a site surrounded by mangroves, which sea turtles, rays and small sharks sometimes use as a mating area. Cerro Dragón, known for its flamingo lagoon, is also located here, and along the trail one may see land iguanas foraging.
* [[Santa Fe Island|Santa Fe (Barrington) Island]] – Named after a city in Spain, it has an area of {{Convert|24|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|259|m|abbr=on}}. Santa Fe hosts a forest of [[Opuntia]] [[cactus]], which are the largest of the archipelago, and Palo Santo. Weathered cliffs provide a haven for swallow-tailed gulls, red-billed tropic birds and [[shearwater]] petrels. [[Barrington land iguana|Santa Fe species]] of [[Galápagos land iguana|land iguanas]] are often seen, as well as [[lava lizard]]s.
*[[Santiago Island (Galápagos)|Santiago (San Salvador, James) Island]] – Its name is equivalent to Saint James in English; it is also known as San Salvador, after the first island discovered by Columbus in the Caribbean Sea. This island has an area of {{convert|585|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|907|m|abbr=on}}. Marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, land and sea turtles, [[flamingo]]s, dolphins and sharks are found here. Pigs and goats, which were introduced by humans to the islands and have caused great harm to the endemic species, have been eradicated (pigs by 2002; goats by the end of 2006). [[Darwin's finches|Darwin finches]] and Galápagos hawks are usually seen, as well as a colony of fur seals. At Sulivan Bay, a recent (around 100&amp;nbsp;years ago) pahoehoe [[lava]] flow can be observed.
* [[Wolf Island|Wolf (Wenman) Island]] – This island was named after the German geologist [[Theodor Wolf]]. It has an area of {{Convert|1.3|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|253|m|abbr=on}}. Here, [[fur seal]]s, frigatebirds, Nazca and red-footed boobies, marine iguanas, sharks, whales, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls can be seen. The most famous resident is the [[vampire finch]], which feeds partly on blood pecked from other birds, and is only found on this island.

===Minor islands===
* [[Daphne Major]] – A small island directly north of Santa Cruz and directly west of Baltra, this very inaccessible island appears, though unnamed, on Ambrose Cowley's 1684 chart. It is important as the location of multidecade finch population studies by [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]].
* [[South Plaza Island]] (Plaza Sur) – It is named in honor of a former president of Ecuador, General [[Leónidas Plaza]]. It has an area of {{Convert|0.13|km2|abbr=on}} and a maximum altitude of {{Convert|23|m|abbr=on}}. The flora of South Plaza includes ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus and ''[[Sesuvium]]'' plants, which form a reddish carpet on top of the lava formations. Iguanas (land, marine and some hybrids of both species) are abundant, and large numbers of birds can be observed from the cliffs at the southern part of the island, including tropic birds and swallow-tailed gulls.
* [[Nameless Island]] – A small islet used mostly for [[scuba diving]].
* [[Roca Redonda]] – An islet approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela]]. Herman Melville devotes the third and fourth sketches of [[The Encantadas]] to describing this islet (which he calls "Rock Rodondo") and the view from it.

==Climate==
[[File:Chlorophyll concentration off the Galapagos archipelago during El Niño and La Niña.jpg|thumb|These satellite maps show [[chlorophyll]] concentration (which corresponds with the abundance of [[phytoplankton]]) during [[El Niño]] (top) and [[La Niña]] (lower). Blue represents low concentrations, yellow, orange and red indicate high concentrations. Currents that normally [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the phytoplankton reverse during El Niño, resulting in [[Primary production|barren]] oceans. These same currents are strengthened by La Niña, resulting in an explosion of ocean life.]]

Thriving phytoplankton populations are indicated by high chlorophyll concentrations (top image), coloured green, and yellow. Images acquired on 2 March 2009.]]

Although the islands are located on the equator, the [[Humboldt Current]] brings cold water to them, causing frequent drizzles during most of the year. The weather is periodically influenced by the [[El Niño]] events, which occur about every 3 to 7 years and are characterized by warm sea surface temperatures, a rise in sea level, greater wave action, and a depletion of nutrients in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vinueza |first=L. |last2=Branch |first2=G. |last3=Branch |first3=M. |last4=Bustamante |first4=R. |year=2006 |title=Top-down herbivory and bottom-up El Niño effects on Galápagos rocky-shore communities |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=111–131 |doi=10.1890/04-1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season known as the ''garúa'' (June to November), the temperature by the sea is {{convert|22|C}}, a steady and cold wind blows from south and southeast, frequent drizzles (''garúas'') last most of the day, and dense fog conceals the islands. During the warm season (December to May), the average sea and air temperature rises to {{convert|25|C}}, there is no wind at all, there are sporadic, though strong, rains and the sun shines.

Weather changes as altitude increases in the large islands. Temperature decreases gradually with altitude, while precipitation increases due to the condensation of moisture in clouds on the slopes. There is a large range in precipitation from one place to another, not only with altitude, but also depending on the location of the islands, and also with the seasons.

The following table corresponding to the wet 1969 shows the variation of precipitation in different places of Santa Cruz Island:

&lt;/center&gt;

The precipitation also depends on the geographical location. During March 1969, the precipitation over Charles Darwin Station, on the southern coast of Santa Cruz was {{convert|249.0|mm|abbr=on}}, while on Baltra Island, the precipitation during the same month was only {{convert|137.6|mm|abbr=on}}. This is because Baltra is located behind Santa Cruz with respect to the prevailing southerly winds, so most of the moisture gets precipitated in the Santa Cruz highlands.

There are significant changes in precipitation from one year to another, too. At Charles Darwin Station, the precipitation during March 1969 was {{convert|249.0|mm|abbr=on}}, but during March 1970, it was only {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on}}.

On the larger islands, the pattern of generally wet highlands and drier lowlands impacts the flora. The vegetation in the highlands tends to be green and lush, with tropical woodland in places. The lowland areas tend to have arid and semi-arid vegetation, with many thorny shrubs and cacti, and almost bare volcanic rock elsewhere.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
According to a 1952 study by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and Arne Skjølsvold, remains of potsherds and other artifacts from several sites on the islands suggest visitation by South American peoples in [[pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref name=Heyerdahl&gt;Heyerdahl, Thor; &amp; Skjolsvold, Arne (1956). "Archaeological Evidence of Pre-Spanish Visits to the Galápagos Islands", Memoirs 12, Society for American Archaeology.&lt;/ref&gt; The group located an [[Inca Empire|Inca]] flute and shards from more than 130 pieces of ceramics, which were later identified as pre-Incan. However, no remains of graves, ceremonial vessels and constructions have ever been found, suggesting no permanent settlement occurred before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lundh, Jacob (1995). "A brief account of some early inhabitants of Santa Cruz Island." In Noticias de Galápagos No. 55. Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galápagos Islands.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear who the first visitors to the islands were, but they were probably sailors blown off course or people on hapless fishing boats blown out to sea. Most of them were likely unimpressed by the lack of [[fresh water]] on the islands. Whether the Incas ever made it here is disputed; in 1572, Spanish chronicler [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] claimed that [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], the second [[Sapa Inca]] of the [[Inca Empire]] had visited the archipelago, but there is little evidence for this, and many experts consider it a far-fetched legend, especially since the Incas were not seafaring people.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Lisa (2005) ''Moon Galápagos Islands''. Avalon Travel Publishing. p. 200. {{ISBN|163121151X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Galápagos tortoise or Galápagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) - Santa Cruz Island.jpeg|thumb|upright|The Galápagos tortoise or Galápagos giant tortoise (''Chelonoidis nigra'') is the largest living species of tortoise; this one is from the Island of Santa Cruz.]]

===European voyages===
European discovery of the Galápagos Islands occurred when Spaniard [[Fray Tomás de Berlanga]], the fourth [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Panamá|Bishop of Panama]], sailed to [[Peru]] to settle a dispute between [[Francisco Pizarro]] and his lieutenants. De Berlanga's vessel drifted off course when the winds diminished, and his party reached the islands on 10 March 1535.

[[File:Sea lion sleeping on bench in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno 2013.JPG|thumb|Adult [[Galápagos sea lion]] resting on a park bench in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]]
The Galápagos Islands first appeared on the maps of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], in about 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Paul D. |title=Galápagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were named "Insulae de los Galopegos" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the [[Galápagos tortoise|giant tortoise]]s found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Michael Hume |title=Galápagos, a natural history |publisher=University of Calgary Press |year=1993 |page=1 |isbn=978-1-895176-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English captain to visit the Galápagos Islands was [[Richard Hawkins]], in 1593. Until the early 19th century, the archipelago was often used as a hideout by mostly English pirates who attacked Spanish [[galleon]]s carrying gold and silver from South America to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latorre |first1=Octavio  |date=1995 |title=Los tesoros escondidos de las Islas Galapagos |url=http://aquaticcommons.org/6704/1/NG_54%2655_1995_Esp_Latorre_Tesoros_escondidos.pdf |journal=Noticias de Galapagos |volume= |issue=55 |doi= |access-date=2018-02-21 |language=Spanish |pages=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gallapagos Islands 1684.jpg|thumb|left|As described in 1684.]]
In 1793, [[James Colnett]] described the flora and fauna of Galápagos, and suggested the islands could be used as base for the [[whaling|whalers]] operating in the Pacific Ocean. He drew the first accurate navigation charts of the islands. Whalers and [[maritime fur trade]]rs killed and captured thousands of the Galápagos tortoises to extract their fat. The tortoises could be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein, as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water. The hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing, and in some cases eliminating, certain species. Along with whalers came the fur-seal hunters, who brought the population of this animal close to extinction.

The first known permanent human resident on Galápagos was [[Patrick Watkins (sailor)|Patrick Watkins]], an Irish sailor who was marooned on the Island Floreana from 1807 to 1809. According to later accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Porter, D. (1822) [https://archive.org/details/journalofcruisem00port ''Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean'']. Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarnmoor, Salvator R. (Herman Melville) (1854) Encantadas or the Enchanted Isles. Putnam's Monthly Magazine of American Literature, Science, and Art. March–May 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins managed to survive by hunting, growing vegetables and trading with visiting whalers, before finally stealing an open boat and navigating to [[Guayaquil]].

In 1818 the Nantucket whaleship ''Globe'', under Captain George Washington Gardner, discovered a "mother lode" of sperm whales some thousand miles west of the South American coast approximately at the equator. He returned to Nantucket in 1820 with more than 2000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery. This led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the Galápagos Islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the Offshore Grounds. This led to the establishment in the Galápagos Islands of a kind of unofficial "post office" where whaleships stopped to pick up and drop off letters as well as for provisioning and repairing.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Roger; ''The Galapagos Islands;'' 1972; Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York p. 44 {{ISBN|978-0-396-06576-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1820, the whaleship ''Essex'', out of Nantucket, stopped at the Galápagos for these purposes on its way to the Offshore Grounds. On what was then known as Charles Island, while most of the crew were hunting tortoises one crewmember, English boatsteerer Thomas Chappel, for reasons still unclear, lit a fire which quickly burned out of control. Some of the tortoise hunters had a narrow escape and had to run a gauntlet of fire to get back to the ship. Soon almost the entire island was in flames. Crewmembers reported that after a day of sailing away they could still see the flames against the horizon. One crewmember who returned to the Galápagos several years afterward described the entire island as still a blackened wasteland.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, T.

===Ecuadorian Galápagos===
[[Ecuador]] annexed the Galápagos Islands on 12 February 1832, naming them the Archipelago of Ecuador. This new name added to several names that had been, and are still, used to refer to the archipelago. The first governor of Galápagos, General José de Villamil, brought a group of convicts to populate the island of Floreana, and in October 1832, some artisans and farmers joined them.

[[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']] brought the survey ship [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], to the Galápagos on 15 September 1835 to survey approaches to harbours. The captain and others on board, including his companion, the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], made observations on the geology and biology on Chatham, Charles, Albemarle and James islands before they left on 20 October to continue on their round-the-world expedition. Primarily a geologist at the time, Darwin was impressed by the quantity of volcanic craters they saw, later referring to the archipelago as "that land of craters." His study of several volcanic formations over the 5 weeks he stayed in the islands, led to several important geological discoveries, including the first, correct explanation for how volcanic [[tuff]] is formed.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. (2009). ''Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin noticed the [[mockingbird]]s differed between islands, though he thought the birds now known as [[Darwin's finches]] were unrelated to each other, and did not bother labelling them by island.&lt;ref name="Confessions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/|title=VQR – Confessions of a Darwinist|accessdate=26 December 2007|author=Niles Eldredge|authorlink=Niles Eldredge|date= Spring 2006|publisher=The Virginia Quarterly Review|pages=32–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Lawson]], acting Governor of Galápagos for the Republic of the Equator, met them on ''Charles Island'', and as they walked to the prison colony, Lawson told Darwin the tortoises differed from island to island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://firstnighthistory.wordpress.com/tag/nicolai-olaus-lossius/|title=  The Norwegian Who Inspired Darwin |publisher=   ThorNews|accessdate= July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the voyage, Darwin speculated that the distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might "undermine the stability of Species".&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Richard ed. (2000). ''Charles Darwin's zoology notes &amp; specimen lists from H.M.S. Beagle.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1840&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=23 June – August 1836], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=328 291–293]&lt;/ref&gt; When specimens of birds were analyzed on his return to England, it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species of [[finch]]es, which were unique to islands. These facts were crucial in Darwin's development of his theory of [[natural selection]] explaining [[evolution]], which was presented in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Confessions"/&gt;

[[José Valdizán]] and [[Manuel Julián Cobos]] tried a new colonization, beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands (''Roccella portentosa'') used as a coloring agent. After the assassination of Valdizán by some of his workers, Cobos brought from the continent a group of more than a hundred workers to San Cristóbal Island, and tried his luck at planting sugar cane. He ruled his plantation with an iron hand, which led to his assassination in 1904. In 1897, Antonio Gil began another plantation on Isabela Island.

Over the course of a whole year, from September 1904, an expedition of the Academy of Sciences of California, led by [[Rollo Beck]], stayed in the Galápagos collecting scientific material on geology, [[entomology]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[herpetology]]. Another expedition from that Academy was done in 1932 (Templeton Crocker Expedition) to collect insects, fish, [[Exoskeleton|shells]], [[fossil]]s, birds and plants.

For a long time during the early 1900s and at least through 1929, a cash-strapped Ecuador had reached out for potential buyers of the islands to alleviate financial troubles at home. The US had repeatedly expressed its interest in buying the islands for military use as they were positioned strategically guarding the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19290121&amp;id=dksbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AUsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6398,2635333 |title=May Sell Galapagos |date=21 January 1929 |work=from "The United Press" |publisher=The Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the United States, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Chile]] also expressed interest in establishing bases in the islands at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Ferenc |date=1999 |title=El modelo militar prusiano y las fuerzas armadas de Chile 1885-1945 |chapter=¿la guantánamo del océano pacífco? la rivalidad de los ee. uu., alemania, Japón y chile por la adquisición de las islas galápagos antes de la I guerra mundial|url= |location=pécs, Hungary |publisher=University Press |pages=71–87 |isbn= |author-link=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Tapia |first=Claudio |date=2009 |title=La creación de un área de inﬂuencia en América del Sur.

In the 1920s and 1930s, a small wave of European settlers arrived in the islands. There occurred a series of unsolved disappearances on the island of Floreana in the 1930s among the largely European expatriate residents at the time. ''The Galápagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden'' is a 2013 feature-length documentary film about the same. Ecuadorian laws provided all colonists with the possibility of receiving twenty hectares each of free land, the right to maintain their citizenship, freedom from taxation for the first ten years in Galápagos, and the right to hunt and fish freely on all uninhabited islands where they might settle.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, J.P.

A few years later, other colonists from Europe, America and Ecuador started arriving on the islands, seeking a simpler life.&lt;ref&gt;Hoff, S. (1985). ''Drømmen om Galápagos.'' Oslo: Grøndahl &amp; Sønn&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of the Norwegian Kastdalen family and the German Angermeyer still live on the islands.

During World War II, Ecuador authorized the United States to establish a naval base in Baltra Island, and radar stations in other strategic locations. Baltra was established as a United States Army Air Force base. Baltra was given the name of "Beta Base" along with "Alpha Base" in Nicaragua and "Gamma Base" in Salinas (continental Ecuador). The Crews stationed at Baltra and the aforementioned locations established a geographic triangle of protection in charge of patrolling the Pacific for enemy submarines, and also provided protection for the [[Panama Canal]]. After the war, the facilities were given to the government of Ecuador. Today, the island continues as an official Ecuadorian military base. The foundations and other remains of the US base can still be seen as one crosses the island.
In 1946, a penal colony was established in Isabela Island, but it was suspended in 1959.

The Galápagos became a national park in 1959,&lt;ref name="Galapagos.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.com/conservation.php|title=Galápagos Conservation|work=galapagos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tourism started in the 1960s, imposing several restrictions upon the human population already living on the island. However, opportunities in the tourism, fishing, and farming industries attracted a mass of poor fishermen and farmers from mainland Ecuador. In the 1990s and 2000s, violent confrontations between parts of the local population and the Galápagos National Park Service occurred, including capturing and killing giant tortoises and holding staff of the Galápagos National Park Service hostage to obtain higher annual sea cucumber quotas.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Water taxi in Puerto Ayora on the Island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos photo by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|thumb| Water taxi on [[Puerto Ayora]], [[Galápagos]]]]
{{Main article|Galápagos Province}}
The islands are administered by a provincial government. It was made a province by presidential decree by President [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodríguez Lara]] on 18 February 1973. The province is divided into [[Cantons of Ecuador|cantons]], each covering certain islands. The capital is [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]].

==Demographics==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The largest ethnic group is composed of Ecuadorian [[Mestizo]]s, the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Native Americans, who arrived mainly in the last century from the [[continent]]al part of [[Ecuador]]. Some descendants of the early European and American colonists on the islands also still remain on the islands.

In 1959, approximately 1,000 to 2,000 people called the islands their home. In 1972 a census in the archipelago recorded a population of 3,488. By the 1980s, this number had risen to more than 15,000 people, and in 2010 there were 25,124 people in the Galápagos.

Five of the islands are inhabited: [[Baltra Island|Baltra]], [[Floreana Island|Floreana]], [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela]], [[San Cristóbal Island|San Cristóbal]] and [[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz]].

==Travel==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Options for flying into the Galápagos are limited to two islands: San Cristobal ([[San Cristóbal Airport]]) and Baltra ([[Seymour Airport]]). Private aircraft must use Baltra as it is the airport equipped with overnight plane accommodations. Seymour Airport on Baltra was recently renovated (2012–2013) to accommodate larger planes.

Until 1969 the only way to visit was on a private or chartered vessel. There was no regular air service until Forrest Nelson's Hotel Galápagos began the first organized tours in April 1969. Soon other travel companies brought in tour ships and yachts, and local fishermen began converting their wooden boats for rudimentary cruising with guests. These vessels were the main source of overnight accommodations in the Galápagos. Today there are about 85 yachts and ships equipped for overnight guests. In 2006 the Baltra military governed island, was opened up to limited overnight camping. Baltra also requires permits by the military government for overnight stays on the beach. Other inhabited islands also allow camping on the beaches designated as "recreational" use to the locals. All of these camping permits are limited to number of people and nights, with most nights not to exceed three.

Land based hotels are opening on the inhabited islands of San Cristobal, Santa Cruz, Floreana and Isabela. By 2012, more than half the visitors to Galápagos made their tours using day boats and these small hotels. Restaurants, easy access and economy make this an attractive travel option. The cruise tours are still the best way to see all the complex environment and wildlife of the islands.

There are only 116 visitor sites in the Galápagos: 54 land sites and 62 scuba-diving or snorkeling sites. Small groups are allowed to visit in 2- to 4-hour shifts only, to limit impact on the area. All groups are accompanied by licensed guides.

Though the first protective legislation for the Galápagos was enacted in 1930 and supplemented in 1936, it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna. In 1955, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature organized a fact-finding mission to the Galápagos. Two years later, in 1957, [[UNESCO]], in cooperation with the government of Ecuador, sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station.

In 1959, the centenary year of [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', the Ecuadorian government declared 97.5% of the archipelago's land area a [[national park]], excepting areas already colonised. The [[Charles Darwin Foundation]] (CDF) was founded the same year. The core responsibility of CDF, an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) constituted in Belgium, is to conduct research and provide the research findings to the government for effective management of Galápagos. CDF's research efforts began with the establishment of the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] on Santa Cruz Island in 1964. During the early years, conservation programs, such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species, were carried out by research station personnel. Now much of that work is accomplished by the [[Galápagos National Park]] Service using the research findings and methodologies developed by CDF.

In 1986, the 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 sq mi) of ocean surrounding the islands was declared a [[marine reserve]], second in size only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. In 1990, the archipelago became a whale sanctuary. [[UNESCO]] recognised the islands in 1978 as a [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref&gt;Grant, K. Thalia. (2009) [http://whc.unesco.org/en/review/54/ "Darwin and the Galapagos: Evolution of a Legacy"]. ''World Heritage'' No. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1985, as a [[biosphere reserve]]. This was later extended in December 2001 to include the marine reserve.
In July 2010, the World Heritage Committee agreed to remove the Galápagos Islands from its list of precious sites endangered by environmental threats or overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/07/29/galapagos-no-longer-world-heri/ |title=Galápagos no longer on List of World Heritage in Danger – News Watch |publisher=Blogs.nationalgeographic.com |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noteworthy species include:
* [[Galápagos land iguanas]], ''[[Conolophus]]'' spp.
* [[Marine iguana]], ''Amblyrhynchus cristatus'', the only iguana feeding in the sea
* [[Galápagos tortoise]] (Galápagos giant [[tortoise]]), ''Chelonoidis nigra'', known as ''galápago'' in Spanish, it gave the name to the islands
* Galápagos green turtle, ''Chelonia mydas agassisi'', a subspecies of the [[green turtle]]

* [[Waved albatross]], ''Phoebastria irrorata'', the only living tropical [[albatross]]
* [[Galápagos hawk]], ''Buteo galapagoensis'', the islands' main [[scavenger]] (at the [[Apex predator|top of the food chain]]) and "environmental police"
* Four [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species of [[Nesomimus|Galápagos mockingbirds]], the first species Darwin noticed to vary from island to island
* Thirteen endemic species of [[tanager]]s, popularly called [[Darwin's finches]]. Among them is the [[sharp-beaked ground finch]] ''Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis'' which is sometimes called the "vampire finch" for its blood-sucking habits, and the tool-using [[woodpecker finch]], ''Camarhynchus pallidus''
* [[Galápagos sea lion]]s, ''Zalophus wollebaeki'', closely related to the California sea lion, but smaller
* Two endemic genera of cacti, each with a single species: ''[[Jasminocereus|Jasminocereus thouarsii]]'', the candelabra cactus, and ''[[Lava cactus|Brachycereus nesioticus]]'', the lava cactus

===Environmental threats===
&lt;!--[[Endangered species]] links here--&gt;
Introduced plants and animals, such as feral goats, cats, and cattle, brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans, represent the main threat to Galápagos. Quick to reproduce and with no natural predators, these alien species decimated the habitats of native species. The native animals, lacking natural predators on the islands, are defenseless to introduced predators.

There are over 700 introduced plant species today. There are only 500 native and endemic species. This difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them. These plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of San Cristobal, Floreana, Isabela and Santa Cruz. Some of the most harmful introduced plants are the guayaba or [[guava]] (''Psidium guajava''), [[avocado]] (''Persea americana''), [[cascarilla]] (''Cinchona pubescens''), [[balsa]] (''Ochroma pyramidale''), [[hill raspberry]] (''Rubus niveus''), various [[citrus]] (orange, [[grapefruit]], lemon), [[floripondio]], higuerilla (''[[Ricinus communis]]'') trees and the elephant grass, ''[[Pennisetum purpureum]]''.

Many species were introduced to the Galápagos by [[pirate]]s. [[Thor Heyerdahl]] quoted documents that mention the [[Viceroy of Peru]], knowing that British pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats.&lt;ref name=Heyerdahl/&gt; Also, when colonization of Floreana by José de Villamil failed, he ordered the goats, donkeys, cattle and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization.

Non-native goats, pigs, dogs, rats, cats, mice, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, poultry, ants, cockroaches, and some parasites inhabit the islands today. Dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy the nests of birds, land tortoises, and marine turtles. They sometimes kill small Galápagos tortoises and iguanas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petsaspests.blogspot.com.es/search/label/Gal%C3%A1pagos |title=Feral dogs and cats in Galápagos |publisher=Petsaspests.blogspot.com.es |date= |accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigs are even more harmful, covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises, turtles and iguanas, as well as eating the animals' native food. Pigs also knock down vegetation in their search for roots and insects. This problem abounds in Cerro Azul volcano and Isabela, and in Santiago, pigs may be the cause of the disappearance of the land iguanas that were so abundant when Darwin visited. The [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus'') attacks small Galápagos tortoises when they leave the nest, so in Pinzón they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50&amp;nbsp;years; only adults were found on that island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicholls, Henry |url=http://www.nature.com/news/invasive-species-the-18-km2-rat-trap-1.12992 |title=Invasive species: The 18-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rat trap |journal=Nature |volume=497 |issue=7449 |pages=306–308 |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=8 November 2015|doi=10.1038/497306a |pmid=23676736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, where the black rat is found, the endemic rat has disappeared. Cattle and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for the scarce water. In 1959, fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to Pinta island; by 1973, the National Park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals. Goats were also introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971. A goat eradication program, however, cleared the goats from Pinta and Santiago and most of the goat population from Isabela.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galapagos.org/conservation/conservation/conservationchallenges/invasive-species/|title=Invasive Species|website=Galapagos Conservancy|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fast-growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists, who fear domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic wild bird populations.

The Galápagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities, in addition to other problems of development.&lt;ref name=Carr2013&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carr, Lindsey A |author2=Stier, Adrian C |author3=Fietz, Katharina |author4=Montero, Ignacio |author5=Gallagher, Austin J |author6=Bruno, John F |year=2013 |title=Illegal shark fishing in the Galápagos marine reserve |journal=Marine Policy |volume=39 |pages=317–321 |url=http://rjd.miami.edu/assets/pdfs/pubs/Carr%20et%20al%202013.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2012.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most pressing threat to the Marine Reserve comes from local, mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the Reserve, such as sharks (hammerheads and other species) for their fins,&lt;ref name=Carr2013/&gt; and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season. Development threatens both land and sea species. The growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the Archipelago. The grounding of the oil tanker ''[[Jessica (tanker)|Jessica]]'' in 2001 and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention.

In 2007, [[UNESCO]] put the Galápagos Islands on their [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of threats posed by invasive species, unbridled tourism and overfishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/
|title=World Heritage in Danger List
|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage
|accessdate=8 August 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 29 July 2010, the [[World Heritage Committee]] decided to remove the Galápagos Islands from the list because the Committee found significant progress had been made by Ecuador in addressing these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 28 January 2008, [[Galápagos National Park]] official Victor Carrion announced 53 sea lions (13 [[Pinniped|pups]], 25 youngsters, 9 males and 6 females) were killed at the Galápagos Islands nature reserve on [[Pinta Island|Pinta]], with their heads caved in. In 2001, [[Poaching|poachers]] killed 35 male sea lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7214860.stm |title=BBC NEWS, Sea lions massacred in Galápagos |publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galápagos Islands were short-listed as a candidate to be one of the [[New7Wonders of Nature]] by the New7Wonders of Nature Foundation. As of February 2009, the archipelago was ranked first in Group B, the category for islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/ New 7 Wonders of the World: Live Ranking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705105855/http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/ |date=5 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands' biodiversity is under threat from several sources. The human population is growing at an unsustainable rate of 8% per year (1995). Introduced species have caused damage, and in 1996 a US$5 million, five-year eradication plan commenced in an attempt to rid the islands of introduced species such as goats, rats, deer, and donkeys. Except for the rats, the project was essentially completed in 2006.&lt;ref name="Isabela1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Isabela2" /&gt; Rats have only been eliminated from the smaller Galápagos Islands of [[Rábida Island|Rábida]] and [[Pinzón Island|Pinzón]].&lt;ref name="Isabela3"&gt;{{cite web | title = Post-Rat Eradication and Monitoring on Pinzón | publisher = [[Galapagos Conservancy]] | url = http://www.galapagos.org/conservation/conservation/project-areas/ecosystem-restoration/rat-eradication/ | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El Niño]] has adversely affected the marine ecosystem. In January 2001, an oil slick from a stranded tanker threatened the islands, but winds and shifting ocean currents helped disperse the oil before much damage was done. The devastating El Nino of 1982-83 saw almost six times as much rain as normal in the Galapagos and created a wildlife catastrophe. &lt;ref name="Galpagos-Islands"&gt;{{cite web | title = Galapagos: El Niño and La Niña | url = https://www.galapagos-islands.com/2018/05/galapagos-el-nino-and-la-nina.html | accessdate = 2018-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997–98 El Niño adversely affected wildlife in the waters surrounding the islands, as the waters were {{convert|5|C-change|0}} warmer than normal. Corals and barnacles suffered, hammerhead sharks were driven away, and most of the island's seabirds failed to breed in 1997–98. The mortality rate of marine iguanas rose as the green algae they feed on was replaced by inedible red algae. During the 1982–83 El Niño, 70% of the marine iguanas starved to death because of this.&lt;ref name="Galápagos Islands 2010"&gt;"Galápagos Islands" in ''The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide'' (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1972">The '''geology of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]]''' comprises the Chagos Archipelago—the above water portion of the [[Chagos Bank]]. Formed from hotspot volcanism, the Chagos Bank was separated from the [[Nazareth Bank]] 36&amp;nbsp;million years ago by activity on the Central Indian Ridge. Aside from plate boundaries, the region is one of the most seismically active and earthquakes have caused subsidence of some islands.

Described by Charles Darwin as "a ledge of brecciated coral rocks projecting seawards from the outer shore," the Chagos Archipelago has unusual  [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] platforms. The islands lack [[Eemian]] age carbonates, which are present in the Seychelles for reasons that are not clear—hypothesized to include local storm erosion.&lt;ref name="researchgate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230751432|date=2005-01-14|title= Reef and island formation and Late Holocene sea-level changes in the Chagos islands|author=A. Eisenhauer, G. A. Heiss, C. R. C. Sheppard, W.-C. Dullo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The offshore waters around the archipelago contain deep-sea ferromanganese nodules, with globular, dendritic and laminated microstructures formed from iron-manganese oxide.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petrogenesis of ferromanganese nodules from east of the Chagos Archipelago, Central Indian Basin, Indian Ocean|journal=Marine Geology|volume=157|issue=3–4|pages=145–158|doi=10.1016/S0025-3227(98)00156-X|year=1999|last1=Banerjee|first1=Ranadip|last2=Roy|first2=Supriya|last3=Dasgupta|first3=Somnath|last4=Mukhopadhyay|first4=Subir|last5=Miura|first5=Hiroyuki}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the US military presence on the island the US Geological Survey has conducted water resource analysis since 1984.

*{{HMS|Discovery|1800}} was a survey vessel in service in 1800 and sold in 1828.
*HMS ''Discovery'' was to have been a wood screw [[gunvessel]]. She was ordered in 1861 but was cancelled in 1863.
*{{HMS|Discovery|1874}} was a wood screw storeship, formerly the civilian ''Bloodhound'', purchased in 1874. She was commanded by Captain [[George Nares]] during the [[British Arctic Expedition]] between 1875 and 1876. She was sold in 1902.
*[[RRS Discovery|HMS ''Discovery'']] was a purpose-built survey ship launched in 1901. She was commanded by Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] during the [[Discovery Expedition]] to the Antarctic in 1901, and was sold in 1905. She was re-designated [[Royal Research Ship|RRS]] (Royal Research Ship) ''Discovery'' in 1923, repurchased in 1929 as a [[training ship]], and was handed over for preserving as a [[museum ship]] in 1979.
*{{HMCS|Discovery}}, the Vancouver [[stone frigate]] of the Royal Canadian Navy reserve, established as a volunteer half-company of the [[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in 1924 and commissioned as ''Discovery'' in 1941.

'''ISO 3166-2:PS''' is the entry for the [[State of Palestine]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the [[State of Palestine]], it claims the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], but in fact controls only about 40% of the West Bank. ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority|16 governorates]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PS}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the State of Palestine. The second part is three letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative languages]]:
* (ar): [[Arabic language|Arabic]]
* (en): [[English language|English]]

'''Karagiye''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: Қарақия ойпаты, Karagiye means ''Black Jaw'' in [[Turkish language|Turkic]]&lt;ref name="KTLOW"/&gt;) is a {{convert|40|km}} long [[karst]] [[trench]] close to the [[Caspian Sea]]. At approximately {{convert|132|m}} below [[sea level]] it is the lowest point in [[Central Asia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]]. It is also known as the "Karagiye Depression" and "Karagiye Mountain Trench".&lt;ref name="KTLOW"&gt;{{cite book |title=KAZAKHSTAN THE LAND OF WONDERS |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=BW-KZ |location=Almaty |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trench was formed as soluble [[limestone]], [[dolomite]] and [[gypsum]] dissolved forming [[pothole]]s, funnels and caves that eventually collapsed. Today the trench features many [[scarp face|scarps]] and offsets and generates long rain clouds caused by the air rising above it.&lt;ref name="KTLOW"/&gt; There is a [[vernal pool|vernal lake]] in the south-west of the trench and a stream rising from a drilled well that disappears back into the ground within the trench.&lt;ref name="KTLOW"/&gt;

The trench is inhabited by [[mouflon]], [[corsac fox|corsac]], [[snake]]s, [[hares]] and [[vulture]]s. It is the only place within the [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]] that mushrooms grow and these are collected by locals.&lt;ref name="KTLOW"/&gt;

''Journal of Medical Entomology.'' 1998(35):435-445.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the discipline of [[landscape ecology]] is concerned with analyzing both pattern and process in ecosystems across time and space, landscape epidemiology can be used to analyze both risk patterns and environmental risk factors.

''Natural Nidality of Transmissible Diseases, With Special Reference to the Landscape Epidemiology of Zooanthroponse.'' Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Evgeniy Pavlovsky]] introduced the concept of natural nidality or focality, defined by the idea that microscale disease foci are determined by the entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Galuzo, I.G. "Landscape Epidemiology (epizootiology)." ''Advances in Veterinary Science &amp; Comparative Medicine.'' 1975(19):73-96.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent availability of new computing technologies such as [[geographic information systems]], [[remote sensing]], statistical methods including spatial statistics and theories of [[landscape ecology]], the concept of landscape epidemiology has been applied analytically to a variety of disease systems, including [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, L.

This is a list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]s in [[China]]. China has 53, ranking [[Table of World Heritage sites by country|second in the world]]. China ratified The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage on 12 December 1985. These sites comprise some of the most essential part of China's valuable and rich [[Tourism in China|tourism]] resources.

==Overview==
Since joining the International Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1985, China has 53 world heritage sites to date; of these 36 are cultural heritage sites, 13 are natural heritage sites, and 4 are cultural and natural (mixed) sites, ranking second in the world.

In addition, there are also several Chinese documents inscribed in UNESCO's list [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World]], which registers the world's documentary heritage.

| [[Jerusalem Law]] states that "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel", and the city serves as the seat of the government, home to the president's residence, government offices, supreme court, and parliament. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] declared the Jerusalem Law "null and void" and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem. The United Nations and nearly all of its member states maintain their embassies in other cities such as [[Tel Aviv]], [[Ramat Gan]], and [[Herzliya]], and do not recognise Jerusalem as the capital;&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook] and [https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf Map of Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; however, in May 2018, the [[United States]] and [[Guatemala]] moved their official embassies to Jerusalem, and several other UN member states indicated that they were considering doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/after-us-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-more-countries-follow-its-lead.html See]&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries officially adhere to the proposal that Jerusalem have international status, as called for in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Partition Plan]] of 1947. The [[Palestinian National Authority]] claims East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharkansky |first=Ira |authorlink=Ira Sharkansky |title=Governing Jerusalem: Again on the world's agenda |page=23 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8143-2592-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Positions on Jerusalem]].

|The State of Palestine claims the territories occupied by Israel since the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, with [[East Jerusalem]] as its capital. The proclaimed state is currently occupied by Israel and has no effective control over the territories it claims. Administration is based in [[Ramallah]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]], rather than Jerusalem. Most members of the United Nations regard East Jerusalem as occupied territory, and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Arab League]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] recognise it as the capital of a future Palestinian state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14119">[[File:Jordan nature reserves location map.svg|thumb|upright|Approximate locations of the first six reserves]]
There are at least seven '''[[nature reserves]] in [[Jordan]]'''. In 1966, the organization that would later start Jordan's nature reserves, the [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]], was founded. RSCN's first efforts involved bringing back severely endangered species. In 1973, RSCN, was given the right to issue [[hunting license]]s, giving RSCN an upper hand in preventing extinction. The first step was the founding of Jordan's first nature reserve, [[Shaumari Wildlife Reserve]], in 1975. The primary purpose was to create means to breed endangered species, specifically: the [[Arabian oryx]], [[gazelles]], [[ostriches]] and [[Persian onager]]s in their natural environment.

In 1994, shortly after [[Dana Biosphere Reserve]] was established, RSCN began its Research and Survey section, made up of experienced researchers with the primary goal of collecting information at the reserves needed to create a sustainable living environment for wild animals through scientific research. Shortly thereafter, Wild Jordan was created as a business branch of RSCN dealing with socio-economic projects. In 1999, RSCN started a training program to build local and regional skill in conserving nature. RSCN raised more awareness in 2005 with a "Save Jordan's Trees" campaign. Jordan's sixth and latest nature reserve, [[Dibeen Forest Reserve]], was created in 2004, cementing {{convert|1200|km2|sqmi|0|}} of protected natural landscape throughout Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Full Story|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/AboutRSCN/History/TheFullStory/tabid/128/Default.aspx|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|accessdate=2009-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608134010/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/AboutRSCN/History/TheFullStory/tabid/128/Default.aspx|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are eight proposed nature reserves in Jordan, and two more sites that are possible candidates for preservation.&lt;ref name="prop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposed Protected Areas|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/ProposedProtectedAreas/tabid/100/Default.aspx|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation for Nature|accessdate=2009-06-16|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503071900/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/ProposedProtectedAreas/tabid/100/Default.aspx|archivedate=2009-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protected Areas|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/tabid/91/Default.aspx|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation for Nature|accessdate=2009-06-16|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420011813/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/tabid/91/Default.aspx|archivedate=2015-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dana Biosphere Reserve===
[[File:Danagorge.jpg|thumb|left|Dana Gorge]]
Dana Biosphere Reserve, often simply called Dana Nature Reserve, is Jordan's largest reserve, located in and around the town of [[Dana, Jordan|Dana]] in the mountains east of [[Wadi Araba]]. The geography of the reserve is characterized by steep cliffs in rocky wadis covered by small trees and shrubs. The varied geology switches from [[limestone]] to [[sandstone]] to [[granite]]. Some illegal activities such as grazing and woodcutting continue. Illegal hunting threatens [[ibex]] and [[chukar partridge|chukar]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Biosphere Reserve|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/DanaBiosphereReserve/tabid/93/Default.aspx|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516082613/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/DanaBiosphereReserve/tabid/93/Default.aspx|archivedate=2011-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wadi Mujib===
[[File:Wadi Mujib4.jpeg|thumb|right|Wadi Mujib]]
Mujib Nature Reserve, commonly known as Wadi Mujib, is a long canyon feeding the [[Dead Sea]] running through the ancient region of [[Moab]] and the lowest nature reserve in the world. Directly east of the Dead Sea, Wadi Mujib is made up by a network of freshwater streams, making an otherwise arid area more fertile. The lush riverbeds provide support for aquatic plants. As well as containing 300 species of plants, Wadi Mujib contains at least 10 species of carnivores and other animals, including the hyrax, badger, and the Nubian ibex which was reintroduced into the wild by RSCN. Illegal hunting continues to impede efforts to reach a sustainable number of wild ibexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mujib Nature Reserve|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/MujibNatureReserve/tabid/94/Default.aspx|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624104739/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/MujibNatureReserve/tabid/94/Default.aspx|archivedate=2008-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ajloun Reserve===
[[File:Ajlun Green.jpg|thumb|left|Ajloun forest]]
Ajloun Forest Reserve is in north Jordan, near [[Jerash]] and [[Ajloun]], and close to the [[Ajloun Castle]]. The reserve consists of rolling hills in a Mediterranean-like environment, covered in [[oak|evergreen oaks]], as well as strawberry and pistachio trees, among others. [[Stone marten]]s, [[jackals]], [[red foxes]], [[striped hyena]]s, [[Persian squirrel]]s, [[porcupines]], and [[wolves]] inhabit this area. Privately owned lands surrounding the reserve pose threats, including illegitimate access to the reserve, resulting in illegal hunting, woodcutting, and grazing. Cooperation with local inhabitants has resulted in increased awareness in the community regarding the preservation of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajloun Forest Reserve|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AjlounForestReserve/tabid/96/Default.aspx|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712041505/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AjlounForestReserve/tabid/96/Default.aspx|archivedate=2012-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dibeen Forest Reserve===
[[File:Dibeen Trees.jpg|thumb|right|Vista in Dibeen]]
Dibeen Forest, close to the ancient Roman city of [[Jerash]], is the newest reserve in Jordan, established in 2004. The forest is a pine-oak habitat, housing the [[Aleppo pine]] and marking the geographical limit of this type of forest. Animal inhabitants such as the [[Persian squirrel]] were main reasons for the establishment of the reserve and were considered top priority. Strawberry, pistachio, and wild olive trees also grow in the reserve. Trash, notably [[plastic]], presents a major problem in the reserve, often the result of careless visitors.&lt;ref name="dibeen"/&gt;

===Azraq Wetland Reserve===
[[File:Azraq view.jpg|thumb|left|Azraq wetland]]
The Azraq Wetlands, located in Jordan's eastern desert near the town of [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]], is RSCN's only wetlands reserve. The reserve, once a popular stopover for millions of migratory birds going from [[Africa]] to [[Eurasia]], is now severely depleted due to over-pumping to support Jordan's growing population. In 1978, the reserve was established as an effort to conserve the oasis. Between 1981 and 1993, water levels decreased sharply, concluding with the drying up of the springs in 1992. Azraq today only makes up 0.04% of its former size. Water levels are maintained by RSCN in order to save indigenous fish species such as the Azraq Killfish and to keep the site a tourist destination. Efforts have been partially successful; some birds have returned and killfish have increased in numbers, but attempts to increase the water mass by 10% of the original size have been unsuccessful. Water pumping and lack of manpower and wetland experience keep water levels at a low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azraq Wetlands Reserve|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AzraqWetlandReserve/tabid/98/Default.aspx|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624104203/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AzraqWetlandReserve/tabid/98/Default.aspx|archivedate=2008-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaumari Reserve===
[[File:Shaumarinaturereserve.jpg|thumb|right|Reeds in Shaumari]]
Shaumari Wildlife Reserve is located in the eastern Jordanian desert, close to [[Azraq Wetland Reserve]]. The geology comprises desert wadis making up 65% of the area and Hammada areas covered in black flint forming 35% of the reserve. Founded in 1975, Shaumari was founded for the wildlife in the desert area. One of the main goals of the reserve has been to bring back locally extinct species, notably the [[Arabian oryx]], into the wild. In 1978, 4 Arabian oryxs were brought to the reserve for a breeding program. Starting in 1983, 31 oryxs were released into the wild, successfully returning the oryx into its native environment. Other species, such as [[Somali ostrich]]es, [[Persian onager]]s and [[gazelle]]s reside in the reserve. Before the establishment of the reserve, hunting nearly annihilated local animal populations, a problem which RSCN has been successful in dealing with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaumari Wildlife Reserve|publisher=Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/ShaumariWildlifeReserve/tabid/95/Default.aspx|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430193138/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/ShaumariWildlifeReserve/tabid/95/Default.aspx|archivedate=2009-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifa Nature Reserve===
On July 13, 2011, the Fifa Nature Reserve was officially declared. It is located in the south-western part of Jordan. The reserve has an area of 23.2 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In part lying well below sea level, the reserve contains the salt plant pattern and the tropical plant pattern.&lt;ref name="Fifa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/FifaNatureReserve/tabid/338/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224195725/http://rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/FifaNatureReserve/tabid/338/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-12-24 |df= }}, accessed 2014-11-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature has expressed interest in creating up to nine new nature reserves in Jordan.&lt;ref name="rw"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Eddie|date=March–April 2009 |title=Protect &amp; Serve |journal=Royal Wings |volume= |issue= |pages=35–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these, Fifa, was established in 2011. There were also two other sites mentioned in two reports issued in 1979 and 1998 on the feasibility of new reserve sites around the country.&lt;ref name="prot"/&gt; The nine that RSCN have expressed interest in include:&lt;ref name="prop"/&gt;
*'''Burqu’'''
*'''Yarmouk River'''
*'''Qatar'''
*'''Jabal Mas’uda'''
*'''Aqaba Mountains'''
*'''Rajel'''
*'''Abu Rukbeh'''
*'''Bayer'''

The two additional sites are:&lt;ref name="prot"/&gt;
*'''Jarba'''
*'''Jordan River'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5033">'''Picture the Homeless''' (PTH) is an American [[homelessness|homeless]] person–led rights organization founded in 1999&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Stewart, Nikita, "Born of Homelessness, a Group Takes Stock of Its Policy Victories," The New York Times, 23 December 2017, p. A20.&lt;/ref&gt; based in the [[New York, New York]].  It focuses on [[human rights]], [[Housing|housing]], [[police violence]] and other [[social justice]] issues.  It was housed originally in [[Judson Memorial Church]], which still hosts its Longest Night of the Year [[memorial]] event, and was located for a time in [[Spanish Harlem|El Barrio]] and 2427 Morris Avenue in the [[Bronx]].  It is currently based on 126th Street in [[Manhattan]].

==Profile==

The group is a [[nonprofit]] organization whose goal is to end homelessness. It believes that people who are homeless must become an organized, effective voice for systemic change. PTH attempts to develop [[leadership]] among homeless people to impact policies and systems that affect their lives.  They also endeavor to create space for them, and their agenda, within the broader social justice movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.picturethehomeless.org/home/about/ |title=Picture the Homeless: About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are strong proponents of diverting funds from the [[New York City Department of Homeless Services]] out of the shelter system and into [[community land trust]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Andrew Hutchins representing Picture the Homeless at Studio X, October 29, 2013.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9TgUSxdGTU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Gibbs representing Picture the Homeless at [[Monroe College]], October 12, 2013.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzzlQJ-Lx5Q&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, the organization founded a [[coalition]] called [[The New York City Community Land Initiative]] with [[The New Economy Project]] and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan O'Oonnor. "The Ungentrifiers: Hiding affordable apartments from a ravenous market." ''The Awl''. July 30th, 2015 http://nyf.org/newsmakers/picture-the-homeless-and-new-economy-project-quoted-in-report-on-community-land-trusts-in-feature-on-the-awl/&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times'' writer Nikita Stewart in December 2017 described it as "one of the nation's few advocacy organizations founded by homeless people and led by people who are experiencing or have experienced homelessness" and that "the group has made itself a formidable influence on city policy."&lt;ref  name=NYT/&gt;

==Campaigns==

*[[Civil Rights]] - Picture the Homeless is involved in a number of civil rights campaigns with a large focus on anti-police brutality [[protest]]s and [[court case]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nyclu.org/en/cases/picture-homeless-v-city-new-york-challenging-nypds-singling-out-homeless|title=Picture the Homeless v.

*Housing - The organization believes that [[right to housing|housing is a human right]] and that access to housing is in crisis in New York City. Their campaigns have included fighting for [[affordable housing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.picturethehomeless.org/blog/hnwapril|title=Housing Not Warehousing Campaign|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803143747/http://www.picturethehomeless.org/blog/hnwapril|archivedate=2010-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their actions have included occupying buildings and vacant lots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indypendent.org/2009/03/19/east-harlem-residents-and-housing-advocates-rally/|title=East Harlem Residents, Housing Advocates Rally Outside Vacant Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/activists-for-homeless-occupy-east-harlem-lot/|title=Activists Arrested After Occupying East Harlem Lot|publisher=New York Times | first=Colin | last=Moynihan | date=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International connections==

In 2009 four members of Picture the Homeless traveled to [[Budapest, Hungary]] to meet homeless and other activists, present their work in New York and to mutually exchange experiences. In Budapest, the group was instrumental in founding Hungary’s first homeless-led advocacy group called A Város Mindenkié ([[The City is For All]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indypendent.org/2009/09/09/homeless-in-hungary/

[[Image:Antarctican bases.png|thumb|300px|Countries that have one or more stations in Antarctica]]
A number of governments have set up permanent research stations in Antarctica and these bases are widely distributed. Unlike the [[drifting ice station]]s set up in the [[Arctic]], the [[research station]]s of the [[Antarctic]] are constructed either on rock or on ice that is (for practical purposes) fixed in place.

Many of the stations are [[Demographics of Antarctica|staffed]] around the year. A total of 40 countries (as of October 2006), all signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], operate seasonal (summer) and year-round research stations on the continent.
The population of people performing and supporting scientific research on the continent and nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 during the summer season to 1,000 during winter (June).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Silja Vöneky|author2=Sange Addison-Agyei|authorlink1=Silja Vöneky|title=Oxford Public International Law|journal=Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to these permanent stations, approximately [[Antarctic field camps|30 field camps]] are established each summer to support specific projects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/4past.htm 4.0 Antarctica - Past and Present&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- This cite seems to be only about United States stations, not the whole of the Antarctic --&gt;

==History==

===First bases===
[[File:Omond House - Laurie Island.jpg|thumb|300px|"Omond House", the first permanent base, built in 1903 by the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]]]]
During the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] in the late 19th century, the first bases on the continent were established. In 1898, [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], a Norwegian/British explorer, led the British Antarctic Expedition to [[Cape Adare]], where he established the first Antarctic base on Ridley Beach. The expedition is often referred to now as the [[Southern Cross Expedition|'Southern Cross' Expedition]], after their ship's name. Most of the staff were Norwegian, but the funds for the expedition were British, provided by Sir [[George Newnes]]. The 10 members of the expedition explored Robinson Bay to the west of Cape Adare by dog teams, and later, after being picked up by the ship at the base, went ashore on the Ross Ice Shelf for brief journeys. The expedition hut is still in good condition and visited frequently by tourists.

The hut was later occupied by Scott's Northern Party under the command of [[Victor Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|Victor Campbell]] for a year in 1911, after its attempt to explore the eastern end of the ice shelf discovered [[Roald Amundsen]] already ashore preparing for his assault on the South Pole.

In 1903, Dr [[William Speirs Bruce|William S. Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] set off to Antarctica, with one of its aims to establish a meteorological station in the area. After the expedition failed to find land, Bruce decided to head back to the Laurie Island in the  [[South Orkneys]] and find an anchorage there.&lt;ref name="Rudmose"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudmose Brown|first1=R. N.|last2=Pirie|first2=J. H.|last3=Mossman|first3=R. C.|title=The Voyage of the Scotia|publisher=Mercat Press|location= Edinburgh|year=2002|isbn=1-84183-044-5|pages=34–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were well-situated as a site for a meteorological station, and their relative proximity to the [[South American]] mainland allowed a permanent station to be established.{{sfn|Rudmose Brown|p=57}} Bruce instituted a comprehensive programme of work, involving meteorological readings, trawling for marine samples, botanical excursions, and the collection of biological and geological specimens.&lt;ref name="Rudmose" /&gt;

The major task completed during this time was the construction of a stone building, christened "Omond House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voyage of the ''Scotia'' 1902–04: The Antarctic|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/vsindexantarctic.html|publisher=Glasgow Digital Library|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to act as living accommodation for the parties that would remain on Laurie Island to operate the proposed meteorological laboratory. The building was constructed from local materials using the [[dry stone]] method, with a roof improvised from wood and canvas sheeting. The completed house was 20 feet by 20 feet square (6m&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6m), with two windows, fitted as quarters for six people. Rudmose Brown wrote: "Considering that we had no [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and no [[stonemasonry#Tools|masons' tools]] it is a wonderfully fine house and very lasting. I should think it will be standing a century hence&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speak | first = Peter | year = 2003 | title = William Speirs Bruce: Polar Explorer and Scottish Nationalist | publisher = NMS Publishing | location = Edinburgh | isbn = 1-901663-71-X |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce later offered to  [[Argentina]] the transfer of the station and instruments on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.&lt;ref name=RREE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/7/7-107.htm | title=Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Argentina | accessdate=July 6, 2012 | author1=Escude, Carlos |author2=Cisneros, Andres |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce informed the British officer William Haggard of his intentions in December 1903, and Haggard ratified the terms of Bruce proposition.&lt;ref name=moneta&gt;{{cite book | title=Cuatro Años en las Orcadas del Sur | publisher=Ediciones Peuser | author=Moneta, Jose Manuel | edition=9th | year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Scotia'' sailed back for Laurie Island on 14 January 1904 carrying on board Argentinean officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, National Meteorological Office, Ministry of  Livestock and National Postal and Telegraphs Office. In 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on South Orkney Islands.

===WWII and postwar expansion===
Little happened for the following forty years until the [[Second World War]], when the British launched [[Operation Tabarin]] in 1943, to establish a presence on the continent. The chief reason was to establish solid British claims to various uninhabited islands and parts of Antarctica, reinforced by Argentine sympathies toward Germany.

[[File:Base Arturo Prat .JPG|thumb|left|View of Chile's [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]], established in 1947]]
Prior to the start of the war, German aircraft had dropped markers with swastikas across [[Queen Maud Land]] in an attempt to create a territorial claim, see [[New Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/pictures/catalogue/hmscc1943/|title=HMS Carnarvon Castle 1943|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Lieutenant [[James William Slessor Marr|James Marr]], the 14-strong team left the [[Falkland Islands]] in two ships, [[RRS William Scoresby|HMS ''William Scoresby'']] (a minesweeping trawler) and ''Fitzroy'', on Saturday January 29, 1944. Marr had accompanied the British explorer Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] on his final Antarctic expedition in 1921 - 1922.

Bases were established during February near the abandoned [[Norway|Norwegian]] whaling station on [[Deception Island]], where the [[Union Flag]] was hoisted in place of Argentine flags, and at [[Port Lockroy]] (on February 11) on the coast of [[Graham Land]]. A further base was founded at [[Hope Bay]] on February 13, 1945, after a failed attempt to unload stores on February 7, 1944. These bases were the first ever to be constructed on the mainland Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9706157/Spirit-of-Scott-2012-Britains-polar-interests-lie-under-a-cloud.html|title=Spirit of Scott 2012: Britain’s polar interests lie under a cloud|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Operation provoked a massive expansion in international activity after the war. Chile organized its [[First Chilean Antarctic Expedition]] in 1947–48. Among other accomplishments, it brought the Chilean president [[Gabriel González Videla]] to personally inaugurate one of its bases, thereby becoming the first head of state to set foot on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica and the Arctic: the complete encyclopedia, Volume 1, by David McGonigal, Lynn Woodworth, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Signy Research Station]] (UK) was established in 1947, Australia's [[Mawson Station]] in 1954, [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] was the first French station in 1956. In that same year, the United States built [[McMurdo Station]] and [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]], and the Soviet Union built [[Mirny Station]].

==List of research stations==

The United States maintains the southernmost Base and the largest base and research station 
in Antarctica, [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]. The second-southernmost base is the Chinese [[Kunlun Station]] at 80°25′02″S during the summer season, and the Russian [[Vostok Station]] at 78°27′50″S during the winter season.

==Geography==
The La Plata basin is bounded by the [[Brazilian Highlands]] to the north, the [[Andes Mountains]] to the west, and [[Patagonia]] to the south. The watershed extends mostly northward from the source of the Río de la Plata for roughly {{convert|2400|km|mi}}, as far as [[Brasília]] and [[Cuiabá]] in Brazil and [[Sucre]] in Bolivia, spanning [[latitude]]s between 14 and 27 degrees south and [[longitude]]s between 43 and 67 degrees west. The Paraná River, La Plata's largest tributary, is South America's second longest river and [[List of rivers by length|one of the longest in the world.]].

Politically the basin includes part or all of the [[States of Brazil|Brazilian states]] of [[Mato Grosso]], [[Goiás]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the [[Departments of Bolivia|Bolivian departments]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]] and [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], the entire country of Paraguay, the western and central [[departments of Uruguay]], and the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine provinces]] of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] and [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]].

==Hydrology==
The precipitation falling within this area is collected by numerous rivers to finally reach the [[Río de la Plata]], almost all of it through the [[Paraná River]], the [[Paraguay River]], and the [[Uruguay River]], La Plata's most important [[tributary|tributaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Varis, Olli; Cecilia Tortajada; Biswas, Asit K. 2008. ''Management of Transboundary Rivers and Lakes '' v. 1. Berlin Heidelberg, Germany: Springer-Verlag, pp. 268–272. {{ISBN|978-3-5407-4926-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river discharges water into the Atlantic Ocean at an average rate of {{Convert|22,000|m3/s|cuft/s}}, the majority of which comes from the Paraná.

The basin serves as the recharge zone for the [[Guarani Aquifer]], one of the world's largest [[aquifer]] systems. The rivers of the La Plata Basin carry an estimated {{convert|57000000|m3|cuft}} of [[silt]] into the Río de la Plata each year, where the muddy waters are stirred up by winds and tides; the shipping route from the Atlantic to Buenos Aires is kept open by continual [[dredging]].

===Tributaries===
{{Further information|List of tributaries of the Río de la Plata}}
The Paraná River's main tributaries include the [[Paranaíba River]], [[Rio Grande (Paraná River)|Grande River]], [[Tietê River]], [[Paranapanema River]], [[Iguazu River]], Paraguay River, and the [[Salado River (Argentina)|Salado River]], after which it ends in the large [[Paraná Delta]]. The Paraguay River flows through the [[Pantanal]] wetland, after which its main tributaries include the [[Pilcomayo River]] and the [[Bermejo River]], before it ends in the Paraná. The Uruguay's main tributaries include the [[Pelotas River]], [[Canoas River (Santa Catarina)|Canoas River]], [[Ibicuí River]], and the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]]. Another significant tributary to the Río de la Plata is the [[Salado del Sur River]].

==History==
The Río de la Plata Basin has been the site of much conflict in the modern [[history of South America]], much of it because the basin contained the (contested) frontiers between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s in South America and their successor states. A series of wars has been fought over territorial control in the region, particularly in the nineteenth century.

===Early exploration===
Explorer [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] made a detailed study of the Río de la Plata and its tributaries and gave the river its modern name. He explored the Paraná and Uruguay rivers between 1526 and 1529, ascending the Paraná as far as the present-day city of [[Asunción]], and also explored up the Paraguay River. Cabot acquired silver trinkets trading with the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] near today's Asunción, and these objects gave rise to the name Río de la Plata, "river of silver".&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

===Colonial period===
The first European colony in the Platine region was the city of [[Buenos Aires]], founded by [[Pedro de Mendoza]] on 2 February 1536. This settlement, however, was quickly abandoned; the failure to establish a settlement on the La Plata estuary led to explorations upriver and the founding of Asunción in 1537. Buenos Aires was subsequently refounded by [[Juan de Garay]] on 11 June 1580.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

During the colonial era the Platine basin was largely neglected by the [[Spanish Empire]] until the 1760s, when Portugal and Britain threatened to expand into the estuary.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; The Spanish colonies in the region were separated from the [[Viceroyalty of Perú]] and formed into a new [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Spain became an ally of the French, and Britain [[British invasions of the River Plate|invaded the region]] in 1806–1807 unsuccessfully.

===Revolutionary period===
Conflict in the region intensified after the [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence of the former Spanish]] and [[Independence of Brazil|Portuguese colonies]] in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Territorial interests and navigation rights in the Platine region were at issue in many armed conflicts throughout the century, including the [[Argentine Civil Wars]], the [[Cisplatine War|Cisplatine]] and [[Platine War|Platine]] wars, and the [[Paraguayan War]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Economic features==

===Dams===
There are several hydroelectric dams operating in the basin, among them the second largest operating facility in the world, [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]], shared between Paraguay and Brazil on the Paraná River; the 21st, [[Ilha Solteira Dam]] in Brazil, on the Paraná; the 25th, the [[Yacyretá Dam]] shared between Paraguay and Argentina, also on the Paraná; and the 53rd, the [[Itumbiara Dam]], in Brazil, on the [[Paranaíba River]].

Also on the Paranaíba, in Brazil, are the [[Emborcação Dam|Emborcação]] and [[São Simão Dam|São Simão]] dams. On the Paraná, in Brazil, also are the [[Engineer Souza Dias Dam|Engineer Souza Dias]] and the [[Eng Sérgio Motta Dam|Engineer Sérgio Motta]] dams.

On the [[Rio Grande (Paraná River)|Grande River]], in Brazil, are the [[Água Vermelha Dam|Água Vermelha]], [[Furnas Dam|Furnas]], [[Peixotos Dam|Peixotos]], [[Marimbondo Dam|Marimbondo]], [[Luiz Barreto Dam|Luiz Barreto]], [[Jaguara Dam|Jaguara]] and [[Volta Grande Dam|Volta Grande]] dams.

On the Iguazu river, in Brazil, are the [[Bento Munhoz Hydroelectric Plant|Bento Munhoz]], [[Ney Braga Hydroelectric Plant|Ney Braga]], [[José Richa Hydroelectric Plant|José Richa]], [[Salto Santiago Hydroelectric Power Plant|Salto Santiago]] and [[Salto Osório Hydroelectric Power Plant|Salto Osório]] hydroelectric power plants. On the Pelotas river, in Brazil, it is the [[Machadinho Hydroelectric Power Plant]].

The [[Salto Grande Dam]] is on the Uruguay River and it is shared between Uruguay and Argentina. Also on the Uruguay River, but in Brazil territory, is the [[Itá Hydroelectric Power Plant]].

On the Negro River, in Uruguay, there are the Rincon del Bonete or Gabriel Terra Reservoir (not an hydroelectric facility), and the Baygorria and Constitucion dams.

==Regional culture==
The dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in the lower Río de la Plata basin is [[Rioplatense Spanish]], named for the river. The Platine region is the birthplace of the [[tango]] dance and music.

The '''Satellite Sentinel Project''' ('''SSP''') was conceived by [[George Clooney]] and [[Enough Project]] co-founder [[John Prendergast (activist)|John Prendergast]] during their October 2010 visit to [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Clooney's 'Antigenocide Paparazzi': Watching Sudan|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2039887,00.html|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=George Clooney's Satellite Project Captures Sudan Violence in Real Time|url=http://battleland.blogs.time.com/2011/05/25/george-clooneys-satellite-project-captures-sudan-violence-in-real-time/#ixzz1NNjwECmV|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of satellite imagery, SSP provides an early warning system to deter mass atrocities in a given situation by focusing world attention  and generating rapid responses to human rights and human security concerns taking place in that situation.

==Activities==
SSP currently produces reports on the state of the conflict in the border regions between [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]]. [[DigitalGlobe]] provides [[satellite imagery]] and analysis. Their reporting is then released to the press and policymakers by the [[Enough Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satsentinel.org/our-story Our Story], ''Satellite Sentinel Project''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Satellite Sentinel Project detected images of freshly-dug mass grave sites in the [[Southern Kordofan]] state of South Sudan, where [[Sudan|Sudan’s]] Arab military has been targeting a black ethnic minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=South Sudan joins U.N.; mass graves reported in nearby Sudan By Bill Chappell|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/07/14/137859361/south-sudan-joins-u-n-mass-graves-reported-in-nearby-sudan/|publisher=''[[NPR]]''|date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSP was the first to provide evidence consistent with the razing of the villages of Maker Abior, Todach, and Tajalei in Sudan's contested [[Abyei]] region, and the project has discovered eight alleged [[mass graves]] in [[South Kordofan]], Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mass Graves and George Clooney By Alexis Okeowo|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/08/mass-graves-and-george-clooney.html#ixzz1WjDCpt2W|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSP also plans to investigate how the illegal trade in diamonds, gold, ivory and other resources funds the activities of human-rights abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=George Clooney's Satellite Sentinel Project for Human Rights Enters New Phase|url=http://m.space.com/25964-george-clooney-satellite-sentinel-human-rights.html |publisher=''SPACE.com''|date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and funding==

[[Not On Our Watch Project]] provided [[seed money]] to launch the Satellite Sentinel Project.  The Enough Project contributes field reports, policy analysis and communications strategy, and, together with Not On Our Watch and its SUDANNOW partners, pressures policymakers by urging the public to act. [[Google]] and Internet strategy firm Trellon, LLC collaborate to design the web platform.

==Limits to effectiveness==
Patrick Meier, a [[crisis mapping]] expert, has observed that the deterrent value of any surveillance is diminished in the absence of consequences for the perpetrators of violence. Specific to Sudan, other technologies such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] are necessary to differentiate threats from nomads in order to generate actionable information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irevolution.net/2010/12/30/sat-sentinel-project/ "Will Using ‘Live’ Satellite Imagery to Prevent War in the Sudan Actually Work?"

'''Softscape''' refers to the live [[horticulture|horticultural]] elements of a [[landscape]]. Softscaping can include, flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, flower beds, and duties like weed/nuisance management, grading, planting, mowing, trimming, aerating, spraying, and digging for everything from plants and shrubs , to flower beds. Wheel barrows and manual tools like rakes, shovels, picks, and gas power tools are commonly used. This is a term that has been popularized in recent pop culture (2006 onwards) on television shows such as [[Home &amp; Garden Television]]. The purpose of softscape is to lend character to the landscaping, create an aura, ambience, and reflect the sensibilities of the inhabitants. 

The term softscape stands in contrast to [[hardscape]] which represents inanimate objects of a landscape such as : pavers, stones, rocks,planter boxes, arbors , water feature as well as structures  of wood and natural stone and concrete, like: retaining walls, patios, fences and decks, pergolas, stairs, Etc

[[Image:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map by Dr. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] of [[London]], showing [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. This was one of the first uses of map-based spatial analysis.]] '''Spatial analysis''' or '''spatial statistics''' includes any of the formal [[Scientific technique|techniques]]  which study entities using their [[topological]], [[geometric]], or [[geographic]] properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques, many still in their early development, using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as diverse as [[astronomy]], with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the [[cosmos]], to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of "place and route" [[algorithm]]s to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of [[geographic data]].

Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.

Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.

== History of spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis can perhaps be considered{{according to|date=February 2018}} to have arisen with early attempts at [[cartography]] and [[surveying]] but many fields have contributed to its rise in modern form. [[Biology]] contributed through [[botany|botanical]] studies of global plant distributions and local plant locations, [[ethology|ethological]] studies of animal movement, [[landscape ecology|landscape ecological]] studies of vegetation blocks, [[ecology|ecological]] studies of spatial population dynamics, and the study of [[biogeography]]. [[Epidemiology]] contributed with early work on disease mapping, notably [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s work of mapping an outbreak of cholera, with research on mapping the spread of disease and with location studies for health care delivery. [[Statistics]] has contributed greatly through work in spatial statistics. [[Economics]] has contributed notably through [[spatial econometrics]]. [[Geographic information system]] is currently a major contributor due to the importance of geographic software in the modern analytic toolbox. [[Remote sensing]] has contributed extensively in morphometric and clustering analysis. [[Computer science]] has contributed extensively through the study of algorithms, notably in [[computational geometry]]. [[Mathematics]] continues to provide the fundamental tools for analysis and to reveal the complexity of the spatial realm, for example, with recent work on [[fractals]] and [[scale invariance]]. [[Scientific modelling]] provides a useful framework for new approaches.

== Fundamental issues in spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis confronts many fundamental issues in the definition of its objects of study, in the construction of the analytic operations to be used, in the use of computers for analysis, in the limitations and particularities of the analyses which are known, and in the presentation of analytic results. Many of these issues are active subjects of modern research.

Common errors often arise in spatial analysis, some due to the mathematics of space, some due to the particular ways data are presented spatially, some due to the tools which are available. Census data, because it protects individual privacy by aggregating data into local units, raises a number of statistical issues. The fractal nature of coastline makes precise measurements of its length difficult if not impossible. A computer software fitting straight lines to the curve of a coastline, can easily calculate the lengths of the lines which it defines. However these straight lines may have no inherent meaning in the real world, as was shown for the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]].

These problems represent a challenge in spatial analysis because of the power of maps as media of presentation. When results are presented as maps, the presentation combines spatial data which are generally accurate with analytic results which may be inaccurate, leading to an impression that analytic results are more accurate than the data would indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Monmonier ''How to Lie with Maps'' University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial characterization ===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|240px|Spread of bubonic plague in medieval Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The colors indicate the spatial distribution of plague outbreaks over time.]]The definition of the spatial presence of an entity constrains the possible analysis which can be applied to that entity and influences the final conclusions that can be reached. While this property is fundamentally true of all [[analysis]], it is particularly important in spatial analysis because the tools to define and study entities favor specific characterizations of the entities being studied. Statistical techniques favor the spatial definition of objects as points because there are very few statistical techniques which operate directly on line, area, or volume elements. Computer tools favor the spatial definition of objects as homogeneous and separate elements because of the limited number of [[database]] elements and computational structures available, and the ease with which these primitive structures can be created.

=== Spatial dependency or auto-correlation ===
{{see also|Spatial association}}
Spatial dependency is the co-variation of properties within geographic space: characteristics at proximal locations appear to be correlated, either positively or negatively. Spatial dependency leads to the spatial [[autocorrelation]] problem in statistics since, like temporal autocorrelation, this violates standard statistical techniques that assume independence among observations. For example, [[Regression analysis|regression]] analyses that do not compensate for spatial dependency can have unstable parameter estimates and yield unreliable significance tests. Spatial regression models (see below) capture these relationships and do not suffer from these weaknesses. It is also appropriate to view spatial dependency as a source of information rather than something to be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knegt | first1 = De | last2 = Coughenour | first2 = M.B. | last3 = Skidmore | first3 = A.K. | last4 = Heitkönig | first4 = I.M.A. | last5 = Knox | first5 = N.M. | last6 = Slotow | first6 = R. | last7 = Prins | first7 = H.H.T. | year = 2010 | title = Spatial autocorrelation and the scaling of species–environment relationships | journal = Ecology | volume = 91 | issue = 8| pages = 2455–2465 | doi = 10.1890/09-1359.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locational effects also manifest as spatial [[heterogeneity]], or the apparent variation in a process with respect to location in geographic space. Unless a space is uniform and boundless, every location will have some degree of uniqueness relative to the other locations. This affects the spatial dependency relations and therefore the spatial process. Spatial heterogeneity means that overall parameters estimated for the entire system may not adequately describe the process at any given location.

=== Scaling ===
Spatial [[measurement]] scale is a persistent issue in spatial analysis; more detail is available at the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) topic entry. Landscape ecologists developed a series of [[scale invariant]] metrics for aspects of ecology that are [[fractal]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=J. M.|last2=Hartley|first2=S.|last3=Kallimanis|first3=A. S.|last4=Kunin|first4=W. E.|last5=Lennon|first5=J. J.|last6=Sgardelis|first6=S. P.|date=2004-03-01|title=Uses and abuses of fractal methodology in ecology|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=254–271|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00568.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more general terms, no scale independent method of [[analysis]] is widely agreed upon for spatial statistics.

=== Sampling ===
Spatial [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] involves determining a limited number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places.  But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small.  Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income.  Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Common errors in spatial analysis ===
The fundamental issues in spatial analysis lead to numerous problems in analysis including bias, distortion and outright errors in the conclusions reached. These issues are often interlinked but various attempts have been made to separate out particular issues from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ocaña-Riola | first1 = R | year = 2010 | title = Common errors in disease mapping | journal = Geospatial Health | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 139–154 | pmid = 20503184 | doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Length ====
In a paper by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] on the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]] it was shown that it is inherently nonsensical to discuss certain spatial concepts despite an inherent presumption of the validity of the concept. Lengths in ecology depend directly on the scale at which they are measured and experienced. So while surveyors commonly measure the length of a river, this length only has meaning in the context of the relevance of the measuring technique to the question under study.

Image:britain-fractal-coastline-50km.png|Britain measured using a short yardstick
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Locational fallacy ====
The locational fallacy refers to error due to the particular spatial characterization chosen for the elements of study, in particular choice of placement for the spatial presence of the element.

Spatial characterizations may be simplistic or even wrong. Studies of humans often reduce the spatial existence of humans to a single point, for instance their home address. This can easily lead to poor analysis, for example, when considering disease transmission which can happen at work or at school and therefore far from the home.

The spatial characterization may implicitly limit the subject of study. For example, the spatial analysis of crime data has recently become popular but these studies can only describe the particular kinds of crime which can be described spatially. This leads to many maps of assault but not to any maps of embezzlement with political consequences in the conceptualization of crime and the design of policies to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Spatial Fallacies|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/sgam/node/214|website=The Learner's Guide to Geospatial Analysis|publisher=Penn State Department of Geography|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atomic fallacy ====
This describes errors due to treating elements as separate 'atoms' outside of their spatial context. The fallacy is about transferring individual conclusions to spatial units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Integrating scale in remote sensing and GIS |last=Quattrochi |first=Dale A |isbn=9781482218268|oclc=973767077|date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological fallacy ====
The [[ecological fallacy]] describes errors due to performing analyses on aggregate data when trying to reach conclusions on the individual units. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Errors occur in part from spatial aggregation.  For example, a [[pixel]] represents the average surface temperatures within an area.  Ecological fallacy would be to assume that all points within the area have the same temperature. This topic is closely related to the [[modifiable areal unit problem]].

=== Solutions to the fundamental issues ===

==== Geographic space ====
[[File:Manhattan distance.svg|thumb|200px|Manhattan distance versus Euclidean distance: The red, blue, and yellow lines have the same length (12) in both Euclidean and taxicab geometry. In Euclidean geometry, the green line has length 6×{{radic|2}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;8.48, and is the unique shortest path. In taxicab geometry, the green line's length is still 12, making it no shorter than any other path shown.]]A mathematical space exists whenever we have a set of observations and quantitative measures of their attributes. For example, we can represent individuals' incomes or years of education within a coordinate system where the location of each individual can be specified with respect to both dimensions. The distance between individuals within this space is a quantitative measure of their differences with respect to income and education. However, in spatial analysis, we are concerned with specific types of mathematical spaces, namely, geographic space. In geographic space, the observations correspond to locations in a spatial measurement framework that capture their proximity in the real world. The locations in a spatial measurement framework often represent locations on the surface of the Earth, but this is not strictly necessary. A spatial measurement framework can also capture proximity with respect to, say, interstellar space or within a biological entity such as a liver. The fundamental tenet is [[Tobler's first law of geography|Tobler's First Law of Geography]]: if the interrelation between entities increases with proximity in the real world, then representation in geographic space and assessment using spatial analysis techniques are appropriate.

The [[Euclidean distance]] between locations often represents their proximity, although this is only one possibility. There are an infinite number of distances in addition to Euclidean that can support quantitative analysis. For example, "Manhattan" (or "[[Taxicab geometry|Taxicab]]") distances where movement is restricted to paths parallel to the axes can be more meaningful than Euclidean distances in urban settings. In addition to distances, other geographic relationships such as connectivity''' (e.g., the existence or degree of shared borders) and direction''' can also influence the relationships among entities. It is also possible to compute minimal cost paths across a cost surface; for example, this can represent proximity among locations when travel must occur across rugged terrain.

== Types of spatial analysis ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Spatial data comes in many varieties and it is not easy to
 arrive at a system of classification that is simultaneously
 exclusive, exhaustive, imaginative, and satisfying.
                             -- G. Upton &amp; B. Fingelton&lt;ref name="Upton+:1985"&gt;Graham J. Upton &amp; Bernard Fingelton: '''Spatial Data Analysis by Example Volume 1: Point Pattern and Quantitative Data''' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spatial data analysis ===
Urban and Regional Studies deal with large tables of spatial data obtained from censuses and surveys. It is necessary to simplify the huge amount of detailed information in order to extract the main trends. Multivariable analysis (or [[Factor analysis]], FA) allows a change of variables, transforming the many variables of the census, usually correlated between themselves, into fewer independent "Factors" or "Principal Components" which are, actually, the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of the data correlation matrix weighted by the inverse of their eigenvalues. This change of variables has two main advantages:
# Since information is concentrated on the first new factors, it is possible to keep only a few of them while losing only a small amount of information; mapping them produces fewer and more significant maps 
# The factors, actually the eigenvectors, are orthogonal by construction, i.e. not correlated. In most cases, the dominant factor (with the largest eigenvalue) is the Social Component, separating rich and poor in the city. Since factors are not-correlated, other smaller processes than social status, which would have remained hidden otherwise, appear on the second, third, … factors.

Factor analysis depends on measuring distances between observations : the choice of a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis ) are among the more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Harman H H (1960) ''Modern Factor Analysis'', University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; More complicated models, using communalities or rotations have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel R J (1970) ''Applied Factor Analysis''. Evanston, ILL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using multivariate methods in spatial analysis began really in the 1950s (although some examples go back to the beginning of the century) and culminated in the 1970s, with the increasing power and accessibility of computers. Already in 1948, in a seminal publication, two sociologists, Bell and Shevky,&lt;ref&gt;Bell W &amp; E Shevky (1955) ''Social Area Analysis'', Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that most city populations in the USA and in the world could be represented with three independent factors : 1- the « socio-economic status » opposing rich and poor districts and distributed in sectors running along highways from the city center, 2- the « life cycle », i.e. the age structure of households, distributed in concentric circles, and 3-  « race and ethnicity », identifying patches of migrants located within the city. In 1961, in a groundbreaking study, British geographers used FA to classify British towns.&lt;ref&gt;Moser C A &amp; W Scott (1961) ''British Towns ; A Statistical Study of their Social and Economic Differences'', Oliver &amp; Boyd, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian J Berry, at the University of Chicago, and his students made a wide use of the method,&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; F Horton (1971) ''Geographic Perspectives on Urban Systems'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; applying it to most important cities in the world and exhibiting common social structures.&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; K B Smith eds (1972) ''City Classification Handbook : Methods and Applications'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of Factor Analysis in Geography, made so easy by modern computers, has been very wide but not always very wise.&lt;ref&gt;Ciceri M-F (1974) ''Méthodes d’analyse multivariée dans la géographie anglo-saxonne'', Université de Paris-1 ; free download on http://www-ohp.univ-paris1.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vectors extracted are determined by the data matrix, it is not possible to compare factors obtained from different censuses. A solution consists in fusing together several census matrices in a unique table which, then, may be analyzed. This, however, assumes that the definition of the variables has not changed over time and produces very large tables, difficult to manage. A better solution, proposed by psychometricians,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker L R (1964) « The extension of Factor Analysis to three-dimensional matrices », in  Frederiksen N &amp; H Gulliksen eds, ''Contributions to Mathematical Psychology'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; groups the data in a « cubic matrix », with three entries (for instance, locations, variables, time periods). A Three-Way Factor Analysis produces then three groups of factors related by a small cubic « core matrix ».&lt;ref&gt;R. Coppi &amp; S. Bolasco, eds. (1989), ''Multiway data analysis'', Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; This method, which exhibits data evolution over time, has not been widely used in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cant | first1 = R.G. | year = 1971 | title =  Changes in the location of manufacturing in New Zealand 1957-1968: An application of three-mode factor analysis | journal = New Zealand Geographer | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 38–55 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.1971.tb00636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;Marchand B (1986) ''The Emergence of Los Angeles, 1940-1970'', Pion Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt; however, it has exhibited the role, traditionally ignored, of Downtown as an organizing center for the whole city during several decades.

=== Spatial autocorrelation ===
Spatial [[autocorrelation]] statistics measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space.  Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics include [[Moran's I|Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Geary's C|Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Getis's G|Getis's]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the [[standard deviational ellipse]]. These statistics require measuring a spatial weights matrix that reflects the intensity of the geographic relationship between observations in a neighborhood, e.g., the distances between neighbors, the lengths of shared border, or whether they fall into a specified directional class such as "west". Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics compare the spatial weights to the covariance relationship at pairs of locations. Spatial autocorrelation that is more positive than expected from random indicate the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighboring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board.

Spatial autocorrelation statistics such as Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are global in the sense that they estimate the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset.  The possibility of spatial heterogeneity suggests that the estimated degree of autocorrelation may vary significantly across geographic space. '''Local spatial autocorrelation statistics''' provide estimates disaggregated to the level of the spatial analysis units, allowing assessment of the dependency relationships across space. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; statistics compare neighborhoods to a global average and identify local regions of strong autocorrelation.  Local versions of the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; statistics are also available.

=== Spatial stratified heterogeneity ===
Spatial stratified heterogeneity, referring to the within-strata variance less than the between strata-variance, is ubiquitous in ecological phenomena, such as ecological zones and many ecological variables.  Spatial stratified heterogeneity of an attribute can be measured by geographical detector ''q''-statistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = JF | last2 = Zhang | first2 = TL | last3 = Fu | first3 = BJ | year = 2016 | title = A measure of spatial stratified heterogeneity | journal = Ecological Indicators | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 250–256 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                              &lt;math&gt; q = 1 - \frac{1}{N\sigma^2}\sum_{h=1}^LN_h\sigma_h^2  &lt;/math&gt;
where a population is partitioned into ''h'' = 1, ..., ''L'' strata; ''N'' stands for the size of the population, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stands for variance of the attribute. The value of ''q'' is within [0, 1], 0 indicates no spatial stratified heterogeneity, 1 indicates perfect spatial stratified heterogeneity.The value of ''q'' indicates the percent of the variance of an attribute explained by the stratification.The ''q'' follows a noncentral ''F'' probability density function.

=== Spatial interpolation ===
[[Spatial interpolation]] methods estimate the variables at unobserved locations in geographic space based on the values at observed locations.  Basic methods include [[inverse distance weighting]]: this attenuates the variable with decreasing proximity from the observed location.  [[Kriging]] is a more sophisticated method that interpolates across space according to a spatial lag relationship that has both systematic and random components.  This can accommodate a wide range of spatial relationships for the hidden values between observed locations.  Kriging provides optimal estimates given the hypothesized lag relationship, and error estimates can be mapped to determine if spatial patterns exist.

=== Spatial regression ===
{{See also|Local regression|Regression-Kriging}}

Spatial regression methods capture spatial dependency in [[regression analysis]], avoiding statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, as well as providing information on spatial relationships among the variables involved.  The estimated spatial relationships can be used on spatial and spatio-temporal predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Yong Ge|title=Spatial distribution estimation of malaria in northern China and its scenarios in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050|journal=Malaria Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=345|doi=10.1186/s12936-016-1395-2|pmid=27387921|pmc=4936159|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the specific technique, spatial dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent variables and the dependent, between the dependent variables and a spatial lag of itself, or in the error terms.  '''Geographically weighted regression''' (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis.&lt;ref name="Fotheringham1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotheringham | first1 = A.

Spatial stochastic processes, such as [[Gaussian processes]] are also increasingly being deployed in spatial regression analysis. Model-based versions of GWR, known as spatially varying coefficient models have been applied to conduct Bayesian inference.&lt;ref name="Banerjee2014"/&gt; Spatial stochastic process can become computationally effective and scalable Gaussian process models, such as Gaussian Predictive Processes&lt;ref name="Banerjee2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = Sudipto | last2 = Gelfand | first2 = Alan E. | last3 = Finley | first3 = Andrew O. | last4 = Sang | first4 = Huiyan | year = 2008 | title = Gaussian predictive process models for large spatial datasets | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B | volume = 70 | issue = 4| pages = 825–848 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00663.x| pmid = 19750209 | pmc = 2741335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP).&lt;ref name="Banerjee2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Datta | first1 = Abhirup | last2 = Banerjee | first2 = Sudipto | last4 = Gelfand | first4 = Alan E. | last3 = Finley | first3 = Andrew O. | year = 2016 | title = Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process Models for Large Geostatistical Datasets | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 111| issue = 514| pages =  800–812| doi = 10.1080/01621459.2015.1044091| pmid = 29720777 | pmc = 5927603 | arxiv = 1406.7343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial interaction ===
Spatial interaction or "[[gravity model]]s" estimate the flow of people, material or information between locations in geographic space.  Factors can include origin propulsive variables such as the number of commuters in residential areas, destination attractiveness variables such as the amount of office space in employment areas, and proximity relationships between the locations measured in terms such as driving distance or travel time.  In addition, the topological, or [[Geospatial topology|connective]], relationships between areas must be identified, particularly considering the often conflicting relationship between distance and topology; for example, two spatially close neighborhoods may not display any significant interaction if they are separated by a highway. After specifying the functional forms of these relationships, the analyst can estimate model parameters using observed flow data and standard estimation techniques such as ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. Competing destinations versions of spatial interaction models include the proximity among the destinations (or origins) in addition to the origin-destination proximity; this captures the effects of destination (origin) clustering on flows. Computational methods such as [[artificial neural networks]] can also estimate spatial interaction relationships among locations and can handle noisy and qualitative data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Simulation and modeling ===
Spatial interaction models are aggregate and top-down: they specify an overall governing relationship for flow between locations.  This characteristic is also shared by urban models such as those based on mathematical programming, flows among economic sectors, or bid-rent theory.  An alternative modeling perspective is to represent the system at the highest possible level of disaggregation and study the bottom-up emergence of complex patterns and relationships from behavior and interactions at the individual level. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Complex adaptive systems]] theory as applied to spatial analysis suggests that simple interactions among proximal entities can lead to intricate, persistent and functional spatial entities at aggregate levels.  Two fundamentally spatial simulation methods are cellular automata and agent-based modeling. [[Cellular automata]] modeling imposes a fixed spatial framework such as grid cells and specifies rules that dictate the state of a cell based on the states of its neighboring cells.  As time progresses, spatial patterns emerge as cells change states based on their neighbors; this alters the conditions for future time periods.  For example, cells can represent locations in an urban area and their states can be different types of land use.  Patterns that can emerge from the simple interactions of local land uses include office districts and urban sprawl. [[Agent-based model]]ing uses software entities (agents) that have purposeful behavior (goals) and can react, interact and modify their environment while seeking their objectives.  Unlike the cells in cellular automata, simulysts can allow agents to be mobile with respect to space.  For example, one could model traffic flow and dynamics using agents representing individual vehicles that try to minimize travel time between specified origins and destinations.  While pursuing minimal travel times, the agents must avoid collisions with other vehicles also seeking to minimize their travel times.  Cellular automata and agent-based modeling are complementary modeling strategies.  They can be integrated into a common geographic automata system where some agents are fixed while others are mobile.

Calibration plays a pivotal role in both CA and ABM simulation and modelling approaches. Initial approaches to CA proposed robust calibration approaches based on stochastic, Monte Carlo methods.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=E.

=== Multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) ===
Spatial analysis of a conceptual geological model is the main purpose of any MPS algorithm. The method analyzes the spatial statistics of the geological model, called the training image, and generates realizations of the phenomena that honor those input multiple-point statistics.

A recent MPS algorithm used to accomplish this task is the pattern-based method by Honarkhah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honarkhah | first1 = M | last2 = Caers | first2 = J | year = 2010 | title = Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling | doi = 10.1007/s11004-010-9276-7 | journal = Mathematical Geosciences | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 487–517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, a distance-based approach is employed to analyze the patterns in the training image. This allows the reproduction of the multiple-point statistics, and the complex geometrical features of the training image. Each output of the MPS algorithm is a realization that represents a random field. Together, several realizations may be used to quantify spatial uncertainty.

One of the recent methods is presented by Tahmasebi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tahmasebi | first1 = P. | last2 = Hezarkhani | first2 = A. | last3 = Sahimi | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Multiple-point geostatistical modeling based on the cross-correlation functions | journal = Computational Geosciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 779–79742 | doi=10.1007/s10596-012-9287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a cross-correlation function to improve the spatial pattern reproduction. They call their MPS simulation method as the CCSIM algorithm. This method is able to quantify the spatial connectivity, variability and uncertainty. Furthermore, the method is not sensitive to any type of data and is able to simulate both categorical and continuous scenarios. CCSIM algorithm is able to be used for any stationary, non-stationary and multivariate systems and it can provide high quality visual appeal model.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.91.032401 |pmid=25871117 |title=Reconstruction of nonstationary disordered materials and media: Watershed transform and cross-correlation function |journal=Physical Review E |volume=91 |issue=3|pages=032401 |bibcode=2015PhRvE..91c2401T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |title=Geostatistical Simulation and Reconstruction of Porous Media by a Cross-Correlation Function and Integration of Hard and Soft Data |doi=10.1007/s11242-015-0471-3 |journal=Transport in Porous Media |volume=107 |issue=3| pages=871–905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical information system usage ===
[[Geographic information system]]s (GIS) — a large domain that provides a variety of capabilities designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data — utilizes geospatial analysis in a variety of contexts, operations and applications.

==== Basic applications ====
Geospatial analysis, using [[GIS]], was developed for problems in the environmental and life sciences, in particular [[ecology]], [[geology]] and [[epidemiology]]. It has extended to almost all industries including defense, intelligence, utilities, Natural Resources (i.e. Oil and Gas, Forestry ... etc.), social sciences, medicine and [[Public Safety]] (i.e. emergency management and criminology), disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM), and climate change adaptation (CCA). Spatial statistics typically result primarily from observation rather than experimentation.

==== Basic operations ====
Vector-based [[GIS]] is typically related to operations such as map overlay (combining two or more maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance of one or more features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) the use of the term spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium ([[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]) “simple feature specifications”. For raster-based GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, this typically means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new map layer, for example replacing each cell value with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term [[spatial analysis]]. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, [[Exploratory data analysis|exploratory]], and explanatory [[statistics]]) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.

==== Advanced operations ====
Geospatial analysis goes beyond 2D and 3D mapping operations and spatial statistics. It includes: 
* Surface analysis — in particular analysing the properties of physical surfaces, such as [[gradient]], [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] and [[visibility]], and analysing surface-like data “fields”;
* Network analysis — examining the properties of natural and man-made networks in order to understand the behaviour of flows within and around such networks; and locational analysis. GIS-based network analysis may be used to address a wide range of practical problems such as route selection and facility location (core topics in the field of [[operations research]], and problems involving flows such as those found in [[hydrology]] and transportation research. In many instances location problems relate to networks and as such are addressed with tools designed for this purpose, but in others existing networks may have little or no relevance or may be impractical to incorporate within the modeling process. Problems that are not specifically network constrained, such as new road or pipeline routing, regional warehouse location, mobile phone mast positioning or the selection of rural community health care sites, may be effectively analysed (at least initially) without reference to existing physical networks. Locational analysis "in the plane" is also applicable where suitable network datasets are not available, or are too large or expensive to be utilised, or where the location algorithm is very complex or involves the examination or simulation of a very large number of alternative configurations.
* [[Geovisualization]] — the creation and manipulation of images, maps, diagrams, charts, 3D views and their associated tabular datasets. GIS packages increasingly provide a range of such tools, providing static or rotating views, draping images over 2.5D surface representations, providing animations and fly-throughs, dynamic linking and brushing and spatio-temporal visualisations. This latter class of tools is the least developed, reflecting in part the limited range of suitable compatible datasets and the limited set of analytical methods available, although this picture is changing rapidly. All these facilities augment the core tools utilised in spatial analysis throughout the analytical process (exploration of data, identification of patterns and relationships, construction of models, and communication of results)

==== Mobile Geospatial Computing ====
Traditionally geospatial computing has been performed primarily on personal computers (PCs) or servers. Due to the increasing capabilities of mobile devices, however, geospatial computing in mobile devices is a fast-growing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Ruizhi|last2=Guinness|first2=Robert E.|title=Geospatial Computing in Mobile Devices|date=2014|publisher=Artech House|location=Norwood, MA|isbn=978-1-60807-565-2|pages=228|edition=1st|url=http://www.artechhouse.com/International/Books/Geospatial-Computing-in-Mobile-Devices-2159.aspx|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portable nature of these devices, as well as the presence of useful sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and barometric pressure sensors, make them useful for capturing and processing geospatial information in the field. In addition to the local processing of geospatial information on mobile devices, another growing trend is cloud-based geospatial computing. In this architecture, data can be collected in the field using mobile devices and then transmitted to cloud-based servers for further processing and ultimate storage. In a similar manner, geospatial information can be made available to connected mobile devices via the cloud, allowing access to vast databases of geospatial information anywhere where a wireless data connection is available.

=== Geographic information science and spatial analysis ===
{{further information|Geographic information systems#Spatial analysis}}
'''[[Geographic information systems]]''' (GIS) and the underlying [[geographic information science]] that advances these technologies have a strong influence on spatial analysis.  The increasing ability to capture and handle geographic data means that spatial analysis is occurring within increasingly data-rich environments.  Geographic data capture systems include remotely sensed imagery, environmental monitoring systems such as intelligent transportation systems, and location-aware technologies such as mobile devices that can report location in near-real time.  GIS provide platforms for managing these data, computing spatial relationships such as distance, connectivity and directional relationships between spatial units, and visualizing both the raw data and spatial analytic results within a cartographic context.
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|300px|This flow map of Napoleon's ill-fated march on Moscow is an early and celebrated example of geovisualization. It shows the army's direction as it traveled, the places the troops passed through, the size of the army as troops died from hunger and wounds, and the freezing temperatures they experienced.]]

==== Content ====
*Spatial location: Transfer positioning information of space objects with the help of space coordinate system. Projection transformation theory is the foundation of spatial object representation.
*Spatial distribution: the similar spatial object groups positioning information, including distribution, trends, contrast etc..
*Spatial form: the geometric shape of the spatial objects
*Spatial space: the space objects' approaching degree
*Spatial relationship: relationship between spatial objects, including topological, orientation, similarity, etc..

'''[[Geovisualization]]''' (GVis) combines scientific visualization with [[digital cartography]] to support the exploration and analysis of geographic data and information, including the results of spatial analysis or simulation. GVis leverages the human orientation towards visual information processing in the exploration, analysis and communication of geographic data and information.  In contrast with traditional cartography, GVis is typically three- or four-dimensional (the latter including time) and user-interactive.

'''Geographic knowledge discovery''' (GKD) is the human-centered process of applying efficient computational tools for exploring massive [[spatial database]]s. GKD includes geographic [[data mining]], but also encompasses related activities such as data selection, data cleaning and pre-processing, and interpretation of results. GVis can also serve a central role in the GKD process.  GKD is based on the premise that massive databases contain interesting (valid, novel, useful and understandable) patterns that standard analytical techniques cannot find.  GKD can serve as a hypothesis-generating process for spatial analysis, producing tentative patterns and relationships that should be confirmed using spatial analytical techniques.

'''[[Spatial decision support system]]s''' (SDSS) take existing spatial data and use a variety of mathematical models to make projections into the future. This allows urban and regional planners to test intervention decisions prior to implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Ainhoa|last2=Donnelly|first2=Alison|last3=Jones|first3=Mike|last4=Chrysoulakis|first4=Nektarios|last5=Lopes|first5=Myriam|year=2012|title=A decision-support system for sustainable urban metabolism in Europe|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2012.06.007|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=38|pages=109–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stopps v Just Ladies Fitness (Metrotown) Ltd''''' was a discrimination by sex case heard before the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] that was significant in Canadian law because it found that a women-only admission policy of a public gym was not discrimination.

== The complainant ==

On October 2, 2004 [[Vancouver]] resident Ralph Stopps applied to the Just Ladies Fitness facility in [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] and was denied membership because he is male. Stopps filed a complaint with the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] on November 21, 2006 that he was discriminated against because of his gender, violating s.&amp;nbsp;8 of the "Human Rights Code," which prohibits discrimination by sex. The tribunal, a panel of 9 females and 3 males, rendered its decision that the complainant had not established that he was discriminated against.

== The respondent ==

Just Ladies Fitness is a women-only fitness facility, although some men work there in management and maintenance. It was argued at the tribunal that women attend the facility because they feel demeaned by men gazing at them at unisex facilities. The facility also claimed that because it is cleaner, has smaller weights that are more suitable for females, and because it has prenatal fitness classes their women-only admission policy was justified. The managers argued that women pay higher fees at their facility than at other fitness facilities and that this proves that some females feel that going to a female only fitness facility is necessary, but does not constitute sexual discrimination.

== Tribunal decision ==

The Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the complainant had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities all the elements required to demonstrate that illegal discrimination had happened. Stopps still has the right to appeal the BCHRT's decision.

Firstly, the tribunal found that the complainant was not adversely affected by the denial of membership. His claim that the facility was nearer his home was incorrect, his claim that the free initial membership period was not significant and since he had not pursued other opportunities to join other gyms, the tribunal found he had no serious intention of working out at a facility, as he had never gone to any fitness facilities before, and did not attend any after he was denied membership at "Just Ladies Fitness".

Second, the tribunal found that the complainant failed to prove that his dignity has been adversely affected by his denial of membership. In British Columbia, one cannot receive compensation for being discriminated against unless one also proves that the discrimination demeaned their dignity, and Mr. Stopps failed to prove that his dignity had been significantly demeaned.

Third, the tribunal found that its purpose is to provide compensation for those who have actually suffered from being discriminated against, and that the tribunal should not be used to make a political point. The tribunal found that Stopps's claim was politically motivated, and filing such claims harms those who file legitimate claims of discrimination, including men who have been discriminated against and whose dignity has been demeaned.

'''Svinesund''' is a [[sound (geography)|sound]] separating the [[Sweden|Swedish]] municipality of [[Strömstad]] in the province of [[Bohuslän]] in the county of [[Västra Götaland County|Västra Götaland]] from the [[Norway|Norwegian]] municipality of [[Halden]] in the county of [[Østfold]].

Two bridges, the old and new [[Svinesund Bridge]] (''[[norwegian language|no]]:Svinesundsbroen [[swedish language|sv]]:Svinesundsbron''), span this sound of the [[Iddefjord]]. The Swedish side is extremely popular with Norwegians who flock to buy relatively cheap goods in Sweden, where a large shopping area can be found immediately after crossing the sound. Following the erection of the new bridge in 2005, both the old and new bridges are [[toll bridge]]s.

Norwegian and Swedish [[customs]] authorities have offices and checkpoints on their respective sides of the sound. While there is not normally any passport control on the border, vehicles crossing are regularly stopped and searched. Norway is not in the [[European Union|EU]] so there are much stricter restrictions on the amount of goods (e.g. alcohol, cigarettes, food, etc.) that can be taken across the border without stopping to pay customs duties than between EU countries. Customs duties are paid immediately after crossing the border using the new bridge.

[[File:Ancient Levant routes.png|thumb|The Via Maris (purple), King's Highway (red), and other ancient Levantine trade routes, c. 1300 BCE]]
[[File:Via Maris 0672.jpg|thumb|[[Jezreel Valley]] with Via Maris in foreground]]

'''Via Maris''' is the modern name for an ancient [[trade route]], dating from the early [[Bronze Age]], linking [[Egypt]] with the northern empires of [[Syria]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] — modern day [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]]. In [[Latin language|Latin]], ''Via Maris'' means "way of the sea." It is a historic road that runs along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. It was the most important route from Egypt to Syria (the [[Fertile Crescent]]) which followed the coastal plain before crossing over into the plain of Jezreel and the Jordan valley.

Its earlier name was "Way of the [[Philistines]]", a reference to a passageway through the Philistine Plain (which today consists of Israel's southern [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]). The name "Via Maris" is not ancient and academic researchers prefer other names, for instance "'''International Trunk Road'''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hRGdXVWJkNjI4S3c/view ''Northern Exposure: Launching Excavations at Tell Abil el-Qameḥ (Abel Beth Maacah)'', p. 32, in Strata: Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, 2013, Volume 31  ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[King's Highway (Ancient)|King's Highway]], the ''Via Maris'' was one of the major trade routes connecting [[Egypt]] and the [[Levant]] with [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. The ''Via Maris'' was crossed by other trading routes, so that one could travel from Africa to Europe or from Asia to Africa. It began in [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|al-Qantara]] and went east to [[Pelusium]], following the northern coast of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] through [[el-Arish]] and [[Rafah]]. From there it followed the coast of [[Canaan]] through [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ashkelon]], [[Ashdod]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]], and [[Tel Dor|Dor]] before turning east again through [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and the [[Jezreel Valley]] until it reached [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]]. Again turning northward along the shore, the ''Via Maris'' passed through [[Magdala|Migdal]], [[Capernaum]], and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]]. From Hazor it crossed the northern [[Jordan River|River Jordan]] at [[Jacob's Ford|Jacob's Daughters' Bridge]] then climbed sharply over the [[Golan Heights]] and wound its way northeast into [[Damascus]]. Here travelers could continue on the King's Highway as far as the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] or proceed northward into Anatolia.

==Name and controversy==
According to [[Anson Rainey]] (1981),&lt;ref&gt;Anson Rainey, "Toponomic Problems (cont.)" in Tel Aviv 8 (1981), cited after
Stephen Langfur, [http://www.netours.com/content/view/101/1/  The "Via Maris" (netours.com)], c.f. also Anson F. Rainey and R. Steven Notley's ''Carta's New Century Handbook and Atlas of the Bible''(2007), p. 76: "The coastal trunk route (popularly and wrongly called ''Via Maris''),..."&lt;/ref&gt;
"Via Maris" is not the historical name of any road. The phrase rather originates as the Latin translation of {{Bibleref2|Isaiah 9:1}} (in the [[Hebrew Bible]], 8:23) – "by the way of the sea".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 9:1/Hebrew Bible Isaiah 8:23: "In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, '''by the way of the sea''', along the Jordan." The [[Vulgate]] (the Christian Bible, both the Old and [[New Testament]] in Latin translation), {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|4}} reads: "terra Zabulon et terra Nephthalim '''via maris''' trans Iordanen Galilaeae gentium" – "The land of [[Zebulun]] and the land of [[Naphtali]], '''by the way of the sea''', beyond the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], Galilee of the Gentiles." ([[NKJV]] translation)&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet was probably referring to the road from [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] to the sea at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], passing through [[Abel-beth-maachah]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hRGdXVWJkNjI4S3c/view Nava Panitz-Cohen et al., ''Northern Exposure: Launching Excavations at Tell Abil el-Qameḥ (Abel Beth Maacah)'', p 32 in Strata: Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, 2013, Volume 31]&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the northern border of Israel at the time of the Assyrian conquest.

The road mentioned in the traditional description is better listed as '''the Great Trunk Road'''. This Egypt-to-Damascus route is so designated by Barry J. Beitzel in ''The New Moody Atlas of the Bible ''(2009), p.&amp;nbsp;85, by John D. Currid and David P. Barrett in the ''ESV Bible Atlas'' (2010), p.&amp;nbsp;41, and by Rainey and Notley in ''[[Carta (publisher)|Carta]]'s New Century Handbook and Atlas of the Bible'' (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;76. Carl G. Rasmussen in the ''[[Zondervan]] Atlas of the Bible ''(2010), p.&amp;nbsp;32, also notes the traditional misnomer and denotes the Egypt–Damascus route as '''the International North-South Route'''.

Rasmussen, basically in agreement with Langfur and Rainey, suggests that the ''Via Maris'' was the road that connected [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] with [[Damascus]]. Beitzel, in contrast, denotes the Via Maris as a road from Ptolemais (Acco / [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]) to [[Kedesh]] (Kedesh-naphtali) in the Galilee – also leading west to east, but slightly further south and not reaching so far inland.

The '''''Western Australia Post Office Directory''''', also known as ''Wise Directories'' or ''Wise Street Directories'' were published in Perth from 1893-1949.

They were published by H. Pierssené&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pierssené, Herbert | title=The Western Australian directory | publication-date=1893 | publisher=H. Pierssene | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/28621466 | accessdate=6 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by H. Wise &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Wise &amp; Co | title=Wise's Western Australia post office directory | publication-date=1938 | publisher=H. Wise &amp; Co. Pty Ltd | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19293522 | accessdate=6 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They listed household, business, society, and Government contacts in [[Perth]], [[Fremantle]], [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], [[Boulder, Western Australia|Boulder]] and [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]] including some rural areas of [[Western Australia]].

==Publishers==
The ''Western Australian Directory'' was published by H. Pierssene between 1893-1895. Herbert Pierssene was a merchant and importer of English Continental and Ceylonese goods. He was an agent for McCulluch Carrying Company and a bottler of West Australian wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Herbert Pierssené|url=http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/handle/10070/244383|website=Territory Stories|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Arts and Museums|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Western Australia Post Office Directory'' was published by Wise &amp; Co. between the years 1895-1949 with the exception of 1943 and 1948.

==Wise Directories== 	
The directories provide information by locality, individual surname, government service, and by trade or profession. The addresses of householders and businesses throughout Western Australia are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77356821 |title=POST-OFFICE DIRECTORY. |newspaper=[[Daily_News_(Perth,_Western_Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 - 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=27 April 1909 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |page=2 Edition: THIRD EDITION |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maps were sometimes published with an edition of the directory.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77329156 |title=WESTERN AUSTRALIA DIRECTORY. |newspaper=[[Daily_News_(Perth,_Western_Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 - 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=5 March 1908 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |page=6 Edition: THIRD EDITION |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The towns section of the directories normally contained separate street directories of Perth and suburbs, Fremantle and Suburbs, Kalgoorlie, Boulder and Coolgardie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Wise's Directories | author2=Archive CD Books Australia | title=Western Australia Post Office directory (Wise's) 1905 | publication-date=2004 | publisher=Archive CD Books Australia | isbn=978-1-920978-23-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known colloquially to users and  book collectors as 'Wise Directories' or 'Wise Street Directories' the red covered directories were published between 1893 and 1949.  Due to the annual changes, the directories are valuable historical documents for Western Australian History.  They are scarce in the Australian rare book market.  

The directories have been invaluable referent points for such projects as the [[Dictionary of Western Australians]] and others where the street lists in the directory provide details of inhabitants and houses in some streets in the more built-up residential areas.  Country towns in the directory have name lists only. 

They have been available in microfilm form in [[J S Battye Library]], and more recently have become online (see link below) in one of the J S Battye Library digitization projects.

The WILMap is a graphic interface for legislation and case law enabling the public to learn about intermediary liability regimes worldwide and evolving Internet regulation affecting freedom of expression and user rights. This detailed English-language resource allows visitors to select information on countries of interest, including case law, statutes, and proposed laws. Each country page includes links to original sources and English translations, if available. As the WILMap website, programmatically states, this resource should be used “to learn about intermediary liability regimes worldwide, and to identify places where legal regimes balance—or fail to balance—regulatory goals with [[free expression]] and other [[civil liberties]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/our-work/projects/world-intermediary-liability-map-wilmap|title=World Intermediary Liability Map (WILMap)|website=cyberlaw.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==
The WILMap features legislation, pending bills and proposals imposing obligations on intermediaries, both access and [[Internet hosting service|hosting providers]] or other online intermediaries, such as [[payment processors]]. The WILMap covers wide-ranging topics, including online intermediaries' safe harbors, [[e-commerce]], [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] protection, defamation, hate/dangerous speech, including anti-terrorism provisions, privacy protection, and child protection online. If available, the WILMap includes relevant case law for each jurisdiction. Basically, the WILMap would like to features any case law discussing obligations and liability of online intermediaries due to (infringing) activities undertaken by their users. The WILMap also features sections for administrative enforcement of intermediary liability online, if there are administrative agencies in charge with implementing [[Internet censorship|website blocking]] orders or content removal in a certain jurisdiction.

== Coverage and expansion ==
Since its launch in July 2014, the WILMap has been steadily and rapidly growing. In May 2018, an improved version of the WILMap was launched, including a new layout, a relational database and additional features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/05/stanford-law-schools-center-internet-and-society-launch-world-intermediary-liability|title=Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society Launch the World Intermediary Liability Map 2.0|website=cyberlaw.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the WILMap covers almost one hundred jurisdictions in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania. The WILMap is an ongoing project. In collaboration with a network of experts worldwide, CIS continues to update and expand the map, with the goal of covering all jurisdictions. In an effort to make the WILMap an increasingly valuable resource for activists, industry players, researchers, and the general public, the WILMap website will be soon updated with enhanced usability and [[data aggregation]] features.

==Contributors==
The WILMap project was made possible by a team of contributors from around the world, both individual researchers and institutions, providing the necessary information to create and update each country page. The creation of a global network of WILMap contributors also allowed to promote synergies with global platforms and free expression groups to advocate for policies that will protect innovation and other user rights.

{{chinese-name|[[Xú|Xu]]}}
'''Xu Xiake''' ({{zh|c=徐霞客|p=Xú Xiákè|w='''Hsü Hsia-k'o'''}}, January 5, 1587 – March 8, 1641), born '''Xu Hongzu''' (徐弘祖), [[courtesy name]] '''Zhenzhi''' (振之), was a Chinese [[travel writer]] and [[geographer]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), known best for his famous geographical treatise, and noted for his bravery and humility. He traveled throughout China for more than 30 years, documenting his travels extensively. The records of his travels were compiled posthumously in ''[[Xu Xiake's travel|The Travel Diaries Xu Xiake]]'', and his work translated by Ding Wenjiang.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Xu's writing falls under the old Chinese literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'“遊記文學”), which used [[narrative]] and [[prose]] styles of writing to portray one's travel experiences.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 69"&gt;Hargett, 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] barracks ship ''[[Chinese barracks ship Xu Xiake|Xu Xiake]]'' was named after him.

== Life ==

With ancestors from [[Jiangxi]] province, Xu Xiake was born in what is today [[Jiangyin]] (in [[Jiangsu]] province) as Xu Hongzu (宏祖), as the second son of Xu Yu'an (徐豫庵, 1545–1694) and Wang Ruren (王孺人, 1545–1625). It was often said his mother encouraged him to travel and this shaped Xu's predilections. His sobriquet is Zhenzhi (振之). ''Xiake'' was an alternate sobriquet (別號) given to him by his friend Chen Jiru (陳繼儒, 1558–1639) and it means "one who is in the sunset clouds". His other friend, [[Huang Daozhou]] (黃道周, 1585–1646), also gave Xu an alternate sobriquet: ''Xiayi'' (霞逸), meaning "untrammelled in the sunset clouds."

On his journeys throughout China he travelled with a servant called Gu Xing (顧行). He faced many hardships along the way, as he was often dependent on the patronage of local scholars who would help him after he had been robbed of all his belongings.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524" /&gt; Local Buddhist abbots of the various places he visited often would pay him money as well, for the small service of recording the history of their local monastery.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524" /&gt; From the snowy passes of [[Sichuan]], to the subtropical jungles of [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]], to the mountains of [[Tibet]], Xu Xiake wrote of all his experiences and provided enormous amounts of written detail from his observations.

==Travel records==
{{anchor|geography|diary|journals|records}}
[[File:Travels of Xu Xiake.png|320px|thumb|Travel routes of Xu Xiake]]
The written work of Xu Xiake's travel records and diaries contained some 404,000 [[Chinese character]]s, an enormous work for a single author of his time.&lt;ref name="hargett 69"&gt;Hargett, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Xu traveled throughout the provinces of China, often on foot, to write his enormous geographical and [[topography|topographical]] treatise, documenting various details of his travels, such as the locations of small gorges, or [[mineral]] beds such as [[mica]] [[schists]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 525"/&gt; Xu's work was quite systematic, providing accurate details of measurement, and his work, later translated into modern Chinese by Ding Wenjiang, reads more like the accounts of a 20th-century field surveyor than an early 17th-century scholar.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 525" /&gt; In [[Guizhou]], he made the discovery of the true source of the [[Xi Jiang|West River]]. He also discovered the [[Mekong]] and [[Salween]] rivers were, in fact, separate drainages with completely separate watersheds.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 525"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC&amp;q=Xu+Xiake#v=snippet&amp;q=Quantitative%20Cartography%20in%20East%20and%20West&amp;f=false p. 524-525].&lt;/ref&gt; Xu made the important realization that the [[Jinsha River|Jinsha]] river network {{ndash}} and not the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]] or [[Yalong River|Yalong]] {{ndash}} formed the true headwaters of the [[Yangtze River]], correcting a mistake in Chinese geography as old as the "[[Tribute of Yu]]" compiled by [[Confucius]] in the [[Classic of History]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 525" /&gt;
