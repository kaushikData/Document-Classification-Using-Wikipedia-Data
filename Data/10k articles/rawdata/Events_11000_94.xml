The '''2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran''' was a mob action on 2 January 2016 by a crowd of protesters who stormed the embassy in [[Tehran]] and another Saudi diplomatic consulate in [[Mashhad]], ransacking offices. The embassy building was set on fire with [[Molotov cocktail]]s and [[petrol bomb]]s. During the attacks, the police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire.&lt;ref name="tnyt" /&gt;

The attacks were later condemned by [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ali Khamenei]], and [[Iranian president]] [[Hassan Rouhani]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brumfield|first1=Ben|title=Saudi Arabia severs ties with Iran as Mideast protests rage|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/03/middleeast/saudi-arabia-executes-dozens-terror/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=13 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108052000/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/03/middleeast/saudi-arabia-executes-dozens-terror/|archive-date=8 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, [[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i]] announced that around 100 people involved in the attack are in custody by the authorities.&lt;ref name="chan" /&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Saudi Arabia–Iran relations|Execution of Nimr al-Nimr|2016 Saudi Arabia mass execution}}
Moments after [[Execution of Nimr al-Nimr|Sheikh Nimr was executed]], the Saudi Arabian [[chargé d'affaires]] was summoned to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Iranian Foreign Ministry]] to protest against the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.irib.ir/news/item/220881-iran-summons-saudi-envoy-over-nimr-execution|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160105211323/http://english.irib.ir/news/item/220881-iran-summons-saudi-envoy-over-nimr-execution|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-05|title=Iran summons Saudi envoy over Nimr execution|publisher=irib.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari said the execution of Sheikh Nimr "who had no means other than speech to pursue his political and religious objectives only shows the depth of imprudence and irresponsibility".&lt;ref name=presstv1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/01/02/444213/Nimr-Saudi-Arabia-Qatif-Shia-cleric-/|publisher=PressTV|title=People in Saudi Arabia’s Qatif slam Nimr execution|access-date=2016-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203145836/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/01/02/444213/Nimr-Saudi-Arabia-Qatif-Shia-cleric-/|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the Saudi government "supports terrorist movements and [[Takfiri]] extremists, while executing and suppressing critics inside the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/saudi-execution-of-shiite/2394042.html|title=Shiite anger after Saudi Arabia executes top cleric|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203130030/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/saudi-execution-of-shiite/2394042.html|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remarks were later condemned by [[Saudi Arabia]] as "hostile" and the ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador in [[Riyadh]]. The ministry expressed "the kingdom's astonishment and its utter rejection of these hostile statements, which it deemed a blatant intervention in the kingdom's affairs", according to a statement released by the [[Saudi Press Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_saudi-arabia-summons-iranian-ambassador-over-hostile-remarks-on-executions_408598.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127145205/http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_saudi-arabia-summons-iranian-ambassador-over-hostile-remarks-on-executions_408598.html |archive-date=2016-01-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incursion==
About several thousand demonstrators gathered near the embassy on Saturday night to protest and strongly condemn against the execution of [[Sheikh Nimr]]. The rally began quietly, but some participants attempted stormed the building by climbing the embassy's fence, breaking down the door, throwing around papers on the roof and seizing the [[Flag of Saudi Arabia|Saudi flag]].  The protesters chanted, "Death to the Al Saud [family]", the ruling family of [[Saudi Arabia]] among other slogans. It later turned violently after demonstrators began throwing petrol bombs and [[Molotov cocktail]]s at the embassy and then broke into the compound. The police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire.&lt;ref name="tnyt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hubbard|first1=Ben|title=Iranian Protesters Ransack Saudi Embassy After Execution of Shiite Cleric|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-executes-47-sheikh-nimr-shiite-cleric.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=27 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108171711/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-executes-47-sheikh-nimr-shiite-cleric.html?_r=0|archive-date=8 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]]'s second largest city, demonstrators have also set fire at the Saudi consulate and torn down the Saudi flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi embassy in Tehran attacked by protesters|url=http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/saudi-embassy-in-tehran-attacked-by-protesters/|publisher=Saudi Gazette|accessdate=27 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206202830/http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/saudi-embassy-in-tehran-attacked-by-protesters/|archive-date=6 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ali Khamenei]] condemned the attacks and known it as "a very bad and wrong incident". Also, he declared that: "like the [[2011 attack on the British Embassy in Iran|British embassy attack]] before it, this was against the country (Iran) and [[Islam]], and I didn't like it."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-supreme-leader-condemns-saudi-embassy-attack/ |title=Iran supreme leader condemns Saudi embassy attack |work=Times of Israel |date=20 January 2016 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522122049/http://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-supreme-leader-condemns-saudi-embassy-attack/ |archive-date=22 May 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3408185/Iran-supreme-leader-condemns-Saudi-embassy-attack.html |title=Iran supreme leader condemns Saudi embassy attack |work=Daily Mail |date=20 January 2016 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604112114/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3408185/Iran-supreme-leader-condemns-Saudi-embassy-attack.html |archive-date=4 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Hassan Rouhani]] condemned the attacks while at the same time he also condemned the execution of [[Nimr al-Nimr]]. He blamed the attacks on "extremist individuals". He has pledged to protect the security of foreign missions and prosecute those responsible for attacking Saudi diplomatic posts, in a series of messages posted on his Twitter account moments after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran president condemns Saudi execution, embassy attack|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-security-iran-rouhani-idINKBN0UH0DZ20160103|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203055417/http://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-security-iran-rouhani-idINKBN0UH0DZ20160103|archive-date=3 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January, President Rouhani has asked the Iranian judiciary to immediately prosecute the attackers invoked. He said by punishing the attackers and those who orchestrated this obvious offense, his government should put an end once and forever to such damage and insults to Iran's dignity and national security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharafedin|first1=Bozorgmehr|title=Rouhani shows determination to end embassy attacks in Iran|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-iran-idUSKBN0UK1XT20160106|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109103545/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-iran-idUSKBN0UK1XT20160106|archive-date=9 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian authorities have express regret over the attacks and arrested at least 40 individuals in connection to the attack.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Five days later on January 7, 2016, Iran's foreign ministry made the claim that Saudi warplanes had "deliberately" targeted its embassy to Yemen in the city of [[Sana'a]]. Iran's report included claims that,"a number of the building's guards" had been injured as a result of the bombing.

[[File:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lehman Brothers headquarters in New York City, one year prior to bankruptcy]]
The filing for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy protection]] by financial services firm [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, remains the [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code#Largest cases|largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history]], with Lehman holding over {{currency|600 billion|USD}} in assets.

The bank had become so deeply involved in [[mortgage origination]] that it had effectively become a [[real estate]] [[hedge fund]] disguised as an investment bank. At the height of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], it was exceptionally vulnerable to any [[downturn]] in real estate values.

The bankruptcy triggered a one-day drop in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] of 4.5%, the largest decline since the [[September 11 attacks#Economic|September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==Background==
{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}

=== Rise of mortgage origination (1997–2006) ===
Lehman was one of the first [[Wall Street]] firms to move into the business of [[mortgage origination]]. In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender Aurora Loan Services, an [[Alt-A]] lender. In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender [[BNC Mortgage LLC]]. Lehman quickly became a force in the [[subprime lending|subprime market]]. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending.  By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0071638296|location=|pages=129|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehman had morphed into a real estate hedge fund disguised as an investment bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0071638296|location=|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a three- to five-percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.

===Exposure to the mortgage market===
Lehman borrowed significant amounts to fund its investing in the years leading to its bankruptcy in 2008, a process known as [[Leverage (finance)|leveraging]] or gearing. A significant portion of this investment was in housing-related assets, making it vulnerable to a downturn in that market. One measure of this risk-taking was its leverage ratio, a measure of the ratio of assets to owners equity, which increased from approximately 24:1 in 2003 to 31:1 by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/d11MXs.t5Bb.htm#1stPage |title=Lehman 2007 Annual Report-See Item 6 on Page 29 for ratios |publisher=Secinfo.com |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While generating tremendous profits during the boom, this vulnerable position meant that just a 3–4% decline in the value of its assets would entirely eliminate its book value of equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robin Blackburn |url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2715 |title=Blackburn-The Subprime Crisis-New Left Review-March/April 2008 |publisher=Newleftreview.org |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment banks such as Lehman were not subject to the same regulations applied to depository banks to restrict their risk-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em |title=NYT-Agency 04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up More Debt-October, 2008 |work=The New York Times  |date=October 2, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Lehman closed its [[subprime lender]], BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took a $25-million after-tax charge and a $27-million reduction in [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]. The firm said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space "necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10375812/1/lehman-brothers-amputates-mortgage-arm.html |title=Lehman Brothers Amputates Mortgage Arm |author=Kulikowski, Laura |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |publisher=[[TheStreet.com]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317171246/http://www.thestreet.com/story/10375812/1/lehman-brothers-amputates-mortgage-arm.html| archivedate= March 17, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lehman's final months===
In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss due to the continuing [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Lehman's loss resulted from having held onto large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage [[tranche]]s when securitizing the underlying mortgages. Whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear.  In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008.  In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8 billion and decided to raise $6 billion in additional capital by offering new shares.&lt;ref name="nytimes-crisis"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/business/29wall.html?em |title=Struggling Lehman Plans to Lay Off 1,500 |author=Jenny Anderson |author2=Eric Dash |work=The New York Times |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034244/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/business/29wall.html?em| archivedate=May 12, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2008/06/09/lehman-raising-6-billion-in-capital-expects-2-8-billion-loss/|title=Lehman raising $6 billion in capital, expects $2.8 billion loss|author=|date=June 9, 2008|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten.&lt;ref name="nytimes-crisis"/&gt; In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September.&lt;ref name="nytimes-crisis"/&gt;

On August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled [[Korea Development Bank]] was considering buying Lehman.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, World Business, article by Jenny Anderson and Landon Thomas, August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news emerged that Korea Development Bank was "facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid={9E9BDC4C-06D1-4EBD-971B-FCD4A4249F24}&amp;siteid=yhoof2 |title=Financials slip as Korea snags weigh on Lehman and Merrill – MarketWatch |publisher=Marketwatch.com |accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It culminated on September 9, 2008, when Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA |title=AFP: Lehman Brothers in freefall as hopes fade for new capital |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421002953/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA |archive-date=April 21, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the [[S&amp;P 500]] down 3.4% on September 9, 2008. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] lost nearly 300 points the same day, on investors' concerns about the security of the bank.&lt;ref name="tp-0909"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2008/09/dow_plunges_nearly_300_points.html |title=Dow plunges nearly 300 points on concern about Lehman |publisher=Times-Picayune |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman.&lt;ref name="nytimes-0909"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/business/10place.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |title=Wall Street’s Fears on Lehman Bros.

On September 10, 2008, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9 billion and their intent to sell off a majority stake in their investment-management business, which included [[Neuberger Berman]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-0910"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |title=Lehman Sees $3.9 Billion Loss and Plans to Shed Assets |work=The New York Times |author=Ben White |date=September 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034331/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin| archivedate=May 12, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-0910"/&gt; The stock slid 7% that day.&lt;ref name="ap-0910"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008171076_weblehman10.html |title=Lehman shares slip on plans to auction off unit, consider sale of company |author=Joe Bel Bruno |agency=Associated Press |date=September 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-0911"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html?hp |title=As Pressure Builds, Lehman Said to Be Looking for a Buyer  |author=Jenny Anderson |author2=Andrew Ross Sorkin |work=The New York Times |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=September 11, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034402/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html?hp| archivedate=May 12, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2008, [[Timothy F.

==Bankruptcy filing==
[[File:Barclays HQ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barclays]] acquired the investment banking business of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008]]

Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. According to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], reports filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan) on September 16 indicated that [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.]] provided [[Lehman Brothers]] with a total of $138 billion in "Federal Reserve-backed advances". The "Federal Reserve-backed advances" as provided by [[JPMorgan Chase]] were for $87 billion on September 15 and $51 billion on September 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kary |first=Tiffany |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aX7mhYCHmVf8&amp;refer=home |title=JPMorgan Gave Lehman $138 Billion After Bankruptcy (Update3) By Tiffany Kary and Chris Scinta |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filing remains the [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code#Largest cases|largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history]], with Lehman holding over $600 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={2FE5AC05-597A-4E71-A2D5-9B9FCC290520}&amp;siteid=rss |title=Lehman folds with record $613 billion debt|publisher=Marketwatch |date=September 15, 2008 |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakup process===
On September 22, 2008, a revised proposal to sell the brokerage part of Lehman Brothers holdings of the deal, was put before the bankruptcy court, with a $1.3666 billion (£700 million) plan for [[Barclays]] to acquire the core business of [[Lehman Brothers]] (mainly Lehman's $960 million [[Midtown Manhattan]] office skyscraper), was approved. [[Manhattan]] court bankruptcy Judge James Peck, after a seven-hour hearing, ruled: "I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. It's hard for me to imagine a similar emergency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7626624.stm |title=news.bbc.co.uk, Judge approves $1.3bn Lehman deal |publisher=BBC News  |date=September 20, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luc Despins, the creditors committee counsel, said: "The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Judge approves Lehman, Barclays pact|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lehman-barclays-idUSN1932554220080921|newspaper = Reuters|date = September 21, 2008|access-date = January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb  $47.4 billion in securities and assume $45.5 billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney [[Harvey R. Miller]] of [[Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges]], said "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29 billion, including $960 million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330 million for two New Jersey data centers. Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally,  Lehman will retain $20 billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chasan |first=Emily |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSN1932554220080920 |title=reuters.com, Judge approves Lehman, Barclays pact |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |date=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barclays had a potential liability of $2.5 billion to be paid as [[Severance package|severance]], if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fastdipfinancing.com/u-s-judge-approves-lehman-asset-sale-to-barclay/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217225635/https://fastdipfinancing.com/u-s-judge-approves-lehman-asset-sale-to-barclay/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-12-17|title=Judge says Lehman can sell units to Barclay.|author=|date=|website=fastdipfinancing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fastdipfinancing.com/u-s-judge-approves-lehman-asset-sale-to-barclay/ "US judge approves Lehman's asset sale to Barclay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217225635/https://fastdipfinancing.com/u-s-judge-approves-lehman-asset-sale-to-barclay/ |date=December 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2008, [[Nomura Holdings, Inc.]] announced it agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia Pacific region including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nomura to acquire Lehman Brothers' Asia Pacific franchise | url=http://www.nomuraholdings.com/news/nr/holdings/20080922/20080922.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Nomura announced its intentions to acquire Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. A few weeks later it was announced that conditions to the deal had been met, and the deal became legally effective on Monday, October 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nomura to close acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Europe and Middle East investment banking and equities businesses on October 13 | url=http://www.nomuraholdings.com/news/nr/europe/20081006/20081006_a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehman Brothers 2007 Annual Report |url=http://www.lehman.com/annual/2007/div_regions/intro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322002013/http://www.lehman.com/annual/2007/div_regions/intro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of bankruptcy filing ==
The Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points (−4.4%) on September 15, 2008, at the time the largest drop by points in a single day since [[Economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks|the days following]] the attacks on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16markets.html?hp |title=Wall St.’s Turmoil Sends Stocks Reeling  |author=Michael Grynbaum |work=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2008 |accessdate=September 15, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110411024523/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16markets.html?hp| archivedate=April 11, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This drop was subsequently exceeded by an even larger −7.0% plunge on September 29, 2008.)
 
Lehman's bankruptcy was expected to cause some depreciation in the price of commercial real estate. The prospect for Lehman's $4.3 billion in mortgage securities getting liquidated sparked a selloff in the [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial mortgage-backed securities]] (CMBS) market. Additional pressure to sell securities in commercial real estate was feared as Lehman got closer to liquidating its assets. Apartment-building investors were also expected to feel pressure to sell as Lehman unloaded its debt and equity pieces of the $22 billion purchase of [[Archstone-Smith Trust|Archstone]], the third-largest United States [[real estate investment trust]] (REIT). Archstone's core business was the ownership and management of residential apartment buildings in major metropolitan areas of the United States. Jeffrey Spector, a real-estate analyst at [[UBS]] said that in markets with apartment buildings that compete with Archstone, "there is no question that if you need to sell assets, you will try to get ahead" of the Lehman selloff, adding "Every day that goes by there will be more pressure on pricing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.comarticleSB122161549909246211.html?mod=residential_real_estate |title=After Lehman, Banks Jettison Commercial-Property Debt |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=September 18, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several [[money fund]]s and institutional cash funds had significant exposure to Lehman with the institutional cash fund run by [[Bank of New York Mellon|The Bank of New York Mellon]] and the Reserve Primary Fund, a [[money market fund]], both falling below $1 per share, called "[[wiktionary:break the buck|breaking the buck]]", following losses on their holdings of Lehman assets. In a statement The Bank of New York Mellon said its fund had isolated the Lehman assets in a separate structure. It said the assets accounted for 1.13% of its fund.

[[Putnam Investments]], a unit of Canada's [[Great-West Lifeco]], shut a $12.3 billion money-market fund as it faced "significant redemption pressure" on September 17, 2008.

Close to 100 hedge funds used Lehman as their [[prime broker]] and relied largely on the firm for financing.

In Japan, banks and insurers announced a combined 249 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in potential losses tied to the Lehman shock. [[Mizuho Trust &amp; Banking Co.]] cut its profit forecast by more than half, citing 11.8 billion yen in losses on bonds and loans linked to Lehman. The [[Bank of Japan]] Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said, "Most lending to Lehman Brothers was made by major Japanese banks, and their possible losses seem to be within the levels that can be covered by their profits," adding, "There is no concern that the latest events will threaten the stability of Japan's financial system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=a3mSQ9tXT.5w&amp;refer=japan|title=Japan Banks, Insurers Have $2.4 Billion Lehman Risk|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During bankruptcy proceedings a lawyer from [[Royal Bank of Scotland Group|The Royal Bank of Scotland Group]] said the company was facing between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in claims against Lehman partially based on an unsecured guarantee from Lehman and connected to trading losses with Lehman subsidiaries, Martin Bienenstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/fundsFundsNews/idUSN1751719120080918|title=RBS sees Lehman claims at $1.5 bln-$1.8 billion: lawyer|publisher=Reuters|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 18, 2008 | first=Emily | last=Chasan| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921024016/https://www.reuters.com/article/fundsFundsNews/idUSN1751719120080918| archivedate= September 21, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lehman was a counterparty to mortgage financier [[Freddie Mac]] in unsecured lending transactions that matured on September 15, 2008. Freddie said it had not received principal payments of $1.2 billion plus accrued interest. Freddie said it had further potential exposure to Lehman of about $400 million related to the servicing of single-family home loans, including repurchasing obligations. Freddie also said it "does not know whether and to what extent it will sustain a loss relating to the transactions" and warned that "actual losses could materially exceed current estimates." Freddie was still in the process of evaluating its exposure to Lehman and its affiliates under other business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lehman owes Freddie at least $1.2bn|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9bbd2a58-85dd-11dd-a1ac-0000779fd18c.html|last=Bullock|first=Nicole|work=Financial Times|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After [[Constellation Energy]] was reported to have exposure to Lehman, its stock went down 56% in the first day of trading having started at $67.87. The massive drop in stocks led to the [[New York Stock Exchange]] halting trade of Constellation. The next day, as the stock plummeted as low as $13 per share, Constellation announced it was hiring [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[UBS]] to advise it on "strategic alternatives", suggesting a buyout. While rumors suggested French power company [[Électricité de France]] would buy the company or increase its stake, Constellation ultimately agreed to a buyout by [[MidAmerican Energy]], part of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] (headed by billionaire [[Warren Buffett]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/economy/2008/09/17/constellation-energy-lehman-markets-equity-cx_md_0917markets22.html|title=Lehman Ties Dim Constellation|last=Desmond|first=Maurna|work=Forbes|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.scotsman.com/energyutilities/Power-deal-delivers--new.4508490.jp|last=Thomson|first=Victoria|title=Power deal delivers new star to Buffett's energy constellation|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222919/http://business.scotsman.com/energyutilities/Power-deal-delivers--new.4508490.jp| archivedate= September 21, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/09/18/buffett-shoots-for-falling-constellation/|title=Buffett Shoots for Falling Constellation|last=Gaffen|first=David|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921001146/https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/09/18/buffett-shoots-for-falling-constellation/| archivedate= September 21, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuberger Berman ==

'''[[Neuberger Berman]] Inc.''', through its subsidiaries, primarily '''Neuberger Berman, LLC''', is an investment-advisory firm founded in 1939 by [[Roy Neuberger|Roy R. Neuberger]] and Robert Berman, to manage money for [[high-net-worth individual]]s.  In the decades that followed, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole.  In 1950, it introduced one of the first [[no-load]] [[mutual fund]]s in the United States, the [[Guardian Fund]], and also began to manage the assets of [[pension plan]]s and other institutions.  Historically known for its [[value investing|value-investing]] style, in the 1990s the firm began to diversify its competencies to include additional value and [[growth investing]], across the entire [[market capitalization|capitalization]] spectrum, as well as new investment categories, such as international, [[real estate investment trust|real-estate investment trusts]] and [[high yield|high-yield]] investments.  In addition, with the creation of a nationally and several state-chartered trust companies, the firm became able to offer trust and fiduciary services.  In 2016, the firm had approximately $246 billion in [[assets under management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nb.com/pages/public/en-us/private-equity.aspx|title=Private Equity - Neuberger Berman|author=|date=|website=nb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Neuberger Berman by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|[[Neuberger Berman]]'s New York City headquarters on [[Third Avenue]].]]
 
In October 1999, the firm conducted an [[initial public offering]] of its shares and commenced trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], under the ticker symbol "NEU".  In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in [[merger]] discussions with [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]]  These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities.  
 
On November 20, 2006, Lehman announced its Neuberger Berman subsidiary would acquire H. A. Schupf &amp; Co., a money-management firm targeted at wealthy individuals.  Its $2.5 billion of assets would join Neuberger's $50 billion in high-net-worth client assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlebusiness.aspx?type=ousiv&amp;storyID=2006-11-20T154504Z_01_N20427604_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESSPRO-FINANCIAL-LEHMAN-SCHUPF-DC.XML&amp;WTmodLoc=BizArt-C2-NextArticle-1 Lehman to acquire H.

An article in [[Wall Street Journal|The Wall Street Journal]] on September 15, 2008, announcing that Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy protection]], quoted Lehman officials regarding Neuberger Berman:  "''Neuberger Berman LLC and Lehman Brothers Asset Management will continue to conduct business as usual and will not be subject to the bankruptcy case of the parent company, and its portfolio management, research and operating functions remain intact.  In addition, fully paid securities of customers of Neuberger Berman are segregated from the assets of Lehman Brothers and aren't subject to the claims of Lehman Brothers Holdings' creditors, Lehman said.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122145492097035549 |title=Lehman Files for Bankruptcy |accessdate=December 22, 2010 |date=September 16, 2008 |work=Wall Street Journal |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB122145492097035549.html&amp;date=2010-12-22 |archivedate=December 22, 2010 |first=Carrick |last=Mollenkamp |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers' top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to "send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance".
 
Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director [[George Herbert Walker IV]] dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea of bonus reduction having been suggested.  He wrote, "Sorry team.  I am not sure what's in the water at Neuberger Berman.  I'm embarrassed and I apologize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27047714/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/ |title=House panel grills Lehman chief about bonuses |accessdate=December 22, 2010 |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=MSNBC |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.msnbc.msn.com%2Fid%2F27047714%2Fns%2Fbusiness-stocks_and_economy%2F%23fullstory&amp;date=2010-12-22 |archivedate=December 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Controversy of executive pay during crisis ===

[[Richard S. Fuld, Jr.|Richard Fuld]], head of Lehman Brothers, faced questioning from the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]' [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA) asked: "Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in crisis, but you get to keep $480 million (£276 million). I have a very basic question for you, is this fair?"&lt;ref name="Fuld punched in face"/&gt; Fuld said that he had in fact taken about $300 million (£173 million) in pay and bonuses over the past eight years.&lt;ref name="Fuld punched in face"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3150319/Richard-Fuld-punched-in-face-in-Lehman-Brothers-gym.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | title=Richard Fuld punched in face in Lehman Brothers gym | first=Jon | last=Swaine | date=October 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Fuld's defense on his high pay, Lehman Brothers executive pay was reported to have increased significantly before filing for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/id/415432/cs/1/ |title=Lehman Brothers executive pay was increased before bankruptcy |publisher=Story.malaysiasun.com |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205754/http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/id/415432/cs/1/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 2008, [[CNBC]] reported that several Lehman executives, including Richard Fuld, had been subpoenaed in a case relating to securities fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27236448/Lehman_Executives_Including_Fuld_Subpoenaed |work=CNBC-TV |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |title=Lehman Executives Including Fuld Subpoenaed |first=Charlie |last=Gasparino |date=October 17, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015054622/http://www.cnbc.com/id/27236448/Lehman_Executives_Including_Fuld_Subpoenaed |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounting manipulation ===
In March 2010, the [[report of Anton R. Valukas]], the Bankruptcy Examiner, drew attention to the use of [[Repo 105]] transactions to boost the bank's apparent financial position around the date of the year-end [[balance sheet]]. The New York attorney general [[Andrew Cuomo]] later filed charges against the bank's auditors [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in December 2010, alleging that the firm "substantially assisted... a massive accounting fraud" by approving the accounting treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1934026/-sued-lehmans-audit E&amp;Y sued over Lehmans audit], ''Accountancy Age'', December 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2010, a story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed that Lehman had used a small company, [[Hudson Castle Group, Inc.|Hudson Castle]], to move a number of transactions and assets off Lehman's books as a means of manipulating accounting numbers of Lehman's finances and risks. One Lehman executive described Hudson Castle as an "alter ego" of Lehman. According to the story, Lehman owned one quarter of Hudson; Hudson's board was controlled by Lehman, most Hudson staff members were former Lehman employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13lehman.html | title=Lehman Channeled Risks Through ‘Alter Ego’ Firm |work=The New York Times | date=April 12, 2010 | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | first=Louise | last=Story |author2=Eric Dash| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420013437/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13lehman.html| archivedate= April 20, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Section 363 sale ===

On February 22, 2011, Judge [[James M. Peck]] of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York rejected claims by lawyers for the Lehman estate that Barclays had improperly reaped a windfall from the [[section 363]] sale.  "The sale process may have been imperfect, but it was still adequate under the exceptional circumstances of Lehman Week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12549242 | title=Lehman Brothers $11bn case against Barclays fails | publisher=BBC | date=February 23, 2011 | accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival''' ({{ko-hhrm|부천국제판타스틱영화제|富川國際판타스틱映畵祭}}), or '''BiFan''', is an international [[film festival]] held annually in July in [[Bucheon]], [[South Korea]]. Prior to 2015, it was known as the '''Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival''' or '''PiFan'''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Inaugurated in 1997, the festival focuses on [[Cinema of South Korea|South Korean]] and international horror, thriller, mystery and fantasy films, with particular attention to [[Asian cinema]] from [[East Asian cinema|East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asian cinema|Southeast Asia]].

The 11th edition of BiFan, held from 12 to 24 July 2007, featured 225 films from 33 countries. The 12th edition of BiFan was held between 18 and 27 July 2008.

==Program==
The festival's programming consists of eight sections:
* Bucheon Choice
* World Fantastic Cinema
* Fantastic Short Films
* Forbidden Zone
* Family Fanta
* Ani-Fanta
* Special Programs
* Retrospectives

==Awards==
The festival is non-competitive, except for the Bucheon Choice section, in which the "Golden Kebbi" is bestowed on the "Best of Bucheon" film.

==Boycott==
The festival faced a [[boycott]] in 2005 to protest what was seen by critics as meddling by Bucheon mayor [[Hong Geon-pyo]]. A rival event called RealFanta was organized that year on the same dates as BiFan by former festival director Kim Hong-joon. The festival returned in 2006 without any dispute under the direction of veteran filmmaker [[Lee Jang-ho]] and a new programming team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Paquet  | first = Darcy | title = Fest tries to regain fantastic rep  | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | date = 2006-05-14  | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943178.html?categoryid=1442&amp;cs=1 | accessdate = 2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TorontoCodeCamp.jpg|thumb|Toronto Code Camp 2010]]
'''Code Camp''' is a form of an [[unconference]]. Originally begun with the goal of helping developers who could not make it to work during regular hours, the project offers technical presentations and provides access to technical content.  Started in Boston by Thom Robbins and a handful of local developer community leaders, Code Camps went on to influence the creation of other "Camp" style events such as [[barcamp]].  As they have evolved, Code Camps have moved away from being strictly limited to the [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/trobbins/archive/2004/12/12/280181.aspx|title = The Code Camp Manifesto|date = 12 Dec 2004|accessdate = 24 Dec 2015|website = Thom Robbins .NET Weblog|publisher = Thom Robbins|last = Robbins|first = Thom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Code Camps are free to attend and they do not take place during the typical work week.

Like most unconferences, Code Camps are focused on the local or regional development community. Presenters are typically also members of the community. Presentation topics are suggested by attendees, and often presented by those who originally suggest them.

A '''conceptual system''' is a system that is composed of non-[[physical system|physical]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, i.e. ideas or concepts. In this context a [[system]] is taken to mean "an interrelated, interworking set of objects".

== Overview ==
A conceptual system is a [[conceptual model]]. Such systems may be related to any topic from [[formal science]] to individual [[imagination]]. Conceptual systems may be found within the human mind, as works of art and fiction, and within the academic world. Indeed, this article may be understood as a conceptual system because it includes a set of interrelated concepts.

Broadly, when a conceptual system includes a range of values, ideas, and beliefs the conceptual system is said be a [[worldview|view of the world]]. In [[psychology]] and [[social work]], a conceptual system may refer to an individual's [[mental model]] of the world. In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a [[metaphor]] for the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0402_4 | volume=4 | title=The Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System | journal=Cognitive Science | pages=195–208 | last1 = Lakoff | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt; In science, there are many forms of conceptual systems including laws, theories, and models. Those conceptual systems may be developed through [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical analysis]].

The idea that the human mind might contain conceptual systems goes back at least as far as Kelly's [[personal construct theory]] in 1955. More recently, many scholars discuss conceptual systems and the importance of understanding them (c.f. [[Bateson]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], [[Senge]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Umberto Eco|Eco]], [[Umpleby]], and [http://projectfast.org Wallis]). On the personal level, the human mind is generally held to contain a wide range of conceptual systems although they are not well organized. Indeed, our minds are full of conflicting mental models&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/92-09-048.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which makes decision making unreliable - particularly in large-scale, complex situations.

Within the academic literature, each theory may be understood as a conceptual system. Conceptual systems are generally held to have greater value when they are more useful, based on more research, and are more systemically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integral-review.org/documents/Wallis,%20Validation%20of%20Theory,%20Vol.%204%20No.%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, that validity may also be described in terms of its internal [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and the [[Communication|correspondence]] between the conceptual system and other systems (e.g. [[social system]]s or [[physical system]]s). Coherence may be tested by [[Integrative complexity]] (for individuals) and  by [http://journals.isss.org/index.php/proceedings56th/article/viewFile/1943/657 Integrative Propositional Analysis] (for academic theories). Correspondence is generally tested by [[empirical analysis]] and conditions of [[falsifiability]]. The conceptual system may then be said to model the physical or social system and serve as a guide for individual behavior or academic research.

=== Examples ===
Examples of conceptual systems include:
*Assumptions
*[[Business decision mapping|Business decision map]]
*[[Entity-relationship model]]
*[[Ethics]]
*[[Laws of science]]
*[[Metalogic]]
*[[Mind map]]
*[[Conceptual model|Model]]
*[[Object-oriented programming]]: allows conceptual systems to be defined in a robust manner.
*[[Policy]]
*[[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]
*[[Strategic plan]]
*[[Theory]]
*[[Unified Modeling Language]]
*[[Values]]

=== Concept ===
{{Main|Concept}}
A '''concept''' is an [[abstraction|abstract]] [[idea]] or a mental symbol, typically associated with a corresponding representation in [[language]] or [[symbology]], that denotes all of the objects in a given [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] or [[class (philosophy)|class]] of entities, [[interaction]]s, [[phenomena]], or relationships between them.  Concepts are abstract in that they omit the [[Difference (philosophy)|differences]] of the things in  [[extension (semantics)|extension]], treating them as if they were identical. They are universal in that they apply equally to everything in their extension.  Concepts are also the basic elements of [[proposition]]s, much the same way a [[word]] is the basic [[semantics|semantic]] element of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Unlike [[perception]]s, which are particular images of individual objects, concepts cannot be visualized. Because they are not, themselves, individual perceptions, concepts are discursive and result from [[reason]]. They can only be thought about, or designated, by means of a [[name]]. Words are not concepts. Words are signs for concepts.

=== Conceptual schema ===
{{Main|Conceptual schema}}
A conceptual model is a representation of some phenomenon, data or theory by logical and mathematical objects such as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, tables, [[stochastic process]]es, formulas, axiom systems, rules of inference etc. A conceptual model has an [[ontology]], that is the set of expressions in the model which are ''intended'' to denote some aspect of the modeled object. Here we are deliberately vague as to how expressions are constructed in a model and particularly what the logical structure of formulas in a model actually is.  In fact, we have made no assumption that models are encoded in any [[formal logical system]] at all, although we briefly address this issue below. Moreover, the definition given here is oblivious to whether two expressions really should denote the same thing. Note that this notion of ontology is different from (and weaker than) ontology as is sometimes understood in philosophy; in our sense there is no claim that the expressions actually denote anything which exists ''physically'' or ''spatio-temporally'' (to use W. Quine's formulation).

For example, a stochastic model of stock prices includes in its ontology a sample space, random variables, the mean and variance of stock prices, various regression coefficients etc. Models of [[quantum mechanics]] in which [[pure state]]s are represented as unit vectors in a Hilbert space include in their ontologies [[observable]]s, [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[measurement]] operators etc. It is possible that observables and states of quantum mechanics are as physically real as the electrons they model, but by adopting this purely formal notion of ontology we avoid altogether this question.

=== Conceptual framework ===
{{Main|Conceptual framework}}
A [[conceptual framework]] is used in research to outline possible courses of action or to present a preferred approach to a [[system analysis]] project. It has also been defined as the organization of ideas to achieve a purpose&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating conceptual frameworks and project Management.'' Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press&lt;/ref&gt; The framework is built from a set of [[concept]]s linked to a planned or existing [[system]] of [[Method (software engineering)|method]]s, [[behavior]]s, functions, relationships, and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s. A conceptual framework might, in computing terms, be thought of as a [[relational model]].

For example, a conceptual framework of accounting "seeks to identify the nature, subject, purpose and broad content of general-purpose financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics that financial information should possess".&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, J.C. ''Australian Financial Accounting'', McGraw Hill Australia Pty Ltd, New South Wales, 2005, p.1184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dia dos Namorados''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈdʒiɐ duʒ namoˈɾaduʃ|lang}}, ''Lovers' Day'') is celebrated on June 12 in Brazil, due to the date's proximity to Saint Anthony's Day on June 13.  The date is celebrated in a manner similar to the way that [[Valentine's Day]] is celebrated on February 14 in many other parts of the world, with gifts, [[Romance (love)|romantic activities]], decorations and festivities. The term "Dia dos Namorados" is also used in other [[CPLP|Portuguese-speaking countries]].

==Background==
[[Anthony of Padua]], known as Saint Anthony, died on June 13, 1231, in Padua, Italy.&lt;ref name=OC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?date=2013-06-13|title=Old Calendar: St. Anthony of Padua|accessdate=June 25, 2013|date=|publisher=Trinity Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having been [[Canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]] by the [[Catholic Church]], Anthony of Padua is recognized as a [[General officer|general]] in the [[Brazilian Army]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt; In [[Brazil]], the Dia dos Namorados is celebrated on June 12, which is Saint Anthony's Day Eve.&lt;ref name=DDNADFTE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boldsky.com/insync/pulse/2007/brazilian-couple.html|title=Dia Dos Namorados – A Day For The Enamoured|accessdate=June 18, 2013|date=January 31, 2007|work=[[Bold Sky]]|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Anthony is recognized for blessing young couples with happy and prosperous marriages.&lt;ref name=DDNADFTE/&gt; Celebrations for Dia dos Namorados in Brazil and those for Valentine's Day in most other countries are similar. Typically, couples exchange romantic gifts, such as chocolates or flowers, and they may also share a "date night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-entertainment/celebrate-dia-dos-namorados-in-rio/|title=Celebrate Dia dos Namorados 2013 in Rio|accessdate=June 12, 2013|date=June 11, 2013|work=[[Rio Times]]|author=Fiona Hurrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, beautifying home decorations are common as a part of the celebration. The day is festive, with colorful street decorations, parades and carnivals. Common musical celebrations include [[samba]] dancing and other folk music celebrations.&lt;ref name=DDNADFTE/&gt; In 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/dia-dos-namorados-2011|title=Dia Dos Namorados 2011|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=June 12, 2011|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/dia-dos-namorados-2012|title=Dia Dos Namorados 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2013|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day was recognized online as the subject of a [[Google doodle]].

Dia dos Namorados as a celebration for lovers is closely related to observances of Saint Anthony's Day.  Although Saint Anthony's Day is celebrated in some countries on January 17 in association with [[Anthony the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d29Yo-UIBSwC&amp;pg=PA1491&amp;dq=Saint+Anthony%27s+Day+Marriage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K4vKUfypHIbN0AH61IHYBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Anthony%27s%20Day%20Marriage&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World|accessdate=June 26, 2013|date=2003|isbn=1410209164|publisher=[[University Press of the Pacific]]|page=1491|editor= Daniels, Cora Linn and C.

The February 14 Valentine's Day is not celebrated in Brazil at all because it usually falls close to the [[Brazilian Carnival]], which is celebrated in most other countries annually during the four days before [[Ash Wednesday]], which falls between February 4 and March 10 depending on the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900628,00.html|title=The Psychology of Carnaval|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 14, 1969|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The June 12 holiday celebration was popularized in the 1950 by an advertising professional.--&gt;&lt;!--(Unable to find an [[WP:RS]] for the following) Dia dos Namorados' June 12 recognition traces back to 1949 when the São Paulo Chamber of Commerce originated the date in hopes of boosting commercial activity during its traditional cyclical lull period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madeinbrazilbbq.com/valentines-day-dia-dos-namorados|title=Valentine’s Day / Dia dos Namorados|accessdate=June 18, 2013|date=|publisher=MadeInBrazilbbq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In other Portuguese speaking countries, mainly in Africa, Valentine's Day is referred to as "Dia dos Namorados" and celebrated the same day Valentine's Day is celebrated in February.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Francis Tumblety''' (c.1833 – 28 May 1903) was an Irish-born American [[Quackery|medical quack]] who earned a small fortune posing as an "Indian Herb" doctor throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="MPS001"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper | publisher = Metropolitan Police | url = http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm | accessdate = 20 January 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060711093022/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm | archivedate = 11 July 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an eccentric self-promoter and was often in trouble with the law. He has been put forward as a [[Jack the Ripper suspects|suspect]] for the notorious and unsolved [[Jack the Ripper]] murder spree in [[Whitechapel]], [[London]], in 1888.

==Childhood==
According to the 1850 United States census, Tumblety was born in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=casebook&gt;Willard, Bev; Thurston, Roy (1998) "[http://www.casebook.org/suspects/tumblety.tbgrave.html Francis Tumblety's Grave]", Casebook: Jack the Ripper, retrieved 3 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, James and Margaret Tumuelty (so spelled on their tombstone),&lt;ref name=casebook/&gt; along with his 10 brothers and sisters, immigrated to [[Rochester, New York]], a few years after his birth.&lt;ref name=w&amp;r126/&gt; By the age of 17 he was selling books, which were possibly [[pornography|pornographic]], along the [[Erie Canal]] between Rochester and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He left home around 17, and did not return for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly employed as a cleaner at "Lispenard's Hospital" in Rochester.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"[www.casebook.org/press_reports/rochester_daily_union_and_advertiser/18810405.html "Dr." Tumblety]", ''Rochester Daily Union &amp; Advertiser'', 5 April 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tumblety set himself up in business, initially in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name=w&amp;r126&gt;Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to be a "great physician", but was commonly perceived as a [[Quackery|quack]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He sold [[patent medicine]]s such as "Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer" and "[[Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills]]", and gained a reputation for his eccentric, ostentatious clothes, which were frequently of a military nature.&lt;ref name=r265&gt;Rumbelow, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tumblety, by 1857 he was practicing medicine in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tumblety|first=Francis|title=Narrative of Dr. Tumblety |year=1872|publisher=Russells' American steam printing house|location=New York|pages=6–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ4fAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to New York and Washington, D.C., where he claimed to have first been introduced to Abraham Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tumblety|first=Francis|title=Narrative of Dr. Tumblety |year=1872|publisher=Russells' American steam printing house|location=New York|pages=16–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ4fAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumblety's medicinal approach was based on herbal remedies over mineral "poisons" (mercury) or surgical techniques.&lt;ref name="Roscoe, Theodore 1959 pp. 301"&gt;Roscoe, Theodore (1959) ''The Web of Conspiracy'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., pp. 301–302, 502&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tumblety|first=Francis|title=Narrative of Dr. Tumblety |year=1872|publisher=Russells' American steam printing house|location=New York|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ4fAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was connected to the death of one of his patients in [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 611–616; Rumbelow, p. 265; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; but escaped prosecution.&lt;ref name=w&amp;r126/&gt;

In 1858 he returned to Rochester apparently a rich man, making an ostentatious display of his wealth and new social standing, and claiming that it had been achieved through patenting of his medicinal cures.&lt;ref name=C4&gt;'The Whitechapel Murders', 'Secret History, Season 4, Episode 2, (1996), Channel 4 Television, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal tax records show he was in Maryland in early 1863,&lt;ref&gt;IRS tax assessment list, District 4; Annual Lists, 1863 and Monthly Lists, Nov 1862-Apr 1864&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon moved to St. Louis, Missouri, living at 50 Olive Street.&lt;ref&gt;IRS tax assessment list, District 1 Special Lists; Jan-Aug 1865&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1865, he was arrested in St. Louis and taken to Washington on orders of the Secretary of War for alleged complicity in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]], because the police believed that he was an associate of [[David Herold]], who was captured with [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Tumblety denied any association with Herold, and there was nothing to tie him to the plot, so Tumblety was released without charge on May 30.&lt;ref name="Roscoe, Theodore 1959 pp. 301"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selected Records of the War Department Relating to Confederate Prisoners of War, 1861-1865, Roll M598_110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tumblety|first=Francis|title=Narrative of Dr. Tumblety |year=1872|publisher=Russells' American steam printing house|location=New York|pages=22–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ4fAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 he was arrested in [[New Orleans]] for [[pick pocket]]ing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Tumblety appeared to revel in denouncing all women, but reserved a special hatred for [[prostitution|prostitutes]]; he blamed his [[misogyny]] on a failed marriage to a prostitute.&lt;ref name=r265/&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.]], he displayed a collection of [[uterus]]es preserved in jars, which he kept in his study, to his guests at an all-male dinner party, and proudly boasted that they came from "every class of woman".&lt;ref name=r265/&gt;

==Jack the Ripper suspect==
Tumblety visited Europe several times, including Ireland, Scotland, England, Germany, and France. He claimed to have been introduced to [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William I, German Emperor|King William]] and to have provided treatment to [[Louis Napoleon]], for which he was awarded the [[Cross of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tumblety|first=Francis|title=Narrative of Dr. Tumblety |year=1872|publisher=Russells' American steam printing house|location=New York|pages=61–63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ4fAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one visit he became closely acquainted with writer [[Hall Caine]], with whom it has been suggested he had an affair.&lt;ref name=e&amp;s&gt;Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional police officers and amateur historical researchers Stewart Evans and Paul Gainey,&lt;ref name=C4/&gt;  detailed evidence in their 1996 book ''Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer'' that Tumblety was temporarily resident in a boarding house in the [[Whitechapel]] district during the brief period of the murder rampage of ''[[Jack the Ripper]]'', and pieced together a case that he may be the culprit.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Police]] arrested Tumblety on 7 November 1888 on unrelated charges of [[gross indecency]], apparently for having been caught engaging in a [[homosexual]] encounter, which was illegal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 621&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst awaiting trial on this charge on bail of £300 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|300|1888|r=-3}}}} today), and knowing that [[Scotland Yard]] was increasingly interested in him with regard to the recent murder spree in Whitechapel,&lt;ref name=C4/&gt; he fled England for [[France]] on 20 November under the false name of ''Frank Townsend'',&lt;ref name=w&amp;r126/&gt; and on 24 November 1888 he returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Ludington Record'', 20 December 1888&lt;/ref&gt; Already notorious in the United States for his self-promotion and previous brushes with the law, Tumblety's arrest in London was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as being connected to the Ripper murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Something About Dr. Tumblety.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1888/11/23/103184946.pdf|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 November 1888 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; American newspaper reports that Scotland Yard tried to [[extradition|extradite]] him have not been confirmed by research in the contemporary British press or the London police files.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 616&lt;/ref&gt; However, English police inspector [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] travelled to America, perhaps partly to trace Tumblety.&lt;ref name=w&amp;r126/&gt; The [[New York City Police]], who had him under surveillance, said "there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is under bond in London is not extraditable".&lt;ref&gt;Chief Inspector Byrnes quoted in Begg, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Tumblety published a self-aggrandising pamphlet titled ''Dr. Francis Tumblety – Sketch of the Life of the Gifted, Eccentric and World Famed Physician'', in which he attacked the rumours in the press but omitted any mention of his criminal charges and arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumblety was mentioned as a Ripper suspect by former Detective Chief Inspector [[John Littlechild]] of the Metropolitan Police in a letter to journalist and author [[George R. Sims]], dated 23 September 1913,&lt;ref name="MPS001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=e&amp;s/&gt; which was discovered by Evans and Gainey for sale in an antiquarian bookshop in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]].&lt;ref name=C4/&gt; Littlechild suspected Tumblety because of his extreme misogyny and his previous criminal record.&lt;ref name=r265/&gt;

Other [[Ripperologists]] have dismissed Tumblety as a plausible Ripper suspect, citing the fact that his appearance and age did not match the description of any of the men that were seen with the murder victims, and that his relatively tall height of at least {{convert|5|ft|10|in|m}} and enormous moustache would have made him particularly conspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 267; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; However, a contemporary interview describes Tumblety as having a much smaller moustache at the time of the Whitechapel murders than is seen in the well known photograph of him.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Stewart P. (August 2007) "[http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-slouch.html A Slouch-Hatted Yank]", ''Ripperologist'' No. 82, republished at Casebook: Jack the Ripper, retrieved 3 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
Tumblety returned to Rochester and moved in with an elderly female relative, whose house also served as his office.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 268; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He was living in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], during the 1900 census,&lt;ref&gt;US Census 1900, Supervisor's District III - 1st District, Md, enumerator district 20, sheet 14&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to St Louis, where he died in 1903 of heart disease.&lt;ref name=e&amp;s/&gt; His body was buried in the family plot in Rochester's [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (Rochester, New York)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=casebook/&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

The '''Hilaria''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɑː|ɹ|i|ə}}; [[Latin]] "the cheerful ones", a term derived from the borrowed adjective {{lang-grc|ἱλαρός}} "cheerful, merry") were [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religious festivals]] celebrated on the [[March equinox]] to honor [[Cybele]].

==Origins==
The term seems originally to have been a name which was given to any day or season of rejoicing. The ''hilaria'' were, therefore, according to [[Maximus the Confessor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Maximus the Confessor]], ''Schol. ad Dionys. Areopag. Epist.'' 8&lt;/ref&gt; either private or public. Among the former, he thinks it the day on which a person married, and on which a son was born; among the latter, those days of public rejoicings appointed by a new emperor. Such days were devoted to general rejoicings and public sacrifices, and no one was allowed to show any symptoms of grief or sorrow.

The Romans also celebrated ''hilaria'' as a ''[[feria]] stativa'', on March 25, the eighth day before the [[Calends]] of April, in honor of Cybele, the mother of the gods; and it is probably to distinguish these ''hilaria'' from those mentioned above, that the ''[[Augustan History]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History]]'', "The Life of Severus Alexander", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Severus_Alexander/2*.html#37.6 c37.6]&lt;/ref&gt; calls them '''Hilaria Matris Deûm'''. The day of its celebration was the first after the vernal equinox, or the first day of the year which was longer than the night. The winter with its gloom had died, and the first day of a better season was spent in rejoicings. The manner of its celebration during the time of the republic is unknown, except that [[Valerius Maximus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/2*.html#4.3 ii.4 §3]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions games in honour of the mother of the gods. Respecting its celebration at the time of the empire, [[Herodian]] writes that, among other things, there was a solemn procession, in which the statue of the goddess was carried, and before this statue were carried the most costly specimens of plate and works of art belonging either to wealthy Romans or to the emperors themselves. All kinds of games and amusements were allowed on this day; masquerades were the most prominent among them, and everyone might, in his disguise, imitate whomsoever he liked, and even magistrates.

The Romans took this feast originally from the Greeks, who called it [[Wikt:ἀνάβασις|Ἀνάβασις]], Latin ''Ascensus'': the eve of that day they spent in tears and lamentations, calling it ''[[Katabasis|Κατάβασις]]'' (Latin ''[[wikt:descensus|Dēscensus]]''). Greek writers later borrowed the Latin name as [[wikt:ἱλάρια|Ἱλάρια]], as appears from [[Photios I of Constantinople]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' in his [[codex]] of the life of the philosopher [[Isidore of Alexandria]].

==Festival structure==
The full festival can be tentatively reconstructed (with the days of the festival literally translated) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R Turcan. 1996. ''The Cults of the Roman Empire''. p44-47&lt;/ref&gt;

* 15 March. "The Reed Entered". Its exact significance is uncertain (the reeds may refer to the river bank where [[Attis]] was exposed as a child and rescued by [[Cybele]]). A nine-day period of abstinence from bread, pomegranates, quinces, pork, fish, and probably wine began. Only milk was permitted as a drink.&lt;ref&gt;R Turcan. 1996. ''The Cults of the Roman Empire''. p44.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 22 March. "The Tree Entered" (''Arbor intrat''). A pine tree from a wood sacred to Cybele is felled following the sacrifice of a ram at its roots. The tree was carried in procession through the city as if in a funeral to the Temple of Cybele on the [[Palatine Hill]].
* 23 March. A day of mourning.
* 24 March. "The Day of Blood" (''Sanguis''). Frenzied rites including [[scourging]] and whipping. [[Castration]] rituals would take place on this day. The tree is symbolically buried.
* 25 March. "The Day of Joy" (''Hilaria'') celebrating the resurrection of [[Attis]]. This was the ''hilaria'' proper (as opposed to the mournful tone of the previous days).
* 26 March. A day of rest.
* 27 March. "The Washing" (''Lavatio''). Added by [[Marcus Aurelius]].
* 28 March. Possible ceremony at the Vatican sanctuary. Appears in the [[Calendar of Philocalus]].

==Other==
According to the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] from 354, a Hilaria of Isis was part of the [[Isia (festival)|Isia]] festival, taking place on its final day, November 3.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, Michele (1990). ''On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity''. pp. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt;

==On this day==
[[Herodian]] details an assassination plot by Maternus against Emperor [[Commodus]] that was to occur on the hilaria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodian]], ''Roman History'' i.10.5-7&lt;/ref&gt; Maternus planned to disguise himself and his followers as members of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and proceed among the true members of the Guard, until they were close enough to kill Commodus. However, one of Maternus's followers revealed the plot ahead of time, betraying him because, according to Herodian, his men "preferred a legitimate emperor to a robber tyrant". On the day of hilaria, he was beheaded and his followers punished. The public celebrated the emperor's safety, and Commodus sacrificed to Cybele for protecting him from harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71565">{{DISPLAYTITLE:International response to ''Innocence of Muslims'' protests}}
Following the [[2012 diplomatic missions attacks]] that began on September 11, 2012, many nations and public officials released statements. Widespread early news coverage said that the protests were a spontaneous response to an online preview of ''[[Innocence of Muslims]],'' a movie considered offensive to Muslims. Later consideration of the Libya attack's complexity, of statements made by some Libyan officials, and of the potentially symbolic date (the anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]]) fueled speculation of preplanned efforts. U.S. missions in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]], were attacked during the first day of the protest.

==Egypt==
[[Prime Minister of Egypt|Egyptian Prime Minister]] [[Hisham Kandil]] condemned violence, saying: "What happened at the U.S. embassy in Cairo is regrettable and [is] rejected by all Egyptian people and cannot be justified, especially if we consider that the people that produced this low film have no relation to the U.S. government. We ask the American government to take a firm position towards this film's producers within the framework of international charters that criminalise acts that stir strife on the basis of race, color or religion."&lt;ref name="Reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/us-libya-usa-attack-idUSBRE88B0EI20120912|title=US ambassador to Libya killed in Benghazi attack|date=September 12, 2012|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian President]] [[Mohamed Morsi]] issued a statement 24 hours after the event, saying: "The presidency deplores the most vicious attempt to insult the person of Muhammad and condemns people who produced this extremist film"&lt;ref name="Morsi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release from the Presidency of the Republic|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=409673332421923&amp;set=a.377665218956068.90079.377633175625939&amp;type=1&amp;theater|language=Arabic |publisher=Presidency of Egypt|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked President Obama to "act against the film".&lt;ref name=WSJb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444023704577649262203487818|title=Morsi Calls for 'End' to Film, Pledges Safety for Embassies|author=Matthew Dalton|date=September 13, 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added that the President had instructed Egyptian Embassy in the U.S. to "take possible legal action to respond to those persons who seek to sabotage the relations and dialogue between peoples and nations."&lt;ref name="Morsi"/&gt;

The site Onislam, which is affiliated with [[Al Azhar]], issued a fatwa condemning the violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/international-relations-and-jihad/relations-during-peace/459005-attacking-us-embassies-for-prophet-film-illegal.html Attacking U.S. embassies for Prophet Film: Illegal? - Relations during Peace - counsels - OnIslam.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Al Azhar itself issued a fatwa condemning the violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/shariah/muhammad/misconceptions/459016-al-azhar-scholars-condemn-offensive-prophet-film.html "Al-Azhar Scholars Condemn Offensive Prophet Film", OnIslam.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial reactions of President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were received coldly in the US. Both American media, policy experts and President Obama contrasted the allegedly insufficient and "mild" Egyptian reaction with the Libyan reaction, which they praised.&lt;ref name="EgyptNotLibya"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/world/middleeast/egypt-not-libya-may-be-bigger-challenge-for-white-house.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp&amp;gwh=DE6E3649712E4FD5AF3CD4F8902893B4|title=Egypt May Be Bigger Concern Than Libya for White House|author=Helene Cooper|date=13 September 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BelatedResponse"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/opinion/the-belated-response-from-egypt.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;gwh=BE7D3C45CADADE7CD8E4698D301D3707|title=Belated Response From Egypt|date=13 September 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EgyptHears"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/world/middleeast/egypt-hearing-from-obama-moves-to-heal-rift-from-protests.html?pagewanted=1&amp;gwh=4F869D388BEBE8928CDFE8F6077E5937&amp;ref=middleeast|title=Egypt, Hearing From Obama, Moves to Heal Rift From Protests|publisher=New York Times|date=13 September 2012|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick|first2=Helene|last2=Cooper|first3=Mark|last3=Landler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryObama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/ad-lib/2012/sep/14/angry-president-obama-warns-morsi-and-egypt-protec/|title=An angry President Obama warns Morsi and Egypt to protect American Embassy or else|publisher=Washington Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin S. Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, criticized the "precious little" that Egyptian police did "the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo,"&lt;ref name="EgyptNotLibya" /&gt; while others criticized that the Morsi's 24-hour wait&lt;ref name="EgyptNotLibya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryObama" /&gt; before his allegedly "mild" initial rebuke of the embassy attack, which allegedly seemed to focus more on condemnation of film.&lt;ref name="EgyptNotLibya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BelatedResponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryObama" /&gt; In an interview, Obama remarked that though Egypt was not hostile, it was not "necessarily an ally,"&lt;ref name="EgyptNotLibya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryObama" /&gt; though the administration later backed off from this statement.&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt; In a late-night phone call, Obama warned Morsi that relations could be jeopardized if Egypt failed to protect diplomats.&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AngryObama" /&gt; Two days after, a particular Arabic release by the Brotherhood saying "Egyptians rise up to support Muhammad in front of the American Embassy.

Responding to this criticism, both Morsi and the Brotherhood took a much harder line against the embassy attacks, promising charges against those who scaled the embassy's walls, offering condolences for Stevens' death, and appearing on Egyptian television, telling Egyptians of their "religious duty to protect our guests and those who come to us from outside our nation ... I know that the people attacking the embassies do not represent any of us."&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt; Meanwhile, one Muslim Brotherhood spokesman defended its rhetoric, saying they balanced anger at the film with urging restraint, while its strategist, Khairat el-Shater wrote a letter to the NY Times, explaining that "Despite our resentment of the continued appearance of productions like the anti-Muslim film that led to the current violence, we do not hold the American government or its citizens responsible for acts of the few that abuse the laws protecting freedom of expression."&lt;ref name="EgyptHears" /&gt;

They clearly sent mixed messages to the world.

The editorial board of the ''[[Denver Post]]'' noted that Romney's critique of the embassy's statement was "out [of] line," but also stated: "This country cannot allow extremists anywhere to dictate what Americans speak, write, draw or film ... Sorry, provocative speech is not an abuse of free speech.

Salam al-Marayati, president of the Los Angeles-based [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]], said in a published statement that "America is our home and is home to Islam, like so many other religions.

The '''Italian Formula Three Championship''' was the [[Formula Three]] racing competition in [[Italy]].

==History==
Formula Three has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone for F1 hopefuls - it is typically the first point in a driver's career at which most drivers in the series are aiming at professional careers in racing rather than being amateurs and enthusiasts. Success in F3 can lead directly to more senior formulae such as GP2, A1 Grand Prix, or even a Formula One test or race seat.

Most notably in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Italian F3 championship produced drivers who graduated to [[Formula One]] to varying success. As of 2010, the last Italian Formula Three driver to graduate to [[Formula One]] was 1994 Italian F3 champion [[Giancarlo Fisichella]], who debuted with [[Minardi]]'s F1 team in {{F1|1996}}. Other champions include successful [[World Sportscar]] driver [[Max Angelelli]] (1992 series champion) and [[Riccardo Patrese]].

In December 2012, CSAI, the Italian Motorsport Federation announced it would cancel the Formula 3 championship &lt;ref name="cancelled"&gt;http://www.acisportitalia.it/F3/home/ita/2990/Nuove-strategie-FIA-e-ACI-CSAI-per-le-serie-Formula&lt;/ref&gt; to focus on [[Formula Abarth]].

The '''kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard''' occurred on June 10, 1991, south of [[South Lake Tahoe, California]]. Dugard, 11 years old, was abducted from a street while walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] accompanied by two girls on August 24 and 25 that year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in [[Concord, California]], on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman identified as Jaycee Dugard, 29 years old.

Phillip, 58, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54, of [[Antioch, California|Antioch]], were arrested by police for kidnapping, imprisonment, and sexual assault. On April 28, 2011, they pleaded guilty to Dugard's kidnapping and sexual assault. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was kept in concealed tents, sheds, and lean-tos in an area behind the Garridos' house in Antioch for 18 years. During such time, Dugard bore two daughters, 11 and 15 at the time of her reappearance. On June 2, 2011, Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; his wife, Nancy, received 36 years to life. Garrido is a person of interest in at least one other [[San Francisco Bay Area]] missing person case.

In 1979, Dugard's biological father Ken Slayton had an affair with Dugard's mother, Terry, that resulted in a pregnancy of which he was unaware; he had never met Dugard. Upon her resurfacing, Slayton sought a relationship with Dugard, but Dugard declined this. In 2010, the State of California awarded the Dugard family {{US$|20{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}. In 2011, Dugard wrote an autobiography titled ''A Stolen Life''. Her second book,  ''Freedom: My Book of Firsts'', was published in 2016. According to interviews, she remains single, focusing on herself, her children, and her family. Her exact location has not been told to the public.

In 1973, Garrido married high school classmate Christine Murphy, who said he was [[domestic violence|abusive]].

In 1976, Garrido kidnapped 25-year-old Katherine Callaway in [[South Lake Tahoe, California]]. He took her to a [[Reno, Nevada]] warehouse, where he [[rape]]d her for five and a half hours. When a police officer noticed a car parked outside the unit and then the broken lock on the warehouse door, he knocked on the door and was greeted by Garrido.

At Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegra{{snds}}the secondary arrestee in Dugard's kidnapping{{snds}} who was visiting another prisoner, her uncle. On October 5, 1981, he and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido was released from Leavenworth to [[Nevada State Prison]], where he served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in Contra Costa on August 26, 1988.&lt;ref name=KTVN /&gt; In Antioch, the Garridos lived in the home of his elderly mother, who suffered from [[dementia]].

== Abduction ==
In September 1990, Dugard and her family moved from the [[Los Angeles County]] city of [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], to [[Meyers, California|Meyers]],&lt;ref name=KCRAHearing&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kcra.com/news/21929319/detail.html |title = Garridos Have Brief Court Appearance |publisher = KCRA-TV |date = December 11, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120403030329/http://www.kcra.com/news/21929319/detail.html |archivedate = April 3, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because they thought it was a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was worrying about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990.&lt;ref name=homevideo&gt;{{cite news |url = http://abcnews.go.com/2020/TheLaw/jaycee-dugard-home-video-kidnap-survivor-speaks-time/story?id=10009310 |title = Jaycee Dugard: 'It's Been a Long Haul' |author = Alan B.

Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old&lt;ref name =homevideo /&gt; Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted in and out of consciousness during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;{{cite news |author = Jessica Hopper |title = Jaycee Dugard Interview: She Describes Giving Birth in Phillip Garrido's Backyard Prison |url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/jaycee_dugard/jaycee-dugard-interview-describes-giving-birth-phillip-garridos/story?id=14021938 |publisher = ABC News |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |date = July 7, 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160610100911/http://abcnews.go.com/US/jaycee_dugard/jaycee-dugard-interview-describes-giving-birth-phillip-garridos/story?id=14021938 |archivedate = June 10, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stolen life 7-11"&gt;{{cite book |author = Jaycee Dugard |title = A Stolen Life |pages = 7–11 |date = July 12, 2011 |publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn = 978-1-4516-2918-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of Dugard's disappearance, local and national media converged on South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, tens of thousands of fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community.&lt;ref name =ABCNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Sandra Chereb |title = South Lake Tahoe Celebrates Reappearance of Kidnapping Victim Jaycee Lee Dugard |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/30/AR2009083002660.html |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] |date = August 31, 2009 |agency = Associated Press |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160308113703/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/30/AR2009083002660.html |archivedate = March 8, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Kidnapping Victim Jaycee Dugard Held Captive for 18 Years |url = http://www.uhsecho.com/2011/05/kidnapping-victim-jaycee-dugard-held-captive-for-18-years/ |author = Echo Staff |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |newspaper = The Echo |location = [[Urbana, Illinois]] |date = May 4, 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160323174542/http://www.uhsecho.com/2011/05/kidnapping-victim-jaycee-dugard-held-captive-for-18-years/ |archivedate = March 23, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Probyn founded a group called Jaycee's Hope, which directed the volunteer and fundraising efforts. Cassette tapes of the song "Jaycee Lee" along with T-shirts, sweatshirts, and buttons were sold to raise money for poster materials, postage, printing, and related expenses. Child Quest International and the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] were involved in the effort. A reward was offered, which was noted on the posters and fliers. The kidnapping case attracted nationwide attention and was featured on the June 14, 1991 episode of the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = James M.

Immediately after he kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The first time he raped her, she was still in handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who sometimes brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost a month and a half after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the "demon angels" let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called "runs", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her while cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her listen for the voices he said he could hear from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of [[God]]. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.&lt;ref name = ABCNews /&gt;

Seven months into her captivity, Garrido introduced Dugard to his wife, Nancy, who brought the child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, who worked as a nursing home aide, as "evil" and "twisted." When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later "mysteriously vanish." When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced to tear out the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until years later.&lt;ref name=ABCNews /&gt; She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.&lt;ref name =homevideo /&gt;

=== Pregnancy and children ===
Thirty-four months into her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her handcuffs for periods of time, though they kept her locked in the bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, they gave her cooked food for the first time. They informed her that they believed that she was pregnant. Age 13 and four-and-a-half months pregnant, Dugard had learned of the link between sex and pregnancy from television. At this time, while Dugard was raising her baby, Angel, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenage Dugard.&lt;ref name =homevideo /&gt; Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care of her daughters using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures.&lt;ref name=ABCNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=KCRABirth&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kcra.com/news/22351413/detail.html |title = Judge Issues Birth Certificates For Dugard's Kids |publisher = KCRA TV |date = January 26, 2010 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050032/http://www.kcra.com/news/22351413/detail.html |archivedate = February 22, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WJLA&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.wjla.com/articles/2011/07/jaycee-dugard-recounts-horror-of-18-years-in-captivity-63386_page2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131030013109/http://www.wjla.com/articles/2011/07/jaycee-dugard-recounts-horror-of-18-years-in-captivity-63386_page2.html |archivedate = October 30, 2013 |title = Jaycee Dugard recounts horror of 18 years in captivity |author = Jennifer Donelan |date = July 8, 2011 |work = ABC News./[[WJLA-TV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChristianPost&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/jaycee-dugard-files-suit-says-govt-failed-to-monitor-garrido-56440/ |title = Jaycee Dugard Files Suit, Says Gov't Failed to Monitor Garrido |author = Stephanie Samuel |date = September 24, 2011 |work = [[The Christian Post]] |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722100054/http://www.christianpost.com/news/jaycee-dugard-files-suit-says-govt-failed-to-monitor-garrido-56440/ |archivedate = July 22, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbor Patrick McQuaid said that he recalls, as a child, meeting Dugard through a fence in the Garridos' yard soon after the kidnapping. He said that she had identified herself by the name "Jaycee" and that when he asked her if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point, Garrido came out and took her back indoors. He eventually built an eight-foot-tall fence around the backyard and set up a tent for Dugard, the first time that she was allowed to walk outside since her kidnapping.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web |url = http://images.salon.com/5things/2009/08/28/neighbor_talked_to_j/print.html |title = Neighbor talked to Jaycee Dugard through fence |work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate = May 16, 2012 }} {{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She coped with her continued captivity by planting flowers in a garden and home-schooling her daughters. At one point, Garrido informed Dugard that to pacify his wife, she and her daughters were to address Nancy as their mother, and that she was to teach her daughters that she was their older sister. When Dugard and her daughters were eventually allowed to come into contact with other people, they continued this fiction.&lt;ref name=ABCNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph9.2.09&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6127898/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-daughters-thought-she-was-their-sister.html |author = Nick Allen |title = Jaycee Lee Dugard: daughters thought she was their sister |newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date = September 2, 2009 |location = London |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129025240/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6127898/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-daughters-thought-she-was-their-sister.html |archivedate = January 29, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrido operated a print shop where Dugard acted as the graphic artist. Ben Daughdrill, a customer of Garrido's printing business, claimed that he met and spoke by telephone with Dugard and that she did excellent work. During this time, Dugard had access to the business phone and an email account. Another customer indicated that she never hinted to him about her childhood abduction or her true identity.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/us/29abduct.html |title = Kidnapping Victim Was Not Always Locked Away |newspaper = The New York Times |date = August 28, 2009 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |author = Jessie McKinley |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113214029/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/us/29abduct.html |archivedate = November 13, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrido kept a blog associated with what he called "God's Desire Church." In the blog, he claimed that he had the power to control sound with his mind. Garrido asked several people, including customers, to sign testimonials confirming that they witnessed his ability to "control sound with my mind" and a device he developed "for others to witness this {{sic|phen|omena}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Mallory Simon |title = Alleged kidnapper couple met while man was in prison |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/08/28/california.missing.girl.blog/index.html |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |newspaper = [[CNN]] |date = August 29, 2009 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307132059/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/08/28/california.missing.girl.blog/index.html |archivedate = March 7, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = John Simerman |author2 = Leah Creighton |title = Sex captor Phillip Garrido's backyard cell for Jaycee Dugard |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sex-captor-phillip-garridos-backyard-cell-for-jaycee-dugard/story-e6freuy9-1225767517983 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Telegraph]] |date = August 30, 2009 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160726161458/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sex-captor-phillip-garridos-backyard-cell-for-jaycee-dugard/story-e6freuy9-1225767517983 |archivedate = July 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement officers believe that in 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was [[soundproofing|soundproofed]] and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs),&lt;ref name=ABCNews /&gt; two homemade tents, and what has been described as a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a {{Convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|sp=us}} high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a [[tarpaulin]]. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords.&lt;ref name=CNNAugust2009&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-27/justice/california.kidnap.shed_1_sheds-phillip-and-nancy-garrido-tarps?_s=PM:CRIME |title = Girl grew up locked away in backyard sheds |author = Mallory Simon |date = August 27, 2009 |work = [[CNN]] |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101121103916/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-27/justice/california.kidnap.shed_1_sheds-phillip-and-nancy-garrido-tarps?_s=PM:CRIME |archivedate = November 21, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard,&lt;ref name=ABCNews8.28.09&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8431843 |author1 = Sarah Netter |author2 = Sabina Ghebremedhin |title = Cops Apologize for Muffing Chance to Rescue Jaycee Dugard in 2006 |publisher = ABC News |date = August 28, 2009 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160413161648/http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8431843 |archivedate = April 13, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Larry J.

=== Missed rescue opportunities ===
* Police failed to make the connection that Jaycee Lee Dugard was kidnapped south of South Lake Tahoe, the same location as Garrido's 1976 kidnapping and rape of Katherine Callaway Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/dont-worry-ive-got-it-all-planned-garrido-told-victim-20090902-f7sn.html |title = Don't worry, I've got it all planned, Garrido told victim |author = MCT |date = September 2, 2009 |work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911193240/http://www.smh.com.au/world/dont-worry-ive-got-it-all-planned-garrido-told-victim-20090902-f7sn.html |archivedate = September 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 22, 1992, less than a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller reported that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/05/MNS11A1JEG.DTL |author = Demian Bulwa |title = 91 Tipster Told Of Girl Like Dugard In Oakley: The Jaycee Dugard Case Garridos Lived Less Than 2 Miles From Call's Source |newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = October 6, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100106112951/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F10%2F05%2FMNS11A1JEG.DTL |archivedate = January 6, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = A Stolen Life |author = Jaycee Dugard |date = July 12, 2011 |pages = 101–106 |isbn = 978-1-4516-2918-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2002, the fire department responded to a report of a juvenile with a shoulder injury that occurred in a swimming pool at the Garridos' home. This information was not relayed to the parole office, which had no record of either a juvenile or a swimming pool at the Garridos' address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Shattered Innocence |author = Robert Scott |publisher = Pinnacle |year = 2011 |page = 316 |isbn = 978-0-7860-2411-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, one of Garrido's neighbors called [[9-1-1]] to inform them that there were tents in the backyard with children living there and that Garrido was "[[psychosis|psychotic]]" with [[sexual addiction]]s. A deputy sheriff spoke with him at the front of the house for about 30 minutes and left after telling him that there would be a code violation if people were living outside on the property. After Dugard was found in August 2009, the local Contra Costa County Sheriff, Warren E. Rupf issued an apology to the victims in a news conference.&lt;ref name=ABCNews8.28.09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/missing-girl-could-have-been-found-in-2006-1778997.html |author = Guy Adams |title = Missing Girl Could Have Been Found In 2006: As Phillip Garrido Appears In Court Over Jaycee Lee Dugard's Abduction, Police Admit They Did Not Properly Follow Up A 911 Call Three Years Ago At His Property |newspaper = [[The Independent]] |date = August 28, 2009 |location = London |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060355/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/missing-girl-could-have-been-found-in-2006-1778997.html |archivedate = March 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 4, 2009, the California Office of the Inspector General issued a report that enumerated lapses by the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] that had contributed to Dugard's continued captivity. The central finding was that Garrido was incorrectly classified as needing only low-level supervision; all other lapses derived from that mistake. In his report, the inspector general detailed an instance in which a parole agent encountered a 12-year-old girl at the home but accepted Garrido's explanation that "she was his brother's daughter and [the agent] did nothing to verify it," despite the fact that a call to Garrido's brother verified that he did not have children.&lt;ref name=CDCRReport&gt;* {{cite web |url = http://www.calcasa.org/2009/11/special-report-cdcrs-supervison-of-parolee-phillip-garrido/ |title = Special Report: CDCR's Supervision of Parolee Phillip Garrido |author = Tammy Strobel |date = November 5, 2009 |work = [[California Coalition Against Sexual Assault]] |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129025239/http://www.calcasa.org/2009/11/special-report-cdcrs-supervison-of-parolee-phillip-garrido/ |archivedate = January 29, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}

On August 24, 2009, Garrido visited the [[San Francisco]] office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and left a four-page essay containing his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information could be used to assist in curing other [[sexual predator]]s by: "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Mike Von Fremd |author2 = Kate Snow |author3 = Stephen Splane |date = August 30, 2009 |url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/Weekend/story?id=8447788#.UFFQ4RhhKR8 |title = Dugard Kidnapping Suspect Told FBI He'd Cured Himself |work = ABC News |accessdate = June 3, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074653/http://abcnews.go.com/US/Weekend/story?id=8447788#.UFFQ4RhhKR8 |archivedate = March 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, he went to a [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[University of California Police Department|police office]] with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his "God's Desire" program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as "erratic" and that the girls were "sullen and submissive." She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00{{nbsp}}p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.&lt;ref name=CDCRReport /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite news |url = http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/08/28_ucpd.shtml |title = Arrest of kidnap suspect Phillip Garrido hinged on instincts and diligence of two members of UC Berkeley police force |author = Cathy Cockrell |date = August 28, 2009 |work = UC Berkeley News |accessdate = June 12, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160418032823/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/08/28_ucpd.shtml |archive-date = April 18, 2016 }}

After hearing Jacobs' recorded message, two parole agents drove to the Garridos' house later that day. Upon arrival, they handcuffed him and searched the house, finding only his wife Nancy and his elderly mother at home. Then the parole agents drove him back to the parole office. En route, he said that the girls who had accompanied him to UC Berkeley "were the daughters of a relative, and he had permission from their parents to take them to the university." Although a month before the parole office had barred Garrido from being around minors, and although Berkeley was {{convert|40|mi}} from the Garridos' Contra Costa residence, {{convert|15|mi}} in excess of the {{convert|25|mi}} limit he was allowed to travel from his home without permission from his parole agent, the agents overlooked this violation. After reviewing his file with a supervisor, they drove him home and ordered him to report to the office again the next day to discuss further his visit to UC Berkeley, and to follow up on their concerns about the two girls.&lt;ref name=CDCRReport /&gt;

Garrido arrived at the parole office in Concord, California on August 26 with his wife Nancy, the two girls, and Dugard, who was introduced as "Allissa".&lt;ref&gt;While some sources give the spelling of the name as "Alyssa", others such as the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6111929/How-Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-became-Allissa-the-the-girl-with-a-smile-for-her-captors-clients.html August 29, 2009 ''Daily Telegraph''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809113450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6111929/How-Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-became-Allissa-the-the-girl-with-a-smile-for-her-captors-clients.html |date=August 9, 2016 }} story and [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210113/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-kidnapper-linked-murders-prostitutes-girl-15.html this September 1, 2009 ''Daily Mail'' story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522015027/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210113/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-kidnapper-linked-murders-prostitutes-girl-15.html |date=May 22, 2012 }} give it as "Allissa". Dugard herself states on page 151 of her memoir, "After a couple of days of thinking, I decide on my new name and tell Garrido and Nancy my choice. I say I want to be called Allissa.

Maintaining her false identity as "Allissa", Dugard told investigators that the girls were her daughters. Although she indicated that she was aware that Garrido was a convicted sex offender, she stated that he was a "changed man", a "great person" and was "good with her kids",&lt;ref name=LostAndFound /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph10.5.09&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6509828/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-showed-signs-of-Stockholm-syndrome.html |author = Nick Allen |title = Jaycee Lee Dugard showed signs of Stockholm syndrome |newspaper = The Telegraph |date = October 5, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160323020026/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6509828/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-showed-signs-of-Stockholm-syndrome.html |archivedate = March 23, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; comments that were echoed by the two girls. When pressed for details that would confirm her identity, Dugard became "extremely defensive" and "agitated",
demanding to know why she was being "interrogated", and subsequently stated that she was a battered wife from Minnesota in hiding from her abusive husband. The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of [[Stockholm syndrome]].&lt;ref name=LostAndFound /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph10.5.09 /&gt; In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: "The phrase [Stockholm Syndrome] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that it makes me want to throw up. ... I adapted to survive my circumstance." said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.&lt;ref&gt;Jaycee Dugard Part 2: Why She Wants to Change How People View Victims, ABC News, Youtube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrido and his wife were placed under arrest. An FBI [[Special agent (United States)|Special Agent]] put Dugard on the telephone with her mother, Terry Probyn. Dugard retained custody of her children and was soon reunited with her mother.&lt;ref name=cop&gt;* {{cite web |url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=8437707 |author = Arash Ghadishah |title = EXCLUSIVE: Meet Cop Who Helped Nail Alleged Dugard Kidnapper |publisher = ABC News |date = August 28, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160610101558/http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=8437707 |archivedate = June 10, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}

{{Further|A Stolen Life (memoir)}}
Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, and a former business associate of the Garridos, Cheyvonne Molino, have commented that Dugard's children looked healthy. Tina Dugard said that upon her meeting them after their escape, they "always appeared and behaved like normal kids". Molino said of the times that she met them while they were captive "that in her presence the girls never acted robotically" and didn't wear unusual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ocregister.com/news/jaycee-143194-dugard-tina.html |author = Greg Hardesty |title = Exclusive video: Interview with Jaycee's aunt |newspaper = [[Orange County Register]] |date = August 21, 2013 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160611151449/http://www.ocregister.com/news/jaycee-143194-dugard-tina.html |archivedate = June 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/01/crimesider/entry5279423.shtml |author = Ryan Smith |title = Controversy: Jaycee Dugard Daughter's Photos |work = Crimesider |publisher = CBS News |date = September 1, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100218165016/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/01/crimesider/entry5279423.shtml |archivedate = February 18, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/31/earlyshow/main5276887.shtml |title = Jaycee's Stepdad: Her New Life "Like Mars" |author = CBS News staff |publisher = CBS News |date = August 31, 2009 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029233617/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/31/earlyshow/main5276887.shtml |archivedate = October 29, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Jaycee-Dugard-And-Children-Cried-When-Phillip-Garrido-Was-Arrested-Says-Ms-Dugards-Stepfather/Article/200908415371513 |author = Greg Milam |title = Jaycee and Kids 'Cried at Kidnapper's Arrest' |publisher = [[Sky News]] |date = September 1, 2009 |accessdate = October 12, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903092704/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Jaycee-Dugard-And-Children-Cried-When-Phillip-Garrido-Was-Arrested-Says-Ms-Dugards-Stepfather/Article/200908415371513 |archivedate = September 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/03/california.missing.girl/index.html |title = Jaycee Dugard's aunt: 'This is a joyful time' |publisher = CNN |date = September 3, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004053/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/03/california.missing.girl/index.html |archivedate = March 5, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernie Allen, president of the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there is hope even in long-term cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.eastbaytimes.com/news/ci_13224075 |title = Discovery of Jaycee Dugard brightens hopes for parents of other missing children |author = Sophia Kazmi |date = August 28, 2009 |publisher = [[Contra Costa Times]] |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160812070905/http://www.eastbaytimes.com/news/ci_13224075 |archivedate = August 12, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable abduction survivor [[Elizabeth Smart]] has stressed the importance of focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/27/360-interview-ed-smart-and-his-daughter-elizabeth/ |title = 360 Interview: Elizabeth Smart and her father, Ed |author = [[Anderson Cooper]] |work = [[Anderson Cooper 360°]] |date = August 27, 2009 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160713202244/http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/27/360-interview-ed-smart-and-his-daughter-elizabeth/ |archivedate = July 13, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNGandossy&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/08/27/california.missing.girl/ |title = Sheriff: Kidnap victim, children kept in backyard compound |author = Taylor Gandossy |author2 = Tom Watkins |author3 = Stan Wilson |date = August 28, 2009 |publisher = CNN |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224341/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/08/27/california.missing.girl/ |archivedate = March 3, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20301153,00.html |author = Eunice Oh |title = Elizabeth Smart's Advice to Jaycee Dugard: Move Forward in Life |newspaper = [[People (magazine)|People]] |date = August 28, 2009 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160709213837/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20301153,00.html |archivedate = July 9, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shawn Hornbeck]], another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world.

=== Police investigations ===
Following the arrest, police searched the Garrido house extensively for evidence of other crimes. Because Garrido had access to his neighbor's house, it was also searched for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6116417/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-Death-dogs-search-Philip-Garridos-home-for-missing-girls.html |author = Nick Allen |title = Jaycee Lee Dugard: 'Death dogs' search Phillip Garrido's home for missing girls |newspaper = The Telegraph |date = August 31, 2009 |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |location = London |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160809103142/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/jaycee-lee-dugard/6116417/Jaycee-Lee-Dugard-Death-dogs-search-Philip-Garridos-home-for-missing-girls.html |archivedate = August 9, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8451296 |author = Sarah Netter |author2 = Mike Von Fremd |author3 = Ronna Waldman |author4 = Ariane Nalty |title = Garrido Investigators Unearth Bone Fragments |publisher = ABC News |date = August 31, 2009 |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160610103412/http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8451296 |archivedate = June 10, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also searched the homes and business of one of Garrido's printing business clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/10/crimesider/entry5300871.shtml |author = Neil Katz |title = Jaycee Dugard Investigation Turns to Phillip Garrido's Associates |work = Crimesider |publisher = CBS News |date = September 10, 2009 |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100109224357/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/10/crimesider/entry5300871.shtml |archivedate = January 9, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police agencies from [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] and [[Dublin, California]], conducted searches of the Garridos' property for evidence pertaining to missing girls from those communities but turned up no clues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/16/california.kidnapping/index.html?eref=ib_us |title = Police: Bones found on Garrido property |work = CNN |date = September 16, 2009 |accessdate = June 9, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160808151127/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/16/california.kidnapping/index.html?eref=ib_us |archivedate = August 8, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Hayward police announced that Garrido has not been eliminated as a suspect and is still a person of interest in the abduction case of [[Michaela Garecht]].

=== Garrido's statements ===
On August 27, 2009, [[KCRA-TV]] in [[Sacramento]], [[California]] interviewed Garrido in his jail cell by telephone. During the interview, Garrido said, "In the end, this is going to be a powerful, heartwarming story"&lt;ref name=kcra&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kcra.com/news/20591281/detail.html |title = Kidnap Suspect: 'Wait Until You Hear The Story' |publisher = KCRA-TV |date = August 27, 2009 |accessdate = September 1, 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091223035518/http://www.kcra.com/news/20591281/detail.html |archivedate = December 23, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; because, in his version of events:

{{quote|My life has been straightened out. ... Wait till you hear the story of what took place at this house. You're going to be absolutely impressed. It's a disgusting thing that took place with me at the beginning, but I turned my life completely around.&lt;ref name=kcra /&gt;}}

[[File:garritobackyard1.jpg|thumb|Investigators at the Garridos' Contra Costa home]]
Garrido repeatedly told the reporter how he "filed documents" with the [[FBI]] on August 24, 2009, which, when they were published, would cause people to "fall over backwards", and that he could not reveal more because he "had to protect law enforcement", and "what happened" ... was "something that humans have not understood well". In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and: "they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them." On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details.&lt;ref name=kcra /&gt; The document, titled ''Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed'', was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Phillip Garrido |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/19208889/Garrido-Spiritual-Manifesto |title = Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed |publisher = Grove Publishing |date = &lt;!-- none --&gt; |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |subscription = yes |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306082419/https://www.scribd.com/doc/19208889/garrido-spiritual-manifesto |archivedate = March 6, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal proceedings ===
On August 28, 2009, Garrido and his wife pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping, rape, and [[false imprisonment]]. The case was prosecuted in El Dorado County, by elected District Attorney Vern R. Pierson and Assistant District Attorney James A Clinchard. A bail review/pre-preliminary hearing was held September 14, 2009, at the El Dorado County Superior Court in [[Placerville, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://garrido.eldoradocourt.org/ |title = People of the State of California v.

This hearing occurred on December 11, 2009. Katie Callaway Hall, whom Garrido kidnapped and raped in 1976, appeared in the courtroom at the October and December hearings. She did not speak during either proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/29/california.kidnapping/ |title = Garridos in court for hearing as 1976 rape victim watches |publisher = CNN |date = October 30, 2009 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213943/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/29/california.kidnapping/ |archivedate = March 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KCRAHearing /&gt;

On November 5, 2009, Phimister ordered Nancy's defense attorney, Gilbert Maines, to be removed from the case. According to a posting on the court's website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://garrido.eldoradocourt.org/docs/nancy/20091105-MinOrd-ConfEvid.pdf |title = Minute Order |publisher = Superior Court of California, El Dorado County |date = November 9, 2009 |accessdate = November 15, 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726021813/http://garrido.eldoradocourt.org/docs/nancy/20091105-MinOrd-ConfEvid.pdf |archivedate = July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision occurred in review of "confidential evidence" that has not been disclosed to the public, and details of the proceedings were kept sealed.

At a press conference on February 28, 2011, Tapson said that Nancy and Phillip Garrido had both made a 'full confession' in the case. The development came as lawyers for both sides re-opened discussions on a possible plea deal that had the potential to obviate the need for a trial. Nancy's attorney acknowledged that she was facing "241 years, eight months to life" and that he was working for a reduced sentence in the 30-year range. He stated that the prosecutor had acknowledged that Phillip was a master manipulator and that Nancy was under both his influence and that of substances during the period of Dugard's kidnapping, so should receive some consideration while alluding to parallels with kidnap victim [[Patty Hearst]] and to Stockholm syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ktvu.com/news/27029177/detail.html?cxntlid=cmg_cntnt_rss |title = Garridos Confess To Dugard Kidnapping |publisher = [[KTVU]] |date = February 28, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110301174051/http://www.ktvu.com/news/27029177/detail.html?cxntlid=cmg_cntnt_rss |archive-date = March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, April 7, 2011, instead of pleading guilty, as had been expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-07-dugard-trial_N.htm |title = Challenge of grand jury stops expected Garrido guilty plea |editor = Brent Jones |newspaper = [[USA Today]] |agency = Associated Press |date = April 7, 2011 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110411210425/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-07-dugard-trial_n.htm |archivedate = April 11, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlement with the State of California ===
In July 2010, the State of California approved a US $20{{nbsp}}million settlement with Jaycee Dugard to compensate her for: "various lapses by the Corrections Department [that contributed to] Dugard's continued captivity, ongoing sexual assault and mental and/or physical abuse." The settlement, part of [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_1701-1750/ab_1714_cfa_20100701_112156_asm_floor.html AB1714], was approved by the [[California State Assembly]] by a 70 to 2 vote, and by the [[California State Senate]] by a 30 to 1 vote. [[San Francisco County Superior Court]] Judge Daniel Weinstein, who mediated the settlement, stated that the settlement was reached to avoid a lawsuit, which would be a: "greater invasion of privacy and greater publicity for the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/02/local/la-me-0702-dugard-settlement-20100702 |title = Jaycee Lee Dugard's family will receive $20 million from California |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = July 2, 2010 |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |author = Maria L.

=== Lawsuit against the United States ===
On September 22, 2011, Dugard filed suit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|US District Court for the Northern District of California]] accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip when he was a federal parolee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/23/us-crime-dugard-lawsuit-idUSTRE78M03G20110923 |author = Emmet Berg |title = Jaycee Dugard sues U.S. over monitoring of her captor |publisher = Reuters |date = September 22, 2011 |accessdate = June 11, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155343/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/23/us-crime-dugard-lawsuit-idUSTRE78M03G20110923 |archivedate = September 24, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal government that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido at the time he was placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.readingeagle.com/ap/article/court-rejects-lawsuit-by-kidnapping-survivor-jaycee-dugard |title = Court rejects lawsuit by kidnapping survivor Jaycee Dugard |author = Sudhin Tranawala |date = March 15, 2016 |agency = Associated Press |via = Reading Eagle |accessdate = June 14, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160411031920/http://www.readingeagle.com/ap/article/court-rejects-lawsuit-by-kidnapping-survivor-jaycee-dugard |archivedate = April 11, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed Dugard's civil claims under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] (FTCA). In a 2-1 decision authored by Judge [[John B. Owens]], the court ruled that the federal government's [[sovereign immunity]] was not waived because the U.S. is only liable "in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances" under state law. In this case, because the U.S. would not be liable under California law, Dugard could not prevail on her FTCA claim. Chief District Court Judge William Smith again dissented, stating that he believed that the majority misinterpreted California law, as the cases cited by the majority only involved FTCA liability in rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Jaycee Dugard v.

'''''Le Journal Hebdomadaire''''' (French for '''''The Weekly Journal'''''; often shortened to '''''Le Journal Hebdo''''') was a [[French-language]], [[Morocco|Moroccan]] weekly [[magazine]], published between 1997 and 2010.&lt;ref name="liberation"&gt;Sylvain Mouillard, [http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101617009-au-maroc-le-journal-hebdomadaire-jette-l-eponge Au Maroc, le «Journal hebdomadaire» jette l'éponge], [[Libération]], 2 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was cofounded by [[Aboubakr Jamaï]], who also co-founded its [[Arabic-language]] counterpart, ''[[Assahifa Al Ousbouia]]''.

==Background==
An MBA by training, at age 29 Jamaï moved from finance into financial journalism, helping to found the [[Casablanca]]-based ''Le Journal''. The magazine was first published on 17 November 1997.&lt;ref name="ParkBoum2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas K. Park|author2=Aomar Boum|title=Historical Dictionary of Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KiCl5-MxMMC&amp;pg=PA243|date=16 January 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6511-2|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a model, the paper's creators used the Spanish paper ''[[El País]]'' because of the way it had started as a weekly paper under [[Francisco Franco]]'s rule before growing into a media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=WAN/&gt;

The journal's circulation was initially small, with the first issue selling only 3,000 copies, primarily to a business audience. However, the journal soon grew by word-of-mouth, attracting a non-business audience and attracting more advertisers.&lt;ref name=CPJ2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/Briefings/2002/DA_fall_2002/Dangerous.pdf|title=The Business of Journalism|author=Hani Sabra|date=Fall–Winter 2002|publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Jamaï co-founded an Arabic-language sister publication, ''[[Assahifa al-Ousbouiya]]'', designed to appeal to a broader audience.&lt;ref name=YWS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/worldfellows/fellows/jamai.html |title=Aboubakr Jamaï|year=2008|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Mohammed VI government==
On 23 July 1999, Hassan II died, and his son [[Mohammed VI]] succeeded him to the throne, raising hopes for democratic reform. ''Le Journal'' soon became critical of Mohamed's reign, however, particularly his slowness in transforming Morocco into a [[constitutional democracy]].&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016fa_fact_kramer|title=The Crusader |author=Jane Kramer|date=16 October 2006|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the critical editorials printed by the paper, Moroccan printers soon refused to do business with it, forcing Jamaï to print in France and pay enormous transportation costs.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

In April 2000, ''Le Journal'' "crossed a political redline" by printing an interview with [[Mohamed Abdelaziz (Sahrawi politician)|Muhammad Abdelaziz]], leader of the [[Saharawi people|Saharawi]] separatist movement [[Polisario Front]] that was fighting for the independence of [[Western Sahara]] from Morocco.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; The Moroccan Ministry of Communications responded by banning both ''Le Journal'' and ''Assahifa Al Ousbouia'', though the latter had not run the interview in question. A Ministry spokesperson stated that the reasons for the papers' banning were "excesses in [their] editorial line concerning the question of Morocco’s territorial integrity" and "collusion with foreign interests".&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt; However, following an outcry from foreign governments and NGOs, the papers were allowed to re-open.&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt;

The conflict with the government won Jamaï's papers publicity and popular credibility, and advertising revenues increased substantially for the following months. In November, however, the paper reprinted a letter implicating that a number of socialist politicians, including then-Prime Minister [[Abderrahmane Youssoufi]], had participated in a 1972 plot to assassinate Hassan II.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; The papers were again banned. At the January 2001 Congress of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] in Casablanca, Jamaï took the podium to announce to the applause of the delegates that he would go on a [[hunger strike]] until his papers were unbanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1111106.stm|title=Moroccan editor on hunger strike|date=11 January 2001|work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following another round of international protest—including a question about the banning from [[German Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schroeder]] on the occasion of Youssoufi's state visit to Germany—the government relented, and the papers were once more allowed to print.&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt;

In 2006, in its reporting on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]—in which a Danish newspaper published several cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], triggering widespread anger in the Muslim world--''Le Journal'' published a blacked-out version of one of the cartoons. The newspaper's offices were then the target of a series of protests, which Jamaï alleges were orchestrated by the national government.&lt;ref name=TIME/&gt;

==Binaissa defamation suit==
At the time of the papers' first banning in April 2000, Foreign Minister [[Mohamed Benaissa]] filed a [[defamation]] lawsuit against Jamaï and Ali Amar, another editor of ''Le Journal'', for a 1999 series of articles alleging that the minister had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; Jamaï later speculated that Benaissa "was waiting for a signal" to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of the ban.&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt; In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages of 2 million [[dirham]]s (US$200,000). In addition, Jamaï was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and Amar to two months.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] immediately called for the Moroccan Justice Minister to overturn the verdict, asserting that "Fines should not be used by the authorities with the aim of halting the appearance or publication of a media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1197479.stm|title=Morocco editors jailed|date=2 March 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lawsuits followed, and by 2006, Jamaï's debts amounted to more than US$1.5 million in fines, damages, and back taxes.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; In 2002, ''Le Journal'''s staff was told by a number of companies that had formerly advertised in the paper that they had been pressured by the government no longer to do so. Jamaï speculated to an interviewer that having realized that they could not shut the paper down directly without international pressure, the government was now seeking to bankrupt it.&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt;

In 2006, Jamaï lost another libel suit, this time to Claude Moniquet, director of the [[Brussels]] think-tank, the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center; Jamaï had described a report of his on the Polisario Front as "tele-guided by the royal palace", and was ordered to pay a US$360,000 fine.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; The [[press freedom]] watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF) described the trial as "politically motivated and unfair", and said that it could prove a "fatal blow" to the weekly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.rsf.org/maroc-mise-a-mort-du-journal-23-12-2006,20238.html Mise à mort du Journal Hebdomadaire : une semaine pour payer trois millions de dirhams de dommages et intérêts], [[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters sans frontières]], 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A cousin of Mohammad's, Prince [[Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah]], offered to settle Jamaï's legal debts, but Jamaï refused, saying that he would "prefer to force the regime to let the press alone or be exposed for silencing it".&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1194000,00.html|title=Aboubakr Jamai: Journalist|author=Scott Macleod |date=14 May 2006|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaï then resigned from his papers and traveled to the US, working as a professor at the [[University of San Diego]] for three years. He returned to Morocco in 2009.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

Faced with growing debts and an advertising boycott, ''Le Journal'' went out of business in 2010.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/middleeast/28iht-M28C-MOROCCO-MEDIA.html|title=Web Offers a Voice to Journalists in Morocco|author=Aida Alami|date=28 April 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2010, bailiffs arrived with a court order that the paper must cease publication. Jamaï announced to a crowd outside the office that he was leaving journalism, because "serious journalism has become impossible in Morocco today".&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/02/morocco-draft-pioneer-of-independent-press-shut-over-debts-amid-censorship-suspicions-1.html|title=Morocco: Pioneer of independent press silenced amid censorship worries|date=16 February 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, he would go on to found the news website  [[Lakome.com]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2003, The Committee to Protect Journalists presented Jamaï its International Press Freedom Award, "an annual recognition of courageous journalism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/|title=CPJ International Press Freedom Awards 2011|year=2011 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work with ''Le Journal''.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/2003/jamai.php |title=Morocco: Aboubakr Jamai |year=2003|publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[World Association of Newspapers]] awarded him its Gebran Tueni Prize, established in honor of the assassinated Lebanese editor and press freedom advocate [[Gebran Tueni|of the same name]].&lt;ref name=WAN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wan-ifra.org/articles/2011/07/07/the-irresolvable-dilemma-of-the-newspaper-publisher|title=The irresolvable dilemma of the newspaper publisher|author=Andrew Heslop|date=7 July 2011|publisher=[[World Association of Newspapers]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confederate Reunion Parade Richmond.jpg|thumb|300px|[[George Washington Custis Lee]] (1832–1913) on horseback in front of the [[Monument Avenue|Jefferson Davis Monument]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on June 3, 1907, reviewing the Confederate Reunion Parade]]
The '''Lost Cause of the Confederacy''', or simply the '''Lost Cause''', is an [[History of the United States|American]] [[Historical negationism|historical negationist]] ideology that holds that, despite losing the [[American Civil War]], the cause of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] was a just and heroic one. The ideology endorses the supposed virtues of the [[Antebellum South|antebellum South]], viewing the war as a struggle primarily for the [[Southern United States|Southern]] way of life&lt;ref name="Gallagher 2000 p. 1"&gt;Gallagher (2000) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or [[States' rights|"states' rights"]] in the face of overwhelming [[Names of the American Civil War#War of Northern/Yankee Aggression|"Northern aggression"]]. At the same time, the Lost Cause minimizes or denies outright the central role of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the outbreak of the war.

Lost Cause ideology emerged in the [[Reconstruction era|decades after the war]] among former Confederate generals and politicians, as well as organizations like the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. Particularly intense periods of Lost Cause activity came around the time of [[World War I]], as the last Confederate veterans began to die and a push was made to preserve their memories, and during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, in [[Reactionary|reaction]] to growing public support for [[racial equality]]. Through activities such as building prominent [[List of Confederate monuments and memorials|Confederate monuments]] and writing school history [[textbook]]s, they sought to ensure future generations of Southern [[White Americans|whites]] would know of the South's "true" reasons for fighting the war and therefore continue to support [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] policies, such as [[Jim Crow]].

Though it synthesizes numerous ideas, proponents of the Lost Cause primarily argued that slavery was not the [[Origins of the American Civil War|main cause]] of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Aaron |editor-last=Sheehan-Dean |title=A Companion to the U.S. Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bfQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT837|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|page=837|isbn=9781118802953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach this conclusion, they directly ignored the declarations of secession by the seceding states, the declarations of congressmen who left Congress to join the Confederacy, and the treatment of slavery in the [[Confederate States Constitution#Slavery|Confederate constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Supporters often stressed the idea of [[secession]] as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and said that the threat violated the [[states' rights]] guaranteed by the Constitution. They believed any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more adherent to [[Christian values]] than the allegedly greedy North. It portrayed slavery as more benevolent than cruel, alleging that it taught [[Christianity]] and "civilization". Stories of happy slaves were often used as propaganda in an effort to defend slavery. These stories would be used to explain slavery to Northerners. Many times they also portrayed slave owners being kind to their slaves. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause said that the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the Yankee industrial machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

Critics of the ideology have stated that [[white supremacy]] is a key characteristic of the Lost Cause narrative.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=David W.

Proponents of the Lost Cause movement also condemned the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] that followed the Civil War, claiming that it had been a deliberate attempt by Northern politicians and speculators to destroy the traditional [[Southern culture|Southern]] way of life. In recent decades Lost Cause themes have been widely promoted by the [[Neo-Confederate]] movement in books and op-eds, and especially in one of the movement's magazines, the ''[[Southern Partisan]]''. The Lost Cause theme has been a major element in defining gender roles in the white South, in terms of honor, tradition, and family roles.&lt;ref&gt;Karen L.

==History==
===19th century===
Many white Southerners were devastated economically, emotionally, and psychologically by the defeat of the Confederacy. Before the war, many Southerners proudly felt that their rich military tradition and superior dedication to the concept of [[honor]] would enable them to prevail in the conflict. When this did not happen, white Southerners sought consolation in attributing their loss to factors beyond their control, such as physical size and overwhelming brute force.&lt;ref name="Gallagher 2000 p. 1"/&gt;

University of Virginia professor [[Gary W. Gallagher]] wrote:

{{quote|The architects of the Lost Cause acted from various motives.

Yale University history professor [[Rollin G. Osterweis]] summarizes the content that pervaded "Lost Cause" writings:

{{quote|The Legend of the Lost Cause began as mostly a literary expression of the despair of a bitter, defeated people over a lost identity. It was a landscape dotted with figures drawn mainly out of the past: the chivalric planter; the magnolia-scented Southern belle; the good, gray Confederate veteran, once a knight of the field and saddle; and obliging old [[Uncle Remus]]. All these, while quickly enveloped in a golden haze, became very real to the people of the South, who found the symbols useful in the reconstituting of their shattered civilization. They perpetuated the ideals of the [[Old South]] and brought a sense of comfort to the [[New South|New]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollin G. Osterweis, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause, 1865–1900'' (1973) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Louisiana State University]] history professor Gaines Foster wrote in 2013:

{{quote|Scholars have reached a fair amount of agreement about the role the Lost Cause played in those years, although the scholarship on the Lost Cause, like the memory itself, remains contested. The white South, most agree, dedicated enormous effort to celebrating the leaders and common soldiers of the Confederacy, emphasizing that they had preserved their and the South's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines Foster, "Civil War Sesquicentennial: The Lost Cause,"  [http://www.cwbr.com/civilwarbookreview/index.php?q=5590&amp;field=ID&amp;browse=yes&amp;record=full&amp;searching=yes&amp;Submit=Search ''Civil War Book Review'' (Fall 2013) online]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term ''Lost Cause'' first appeared in the title of an 1866 book by the Virginian author and journalist [[Edward A. Pollard]], ''The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulbrich, p. 1221.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard promotes many of the aforementioned themes of the Lost Cause. In particular, he dismisses the role of slavery in starting the war and understates the cruelty of American slavery, even promoting it as a way of improving the lives of Africans:

{{quote|We shall not enter upon the discussion of the moral question of slavery. But we may suggest a doubt here whether that odious term "slavery" which has been so long imposed, by the exaggeration of Northern writers, upon the judgement and sympathies of the world, is properly applied to that system of servitude in the South, which was really the mildest in the world; which did not rest on acts of debasement and disenfranchisement, but elevated the African, and was in the interest of human improvement; and which, by the law of the land, protected the negro in life and limb, and in many personal rights, and, by the practice of the system, bestowed upon him a sum of individual indulgences, which made him altogether the most striking type in the world of cheerfulness and contentment.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Pollard, The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates (1866)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, it was the articles written by General [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in the 1870s for the [[Southern Historical Society]] that firmly established the Lost Cause as a long-lasting literary and cultural phenomenon. The 1881 publication of ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]'' by [[Jefferson Davis]], a two-volume defense of the Southern cause, provided another important text in the history of the Lost Cause. Davis blamed the enemy for "whatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government has resulted from the war". He charged that the Yankees fought "with a ferocity that disregarded all the laws of civilized warfare". The book remained in print and was often used to justify the Southern position and to distance it from slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gaines M. Foster|title=Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause, and the Emergence of the New South, 1865–1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G6bCqNKpvwC&amp;pg=PA232|year=1987|publisher=Oxford UP|page=232|isbn=9780199772100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early's original inspiration for his views may have come from General [[Robert E. Lee]]. When Lee published his farewell order to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], he consoled his soldiers by speaking of the "overwhelming resources and numbers" that the Confederate army fought against. In a letter to Early, Lee requested information about enemy strengths from May 1864 to April 1865, the period in which his army was engaged against Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (the [[Overland Campaign]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]]). Lee wrote, "My only object is to transmit, if possible, the truth to posterity, and do justice to our brave Soldiers."&lt;ref name="Gal12"&gt;Gallagher, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter, Lee wanted all "statistics as regards numbers, destruction of private property by the Federal troops, &amp;c." because he intended to demonstrate the discrepancy in strength between the two armies and believed it would "be difficult to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought". Referring to newspaper accounts that accused him of culpability in the loss, he wrote, "I have not thought proper to notice, or even to correct misrepresentations of my words &amp; acts. We shall have to be patient, &amp; suffer for awhile at least.&amp;nbsp;... At present the public mind is not prepared to receive the truth."&lt;ref name="Gal12" /&gt; All of these were themes made prominent by Early and the Lost Cause writers in the nineteenth century and that continued to be important throughout the twentieth.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher and Nolan p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 1868 report, U.S. Army general [[George Henry Thomas]], a Virginian who fought for the Union in the war, noted efforts made by former Confederates to paint the Confederacy in a positive light, stating:

{{Quotation|[T]he greatest efforts made by the defeated insurgents since the close of the war have been to promulgate the idea that the cause of liberty, justice, humanity, equality, and all the calendar of the virtues of freedom, suffered violence and wrong when the effort for southern independence failed. This is, of course, intended as a species of political cant, whereby the crime of treason might be covered with a counterfeit varnish of patriotism, so that the precipitators of the rebellion might go down in history hand in hand with the defenders of the government, thus wiping out with their own hands their own stains; a species of self-forgiveness amazing in its effrontery, when it is considered that life and property—justly forfeited by the laws of the country, of war, and of nations, through the magnanimity of the government and people—was not exacted from them.|George Henry Thomas|November 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SDU18681204.2.3 |title=The Department Reports|last=Thomas|first=George Henry|authorlink=George Henry Thomas|work=Sacramento Daily Union|volume=36|number=5520|accessdate=March 20, 2016|date=December 4, 1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Memorial associations such as the [[United Confederate Veterans]], the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], and [[Ladies Memorial Association]]s integrated Lost Cause themes to help white, Confederate-sympathizing Southerners cope with the many changes during this era, most significantly [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Ul1222"&gt;Ulbrich, p. 1222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janney, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions have lasted to the present and descendants of Southern soldiers continue to attend their meetings.

In 1879 John McElroy published "Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons" which was highly critical of the Confederate treatment of prisoners; he implied in the preface that the mythology of the Confederacy was well established and that criticism of the otherwise-lionized Confederates was met with disdain:

{{Quotation|I know that what is contained herein will be bitterly denied. I am prepared for this. In my boyhood I witnessed the savagery of the Slavery agitation - in my youth I felt the fierceness of the hatred directed against all those who stood by the Nation. I know that hell hath no fury like the vindictiveness of those who are hurt by the truth being told to them.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, John. Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons, Fifteen Months a Guest of the So-called Southern Confederacy : A Private Soldier's Experience in Richmond, Andersonville, Savannah, Millen, Blackshear, and Florence.

===20th century to present===
{{main|Modern display of the Confederate flag|Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials}}
[[File:Confederate Rebel Flag.svg|thumb|The Army of Northern Virginia [[Confederate battle flag]]]]
[[File:Flag of Mississippi.svg|thumb|The current [[flag of Mississippi]], created in 1894 after the state's "[[Redeemers|Redemption]]"]]

Basic assumptions of the Lost Cause have proved durable for many in the modern South. Lost Cause tenets are frequently voiced during controversies surrounding public display of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]] and various state flags. Historian John Coski noted that the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], the "most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag", "carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth".&lt;ref&gt;Coski pp.&amp;nbsp;192–93&lt;/ref&gt; Coski wrote concerning "the flag wars of the late twentieth century":

{{quote|From the&amp;nbsp;... early 1950s, SCV officials defended the integrity of the battle flag against trivialization and against those who insisted that its display was unpatriotic or racist. SCV spokesmen reiterated the consistent argument that the South fought a legitimate war for independence, not a war to defend slavery, and that the ascendant "Yankee" view of history falsely vilified the South and led people to misinterpret the battle flag.&lt;ref&gt;Coski p.&amp;nbsp;193. Coski (p.&amp;nbsp;62) also wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the battle flag became during the war the most important emblem of Confederate nationalism, so did it become during the memorial period [the late 19th Century through the 1920s] the symbolic embodiment of the Lost Cause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Confederate States of America [[flags of the Confederate States of America|used several flags]] during its existence from 1861 to 1865. Since the end of the American Civil War, personal and official use of Confederate flags, and of flags derived from these, has continued under considerable controversy. The current [[flag of Mississippi|state flag of Mississippi]], created in 1894 after the state's "[[Redeemers|Redemption]]", includes the [[Confederate battle flag]].

On March 23, 2015, a Confederate-flag-related case reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. ''[[Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans]]'' centered on whether or not the state of [[Texas]] could deny a request by the SCV for [[vanity plate|vanity license plates]] that incorporated a Confederate battle flag. The case was heard by the Court on March 23, 2015.&lt;ref name="Walker vs Texas SCV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Walker v.

In October 2015 outrage erupted online at the discovery of a Texan school's geography textbook which described slaves as "immigrants" and "workers".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/23/450826208/why-calling-slaves-workers-is-more-than-an-editing-error&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher, McGraw-Hill, announced that it would change the wording. Many have interpreted this as the legacy of the minimization and trivialization of slavery associated with the Lost Cause movement.

==Reunification of North and South==
Nolan states that the Lost Cause "facilitated the reunification of the North and the South".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Gary W. |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first2=Alan T. |editor-last2=Nolan |title=The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SJvUWYDBhUC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2000|publisher=Indiana UP|page=28|isbn=0253338220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He quotes Foster, who says, "signs of respect from former foes and northern publishers made acceptance of reunion easier. By the mid-eighties, most southerners had decided to build a future within a reunited nation. A few remained irreconcilable, but their influence in southern society declined rapidly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gaines M.

Historian Caroline Janney stated:

{{quote|Providing a sense of relief to white Southerners who feared being dishonored by defeat, the Lost Cause was largely accepted in the years following the war by [[white American]]s who found it to be a useful tool in reconciling North and South.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline E. Janney, "The Lost Cause." [http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Lost_Cause_The ''Encyclopedia Virginia'' (Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2009) accessed 26 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yale historian [[David W. Blight]] wrote:

{{quote|The Lost Cause became an integral part of national reconciliation by dint of sheer sentimentalism, by political argument, and by recurrent celebrations and rituals. For most white Southerners, the Lost Cause evolved into a language of vindication and renewal, as well as an array of practices and public monuments through which they could solidify both their Southern pride and their Americanness. In the 1890s, Confederate memories no longer dwelled as much on mourning or explaining defeat; they offered a set of conservative traditions by which the entire country could gird itself against racial, political, and industrial disorder. And by the sheer virtue of losing heroically the Confederate soldier provided a model of masculine devotion and courage in an age of gender anxieties and ruthless material striving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R-yvmpYaqAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00332-2 |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In exploring the literature of reconciliation, historian William Tynes Cowa wrote, "The cult of the Lost Cause was part of a larger cultural project: the reconciliation of North and South after the Civil War." He says that a typical image in postwar fiction was a materialistic, rich Yankee man marrying an impoverished spiritual Southern bride as a symbol of happy national reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Tynes Cowa|title=The Slave in the Swamp: Disrupting the Plantation Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY_bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=155|isbn=9781135470524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examining films and visual art, Gallagher identifies the theme of "white people North and South [who] extol the ''American'' virtues both sides manifested during the war, to exalt the restored nation that emerged from the conflict, and to mute the role of African Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary W. Gallagher|title=Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know about the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ozVxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP10|year=2008|publisher=U of North Carolina Press|page=10|isbn=9780807886250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Catton]] argues that the myth or legend helped achieve national reconciliation between North and South. He concludes,  "the legend of the lost cause has served the entire country very well", and he goes on to say:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, ''Reflections on the Civil War'' (1981) quoted in Caroline E. Janney, "The Lost Cause" In ''Encyclopedia Virginia'' (2015) [http://www.EncyclopediaVirginia.org/Lost_Cause_The online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The things that were done during the Civil War have not been forgotten, of course, but we now see them through a veil. We have elevated the entire conflict to the realm where it is no longer explosive. It is a part of American legend, a part of American history, a part, if you will, of American romance. It moves men mightily, to this day, but it does not move them in the direction of picking up their guns and going at it again. We have had national peace since the war ended, and we will always have it, and I think the way Lee and his soldiers conducted themselves in the hours of surrender has a great deal to do with it.}}

==New South==
Historians have said that the "Lost Cause" theme helped white Southerners adjust to their new status and move forward into what was called "the [[New South]]". Hillyer states that the [[Confederate Memorial Literary Society]] (CMLS), founded by elite white women in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1890s, exemplifies this solution. The CMLS founded the [[Museum of the Confederacy|Confederate Museum]] to document and defend the Confederate cause and to recall the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781–1860)|antebellum]] mores that the new South's business ethos was thought to be displacing. By focusing on military sacrifice, rather than grievances regarding the North, the Confederate Museum aided the process of sectional reconciliation, according to Hillyer. By depicting [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as benevolent, the museum's exhibits reinforced the notion that [[Jim Crow]] laws were a proper solution to racial tensions that had escalated during Reconstruction. Lastly, by glorifying the common soldier and portraying the South as "solid," the museum promoted acceptance of industrial capitalism. Thus, the Confederate Museum both critiqued and eased the economic transformations of the New South, and enabled Richmond to reconcile its memory of the past with its hopes for the future, leaving the past behind as it developed new industrial and financial roles.&lt;ref&gt;Reiko Hillyer, "Relics of Reconciliation: The Confederate Museum and Civil War Memory in the New South," ''Public Historian'', Nov 2011, Vol. 33 Issue 4, pp. 35–62,&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] states that the Lost Cause theme was fully developed around 1900 in a mood not of despair but of triumphalism for the New South. Much was left out of the Lost Cause:

{{quote|[N]either the trauma of slavery for African Americans nor their heroic, heartbreaking freedom struggle found a place in that story. But the Lost Cause narrative also suppressed the memories of many white southerners. Memories of how, under slavery, power bred cruelty. Memories of the bloody, unbearable realities of war. Written out too were the competing memories and identities that set white southerners one against another, pitting the planters against the up-country, Unionists against Confederates, Populists and mill workers against the corporations, home-front women against war-besotted, broken men.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, "'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique." ''Journal of American History'' (1998): 439–65 at p. 449. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567747 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Religious dimension==
Charles Wilson argues that many white Southerners, most of whom were conservative and pious [[evangelical Protestants]], sought answers to Confederate defeat in religion. They felt that defeat in the war was God's punishment for their sins, and turned increasingly to religion as their solace. The postwar era saw the birth of a regional [[American civil religion|"civil religion"]] that was heavy with symbolism and ritual; clergymen were the primary celebrants.  Wilson says that the ministers constructed:

{{quote|Lost Cause ritualistic forms that celebrated their regional mythological and theological beliefs. They used the Lost Cause to warn Southerners of their decline from past virtue, to promote moral reform, to encourage conversion to Christianity, and to educate the young in Southern traditions; in the fullness of time, they related to American values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Reagan Wilson|title=Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lk84N6NnwO0C&amp;pg=PA11|year=1983|publisher=University of Georgia Press|page=11|isbn=9780820306810}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

White southerners tried to defend on a cultural and religious level what defeat in 1865 made impossible on a political level. The Lost Cause—defeat in a holy war—left southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of evil: that is, they formed what [[C. Vann Woodward]] has called a uniquely Southern sense of the tragedy of history."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reagan Wilson, "The Religion of the Lost Cause: Ritual and the Organization of the Southern Civil Religion, 1865–1920," ''Journal of Southern History'', May 1980, Vol. 46 Issue 2, pp. 219–38 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2208359 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poole has said that in fighting to defeat the Republican reconstruction government in [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|South Carolina in 1876]], white Democrats portrayed the Lost Cause scenario through "Hampton Days" celebrations shouting "Hampton or Hell!". They staged the contest between reconstruction opponent and Democratic candidate [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and incumbent governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel H. Chamberlain]] as a religious struggle between good and evil, and calling for "redemption".&lt;ref&gt;W. Scott Poole, "Religion, Gender, and the Lost Cause in South Carolina's 1876 Governor's Race: 'Hampton or Hell!'," ''Journal of Southern History'', Aug 2002, Vol. 68 Issue 3, pp. 573–98&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, throughout the South the conservatives who overthrew Reconstruction were often called "Redeemers," echoing Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Cresswell, ''Rednecks, redeemers, and race: Mississippi after Reconstruction'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender roles==
[[File:UDC-marker-fort-sanders-tn1.jpg|thumb|The [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] helped promulgate the Lost Cause's ideology through the construction of numerous memorials, such as this one in Tennessee.]]
{{further|United Daughters of the Confederacy}}
Among the writers on the Lost Cause, gender roles were contested domain. Men typically hurried by the role women played during the war, noting their total loyalty to the cause. Women, however, developed a much different approach that emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They explained that when all the men left, the women took command, found substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced apparent danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865–1913'' (1985) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The duty of memorializing the Confederate dead was a major activity for Southerners devoted to the Lost Cause; chapters of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC) played the central role.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Mills, and Pamela Hemenway Simpson, eds. ''Monuments to the Lost Cause: Women, Art, and the Landscapes of Southern Memory'' (U. of Tennessee Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The UDC was especially influential in the early twentieth century across the South, where its main role was to preserve and uphold the memory of the Confederate veterans, especially those husbands, sons, fathers and brothers who died in the war. Its long-term impact was to promote the Lost Cause image of the antebellum plantation South as an idealized society crushed by the forces of Yankee modernization which undermined traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Karen L. Cox, ''Dixie's Daughters: The United Daughters of the Confederacy and preservation of Southern Culture'' (University Press of Florida, 2003) pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt; In Missouri, a border state, the United daughters of the Confederacy was active in setting up its own system of memorials.&lt;ref&gt;Megan B. Boccardi, "Remembering in black and white: Missouri women's memorial work 1860–1910" (PhD. Dissertation), University of Missouri–Columbia, 2011, [https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/14392/research.pdf?sequence=2 online].&lt;/ref&gt; Hall said that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:

{{quote|UDC leaders were determined to assert women's cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region's past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, "'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique." p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, there is even some evidence suggesting that there was a link between the publication of Lost Cause books and the creation of the confederate memorials: Lizzie Cary Daniel's "Confederate Scrap-book" makes clear in the preface and on the title page that it was specifically published to fund the erection of two (implied confederate) memorials.&lt;ref&gt;Lizzie Cary Daniel, "Confederate Scrap-book: Copied from a Scrap-book Kept by a Young Girl During and Immediately After the War" (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; The book therefore plays the dual roles of glorifying the Confederates in songs, poems and other war memorabilia, while also paying for their more enduring and public memorialization.

The Southern states set up their own pension system for veterans and their dependents, especially widows. They were not eligible for the Federal pension system. The pensions were designed to honor the Lost Cause, and help reduce the severe poverty prevalent in the region. Male applicants for pensions had to demonstrate their continued loyalty to the "lost cause". Female applicants were rejected if their moral reputation was in question.&lt;ref&gt;Elna C. Green, "Protecting confederate soldiers and mothers: Pensions, gender, and the welfare state in the US south, a case study from Florida." ''Journal of Social History'' (2006) 39#4 pp: 1079–1104. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jsh/summary/v039/39.4green.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Natchez, Mississippi, the local newspapers and veterans played a role in the maintenance of the Lost Cause. However elite white women were central in establishing memorials such as the Civil War Monument dedicated on Memorial Day 1890. The Lost Cause enabled women noncombatants to lay a claim to the central event in their redefinition of Southern history.&lt;ref&gt;Melody Kubassek, "Ask Us Not to Forget: The Lost Cause in Natchez, Mississippi," ''Southern Studies'', 1992, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp. 155–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDC was quite prominent, but not at all unique in its appeal to upscale white southern women.  "The number of women's clubs devoted to filiopietism and history was staggering," says historian [[W. Fitzhugh Brundage]]. He notes two typical club women in Texas and Mississippi, who between them belonged to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Daughters of the American Revolution, Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities,  Daughters of the Pilgrims, Daughters of the War of 1812, Daughters of Colonial Governors, and Daughters of the Founders and Patriots of America, Order of the First Families of Virginia, and the Colonial Dames of America, as well as a few other historically oriented societies. Comparable men, on the other hand, were much less interested in historical organizations, and devoted their energies  to secret fraternal societies, while they emphasized athletic, political and financial exploits to prove their manhood.  Brundage notes that after women's suffrage came in 1920, the historical role of the women's organizations eroded.&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage,  "White Women and the Politics of Historical Memory in the New South, 1880–1920." in Jane Dailey, Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, &amp; Bryant Simon, eds., ''Jumpin' Jim Crow: Southern Politics from Civil War to Civil Rights'' (Princeton UP, 2000) pp. 115–39. esp. 119, 123, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In their heyday in the first two decades of the 20th century, Brundage concludes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These women architects of whites' historical memory, by both explaining and mystifying the historical roots of white supremacy and elite power in the South, performed a conspicuous civic function at a time of heightened concern about the perpetuation of social and political hierarchies. Although denied the franchise, organized white women nevertheless played a dominant role in crafting the historical memory that would inform and undergird southern politics and public life.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage,  "White Women and the Politics of Historical Memory in the New South,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=yFvjsEYP7hAC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115–16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pompey and Master -- Massa linkum.jpg|thumb|The Lost Cause ideology includes fallacies about the relationships between slaves and their masters.]]

Some of the main tenets of the Lost Cause movement were that:&lt;ref&gt;CarolineJanney,  E. "The Lost Cause." ''Encyclopedia Virginia''(2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865–1913'' (1988) pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Confederate generals such as Lee, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], and [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson]] represented the virtues of Southern nobility and fought bravely and fairly. On the other hand, most Northern generals were characterized as possessing low moral standards, because they subjected the Southern civilian population to indignities like [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s burning of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. While Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] is often portrayed as an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbhayes.org/research/hayes-historical-journal-the-problem-of-ulysses-s.-grant/|title=Hayes Historical Journal: The Problem of Ulysses S. Grant|website=Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library &amp; Museums|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Losses on the battlefield were inevitable due to Northern superiority in resources and manpower.
* Battlefield losses were also sometimes the result of betrayal and incompetence on the part of certain subordinates of General Lee, such as General [[James Longstreet]], who was reviled for doubting Lee at Gettysburg (the Lost Cause focused mainly on Lee and the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] of operations, and often cited Gettysburg as the main [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]]).
* Defense of [[states' rights]], rather than preservation of [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], was the primary cause that led eleven Southern states to [[secession|secede]] from the Union, thus precipitating the war.
* Secession was a justifiable constitutional response to Northern cultural and economic aggressions against the Southern institution of slavery.
* Slavery was a benign institution, and the slaves were loyal and faithful to their benevolent masters, in contrast to the reality of its racism, brutality and dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher and Nolan p. 16. Nolan writes, "Given the central role of African Americans in the sectional conflict, it is surely not surprising that Southern rationalizations have extended to characterizations of the persons of these people. In the legend there exist two prominent images of the black slaves. One is of the "faithful slave"; the other is what William Garrett Piston calls "the happy darky stereotype".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Algood identifies a Southern aristocratic ideal, typically called "the Southern Cavalier ideal" in the Lost Cause. It especially appeared in studies of [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|Confederate partisans]] who fought behind Union lines, such as [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], [[Turner Ashby]], [[John Singleton Mosby]], and [[John Hunt Morgan]]. Writers stressed how they embodied courage in the face of heavy odds, as well as horsemanship, manhood and martial spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Colt B. Allgood, "Confederate Partisans and the Southern Cavalier Ideal, 1840–1920," ''Southern Historian'' (2011) Vol. 32, pp. 28–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
===Confederate generals===
The most powerful images and symbols of the Lost Cause were Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, and [[Pickett's Charge]]. David Ulbrich wrote, "Already revered during the war, Robert E. Lee acquired a divine mystique within Southern culture after it. Remembered as a leader whose soldiers would loyally follow him into every fight no matter how desperate, Lee emerged from the conflict to become an icon of the Lost Cause and the ideal of the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781–1860)|antebellum]] Southern [[gentleman]], an honorable and pious man who selflessly served Virginia and the Confederacy. Lee's tactical brilliance at [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] took on legendary status, and despite his accepting full responsibility for the defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], Lee remained largely infallible for Southerners and was spared criticism even from historians until recent times." Victor Davis Hansen points out that Albert Sidney Johnston was the first officer to be appointed a full general by Jefferson Davis and to lead Confederate forces in the Western Theater. His death during the first day of the battle at Shiloh arguably led to the Confederacy's defeat in that conflict.&lt;ref name="Ul1222" /&gt;

In terms of Lee's subordinates, the key villain in Jubal Early's view was General Longstreet. Despite the fact that General Lee took all responsibility for the defeats (in particular the one at Gettysburg), Early's writings place the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg squarely on Longstreet's shoulders, accusing him of failing to attack early in the morning of July 2, 1863, as instructed by Lee. In fact, however, Lee never expressed dissatisfaction with the second-day actions of his "Old War Horse". Longstreet was widely disparaged by Southern veterans because of his post-war cooperation with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (with whom he had shared a close friendship before the war) and for joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Grant, in rejecting the Lost Cause arguments, said in an 1878 interview that he rejected the notion that the South had simply been overwhelmed by numbers. Grant wrote that "This is the way public opinion was made during the war and this is the way history is made now. We never overwhelmed the South ... What we won from the South we won by hard fighting." He further noted that when comparing resources the "4,000,000 of negroes" who "kept the farms, protected the families, supported the armies, and were really a reserve force" were not treated as a southern asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R-yvmpYaqAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00332-2 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="War of Northern Aggression"===
One essential element of the Lost Cause movement was that the act of secession itself had been legitimate; otherwise, all of the Confederacy's leading figures would have become traitors. In order to legitimize the Confederacy's rebellion, Lost Cause intellectuals challenged the legitimacy of the federal government and the actions of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as President. This is exemplified in "Force or Consent as the Basis of American Government" by Mary Scrugham, in which she presents frivolous arguments against the legality of Lincoln's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Scrugham, Mary, and William H. (William Henry) Townsend. Force or Consent As the Basis of American Government. [Lexington]: Lexington, Ky. Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; These include his receiving a minority (and unmentioned plurality) of the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] and the false assertion that [[Abraham Lincoln and slavery|he made his position on slavery ambiguous]]. These accusations, though thoroughly refuted, gave rise to the belief that the North initiated the Civil War, making a designation of "The War of Northern Aggression" possible as one of the [[names of the American Civil War]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

===Film===
====''The Birth of a Nation''====
Another prominent use of the Lost Cause perspective was in [[Thomas F. Dixon, Jr.]]'s 1905 novel ''[[The Clansman]]'', later adapted to the screen by [[D. W. Griffith]] in his highly successful but controversial ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' in 1915. Noting that Dixon and Griffith collaborated on ''Birth of a Nation'', Blight wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dixon's vicious version of the idea that blacks had caused the Civil War by their very presence, and that Northern radicalism during Reconstruction failed to understand that freedom had ushered blacks as a race into barbarism, neatly framed the story of the rise of heroic vigilantism in the South. Reluctantly, Klansmen—white men—had to take the law into their own hands in order to save Southern white womanhood from the sexual brutality of black men. Dixon's vision captured the attitude of thousands and forged in story form a collective memory of how the war may have been lost but Reconstruction was won—by the South and a reconciled nation. Riding as masked cavalry, the Klan stopped corrupt government, prevented the anarchy of 'Negro rule,' and most of all, saved white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R-yvmpYaqAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00332-2 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In both the book and the movie, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] is portrayed as continuing the noble traditions of the antebellum South and the heroic Confederate soldier by defending Southern culture in general and Southern womanhood in particular against rape and depredations at the hands of the [[Freedmen]] and Yankee [[carpetbaggers]] during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Dixon's narrative was so readily adopted that the film is credited with the revival of the Klan in the 1910s and 1920s. This second Klan reached a peak membership of 2-5 million members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/second-klan/509468/&lt;/ref&gt; The film's legacy is wide-reaching in the history of American racism; even  the now-iconic cross burnings of the KKK were based on the book (the first KKK did not burn crosses - it was originally a Scottish tradition named "Crann Tara", designed to gather clans for war).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z3xhhv4&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Gone with the Wind''====
The Lost Cause view reached tens of millions of Americans in the best-selling 1936 novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' by [[Margaret Mitchell]] and the Oscar-winning [[Gone with the Wind (film)|1939 film]]. Helen Taylor has written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Gone with the Wind'' has almost certainly done its ideological work. It has sealed in popular imaginations a fascinated nostalgia for the glamorous southern plantation house and ordered hierarchical society in which slaves are 'family,' and there is a mystical bond between the landowner and the rich soil those slaves work for him. It has spoken eloquently—albeit from an elitist perspective—of the grand themes (war, love, death, conflicts of race, class, gender, and generation) that have crossed continents and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helen Taylor |chapter=''Gone with the Wind'' and its Influence |pages=258–67 |editor-first=Carolyn |editor-last=Perry |editor-first2=Mary |editor-last2=Weaks-Baxter |title=The History of Southern Women's Literature |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQSYeomI_CAC&amp;pg=PA266 |year=2002 |publisher=LSU Press |isbn=978-0-8071-2753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blight wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From this combination of Lost Cause voices a reunited America arose pure, guiltless, and assured that the deep conflicts in its past had been imposed upon it by otherworldly forces. The side that lost was especially assured that its cause was true and good. One of the ideas the reconciliationist Lost Cause instilled deeply into the national culture is that even when Americans lose, they win. Such was the message, the indomitable spirit, that Margaret Mitchell infused into her character [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''Gone With the Wind''...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R-yvmpYaqAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00332-2 |pages=283–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Southerners were portrayed as noble, heroic figures, living in a doomed romantic society, who rejected the realistic advice offered by the [[Rhett Butler]] character and never understood the risk they were taking in going to war.

====''Gods and Generals''====
The 2003 Civil War film [[Gods and Generals (film)|''Gods and Generals'']], based on [[Jeff Shaara]]'s 1998 [[Gods and Generals (novel)|novel]] of the same name, is widely viewed as championing the Lost Cause ideology by creating a presentation that was favorable to the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="Film Review: Gods and Generals"&gt;{{cite web |last=Woodworth |first=Steven E. |title=Film Review: Gods and Generals |url=http://teachinghistory.org/nhec-blog/25077 |website=Teaching History |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Movie Review: Gods and Generals"&gt;{{cite web |last=Feis |first=William B. |title="Movie Review: Gods and Generals" |url=http://www.smh-hq.org/gazette/godsgenerals.html |website=The Society for Military History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "GODS AND GENERALS (2003)"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gods and Generals (2003) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_and_generals/ |website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the Journal of American History, historian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] derided the movie as a modern day telling of Lost Cause mythology.&lt;ref name="Film Review: Gods and Generals"/&gt; Woodworth called the movie "the most pro-Confederate film since ''Birth of a Nation'', a veritable celluloid celebration of slavery and treason". He summed up his reasons for disliking the movie by saying:

{{quote|''Gods and Generals'' brings to the big screen the major themes of Lost Cause mythology that professional historians have been working for half a century to combat. In the world of Gods and Generals, slavery has nothing to do with the Confederate cause. Instead, the Confederates are nobly fighting for, rather than against, freedom, as viewers are reminded again and again by one white southern character after another.&lt;ref name="Film Review: Gods and Generals"/&gt;}}

Woodworth criticized the portrayal of slaves as being "generally happy" with their condition. He also criticizes the relative lack of attention given to the motivations of Union soldiers fighting in the war. He excoriates the film for allegedly implying, in agreement with Lost Cause mythology, that the South was more "sincerely Christian". Woodworth concludes that the film, through "judicial omission," presents "a distorted view of the Civil War".&lt;ref name="Film Review: Gods and Generals"/&gt;

Historian William B. Feis similarly criticized the director's decision "to champion the more simplistic-and sanitized-interpretations found in post-war "Lost Cause" mythology".&lt;ref name="Movie Review: Gods and Generals"/&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the movie as "a Civil War movie that [[Trent Lott]] might enjoy" and said of its Lost Cause themes, "If World War II were handled this way, there'd be hell to pay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Gods and Generals: Movie Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gods-and-generals-2003/ |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus of film critics for this movie was that it had a firm "pro-confederate slant".&lt;ref name="GODS AND GENERALS (2003)"/&gt;

===Literature===
In his novels about the [[Sartoris]] family, [[William Faulkner]] referenced those who supported the Lost Cause ideal, while suggesting that the ideal itself was misguided and out of date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R-yvmpYaqAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00332-2 |pages=292, 448–49 |quote=[quoting [[Robert Penn Warren]] on Faulkner, Blight writes:] If respect for the human is the central fact of Faulkner's work, what makes that fact significant is that he realizes and dramatizes the difficulty of respecting the human. Everything is against it, the savage egotism, the blank appetite, stupidity and arrogance, even virtues sometimes, the misreading of our history and tradition, our education, our twisted loyalties. That is the great drama, however, the constant story.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further adoption==
Professor Gallagher contends that [[Douglas Southall Freeman]]'s definitive four-volume biography of Lee, published in 1934, "cemented in American letters an interpretation of Lee very close to Early's utterly heroic figure".&lt;ref name="Gal2425"&gt;Gallagher, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Lee's subordinates were primarily to blame for errors that lost battles. While Longstreet was the most common target of such attacks, others came under fire as well. [[Richard Ewell]], [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], [[J. E. B. Stuart]], [[A. P. Hill]], [[George Pickett]], and many others were frequently attacked and blamed by Southerners in an attempt to deflect criticism from Lee.

[[Hudson Strode]] wrote a widely read scholarly three-volume biography of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]. A leading scholarly journal reviewed it stressing Strode's political biases:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His [Jefferson Davis's] enemies are devils, and his friends, like Davis himself, have been canonized. Strode not only attempts to sanctify Davis but also the Confederate point of view, and this study should be relished by those vigorously sympathetic with the Lost Cause.&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy H. Fischer in ''The Journal of American History'' September 1965 p. 396 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i305664 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Texas Civil War Museum]] has been called in 2018 "a lovely bit of 'Lost Cause' propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Contemporary historians==
Contemporary historians overwhelmingly agree that secession was motivated by slavery. There were numerous causes for secession, but preservation and expansion of slavery was easily the most important of them. The confusion may come from blending the causes of secession with the causes of the war—which are separate but related issues. (Lincoln did not enter a military conflict to free the slaves but to put down a rebellion.) According to historian [[Kenneth M. Stampp]], each side supported states' rights or federal power only when it was convenient to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, page 59&lt;/ref&gt; Stampp also cited Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]]'s ''A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States'' as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the "[[Cornerstone Speech|cornerstone of the Confederacy]]" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. According to Stampp, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the 'Lost Cause' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', pp.&amp;nbsp;63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, historian William C. Davis explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states' rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Davis, ''Look Away'', pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davis further notes that, "Causes and effects of the war have been manipulated and mythologized to suit political and social agendas, past and present."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''The Cause Lost'' p.&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Blight says that "its use of white supremacy as both means and ends" has been a key characteristic of the Lost Cause.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Historian Allan Nolan writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the Lost Cause legacy to history is a caricature of the truth. The caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter. Surely it is time to start again in our understanding of this decisive element of our past and to do so from the premises of history unadulterated by the distortions, falsehoods, and romantic sentimentality of the Myth of the Lost Cause.&lt;ref&gt;Gallager and Nolan, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are modern Lost Cause writers of history, such as James Ronald Kennedy and his twin brother Walter Donald Kennedy (founders of [[The League of the South]] and author of ''The South Was Right!'' and ''Jefferson Davis Was Right!''), who play down slavery as a cause in favor of Southern nationalism. The Kennedys describe "the terrorist methods" and "heinous crimes" committed by the Union during the war and then in a chapter titled "The Yankee Campaign of Cultural Genocide" state that they will show "from the United States government's own official records that the primary motivating factor was a desire of those in power to punish and to exterminate the Southern nation and in many cases to procure the extermination of the Southern people".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy and Kennedy p.&amp;nbsp;275–76&lt;/ref&gt;

In arguing why the theme of this book is important to contemporary Southerners, the Kennedys write in the conclusion of their work:

{{quote|The Southern people have all the power we need to put an end to forced busing, affirmative action, extravagant welfare spending, the punitive Southern-only [[Voting Rights Act]], the refusal of the Northern liberals to allow Southern conservatives to sit on the United States Supreme Court, and the economic exploitation of the South into a secondary economic status. What is needed is not more power but the will to use the power at hand! The choice is now yours—ignore this challenge and remain a second-class citizen, or unite with your fellow Southerners and help start a Southern political revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy and Kennedy, p.&amp;nbsp;309&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian David Goldfield characterizes books "such as ''The South Was Right''" as:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;explaining that "the War of Northern Aggression was not fought to preserve any union of historic creation, formation, and understanding, but to achieve a new union by conquest and plunder." As for the abolitionists, they were a collection of socialists, atheists, and "reprehensible agitators".&lt;ref&gt;Goldfield, p.&amp;nbsp;302&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian William C. Davis labels many of the myths surrounding the war as "frivolous" and included attempts to rename the war by "Confederate partisans" which continue to this day. He states that names such as the [[War of Northern Aggression]] and the expression coined by Alexander Stephens, [[War Between the States]], were just attempts to deny that the Civil War was an actual civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, ''The Cause Lost'', p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian A. Cash Koiniger has theorized that Gary Gallagher has mischaracterized films that depict the Lost Cause. He writes, Gallagher:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;concedes that "Lost Cause themes" (with the important exception of minimizing the importance of slavery) are based on historical truths (p.&amp;nbsp;46). Confederate soldiers were often outnumbered, ragged, and hungry; southern civilians did endure much material deprivation and a disproportionate amount of bereavement; U.S. forces did wreck ''{{sic}}'' havoc on southern infrastructure and private property and the like, yet whenever these points appear in films Gallagher considers them motifs "celebratory" of the Confederacy (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref&gt;A. Cash Koiniger, review of Gallagher's ''Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know about the Civil War'' (2008), citing pages 46 and 81, in ''The Journal of Military History'' (Jan 2009) 73&amp;nbsp;(1) p.&amp;nbsp;286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16484">'''MIX NYC''' is a not-for-profit organization based in [[New York City]] and dedicated to [[queer]] [[experimental film]]. It is also known as the "MIX festival," for its most visible program, the annual '''New York Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival''' (NYLGEFF), which has featured early works by filmmakers such as [[Christine Vachon]], [[Todd Haynes]], [[Isaac Julien]], Thomas Allen Harris, [[Barbara Hammer]], [[Jonathan Caouette]], [[Jennie Livingston]], and Matthew Mishory.

== History ==

===1980s===
MIX was founded in 1987 by [[Sarah Schulman]] and [[Jim Hubbard]]. The festival was created because newly emerging Gay Film Festivals were not including formally inventive work, and the then vibrant experimental film venues marginalized gay and lesbian work. They were aided by curators Jack Waters and Peter Cramer from Naked Eye Cinema and Ela Troyano who programmed [[New York Film Festival Downtown|The New York Film Festival Downtown]]. The first festival featured the world premiere of [[Su Freidrich]]'s ''Damned If You Don't'', and from then on the festival became a showcase for new works by established makers, archival masters like [[Barbara Rubin]]'s ''Christmas on Earth'', and new emerging artists. Quickly, in  concert with the emerging AIDS Activist and Queer Activist movement of the day- The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival (NYLGEFF) became a mass cultural event in the LGBT underground. Friday nights were guaranteed sold-out "Lesbian Date Nights" and a counter-culture of new interest in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] emerged around the festival community. MIX soon became very influential on other programming venues, often contributing significant work to [[The Whitney Biennial]], [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and other important screens. MIX  exhibited first films by major lesbian, gay and bisexual filmmakers including [[Todd Haynes]]' college thesis film, ''Assassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud,'' (which got him his first review, ever), [[Maria Maggenti]]'s ''Name Day'', the first screening of ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'', when it was still on a dual system, [[Christine Vachon]]'s first film, and many others. Hubbard and Schulman prioritized artists' fees, paying all makers equally regardless of the length of their work, since in experimental film, labor intensivity was not determined by length. They included the first focus on films by and about black gay men in any film Festival. Schulman and Hubbard worked long and hard to get press review coverage for gay experimental work, often holding individual press screenings at the critic's convenience. They hand wheatpasted posters on buildings around the city, and leafleted areas where gay people hung out, like the piers and bars. MIX received no funding and managed to break even on enthusiastic box office support. They showed gay experimental film from other countries and brought films by hand to venues around the US, Europe and Japan. The festival has shown the work of filmmakers such as [[Barbara Hammer]], [[Nisha Ganatra]], [[Teri Rice]], [[Jonathan Caouette]], and [[Isaac Julien]] among hundreds more. As makers began to die of AIDS, Jim became active in film preservation, beginning with the film ''Avocada'' by the late Bill Vehr of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Eventually, he preserved over 2,000 hours of AIDS Film and Video, now available for free viewing at the [[New York Public Library]]. During Sarah and Jim's tenure, no one was ever turned away from MIX due to inability to pay. The festival also included Transsexual work from the very first year, with Marguerite Paris's film ''All Women Are Equal''. They found ways of getting works by makers like Chantal Ackerman who did not show in gay festivals. Among many fabulous moments in the festival's history was MIX's screening of [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' which was attended by [[Kitty Carlisle|Kitty Carlisle Hart]] in a gown with a tuxedo'd escort.

===1990s===
Hubbard &amp; Schulman ran the festival together as a community event from 1987-1991. After the 1991 festival, Schulman wanted to devote more time to her writing.  The 1992 festival was organized by Hubbard and filmmakers Margueite Paris and Jerry Tartaglia. That year also introduced shows programmed by guest curators, who brought new perspectives to the line-up. Notable shows included Our Fanzine Friends, which drew upon the hot trend of queer zines, featuring work by [[Glenn Belverio]] and [[Bruce LaBruce]]; and ''Fire'', featuring work from the African diaspora. This last program featured work by Dawn Suggs, Shari Frilot, Thomas Allen Harris and others.

In 1993 Frilot and Karim Ainouz were the co-directors, and introduced many changes, including the name MIX, the production of a catalog (instead of handing our program notes), a new venue ([[The Kitchen]] instead of [[Anthology Film Archives]]) and a commitment to multicultural presentations and installation work. A stunning program that year was called The 1000 Dreams of Desire, curated by Jim Lyons. It was a special show featuring Teri Rice's ''The Kindling Point'' and ''Les Affaires'', at the Ann Street Bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where the peep booths were reprogrammed with experimental video, and 16mm film was projected in a separate room. MIX returned to Anthology in 1994, and combined with DCTV's Lookout Lesbian &amp; Gay Video Festival because DCTV's building was under renovation. Ainouz scaled back his involvement, and Frilot became the definitive voice of MIX, making the organization a home for emerging filmmakers and makers of color. This was signaled by 1994's opening feature, Brincando El Charco, and even more powerfully when 1995's opening and closing events were films by makers of color These films, Vintage: Families of Value by Thomas Allen Harris, and Frilot's own documentary Black Nations/Queer Nations, brought new audiences to MIX. They started satellite festivals such as MIX Brasil (1993) and MIX Mexico (1996).

1996 was the festival's 10th anniversary, and in honor of this milestone MIX presented queer work from the African diaspora at the [[Victoria Theater (New York City)|Victoria Theater]] in [[Harlem]], in addition to its downtown programs at NYU's Cantor Film Center and the [[Knitting Factory]].

Frilot headed MIX through 1996. Her other legacy was a commitment to installation work and the nascent digital realm. Installations were on view in 1993, on the upper floor of the Kitchen. But in 1994, Shu Lea Cheang and Beth Stryker curated Cyberqueer, in the basement galleries of Anthology. Although installations were presented in subsequent years, they never matched these early efforts until new MIX NYC staff began devoting substantial space and resources to installations in 2006. Frilot went on to become a curator at the Sundance Film Festival.

Rajendra Roy was in charge in 1997, when the festival moved to Cinema Village, which was then a single-screen theater on E. 12th Street. In 1997 Ernesto Foronda and Maïa Cybelle Carpenter were programming coordinators for the festival. Carpenter stayed on until 1999, also curating additional programs in the years to follow. Roy brought on Anie Stanley as artistic director in 1998, and as a team they propelled MIX to greater visibility, with more corporate sponsorship, but with less emphasis on the identity politics of the early 1990s. 1998 also saw a sidebar of 8&amp;nbsp;mm films curated by Stephen Kent Jusick, featuring work by both contemporary makers and old masters, such as [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], and [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Polavision]] home movies. Roy is now the Celeste Bartos Chief Curator of Film at The Museum of Modern Art.

===2000s===
Roy &amp; Stanley stepped down after the 2000 festival, making way for Ioannis Mookas, who took the title of Executive Director. The organization, whose offices had been in the financial district, suffered after 9/11, and Mookas left after overseeing two festivals.

MIX NYC as an organization took a new direction in 2003, when it initiated the [[ACT UP Oral History Project]], run by Hubbard and Schulman (www.actuporalhistory.org), and funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation. This new effort gave the organization another aspect, different from being just a film festival.

Larry Shea and Stephen Winter took the helm of the festival in 2003. [[Jonathan Caouette]]'s [[Tarnation (2003 film)|Tarnation]] was shepherded into being under Winter's supervision, and its premiere as the festival centerpiece was the beginning of its illustrious path to [[Cannes]], the [[New York Film Festival]] and a distribution deal with Wellspring in 2004. Shea and Winter also reimagined the 1000 Dreams of Desire program from 1993, re-staging it, with differences, at the same Ann Street location as the original. This time, in addition to the video booths and screening room on the upper floors, the basement was also cleared out, and set up with DJs, ambient 16mm &amp; 8mm film projections, and a dance floor.

A large-scale installation called ''Cake'', about garment workers, by Mary Ellen Strom &amp; Ann Carlson, debuted at [[South Street Seaport]] as the festival centerpiece.  MIX expanded beyond the concept of the annual festival more in late 2004, with the introduction of MIXtv, which aired weekly on [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]].

Yet MIX was unable to capitalize on the success of [[Tarnation (2003 film)|Tarnation]], and financial troubles led Shea to move the festival from November to April 2005, skipping 2004 entirely. The opening night "happening" was held at the Gershwin Hotel, while regular screenings were at Anthology Film Archives. Jim Morrison created silk-screened T-shirts for the festival, the first time MIX had shirts since 1996. MIX began a community screening program, which took work to various neighborhoods and communities, beginning with the Bronx in February 2005.

Larry Shea left MIX after the 2005 festival to devote more time to his video art, and a new team was appointed in the fall, including Andre Hereford, Szu Burgess, Kate Huh and [[Stephen Kent Jusick]]. Moving MIX back to its traditional November timeslot was the first decision of the new staff.

In May 2006, MIX began the Naked Eye Celebrity Camera benefit, auctioning off disposable cameras exposed by artists and celebrities including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Gus Van Sant]], [[B.D. Wong]], [[Alec Soth]] and over 100 others. The 2006 festival, the 19th, was held at the new 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center in Lower Manhattan, and featured two screening rooms as well as window installations and an installations lounge.

The 2007 festival began with a name change, to the New York Queer Experimental Film Festival, after a few years of requests from the public to a name more inclusive  than "Lesbian and Gay" and embracing of contemporary terminology. The festival was held in an empty storefront in SoHo, and marked a shift away from traditional theater venues.  Installations covered the space, and led back to the makeshift screening room. Additional installations were in the mezzanine, overlooking the whole space. Many shows were packed, including the ''[[Butt (magazine)|Butt]]'' magazine show, and Homoccult and other Esoterotica, guest curated by Daniel McKernan and Richie Rennt.  Another highlight was a screening of a rare 16mm print shot by Women's Liberation Cinema ([[Kate Millett]] and Susan Kleckner, among others) of the 1971 gay pride march in New York. For this screening Sharon Hayes performed a live audio accompaniment. Hayes continued working with this material, and the film and recorded audio were included in Hayes's show at the Whitney Museum in 2012.

In 2008 MIX took over a former Liz Claiborne department store in the South Street Seaport, filling every nook and cranny with installations, decorations and performances. The festival took place in October, earlier than its traditional mid-November dates, because the space, donated free of charge by the landlord, was only available at that time. This year MIX NYC initiated a program of artist-designed T-shirts celebrating the festival, each available in a limited edition.

The 2009 festival took place in Chelsea for the first time since 1993, this time in an {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} empty storefront of a newly constructed condo building. Ceiling to floor glass windows gave MIX unprecedented street visibility, including projections by Lori Hiris and Kadet Kuhne. Installations were prominent again, most notably a large geodesic dome that was ''Wildflowers of Manitoba'', by Luis Jacob and Noam Gonick. A live actor inhabited the dome, silently lying there, listening to records, lighting incense and ruminating,  while 3 projections illuminated some of the panels with scenes of a same-sex love and commitment. The closing night feature ''Maggots &amp; Men,'' by Carey Cronenwett, was sold out, as were several other shows. The festival suffered some noise complaints from condo residents above, who felt that festival-goers were too loud.

The 2010 festival was held at Theater for the New City, back in the East Village. Using three theater spaces in the TNC complex, MIX emphasized an immersive environment with a string art design in the venue by Diego Montoya. One smaller theater contained a performative installation by Daniel Pillis. Another theater was turned into an installation lounge, anchored by Blaise Garber-Paul's Queer Fruit Tree, which grew and changed throughout the week, and under which visitors could sit on astroturf, or on conical black cushions. The closing night film was Bruce LaBruce's [[L.A. Zombie]], which sold out, and a second screening was added.

In 2011 MIX took over a disused theater on Bleecker Street. The festival trailer, made on 16mm film by Gina Carducci, was projected on a continuous loop onto the building across the street, above the subway entrance. The venue design told a story of sorts. The lobby was dark with back-lit curtains that gave the impression of being in outer space. From there visitors could enter the screening room, or venture through  lush psychedelic forest, and down steps to a subterranean space cave made of pink paper mache and pointy pink pillows. This downstairs space was a lounge, had a second stage used for performances, and contained most of the installations, including work by Adriana Varella, Szu Burgess, Coco Rico and others. The Occupy Wall Street movement was going on at the same time, and the NYPD raided Zuccotti Park just before the festival opened. As a result, MIX made the decision to open the venue as a sanctuary for queer Occupiers.

The 25th MIX Festival took place in a two-story 20,000 sf former nut roasting factory in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn, the first time the festival had been held outside Manhattan. The first floor was a wide-open space that contained all of the many installations, as well as a small performance stage and many lounging areas. An interior design of spandex "explosions" filled the space, often running from ceiling to floor. The second floor, accessible only by a steep staircase, held the screening room, as well as 2 restrooms and administrative space. The closing night film was [[She Said Boom]], about the Toronto band [[Fifth Column]], with band member Caroline Azar in attendance.

After the success of the festival in Brooklyn, the festival returned to Gowanus in 2013, taking over a 25,000&amp;nbsp;ft warehouse, which gave over about 15,000 sf to installation work, and 3600 sf screening room. The festival's visual theme was body parts, and a giant inflatable lung, which breathed slightly, greeted festival-goers as they entered. There were other inflatables, including Rachel Shannon's Breastival Vestibules, and other plastics that resembled veins. Jonathan Caouette returned to the festival with a new film that he finished hours before the screening at MIX NYC.

'''Ilona Marita Lorenz''' (born August 18, 1939) is a German-born American woman who had an affair with [[Fidel Castro]] in 1959 and in January 1960 was involved in an assassination attempt by the [[CIA]] on Castro's life.

In the 1970s and 1980s, she testified about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], stating that she was involved with a group of anti-Cuban militants, [[Frank Sturgis]] of the CIA, and [[E. Howard Hunt]] of CIA and [[Watergate]] infamy shortly before the assassination.

==Early life==
She was born '''Ilona Marita Lorenz''' in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], the daughter of Alice June ([[née]] Lofland) and Heinrich Lorenz. She has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Joachim and Manfred "Philip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bardachreports.com/articles/v_19931100.html |title=Martia biography|accessdate= January 20, 2016|website=bardachreports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a [[Germans|German]] maritime commercial ship captain; and her mother, who was born in [[Delaware]], was an actress and dancer who performed under the stage name June Paget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-DTCS-PN?mode=g&amp;i=1459&amp;wc=MJ72-PTL%3A1042257701%3Fcc%3D1534607&amp;cc=1534607 |title=Alice Lofland public record|accessdate= January 20, 2016|website=familysearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was accused of helping forced laborers in Bremen escape, and Marita and her mother were incarcerated in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Freed after the war, she spent some time traveling with her father on his passenger liner.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Castro and Pérez Jiménez==
In February 1959, weeks after the conclusion of the [[Cuban Revolution]], Lorenz arrived in [[Havana]] with her father on board of the [[MS Gripsholm (1925)|MS ''Berlin'']].&lt;ref name="Geyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geyer |first=Georgie Anne |author-link=Georgie Anne Geyer |year=2001 |orig-year=1991 |title=Guerrilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRhJGLnJjugC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Kansas City, Missouria |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |pages=10, 216–217, 405  |isbn=9780740720642 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidel Castro and his men visited the ship and the ''Máximo Líder'' took a liking to the nineteen-year-old girl. After dinner, the Berlin set sail for New York. Marita disembarked in Manhattan, where she would be living with her brother Joachim, a student at Columbia University. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-search-for-fidel-castros-love-child?ref=home?ref=home|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;A few days after she arrived, Castro called Marita—she had given him Joachim’s home number on a matchbox before parting ways—and said he was sending a plane to fly her back to Cuba. A jeep picked Marita up at the other end and drove her to the Havana Hilton, which Castro had repurposed as his base of operations. She lived with Castro for several months and became pregnant. When Marita discovered she was pregnant, there was little doubt who the father was. In October 1959, at seven months along, Marita says she was given a glass of drugged milk and blacked out. When she woke up in a local doctor’s office, the baby was nowhere to be found. Various stories have been floated over the years about what happened next, but none have been definitively confirmed: Either the fetus was aborted, Marita suffered a miscarriage, or she gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Andre.

She left the island and joined anti-Castro activists in Florida. Her later testimony named Francisco Fiorini as the [[CIA]] agent who recruited her to assassinate Castro, and that this was an alias for [[Frank Sturgis|Frank Fiorini Sturgis]]. She received poison pills that she was to put in Castro's food. Back in Cuba in 1960, she did not deliver the pills but told Castro about the plot, claiming that she still loved him.&lt;ref name="mov"&gt;''Lieber Fidel - Maritas Geschichte'', documentary film by Wilfried Huismann, Germany 2000&lt;/ref&gt; She left the island and visited Castro one last time in 1981.

According to Lorenz, in March 1961 she met deposed Venezuelan dictator [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], introduced to her as "General Diaz", at a residence in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] while working as a courier for the International Anti-Communist Brigade.&lt;ref name="Bardach"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bardach |first=Ann Louise |author-link=Ann Louise Bardach |date=November 1993 |title=The Spy Who Loved Castro |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/03/marita-lorenz-fidel-castro-conspiracy-theories |journal=Vanity Fair |location= |publisher= |access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said she was to collect a $200,000 contribution from Pérez Jiménez for her group.&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt; Lorenz said: "He chased me around for six weeks."&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt;

Lorenz claimed that Castro and Pérez Jiménez each fathered a child with her.&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt;

In August 1963, a [[paternity suit]] Lorenz filed against Pérez Jiménez briefly held up his extradition to Venezuela.&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News; August 13, 1963"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Suit May Delay Jimenez Ouster |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1xsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9ZoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7070%2C1660962 |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |agency=AP |page=2 |date=August 13, 1963 |access-date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lorenz v Jimenez |vol=163 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=500 |pinpoint= |court=Fla.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
In 1977, Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' that she met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an [[Operation 40]] [[safe house]] in the [[Little Havana]] section of [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=Meskil&gt;{{cite news|last=Meskil|first=Paul|title=Ex-Spy Says She Drove To Dallas With Oswald &amp; Kennedy 'Assassin Squad'|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/L%20Disk/Lorenz%20Marita/Item%2011.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2013|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=September 20, 1977|location=New York|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of [[Orlando Bosch]], with [[Frank Sturgis]], [[Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz]], and two other Cubans present.&lt;ref name=Meskil/&gt; She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal.&lt;ref name=Meskil/&gt; Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying "rifles and scopes", but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived.&lt;ref name=Meskil/&gt; In response to her allegations, Sturgis said he did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated his previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref name=Meskil/&gt; In an interview with [[Steve Dunleavy]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'', he said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him.&lt;ref name=Dunleavy&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunleavy|first=Steve|title=Sturgis' Exclusive Story; Marita Pressured By Reds|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/S%20Disk/Sturgis%20Frank%20Fiorini/Item%2011.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2013|newspaper=New York Post|date=November 3, 1977|authorlink=Steve Dunleavy|location=New York|pages=3, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA). Her testimony was investigated by the political committee and said to be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/lorenz.html|title=JFK: Gaeton Fonzi on Marita Lorenz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1985, attorney [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] read a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] that Lorenz provided in [[E. Howard Hunt]]'s libel suit against the [[Liberty Lobby]]'s [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], ''[[The Spotlight]]''.&lt;ref name="The Ledger; February 6, 1985"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Former Castro witness links Oswald, Hunt |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ku8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2fsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4330%2C2089387 |newspaper=The Ledger |location=Lakeland, Florida |page=2B |date=February 6, 1985 |access-date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz lived in New York City at the time, however, Lane read the deposition in court stating that Lorenz was "afraid to come to Miami".&lt;ref name="The Ledger; February 6, 1985"/&gt; The deposition reiterated allegations similar to those she provided to the HSCA.&lt;ref name="The Ledger; February 6, 1985"/&gt; Lorenz said she met Oswald in Miami in the early 1960s, and that in November 1963 Sturgis asked her to come to Dallas with him and Oswald to act as a decoy.&lt;ref name="The Ledger; February 6, 1985"/&gt; Her statement said that she, Oswald, and seven anti-Castro Cubans transported weapons to Dallas in two cars shortly before November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name="The Ledger; February 6, 1985"/&gt; Lorenz claimed that Hunt came to their Dallas motel room and provided Sturgis with an envelope filled with cash.&lt;ref name="Ocala Star-Banner; February 5, 1985"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Howard Hunt Met Oswald In Dallas, Woman Says |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B6tPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1875%2C2146858 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |location=Ocala, Florida |agency=AP |page=2B |date=February 5, 1985 |access-date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, this testimony became the "centerpiece" for Lane's 1991 book ''[[Plausible Denial]]''.&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt;

In 1993, Lorenz was interviewed by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair writer]]'' [[Ann Louise Bardach]] who described her as "a patron saint of conspiracy buffs".&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt;  Bardach wrote "at least half of her story is readily documented by the accounts of others and [[FBI]] memorandum, the other half lacks any corroboration, at times, flies in the face of existing evidence."&lt;ref name="Bardach"/&gt;

==Work for the FBI==
In 1970 she married the manager of an apartment building in New York. The two worked for the FBI spying on [[Eastern Bloc]] UN diplomats living in the building.&lt;ref name=mov/&gt;

==Books and films==
With Ted Schwarz, Lorenz's first autobiography, ''Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy'', was published in 1993 by [[Thunder's Mouth Press]].&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56025-055-5 |work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=May 29, 2015|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=November 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book as "the wild—if nearly incredible—adventures of a new Jane Bond".&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marita-lorenz/marita/ |work=kirkusreviews.com|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=May 29, 2015|author=Kirkus Reviews|authorlink=Kirkus Reviews|date=October 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote: "Like other sensational conspiracy stories, this one presses the limits of credibility, but its very outrageousness gives it weight."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"/&gt; Her second autobiography ''Lieber Fidel – Mein Leben, meine Liebe, mein Verrat'' ({{ISBN|3471780793}}) appeared in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

'''Morgan Dana Harrington''' of [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]] (July 24, 1989 – October 17, 2009), was a 20-year-old American [[Virginia Tech]] student who disappeared from the [[John Paul Jones Arena]] on October 17, 2009, while attending a [[Metallica]] concert at the [[University of Virginia]] (UVA) in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. Her remains were discovered three months later in rural farmland. A forensic connection was later made to Jesse L.

== Disappearance ==
On October 17, 2009, Harrington and three friends drove to the [[John Paul Jones Arena]] at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] for a [[Metallica]] concert. During the opening act's performance, Harrington told friends that she was going to the restroom. When she did not return, they called her cell phone at 8:48pm and she told them that she was locked out of the arena because of its "no re-entry" policy, adding that she would find a way home and they should not worry. According to witness reports, she was last seen at around 9:30pm [[hitchhiking]] on a nearby bridge. There were also two witnesses who claimed to have seen her with three men after she had left the arena.

In April 2010, forensic tests confirmed that a [[Pantera]] T-shirt, which had been found in November 2009 outside of an apartment building about a mile-and-a-half from the arena, was indeed the shirt Harrington had been wearing on the night she went missing.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Courteney.

==Aftermath==
[[File:News-morgan-holiday-paintin.jpg|thumb|Morgan Harrington's mother, Gil, with a self-portrait by her daughter.|right]]
The case achieved such widespread national attention that the [[Virginia General Assembly]] honored the murdered student with a special resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtc.vt.edu/about/newsroom/releases/2010-03-09-va-general-assembly.html "Virginia general assembly honors former VTC intern Morgan Harrington: House Joint Resolution No. 357"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509002656/http://www.vtc.vt.edu/about/newsroom/releases/2010-03-09-va-general-assembly.html |date=May 9, 2010 }}. Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing provoked fears, expressed by her parents in many meetings with media including national television broadcasts, that a [[serial killer]] might be living in Virginia.&lt;ref name="the-hook-march-17-2010"/&gt; DNA was later tied to a September 2005 attempted abduction in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlox.com/story/12742496/update-morgan-harringtons-death-linked-to-case-in-fairfax Morgan Harrington's Death Linked to Case in Fairfax], accessed September 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crimestoppers]] offered a $100,000 reward, and the band playing on the night of Harrington's death, [[Metallica]], added an additional $50,000 reward for information leading to a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metallica.com/news/jan-09-2010-one-of-our-fans-is-missing.asp One Of Our Fans Is Missing]", Metallica.com, January 9, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710230438/http://www.metallica.com/news/jan-09-2010-one-of-our-fans-is-missing.asp |date=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her parents continued to appear at numerous special events, including the [[University of Virginia]]'s annual "Take Back the Night" rally &lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Hawes.

Charlottesville, Virginia. April 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and urged UVA administrators to work toward a safer campus.

In September 2014, Harrington's case was linked to the [[murder of Hannah Graham]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], through "forensic evidence" pertaining to Jesse Matthew, the main suspect in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wtvr.com/2014/09/29/hannah-graham-morgan-harrington-connection/|title=Forensic evidence links Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington cases|work=WTVR.com|accessdate=September 29, 2014|author=LAURA FRENCH|author2=SCOTT WISE|author3=ALIX BRYAN|author4=NICK DUTTON|others=WEB STAFF|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/29/evidence-links-suspect-in-hannah-graham-abduction-to-0-case/|title=Evidence links suspect in Hannah Graham abduction to '09 case|work=Fox News|accessdate=September 29, 2014|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 2014, Matthew was indicted in a 2005 abduction in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/26832199/jesse-matthew-indicted-for-2005-sexual-assault-in-fairfax-county |title=Jesse Matthew Indicted for 2005 Sexual Assault in Fairfax County |work=[[WVIR]] |date=October 20, 2014 |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |first=Henry |last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a decade earlier, Matthew had twice been accused of sexual assault at two separate Virginia colleges he attended as a student.

On March 2, 2016, after Matthew pleaded guilty to the 2014 murder of Hannah Graham and the 2009 murder of Morgan Harrington, a judge sentenced him to four consecutive life sentences.

The '''National Conservative Convention (NCC)''', is the most senior body of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party's]] voluntary wing. The National Convention effectively serves as the Party's internal Parliament, and is made up of its 800 highest-ranking Party Officers. 

The composition and functions of the NCC have evolved since its establishment in 1867. It has previously had a major role in policy-making and the planning of Party Conferences. Today, its primary purposes are to take charge of internal Party affairs and representing the views of Party members. Most crucially, it elects five members each year to sit on the [[Conservative Party Board]]. 

==History and structure==
The NCC was first established as the '''National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations'''. Its purpose was to oversee the running of the Party across the country, and plan Party Conferences. These functions remain largely the same today, and every year the President of the NCC continues to officially open the Party Conference.

Over time, the NUCUA's membership became more clearly defined, and has broadly been the same since the Party's set of extensive internal reforms following their defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 General Election]]. In 1998, new Party leader [[William Hague]] carried out another extensive reform which led to the NUCUA's renaming as the National Conservative Convention. In recent years, the Convention's influence over the running of the Party and its campaigning methods has increased heavily. Any changes to the [[Constitution of the Conservative Party]] must be approved by a majority vote of the NCC, and it plays a pivotal role in the inception and implementation of Party reforms, such as the [[Conservative Party Review (2016)|Conservative Party Review]].

The NCC includes a mix of appointed, directly and indirectly elected Party Officers. When members of the public join the Party, they are attached to the Conservative Association of the constituency they reside in. Party members elect their local Association Chairmen who sit on the Convention, and other local officials. Each Chairman and one Deputy Chairman sit on an Area Council, typically covering one or two Counties and several local authorities and constituencies. These Councils annually elect the Party's senior volunteers; Area and Regional Officers. All senior volunteers (approximately 150 Area and 30 Regional Officers) sit on the Convention. In addition to this, the [[Conservative Women's Organisation]] and [[Conservative Future]] (including their predecessor organisations) each send 40 delegates to the NCC, though Conservative Future has not sent delegates since its dissolution. In 2014, 16 year old Isaac Duffy became the youngest ever member of the National Convention.

The NCC meets three times a year; at [[Conservative Party Conference]], the [[Conservative Spring Forum]], and for its own election meeting, usually held in the summer. The Convention Executive (elected annually by its members) consists of its Chairman, who serves for three years, three Vice-Presidents, who each serve for three years, and the President, who serves for one year. Generally speaking, after finishing their term, an outgoing Vice-President is elected as the President and Chairs that year's Party Conference. Officers typically run for election for the NCC's Executive only after several decades of experience in the Party. The Party Leader and Chairman attend Convention meetings and address its members. There are also regular meetings of Senior Volunteers (Area and Regional Officers) in between full Convention meetings.

'''Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù''', translated as '''The Noble Theatre of Saint James of Corfu''', or simply '''Teatro di San Giacomo''', was a theatre in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]] which became the centre of Greek [[opera]] between 1733 and 1893.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"&gt;Kardamis, Kostas. [https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155757/http://www.donizettisociety.com/Articles/ArticleMantzaros/BirthofGreekopera.pdf Birth of Greek Opera]. "San Giacomo and Greek ottocento" XI Convegno Annuale di Società Italiana di Musicologia [[Lecce]], 22–24 October 2004. Archive from 16 October 2015 (accessed 4 December 2017). Quotes: "Originally it functioned as the loggia of the island’s Venetian nobility, but in 1720 it was converted into a theatre, which, despite being one more theatre in the provinces of Serenissima, became the first modern theatre on Greek soil." - "These activities are of particular importance for the music history of modern Greece, since in an era when there was not such a thing as Greek State in Greek Mainland (let alone organized musical activities)." - "San Giacomo gradually acted as a pole that could hold in Corfu adequate and often well-qualified players and teachers from Italy. This resulted to the increasing interest towards music, a fact that had both cultural and social roots, and to the gradual emergence of a series of indigenous players, becoming this way the first professional musicians of modern Greece." - "Our knowledge for the activities of San Giacomo was until recently very limited, mainly due to the loss of its valuable archive during a German bombing in 1943." - "Spiridon Xindas is widely known as the composer of the opera O ypopsifios (1867), the first opera on Greek libretto." - "In 1867 the opera O Ypopsifios [The Parliamentary Candidate] was performed in San Giacomo by local amateurs. This was the first opera to use a full-scale libretto in Greek and which shows the creative assimilation of Italian and Greek musical perspectives in the Ionians."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its provincial origins it attracted Italian musicians and composers, many of whom became permanent residents of Corfu and contributed to the local music scene.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; The theatre acted as a [[catalyst]] in this cultural interaction and gave impetus to the development of the Ionian School of Music.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; Corfiot composer [[Nikolaos Mantzaros|Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros]] was a beneficiary of the [[synergy]] between the Italian and Corfiot musical traditions.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;

Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo was named after a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in Corfu. Established in 1693 as a gathering place of the Venetian nobility of Corfu it was converted into a theatre in 1720 and became the first modern theatre to be established in Greece.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; Initially the theatre staged theatrical plays but in 1733 an opera was performed there for the first time.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; The opera was A. Aurelli’s ''Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa''.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; The operas were continuously staged especially between 1771 and 1892 when the theatre was converted to a [[City Hall]].&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;

This photograph shows the theatre prior to the 1943 [[Luftwaffe]] bombardment and its subsequent destruction during World War II.]]

The musical tradition established by the theatre is especially important to the history of modern Greek music since it helped establish a Greek musical presence at a time when the Greek State did not even exist.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; The theatre staged the type of comic opera known as [[opera buffa]] which was less elaborate and therefore more economical than the full-fledged [[opera seria]].&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; San Giacomo's opera crews were mainly from southern [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;
[[Image:Stage curtain of San Giacomo.jpg|thumb|200px|The historic stage curtain of Teatro di San Giacomo depicting a scene from the [[Odyssey]]]]
The opera house functioned during times of upheaval unabated as, for example, during the arrival of the French in 1797.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; In 1799, during the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] siege, the theatre continued its performances even as the foreign opera troupe was unable to leave the island due to the blockade.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; The performance at such a challenging time was used as a means for [[propaganda]] and to raise the morale of the population.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;

The theatre attracted many Italian professional musicians who came to Corfu as teachers as well as composers and performers.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; This had the effect of generating an appreciation for music among the locals and this gradually led to the appearance of the first Corfiot music professionals who, in turn, became the first professional musicians of modern Greece.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt; Corfiot [[Spyridon Xyndas]], for example, wrote the Greek opera ''[[O ypopsifios]]'' (''The Parliamentary Candidate'') which became the first opera composed on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]] and was performed at San Giacomo in 1867.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sansimera.gr/archive/biographies/show.php?id=306&amp;name=Spyridon_Xyndas San Simera - Biography of Spyridon Xyndas (in Greek)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111174225/http://www.sansimera.gr/archive/biographies/show.php?id=306&amp;name=Spyridon_Xyndas |date=2008-01-11 }} - Translated quote: "His most famous opera is the "Parliamentary Candidate" which premiered in 1867 at the San Giacomo theatre of Corfu."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-ionia.gr/main.php?lang=1&amp;cat=17&amp;page=631&amp;p_id=2&amp;i_id=1 Ionian Islands Culture] - Quote: "In 1867 in San Giacomo theatre in Corfu premiers the first opera of Xyndas with a social critique topic entitled “Parliament Candidate” which was the first melodrama ever written by a Greek composer on a totally Greek libretto (of Ioannis Rinopoulos)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The oral tradition held that operatic performers who found success at the theater were distinguished with the accolade ''applaudito in Corfú'' ("applauded in Corfu") as a tribute to the discriminating musical taste of the island audience.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406075417/http://www.corfu.gr/en/profil/theatro.htm Corfu - History of the Municipal Theatre via the Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was replaced by the [[Municipal Theatre of Corfu]] in 1902. The Municipal Theatre and its historical archives, many of which belonged to Teatro di San Giacomo, were destroyed during a [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raid in 1943.&lt;ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

'''Pilferage''' is the [[theft]] of part of the contents of a package. It may also include theft of the contents but leaving the package, perhaps resealed with bogus contents.  Small packages can be pilfered from a larger package such as a [[shipping container]].  Broader and related aspects of [[theft]] may include taking the entire package, pallet load, truck load, [[shoplifting]], etc.

==Solutions==
Solutions involve ''all phases'' of product production, [[packaging]], distribution, [[logistics]], sale, and use. No single solution is considered as "pilfer proof". Often, [[packaging engineer]]s, [[logistics]] engineers, and security professionals have  addressed multiple levels of [[security]]  to reduce the risk of pilfering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Each situation is unique.  Some considerations have included:
* Identifying who a potential pilferer might be: an internal employee, security guard, truck driver, delivery person, receiver (consignee), organized crime, etc. Engineers usually start with knowing what level of knowledge, materials, tools, etc. might they have.
* Identifying all feasible methods of unauthorized access into a product, package, or system. In addition to the primary means of entry, engineers also consider secondary or "back door" methods. 
* Identifying available means of resealing, reclosing, or replacing special seals. 
* Using extra strong and secure packaging: A weak or damaged package is an invitation to pilferage.
* Considering unique custom seals and [[label]]s (changing regularly because these are subject to [[counterfeit]]ing)
* Improving the pilfer resistance to make pilfering more difficult, time-consuming, etc. 
* Concealing the identity and value of a pilferable item.  Logistics and packaging professionals do not want to bring attention to the item, its package, addresses, names, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''post–World War I recession''' was an [[economic]] [[recession]] that hit much of the world in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. In many nations, especially in [[North America]], economic growth continued and even accelerated during [[World War I]] as nations mobilized their economies to fight the war in [[Europe]]. After the war ended, the global economy began to decline.  In the [[United States]], 1918–1919 saw a modest economic retreat, but the second part of 1919 saw a mild recovery.  A [[Depression of 1920–21|more severe recession]] hit the United States in 1920 and 1921, when the global economy fell very sharply.

== North America ==
In North America, the recession immediately following World War I was extremely brief, lasting for only seven months from August 1918 (even before the war had actually ended) to March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions], [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. Retrieved on September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second, much more severe recession, sometimes labeled a [[economic depression|depression]], began in January 1920.  Several indices of economic activity suggest the recession was moderately severe.  The Axe-Houghton Index of Index of Trade and Industrial Activity declined by 14.1% in this recession (compared to a 31% decline in the [[Panic of 1907]]).  The Babson index of physical volume of business activity declined by 28.6% in this recession (compared to a 2.3% decline in the 1921 recession and a 22.7% decline in the Panic of 1907).&lt;ref name=Zarnowitz&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Cycles|author=[[Victor Zarnowitz|Zarnowitz, Victor]]|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=It seems like the 28.6% decline and the 2.3% decline both refer to the 1920-21 recession/depression.|date=March 2016}}

== Germany ==
In [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], the economic recession and inflation was harder due to the imposition of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. A [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|period of hyperinflation]] severely devalued the [[German Papiermark|Mark]] and nearly crippled the German economy.


==United Kingdom==
Britain initially enjoyed an economic boom between 1919&amp;ndash;1920, as private capital pent-up over four years of war was invested into the economy.&lt;ref name="Carter &amp; Mears 2011"&gt;{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter &amp; Mears| year=2011| p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shipbuilding industry was flooded with orders to replace lost shipping (7.9 million tons worth of merchant shipping stock was destroyed during the war). However, by 1921, the British transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy faltered, and a serious recession struck the economy between 1921&amp;ndash;1922. With other major economies also mired in recession, the export-dependent economy of Britain was particularly hard-hit. Unemployment reached 17%, with overall exports at only half of their pre-war levels.&lt;ref name="Carter &amp; Mears 2011"/&gt;

'''Pro-war rhetoric''' is [[rhetoric]] or [[propaganda]] designed to convince its audience that war is necessary. The two main analytical approaches to pro-war rhetoric were founded by Ronald Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and [[Robert Ivie]], a Professor of Rhetoric and Public Communication and Culture at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University (Bloomington)]]. Reid's framework originated from inductively studying propaganda. Ivie uses a deductive approach based on the work of [[Kenneth Burke]], claiming that "a people strongly committed to the ideal of peace, but simultaneously faced with the reality of war, must believe that the fault for any such disruption of their ideal lies with others" (Ivie 279).

==Rhetorical framework of Ronald Reid==
According to Reid, pro-war rhetoric uses three appeals: territorial, ethnocentric, and optimistic..

===Territorial appeals===

Territorial appeals threaten the audience's "sense of territoriality" (Reid 260). The audience is more likely to support entering the war on the defensive rather than offensive side because of an actual or threatened invasion.

===Ethnocentric appeals===
Ethnocentric appeals create a dichotomy between the audience and the enemy. [[Ethnocentrism]] should be evoked to a "high level of emotional intensity" in attempt to complete two goals: hate the "inferior alien" and depict threats to cultural values (Reid 267).

The most common method of evoking ethnocentric appeals come in the form of Barbarism vs. Gallantry (Reid 269). It depicts the enemy's cultural values with evil characteristics, and the audience's as angelic.

===Optimistic appeal===
The optimistic appeal assures the audience that victory is inevitable should they enter into war.(Reid 282).

==Rhetorical framework of Robert Ivie==
According to Ivie, pro-war rhetoric identifies three topoi; force vs. freedom, irrational vs. rational, and aggression vs. defense.

===Force vs. freedom===
This tactic portrays to the audience that they are entering war to provide freedom, and the opponent to force their values upon others (Ivie 284). This is accomplished by implying that the opponent is violent, while the audience's nation is willing to negotiate (Ivie 284).

===Irrational vs. rational===
This [[topos]] holds that the enemy is portrayed as irrational, responding "more to animalistic drives than principles of law" (Ivie 288). The enemy has an unenlightened intellect, not based on reason. Rhetors use this argument to prove that when an enemy such as this threatens the well-being of the world, even for a nation committed to neutrality and peace, war is the only choice (Ivie 289).

===Aggression vs. defense===
This idea portrays the enemy as the voluntary aggressor and the nation of the audience as the passive victims of aggression, only entering into war to ensure security (Ivie 290). "While the savage has acted against order, the victim has been forced to respond in its defense" (Ivie 290). Ivie describes the actions as either "voluntary" and "initial" or "involuntary" and "defensive" (Ivie 290). The purpose of this topos is to lay the blame on the enemy and justify reasons for the victimized nation to engage in action.

'''PuppetFest Midwest''' was an annual, four-day [[puppetry]] [[festival]] with the distinction of being an independent conference put together and funded by puppeteers. The festival occurred annually for 10 years, from 2003 to 2012. This workshop was designed to be a small and intimate experience for attendees that would encourage, inspire, and train them to develop their skills and techniques to demonstrate good puppet theatre. PuppetFest Midwest featured a variety of workshops by professional puppeteers, world-class performances, and exhibits.

==Location==
PuppetFest Midwest was located on the campus of [[North Central Missouri College]] in [[Trenton, Missouri]] and also at the Grundy County Jewett Norris Library in Trenton. 

The festival ended after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.puppetfestival.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">'''Ritualcide''' is the systematic destruction or alteration of traditional ritual practices and their sequencing. Rituals have a prescribed form, source, and sequence that include sacred objects, places, times and seasons, music, dance, texts, songs and words, and mediators (such as monks, spirit mediums, religious leaders, and traditional healers). Ritualcide is not necessarily linked to [[genocide]], but ''genocidal priming''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=Alex|title=Why did they kill? : Cambodia in the shadow of genocide|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520241794|edition=2nd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may gain a handhold when regimes tamper with collective tradition and leave inhabitants vulnerable and/or susceptible to spirit-based harm and angst. Herein ancestral pathways for intimate connection are often disrupted.

The term ''ritualcide'' was coined by Peg LeVine in ''Love and Dread in Cambodia: Weddings, Births and Ritual Harm Under the Khmer Rouge,'' which emerged from an eight-year ethnographic study into ''Khmer Rouge weddings'' and Cambodian ritual history before, during and after Democratic Kampuchea. The definition was expanded in 2015 when LeVine continued research at the [[USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education|Shoah Foundation]], Center for Advanced Genocide Research. In October, 2016, ritualcide was introduced at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in conjunction with Khmer Rouge activity between 1975 and 1979; when LeVine gave expert witness, she suggested it was a "crime against culture". She has shown how ritual loss complicates the aftermath of trauma for the living and the dead, and ruptures the cosmological order that binds ancestors. Also, without access to reliable, traditional ritual sources, collective fear and vulnerability increase for survivors. In genocide and [[Holocaust]] studies, ritual restoration holds relevance for recovery by survivors and ancestors, and their collective sense of protection and cultural continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeVine|first1=Peg|title=Love and dread in Cambodia : weddings, births, and ritual harm under the Khmer Rouge|date=2010|publisher=NUS Press|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9971-69-472-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140716141308.htm|title=Sexual harassment, assault common on scientific field studies, survey indicates|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/fed-up-with-sexual-harassment-ii-safe.html|title=Women In Astronomy: Fed Up with Sexual Harassment II: The SAFE study w/ Dr. Kate Clancy|last=Richey|first=Christina|date=2014-09-11|website=Women In Astronomy|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2015-03-11|title=Social behaviour: Indecent advances|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7542-251a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=251–253|doi=10.1038/nj7542-251a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201512/astronomy.cfm|title=Astronomy Allies Team Up to Confront Sexual Harassment|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-end-sexual-harassment-in-astronomy1/|title=How to End Sexual Harassment in Astronomy|last=Urry|first=Meg|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has had a major impact on American [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/30/us/astronomy-sexual-harassment/index.html|title=Sexual harassment in STEM: 'It's tragic'|last=CNN|first=Sara Ganim,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the [[United States Congress|USA Congress]] to counter sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2018-02-08|title=US science agency will require universities to report sexual harassment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01744-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7692|pages=287–288|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01744-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/transcript-of-my-oral-testimony-from-february-27th-congressional-hearing-on-sexual-misconduct-in-the-sciences/|title=Transcript of my oral testimony from February 27th Congressional hearing on sexual misconduct in the sciences {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-now-studies-of-sexual-harassment-show-the-way/|title=What Happens Now?

Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://breakingbio.com/2014/10/07/breaking-bio-episode-68-safe13-with-drs-clancy-nelson-rutherford-hinde/|title="Breaking Bio Episode 68 – #SAFE13 with Drs.

{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox}}

The '''San Remo conference''' was an international meeting of the post-[[World War I]] [[Allied Supreme Council]] as an outgrowth of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919| Paris Peace Conference]], held at Villa Devachan in [[Sanremo]], Italy, from 19 to 26 April 1920. Resolutions passed at this conference determined the allocation of Class "A" [[League of Nations mandate]]s for the administration of [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|former Ottoman]] three territories in the [[Middle East]]: Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia. Whilst Syria and Mesopotamia were provisionally recognized as states, Palestine was not.&lt;ref name="Quigley2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Quigley|title=The Statehood of Palestine: International Law in the Middle East Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTR3BQ0aJ6UC&amp;pg=PA29|date=6 September 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49124-2|pages=29|quote=The provision on Palestine thus read differently from the provision on Syria and Mesopotamia and omitted reference to any provisional recognition of Palestine as an independent state. The provision on Palestine read differently for the apparent reason that the mandatory would administer, hence the thrust of the provision was to make that point clear. In any event, the understanding of the resolution was that all the Class A mandates were states. Before leaving San Remo, Curzon telegraphed a memorandum to the Foreign Office in London to explain the San Remo decisions. In explaining to the Foreign Office how the boundaries between the mandate territories would he fixed, Curzon wrote that "[t]he boundaries of these States will not be included in the Peace Treaty [with Turkey] but are also to be determined by the principal Allied Powers."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The boundaries of the three territories were left unspecified, to "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers."&lt;ref name="Quigley2010"/&gt; Three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] state precipitated the British need to know 'what is the "Syria" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and "does it include Transjordania?"&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Hubert Young to Ambassador Hardinge (Paris), 27 July 1920, FO 371/5254, cited in King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan, Mary Christina Wilson, Cambridge,1988, {{ISBN|0-521-32421-1}}, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the mandated area of Palestine without adding it to the area of the Jewish National Home&lt;ref&gt;A telegram from Earl Curzon to Sir Herbert Samuel, dated 6 August 1920 stated: "I suggest that you should let it be known forthwith that in the area south of the Sykes-Picot line, we will not admit French authority and that our policy for this area to be independent but in closest relations with Palestine;" (in Rohan Butler et al., Documents of British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, first series volume XIII London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963, p. 331.) Karsh writes that at the same time Curzon instructed [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Vansittart]] to leave the eastern boundary of Palestine undefined, stating: "His Majesty's Government are already treating 'Trans-Jordania' as separate from the Damascus State, while at the same time avoiding any definite connection between it and Palestine, thus leaving the way open for the establishment there, should it become advisable, of some form of independent Arab government, perhaps by arrangement with King Hussein or other Arab chiefs concerned."{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1E_SATQRKjoC&amp;pg=PA317|title=Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923|first1=Efraim|last1=Karsh|first2=Inari|last2=Karsh|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wilson|first1= Mary|title= King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/King_Abdullah_Britain_and_the_Making_of.html?id=yUGYsBRpqPkC&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate= 26 Feb 2012|year= 1990|pages= 44|quote= Since the end of the war the territory north of Ma'an had been ruled by Damascus as a province of Faysal's Kingdom of Syria.

Transjordan was not excised but, on the contrary, added to the mandatory area. Zionism was barred from seeking to expand there – but the Balfour Declaration had never previously applied to the area east of the Jordan. Why is this important? Because the myth of Palestine's 'first partition' has become part of the concept of 'Greater Israel' and of the ideology of Jabotinsky's Revisionist movement."&lt;/ref&gt; – and the French proclaimed [[Greater Lebanon]] and [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|other component states of its Syrian mandate]] on 31 August 1920. The boundaries were not finalized until four years later.

It was attended by the four Principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers of World War I]] who were represented by the prime ministers of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] ([[David Lloyd George]]), [[France]] ([[Alexandre Millerand]]), [[Italy]] ([[Francesco Nitti]]) and by [[Japan]]'s Ambassador [[Matsui Keishirō|Keishirō Matsui]].

==Background==
During the meetings of the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Council of Four]] in 1919, British Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]] was the basis for the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] which proposed an independent Arab state or confederation of states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=1 "The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919", pages 1 thru 8]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1919 the parliament of Greater Syria had refused to acknowledge any right claimed by the French Government to any part of Syrian territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n706ShSYt-sC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=&amp;ei=uK_tSLW6GomyyQTgr4H5Bg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U094g1OESzC-POjm1FT4LvlXTNt9Q King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979], {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 161&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1918 supporters of the [[Arab Revolt]] in [[Damascus]] declared a government loyal to Sharif Hussein, who had been declared "King of the Arabs" by religious leaders and other notables in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhSge_Tq09sC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=Zw1GSY3JBpXyNty-kCw&amp;client=#PPA6,M1 Jordan: Living in the Crossfire, Alan George, Zed Books, 2005], {{ISBN|1-84277-471-9}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 1920  the then Prince [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] initialed an agreement with French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] which acknowledged "the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation".&lt;ref&gt;Britain, the Hashemites and Arab Rule, 1920–1925, by Timothy J. Paris, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7146-5451-5}}, Page 69&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Syrian National Congress|Pan-Syrian Congress]], meeting in Damascus, had declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0NwLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA665&amp;dq=&amp;ei=MxJGSb7dKpW6M4nWzLgJ&amp;client= King's Complete History of the World War, William C. King, The History Associates, 1922, page 665]&lt;/ref&gt; The new state included Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and portions of northern Mesopotamia which had been set aside under the Sykes-Picot Agreement for an independent Arab state or confederation of states. Faisal was declared the head of state. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal's brother, was declared regent of Mesopotamia.

==History==
The San Remo conference was convened following [[Conference of London (1920)]] and the proclamation on 8 March 1920 by the [[Syrian National Congress]]  of an independent [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]]. It was attended by the prime ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy, and representatives of Japan, Greece, and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521598/Conference-of-San-Remo Britannica online: San Remo Conference: Retrieved 18 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several issues were addressed: a peace treaty with Turkey, League of Nation mandates in the Middle East, Germany's obligations under the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]] of 1919, and the Allies' position on Soviet Russia.&lt;ref name="HDEI"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;lpg=PA543&amp;dq=san+remo+agreement+1920&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D1LmWashq3&amp;sig=LQy-Wp3Cj4rsI-p4tj_NBtFIVqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DRK0UZLvLua40QWRwYEY&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=san%20remo%20agreement%201920&amp;f=true Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism, eds. James Stuart Olson, Robert Shadle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain and France agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia, while claiming mandates for their administration. Palestine was composed of the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman administrative districts of southern Syria]]. Under international law, premature recognition of its independence would be a gross affront to the government of the newly declared parent state. It could have been construed as a belligerent act of intervention without any League of Nations sanction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=shU9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=&amp;ei=V-pISffkA474MKbuwMAN&amp;client=#PPA116,M1 International Law, Papers of Hersch Lauterpacht, edited by Elihu Lauterpacht, CUP Archive, 1970], {{ISBN|0-521-21207-3}}, page 116 and [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7UOyPGYBkwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=3OFISe7xCY6ukASRncXEBg&amp;client= Statehood and the Law of Self-determination, D.

For France, the San Remo decision meant that most of its claims in Syria were internationally recognized and relations with Faisal were now subject to French military and economic considerations. The ability of Great Britain to limit French action was also significantly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13974397.html France in Syria: The abolition of the Sharifian government, April–July 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; France issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] in July 1920, deposing the Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In 1920, Great Britain appointed [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel]] as high commissioner and established a mandatory government in Palestine that remained in power until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCI/CCCLXI/753.extract Herbert Samuel and the Palestine Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|League of Nations Covenant]], which contained the general rules to be applied to all [[League of Nations mandate|Mandated Territories]], was written two months before the signing of the Versaille Peace Treaty. It was not known at that time to which territories paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 would relate. The territories which came under the regime set up by this article were three former parts of the Ottoman Empire and seven former overseas possessions of Germany referred to in Part IV, Section I, of the treaty of peace. Those 10 territorial areas were originally administered under 15 mandates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv13&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=94 FRUS, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919, Volume XII Treaty Of Versailles, Annotations Of the Text]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
The decisions of the San Remo conference confirmed the mandate allocations of the First [[Conference of London (February 1920)]]. The San Remo Resolution adopted on 25 April 1920 incorporated the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 1917. It and Article 22 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]] were the basic documents upon which the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] was constructed. Under the Balfour Declaration, the British government had undertaken to favour the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. Britain received the mandate for Palestine and [[Iraq]]; France gained control of Syria, including present-day Lebanon. Britain and France also signed the [[San Remo Oil Agreement]], whereby Britain granted France a 25 percent share of the oil production from Mosul, with the remainder going to Britain&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=71sMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;dq=%22Great+Britain%22+France+25+percent+OR+%25+oil+produced+Mosul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XFC0mCA80h&amp;sig=Vb34UzpHTBPkuRf923oVW7elD2c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBWoVChMI96HswOHpxwIVhxgeCh3pjARF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Britain%22%20France%2025%20percent%20OR%20%25%20oil%20produced%20Mosul&amp;f=false The Journal of International Relations, Vol. 11, 1921, p. 329]&lt;/ref&gt; and France undertook to deliver oil to the Mediterranean. The draft peace agreement with Turkey signed at the conference became the basis for the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres. Germany was called upon to carry out its military and reparation obligations under the Versailles Treaty, and a resolution was adopted in favor of restoring trade with Russia.&lt;ref name="HDEI" /&gt;

Asserting that not all parts of the Middle East were ready for full independence, mandates were established for the government of three territories: Syria and Lebanon, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Palestine. In each case, one of the Allied Powers was assigned to implement the mandate until the territories in question could "stand alone."

In 2010, a panel discussion was held in San Remo on the subject of the conference's legal significance for the status of Israel and [[Positions on Jerusalem | Jerusalem]] under international law.

'''San Remo Resolution – 25 April 1920'''

'''It was agreed –'''

'''(a)''' To accept the terms of the Mandates Article as given below with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the [[procès-verbal]] an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine; this undertaking not to refer to the question of the religious protectorate of France, which had been settled earlier in the previous afternoon by the undertaking given by the French Government that they recognized this protectorate as being at an end.

'''(b)''' that the terms of the Mandates Article should be as follows:

The High Contracting Parties agree that Syria and Mesopotamia shall, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 22, Part I (Covenant of the League of Nations), be provisionally recognized as independent States, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The boundaries of the said States will be determined, and the selection of the Mandatories made, by the Principal Allied Powers.

The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory, to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on the 8th [2nd] November, 1917, by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.

''La Puissance mandataire s’engage à nommer dans le plus bref delai une Commission speciale pour etudier toute question et toute reclamation concernant les differentes communautes religieuses et en etablir le reglement. Il sera tenu compte dans la composition de cette Commission des interets religieux en jeu. Le President de la Commission sera nommé par le Conseil de la Societé des Nations.''
[The Mandatory undertakes to appoint in the shortest time a special commission to study any subject and any queries concerning the different religious communities and regulations. The composition of this Commission will reflect the religious interests at stake. The President of the Commission will be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations.]

The terms of the mandates in respect of the above territories will be formulated by the Principal Allied Powers and submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for approval.

Turkey hereby undertakes, in accordance with the provisions of Article [132 of the Treaty of Sèvres] to accept any decisions which may be taken in this connection.

'''(c)''' ''Les mandataires choisis par les principales Puissances alliés sont: la France pour la Syrie, et la Grande Bretagne pour la Mesopotamie, et la Palestine.''
[The officers chosen by the principal allied Powers are: France for Syria and Great Britain for Mesopotamia and Palestine.]

In reference to the above decision the Supreme Council took note of the following reservation of the Italian Delegation:

''La Delegation Italienne en consideration des grands interêts economiques que l’Italie en tant que puissance exclusivement mediterranéenne possède en Asie Mineure, reserve son approbation à la presente resolution, jusqu’au reglement des interêts italiens en Turquie d’Asie.''
[The Italian delegation, in view of the great economic interests that Italy, as an exclusively Mediterranean power, possesses in Asia Minor, withholds its approval of this resolution until Italian interests in Turkey in Asia shall have been settled.]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/san_remo_palestine_1920.htm ''San Remo Resolution-Palestine Mandate 1920''], MidEastWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote  = In the north, the three bands which came under Treaty Six all chose reserves in their traditional hunting areas. Alexis' band, with 42 families, took a reserve on the shores of Lac Ste. Anne, while Paul's band settled on Lake Wabamun. Initially, Sharphead's followers were at Pigeon Lake but when the fisheries failed in 1883, they were induced to take a reserve on Wolf Creek, just south of the present town of Ponoka.

Of all the Stoney bands in Alberta, the Sharpheads had the most tragic history. Although consisting of 36 families in 1883, they were struck down by a measles epidemic three years later and, in 1889 and 1890, epidemics of grippe and influenza reduced them to a mere handful. In the latter year, their reserve was closed, with most of the survivors going to Paul's band, and a few to Morley

The '''Sharphead band''' was an [[First Nations in Alberta|indigenous people]] of what is now [[central Alberta]], which was a part of the [[Stoney (Nakoda)]] ethno-linguistic group and was party to [[Treaty 6]] (1876) with the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Crown]].  The Sharphead were devastated by hunger and disease and ceased to exist as a separate people after 1897 when their [[Indian reserve|reserve lands]] were taken by the Canadian government and the few remaining survivors were dispersed to live with other neighbouring First Nations.

== Post-contact history ==
Following their entry into treaty, the Sharphead people continued to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle until 1885 when the '''Sharphead Indian Reserve No.141''' was created within the [[District of Alberta|District of Alberta, Northwest Territories]] (later the [[Province of Alberta]]) under the terms of the ''[[Indian Act]]''.  As surveyed in October 1885, the reserve had an area of {{convert|42.4|sqmi}} along the [[Battle River]] and [[Battle River#Tributaries|Wolf Creek]], and included a [[Methodism in Canada|Methodist]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty No. 6, N.W.T. Plan of Indian Reserve No. 141, Battle River, Chief Sharp-Head....Surveyed in October 1885 by J.C. Nelson, D.L.S....|url=http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/databases/indian-reserves/001004-119.02-e.php?&amp;isn_id_nbr=1938&amp;interval=50&amp;page_sequence_nbr=1&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=vghgimbut6l8g7mcqlssdkf7c2|website=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canadian colonial records, between 1886 and 1893 the band was devastated by [[smallpox]], crop failures, and declining hunting. During that time, more than half of the population is estimated to have died, while the survivors dispersed and moved to other reserves. The band was deemed to be extinct by the federal government and the reserve land was surrendered in 1897 and divided into [[Dominion Lands Act|homesteads for Euro-Canadian settlers]].&lt;ref name=sun /&gt; Oral history among local peoples has circulated the idea that the Sharphead were deliberately killed by government officials via infected blankets or tainted meat in an act of "[[genocide]]", an accusation voiced in 2014 by [[Kurt Buffalo]], a Sharphead descendant and chief of the nearby [[Samson Cree Nation]].  However, there is no historical evidence regarding this theory according to [[Roger Epp]], vice-provost of academics at the University of Alberta. Historical records around the Sharphead are very sparse and it was not until the mid-1970s that researchers were able to trace Sharphead descendants to 15 neighbouring bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morin|first1=Brandi|title=Remains of 28 First Nations people reburied after nearly 50 years in storage|url=http://aptn.ca/news/2014/10/20/first-nation-remains-reburied-nearly-50-years-storage/|accessdate=10 November 2014|agency=APTN National News|publisher=Aboriginal Peoples' Television Network|date=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement towards securing a surrender of the land seems to have been initiated by [[Hayter Reed]] first as Indian Commissioner, then, after 1893, as Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.  As well, outside pressure from [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], a prominent Edmonton Liberal, publisher of the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' and future cabinet minister, seems to have played a part, according to a 1998 report by Peggy Martin-McGuire for the [[Indian Claims Commission]].&lt;ref name=ICC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin-McGuire|first1=Peggy Martin-McGuire|title=First Nation Land Surrenders on the Prairies 1896-1911|date=1998|publisher=Indian Claims Commission|location=Ottawa|pages=166–168|url=http://iportal.usask.ca/docs/ICC/FNLS_summary_eng.pdf |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 workers installing an electrical power line discovered human remains from 26 individuals at a cemetery site on the former reserve.  The remains were taken by the University of Alberta's anthropology department for study until 1970 when they were put in storage because the then-owner of the land containing the burial site did not want them reinterred.&lt;ref name=sun /&gt;  In 2007 electrical workers discovered more remains on the same site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction crew finds human remains|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=3854c851-ea17-496d-b8e0-b018a85301af|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=Calgary Herald|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prompted the provincial government and 14 nearby bands to begin to search for a new burial site for the remains.  In the summer of 2013 land was purchased by the provincial government near the town of [[Ponoka, Alberta|Ponoka]] close to the [[Battle River]].

During the 20th century, there were various alleged instances of [[soap]] being made from human [[body fat]]. During [[World War I]] it was claimed in the British press that the Germans had a [[German Corpse Factory|corpse factory]] in which they used the bodies of their own soldiers to make glycerine and soap. During [[World War II]] it was believed that [[soap]] was being [[mass production|mass-produced]] from the bodies of the victims of [[Nazi concentration camps]] located in [[German-occupied Poland]]. During [[Nuremberg trials]] evidence was presented that German researchers had developed a process for the production of soap from human bodies.&lt;ref name="Nuremberg, Robert E 1984, pp. 298-9"&gt;Justice at Nuremberg, Robert E.

==History==

===1786===
In 1780, the former [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]] in [[Paris]] was closed because of overuse. In 1786, the bodies were exhumed and the bones were moved to the [[Catacombs of Paris|Catacombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paris-promenades.com/en/site_text/III.htm|title=Paris' Les Innocents cemetery |publisher=|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bodies had incompletely decomposed and had reduced into deposits of [[adipocere|fat]]. During the exhumation, this fat was collected and subsequently turned into candles and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anecdotes-from-the-archive/you-posthumously-light-up-my-life/|title=You (posthumously) light up my life|date=15 April 2011|work=Scientific American blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
{{main|German Corpse Factory}}
The claim that Germans used the fat from human corpses to make products, including soap, was made during [[World War I]]. This appears to have originated as rumor among British soldiers and Belgians. The first recorded reference is in 1915 when [[Cynthia Asquith]] noted in her diary (16 June 1915): "We discussed the rumour that the Germans utilise even their corpses by converting them into glycerine with the by-product of soap."&lt;ref name=nea&gt;Neander, Joachim, ''The German Corpse Factory. The Master Hoax of British Propaganda in the First World War'', Saarland University Press, 2013, pp.79-85.&lt;/ref&gt; It became a major international story when ''[[The Times]]'' of London reported in April 1917 that the Germans had admitted [[rendering (animals)|rendering]] the bodies of their dead soldiers for fat to make soap and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knightley |first=Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Knightley |title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo |publisher=Prion |year=2000 |pages=105–106 |isbn=1-85375-376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war [[John Charteris]], the former head of army intelligence, was reported to have claimed in a 1925 speech that he had invented the story. He subsequently insisted that his remarks had been misreported. The controversy led the British Foreign Secretary Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] to officially state that the government accepted that the "corpse factory" story was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ponsonby |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Ponsonby |title=Falsehood in Wartime |publisher=Dutton |year=1928 |location=New York |pages=102, 111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the British had deliberately invented the story was later used by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Marlin, Randal (2002). ''Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion'', Broadview, pp. 73–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Rumours that the Nazis produced soap from the bodies of concentration camp inmates circulated widely during the war. Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The "human soap" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ''{{lang|de|Reichs-Juden-Fett}}'' ("State Jewish Fat"); in [[Blackletter#Fraktur|German Blackletter]] font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ''{{lang|de|Reichsstelle für industrielle Fettversorgung}}'' ("National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waxman |first=Zoë |authorlink=|title=Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-920638-4 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors about the origins and meaning of "RIF" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book ''Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia'', describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters "RIF" inscribed on a center depression. When one of the POWs complained about the low-foam, smooth soap, the lady of the household answered it was made of "''{{lang|de|Rein Juden Fett}}''" (pure Jewish fat), when asked "out of human fat?", she answered "No, just Jews". A version of the story is included in ''[[Black Book (World War II)|The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry]]'', one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the [[Holocaust]], assembled by Soviet writers [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]]. The specific story is part of a report titled "The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov" attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht:

{{quote|In another section of the Belzec camp was an enormous soap factory. The Germans picked out the fattest Jews, murdered them, and boiled them down for soap. Artur [Izrailevich] Rozenshtraukh—a bank clerk from Lvov, in whose words we relate this testimony—held this "Jewish soap" in his own hands.

The Gestapo thugs never denied the existence of a "production process" of this kind. Whenever they wanted to intimidate a Jew, they would say to him, "We'll make soap out of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrenburg |first=Ilya |author2=Il'ja Grigor'jevic Erenburg |author3=Vasilij Semenovic Grossman |display-authors=etal |title=The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2003 |page=82 |isbn=0-7658-0543-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Raul Hilberg]] reports such stories as circulating in [[Lublin]] as early as October 1942. The Germans themselves were aware of the stories, as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-chief {{lang|de|[[Heinrich Himmler]]}} had received a letter describing the Polish belief that Jews were being "boiled into soap" and which indicated that the Poles feared they would suffer a similar fate. Indeed, the rumours circulated so widely that some segments of the Polish population actually boycotted the purchase of soap.&lt;ref name=hilberg967&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilberg |first=Raul |title=The Destruction of the European Jews: The Revised and Definitive Edition |publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier |year=1985 |isbn=0-8419-0832-X |page=967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|de|Joachim Neander}}, in a German paper presented at the 28th conference of the [[German Studies Association]], cites the following comment by Himmler from a letter of November 20, 1942 to the head of the {{lang|de|Gestapo}}, {{lang|de|[[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]]}}. Himmler had written to Müller due to an exposé by Rabbi Dr. [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen Wise]], which mentioned the soap rumor and had been printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{quote|You have guaranteed me that at every site the corpses of these deceased Jews are either burned or buried, and that at no site anything else can happen with the corpses.}}

Müller was to make inquiries if "abuse" had happened somewhere and report this to Himmler "on SS oath"; Himmler hence did not from the outset exclude the possibility that such had taken place. Neander goes on to state that the letter represents circumstantial evidence that it was Nazi policy to abstain from processing corpses due to their known desire to keep their mass murder as secret as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Neander: "Seife aus Judenfett", paper presented at the Oct. 2004 German Studies Association conference. http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/dachau/legends/NeanderSoap049.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Danzig Anatomical Institute====
{{Wikisource|Testimony of Sigmund Mazur before the International Military Tribunal in Nurenberg in the case of Danzig Anatomical Institute|Testimony of Sigmund Mazur}}
[[File:Rudolf Spanner tablet (1).JPG|thumb|A memorial tablet in [[Gdańsk]], Poland, chronicling Rudolph Spanner's experiments.]]
During the [[Nuremberg Trials]], Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory assistant at the [[Danzig]] Anatomical Institute (modern {{lang|pl|[[Gdańsk]]}}), testified that soap had been made from corpse fat at the camp, and claimed that 70 to 80&amp;nbsp;kg (155–175&amp;nbsp;lb) of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of soap, and that the finished soap was retained by Professor [[Rudolf Spanner]]. Eyewitnesses included British POWs who were part of the forced labor that constructed the camp, and Dr {{lang|pl|Stanisław Byczkowski}}, head of the Department of Toxicology at the {{lang|pl|Gdańsk}} School of Medicine. Holocaust survivor [[Thomas Blatt]], who investigated the subject, found little concrete documentation and no evidence of mass production of soap from human fat, but concluded that there was evidence of experimental soap making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=|author2=Alex Grobman |author3=Arthur Hertzberg |title=Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and why Do They Say It? |publisher=University of California Press |year=2002 |pages=115–116 |isbn=0-520-23469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testimony was given both by Nazis and by British prisoners of war about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel at the Danzig Anatomic Institute.&lt;ref name="Nuremberg, Robert E 1984, pp. 298-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Death Camps: The Sanity of Madness'', Konnilyn G. Feig, Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1981, pp. 200. ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The prosecutor: The experiments of the Anatomical Institute in the production the soap from the corpses and tanning of human skin for industrial purposes were conducted on a wide scale. I submit a document ... to the tribunal, which consists of the testimony of Sigmund Mazur, one of the direct participants of the production of soap from the human fat, he was helper-laboratory assistant at the Danzig Anatomical institute. ...

The question: Please tell us how soap was produced from the human fat at the Danzig Anatomical institute?

The answer: In summer of 1943 in the yard of the Anatomical institute a two-storey stone building containing three chambers was built. This building was designed for the purpose of utilizing corpses and cooking the bones, as the professor Spanner officially declared. The laboratory was defined as the institution of taking down skeletons, burning meat and superfluous bones, but in the winter 1943-1944 he the year of the prof Spanner instructed us to collect the human fat which was not to be thrown away any more. This order was given to Reichert and Borkmann.

Prof Spanner gave me the recipe for the production of soap from the human fat in February 1944. According to this recipe {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of the human fat appertained to be mixed with 10 litres (2.2 [[gallon#The imperial gallon|imp gal]]; 2.6 [[U.S. gallon|US gal]]) of water and 500 to 1000 grams of the caustic soda. This mixture was cooked for two up to three hours, then it was allowed to cool. Then the soap rose to the surface, while water and settlings were under it. To this mixture a pinch of salt and soda was added and it was cooked again for two up to three hours. After cooling the soap was poured into a mould.}}

In his book ''Russia at War 1941 to 1945'', [[Alexander Werth]] reported that while visiting {{lang|pl|Gdańsk}}/Danzig in 1945 shortly after its conquest by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human corpses. According to Werth it had been run by "a German professor called Spanner" and "was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsos pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a flakey substance—human soap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Werth |first=Alexander |title=Russia at War, 1941-1945 |publisher=Dutton |year=1964 |page=1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jasenovac concentration camp====
In the [[Independent State of Croatia]], a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy established in part of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, in the Jasenovac concentration camp a small factory for converting human remains into soap was also established by members of the [[Ustaše|Ustasha movement]]. Parts of the "soap factory" still exist and can be seen in memorial zone "Donja Gradina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusp-donjagradina.org/eng/DonjaGradina-MS/SoapFactory/ |title=Donja Gradina MS - Soap Factory |publisher=Jusp-donjagradina.org |date=1945-05-01 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|section|date=June 2018}}

====Postwar====
The idea that "human soap" was manufactured on an industrial scale by the Nazis was first published after the war in 1946 by {{lang|pl|[[Zofia Nałkowska]]}} in her seminal [[Medallions]] (see [[Rudolf Spanner]]). It was not refuted for dozens of years in Polish official historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auschwitz.org.pl/new/index.php?tryb=news_big&amp;language=PL&amp;id=1129|title=Zakończono śledztwo w głośnej "sprawie profesora Spannera"|last=|first=|date=|website=Dziennik Bałtycki|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015505/http://www.auschwitz.org.pl/new/index.php?tryb=news_big&amp;language=PL&amp;id=1129|archive-date=2007-09-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Resnais]], who treated the testimony of [[Holocaust survivors]] as fact, continued the accusation in his noted 1955 Holocaust documentary film ''{{lang|fr|[[Nuit et brouillard]]}}''. Some postwar Israelis — in the army, schools, etc. — also referred disdainfully to Jewish victims of Nazism arrived to Israel with the Hebrew word {{lang|he|סבון}} (''{{lang|he-Latn|sabon}}'', "soap").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Goldberg (author) |title=Why Should Jews Survive?: Looking Past the Holocaust Toward a Jewish Future |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-511126-5 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this offensive word was not linked to the rumors about the Nazi crimes and the human soap, but had the sense of "soft", "weaklings".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ben Amotz, Netiva Ben Yehuda ''The World Dictionary of Hebrew Slang'' - Milon Olami leivrit meduberet, vol.1,Zmora Bitan, Tel Aviv 1982 page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Though evidence does exist of small-scale soap production, possibly experimental, in the camp at [[Stutthof concentration camp]] near Danzig/Gdansk,&lt;ref name="Michael Shermer 2002, pp. 114-117"&gt;''[[Denying history]]: who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?'' by [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]], University of California Press, 2002: "The Human Soap Controversy," pp. 114–117.&lt;/ref&gt; mainstream scholars of [[the Holocaust]] consider the idea that the Nazis manufactured soap on an industrial scale to be part of World War II [[folklore]].&lt;ref name=hutman&gt;Bill Hutman, "Nazis never made human-fat soap," ''The Jerusalem Post - International Edition'', week ending May 5, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=njb&gt;"Holocaust Expert Rejects Charge That Nazis Made Soap from Jews," ''Northern California Jewish Bulletin'', April 27, 1990.

Holocaust historian [[Robert Melvin Spector]] writes that "her analysis seems sound, given the known fact that the S.S. used everything it could obtain from its prisoners", including hair, skin and bones.&lt;ref name="Holocaust 2004, p. 392"&gt;''World Without Civilization: Mass Murder and the Holocaust, History and Analysis'', Robert Melvin Spector, University Press of America, 2004, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a sample of the soap archived at the [[International Court of Justice]] in The Hague was given for analysis to {{lang|pl|[[:fi:Andrzej Stołyhwo|Andrzej Stołyhwo]]}}, an expert in the chemistry of fats from the [[Gdansk University of Technology]] in Poland. He concluded that some of the fat in the sample tested was of human origin. The sample of soap had previously been used as evidence in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, but at the time the technology was unavailable to determine whether the soap had been produced from human fat. The human remains used to make the soap were believed to have been brought from {{lang|pl|Bydgoszcz}} and Stutthof concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Polska Press Sp. z o.o. |url=http://www.wiadomosci24.pl/artykul/zakonczono_sledztwo_w_glosnej_sprawie_profesora_spannera_8420.html |title=Zakończono śledztwo w głośnej "sprawie profesora Spannera" |publisher=Wiadomosci24.pl |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=8 "Human Fat Was Used to Produce Soap in Gdansk during the War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521224630/http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=8 |date=2011-05-21 }}, Auschwitz–Birkenau Memorial and Museum website, 13 October 2006.

In the wake of the second world war, Rabbi David Polish wrote a poem, speaking of the Jewish soap:

{{poemquote|And on that day it will be,
and one to one they shall gather in the valley of the bones:
Human ashes from the furnaces, human vapor from Auschwitz,
human parchments from the library of Satan himself,
human soap, human unborn fetuses still without the human image...

The master of all winds will command and bring forth a peddler to the world,
who will gather us one to one,
who will wonder around the world, and sell us for money,
like precious ornaments, and not a high price shall he request.
He shall announce his wares and call:
:"Who wishes to buy a souvenir—a memory from my memories?
:Little boys made of soap,
:or a rare parchment from the skin of the head of one of the biggest sages of Ashkenaz?"
|Rabbi David Polish&lt;ref&gt;For a different translation, see [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=oSKSa_NhYZMC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Yom Kippur Readings] pages 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The BBC documentary about the death camps found during the end of the war shows similar atrocities including shrunken prisoner heads and preserved tattoos, recorded at a display in Buchenwald before the German people from Weimar after the camp's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7xA0edrxuE#t=40m50s An Alfred Hitchcock documentary on the Nazi Holocaust] [00:40:50] (youtube) Presumably the display is from [[Ilse Koch]]'s collection of artifacts from humans. The display includes a bar of RIF soap allegedly made from human fat. [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/buchenwald/images/buchenwald02.jpg Image of artifacts on display from BBC documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several burial sites in Israel include graves for "soap made of Jewish victims by the Nazis". These are probably bars of RIF soap. Following a heated discussion on the media about these graves in 2003, Yad Vashem publicized Professor [[Yehuda Bauer]]'s research saying that RIF soap was not made of human fat, and that the RIF myth was probably propagated by the Nazi guards to taunt the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ladaat.info/article.aspx?artid=5468 Shocking: Soap from Jews murdered in holocaust, buried in Safed] (Hebrew, Ladaat.net)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=172144 Yad Vashem: No soap made from Jews] (Hebrew) following discussion of soap grave in Magdiel, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Yad Vashem includes an image of an emotional funeral and burial of "Jewish" soap in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections1.yadvashem.org/notebook_ext.asp?item=30463 Jewish soap funeral] (Yad Vashem)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/holocaust_era_soap_find_raises_new_questions Holocaust era soap find raises new questions] [[Deborah Lipstadt]] told the newspaper that soap was not made in mass production, although "There were attempts, but it was never practical." Stewart Ain, February 22, 2011, ''The Jewish Week''&lt;/ref&gt;

A small bar of soap was on display at the Nazareth holocaust memorial museum in Israel, and a similar bar of soap was buried in the "holocaust cellar" live-museum in mount Zion in Jerusalem, Israel, during the museum's inception in 1958. A replica was on display there. Following Professor Yehuda Bauer of Yad Vashem publicizing his conclusion that soap was not made in industrial quantities from the bodies of Jews or other Nazi camp inmates, [[Tom Segev]], a "new historian" and [[anti-establishment]] Israeli author, wrote in his book "The Seventh Million" about the Holocaust-Cellar soap that it was "idol worshiping in Jerusalem".&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.bgu.ac.il/bgi/israelis/DocLib/Pages/2011/4.pdf The holocaust cellar: Between public memory and the republic memorial] (Hebrew) Alex Lavon, Ben Gurion University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Seventh Million: Israelis and the Holocaust'' (2000, {{ISBN|0-8050-6660-8}}) part 2 page 412 and on.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3328">'''Spontaneous Broadway''' is an advanced long-form [[improvisational theatre|improvised]] performance, based on audience suggestions. The audience typically submits titles of songs that have never been written, and the performers choose suggestions to create songs, the audience votes through acclamation on their favorite song, which is then used as the core of a brand new [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training to Imagine: Practical Improvisational Theatre Techniques to Enhance Creativity, Teamwork, Leadership and Learning|last=Koppett|first=Kat|publisher=Stylus Publishing, Inc|year=2001|location=Sterling, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format received a favorable review from The ''[[New York Times]]'' when it premiered in [[New York City|New York]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=IN PERFORMANCE: THEATER |last=Van Gelder |first=Lawrence |date=1995-03-08 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/theater/in-performance-theater-278395.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not required or necessarily encouraged by improv professionals, elements of humor inevitably surface in the performance because of the surprising and playful nature of improvisation and its use of typical Broadway stereotypes. The performers' songs are supported by an onstage musician or band that improvises the music, generally in the style of typical show tunes.

The format was created in New York City at Freestyle Repertory Theatre and has been performed by a number of different companies around the [[United States|US]]. Currently, it is performed by BATS theatre in [[San Francisco]],  The Mop &amp; Bucket Co. in [[Schenectady,_New_York|Schenectady NY]], and at several colleges around the country, including [[Stanford_University|Stanford]]. 

The Spontaneous Broadway format was created by Kat Koppett in association with Freestyle Repertory Theatre in New York. Koppett is a 25-year improv veteran, having worked with Freestyle Repertory Theatre) and San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. She is currently co-director of the Mop &amp; Bucket Company, an improv troupe based in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mopco.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Koppett also runs a consulting business, appropriately named Koppett. In 1995, [[TheaterWeek]] Magazine named Kat one of the year's "Unsung Heroes" for her creation of  Spontaneous Broadway, which is now performed regularly by teams of actors all over the world. Significant contributions to the development of the format at Freestyle Rep. were made by Kenn Adams, Laura Livingston, and Samuel D. Cohen.

At the 2000 [[Melbourne Fringe Festival]], the show began its life in [[Australia]] and immediately won a special Fringe Award. Produced by musical director John Thorn (who secured the Australian licence from Kat Koppett) and hosted by Russell Fletcher, many of Australia's finest comic improvisors have since performed the show around the country, including sell-out performances at the [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Spiegeltent#The_Famous_Spiegeltent|The Famous Spiegeltent]], and at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], receiving rave reviews and legions of repeat attendee fans.

{{selfref|For harassment-related policies on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Harassment]].}}

'''Stalking''' is unwanted or repeated surveillance by an individual or group towards another person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-01-01|title=The state of the art of stalking: Taking stock of the emerging literature|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178906000450|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=64–86|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2006.05.001|issn=1359-1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking behaviors are interrelated to [[harassment]] and [[intimidation]] and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. The term ''stalking'' is used with some differing definitions in [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], as well as in some legal [[jurisdiction]]s as a term for a [[criminal offense]].

According to a 2002 report by the U.S. [[Victims' rights#National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC)|National Center for Victims of Crime]], "virtually any unwanted contact between two people that directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered stalking",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/help_series/pdftxt/stalkingvictimization.txt|title=Stalking Victimization|author=National Center for Victims of Crime|author-link=Victims' rights#National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC)|publisher=[[Office for Victims of Crime]]|date=Feb 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.

==Definitions==
The difficulties associated with defining this term exactly (or defining it at all) are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sheridan|first1=L. P.|last2=Blaauw|first2=E.|title=Characteristics of False Stalking Reports|journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]]|volume=31|pages=55–72
|year=2004|doi=10.1177/0093854803259235|quote=Given that stalking may often constitute no more than the targeted repetition of ostensibly ordinary or routine behavior, stalking is inherently difficult to define.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been used since at least the 16th century to refer to a prowler or a poacher (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), the term ''stalker'' was initially used by media in the 20th century to describe people who pester and harass others, initially with specific reference to the harassment of celebrities by strangers who were described as being "obsessed".&lt;ref name=StalkersTheirVictims&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=Paul E.|title=Stalkers and Their Victims|year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom]] [u.a.] |isbn=0-521-66950-2 |author2=Pathé, Michele |author3=Purcell, Rosemary }}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the word appears to have been coined by the [[tabloid press]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawson-Cruttenden, 1996, "Is there a law against stalking?", ''[[New Law Journal]]''/6736 pp.&amp;nbsp;418–420, cited in {{doi|10.1016/S1359-1789(02)00068-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time, the meaning of stalking changed and incorporated individuals being harassed by their former partners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Paul E.|last2=Pathé|first2=Michele|date=2002-01-01|title=Stalking|jstor=1147710|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=29|pages=273–318|doi=10.1086/652222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathé and Mullen describe stalking as "a constellation of behaviours in which an individual inflicts upon another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pathe | first1 = M. | last2 = Mullen | first2 = P. E. | doi = 10.1192/bjp.170.1.12 | title = The impact of stalkers on their victims | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 170 | pages = 12–17 | year = 1997 | pmid =  9068768| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking can be defined as the willful and repeated following, watching and/or harassing of another person. Unlike other crimes, which usually involve one act, stalking is a ''series'' of actions that occur over a period of time.

Although stalking is illegal in most areas of the world, some of the actions that contribute to stalking may be legal, such as gathering information, calling someone on the phone, texting, sending gifts, emailing, or instant messaging. They become illegal when they breach the legal definition of harassment (e.g., an action such as sending a text is not usually illegal, but is illegal when frequently repeated to an unwilling recipient). In fact, [[United Kingdom]] law states the incident only has to happen twice when the harasser should be aware their behavior is unacceptable (e.g., two phone calls to a stranger, two gifts, following the victim then phoning them, etc).&lt;ref name="harass_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Stalking.html |title=Stalking |publisher=sexualharassmentsupport.org |accessdate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819170018/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Stalking.html |archivedate=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social norm|Cultural norms]] and meaning effect the way stalking is defined. Scholars note that the majority of men and women admit engaging in various stalking-like behaviors following a breakup, but stop such behaviors over time, suggesting that "engagement in low levels of unwanted pursuit behaviors for a relatively short amount of time, particularly in the context of a relationship break-up, may be normative for heterosexual dating relationships occurring within U.S. culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langhinrichsen-Rohling|first=Jennifer|date=2011-03-01|title=Gender and Stalking: Current Intersections and Future Directions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226915692_Gender_and_Stalking_Current_Intersections_and_Future_Directions|journal=Sex Roles|volume=66|pages=418–426|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0093-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 2005, amending a United States statute, 108 Stat. 1902 et seq, defined stalking as "engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to—

:(A) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others;
:(B) suffer substantial emotional distress."&lt;ref name = "VAW2005(3)(a)(24)" &gt;{{cite act |title=Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005|number=H. R. 3402|language=English|date=January 5, 2006|article=Sec.(3)(a)(24)|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109hr3402enr/pdf/BILLS-109hr3402enr.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=12 February 2013}} "STALKING.—The term 'stalking' means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to—(A) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others; or (B) suffer substantial emotional distress."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology and behaviors==
People characterized as stalkers may be accused of having a mistaken belief that another person loves them ([[erotomania]]), or that they need rescuing.&lt;ref name="harass_1"/&gt; Stalking can consist of an accumulation of a series of actions which, by themselves, can be legal, such as calling on the phone, sending gifts, or sending emails.&lt;ref name="menace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php|title=CyberStalking: menaced on the Internet|publisher=sociosite.org|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalkers may use overt and covert intimidation, threats and violence to frighten their victims. They may engage in [[vandalism]] and property damage or make physical attacks that are meant to frighten. Less common are [[Sexual assault|sexual assaults]].&lt;ref name="harass_1"/&gt;

[[Intimate partner]] stalkers are the most dangerous type.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the UK, for example, most stalkers are former partners and evidence indicates that mental illness-facilitated stalking propagated in the media accounts for only a minority of cases of alleged stalking.&lt;ref name="harass_3"/&gt; A [[UK Home Office]] research study on the use of the Protection from Harassment Act stated: "The study found that the Protection from Harassment Act is being used to deal with a variety of behaviour such as domestic and inter-neighbour disputes. It is rarely used for stalking as portrayed by the media since only a small minority of cases in the survey involved such behaviour."&lt;ref name="harass_3"&gt;{{citation|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r130.pdf|title=The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 – An Evaluation of its Use and Effectiveness|first=Jessica|last=Harris|publisher=Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate|year=2000|format=PDF|ISSN=1364-6540|accessdate=20 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016182707/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r130.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2010|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects on victims===
Disruptions in daily life necessary to escape the stalker, including changes in [[employment]], residence and phone numbers, take a toll on the victim's well-being and may lead to a sense of isolation.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrams|first1=Karen M.|last2=Robinson|first2=Gail Erlick|title=Comprehensive Treatment of Stalking Victims: Practical Steps That Help Ensure Safety|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]] |volume=25 |issue=10 |date=1 Sep 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1278421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lamber Royakkers:

"Stalking is a form of mental assault, in which the perpetrator repeatedly, unwantedly, and disruptively breaks into the life-world of the victim, with whom they have no relationship (or no longer have). Moreover, the separated acts that make up the intrusion cannot by themselves cause the mental abuse, but do taken together (cumulative effect)."&lt;ref name="menace" /&gt;

=== Stalking as a close relationship ===
Stalking has also been described as a form of close relationship between the parties, albeit a disjunctive one where the two participants have opposing goals rather than cooperative goals.  One participant, often a woman, likely wishes to end the relationship entirely, but may find herself unable to easily do so.  The other participant, often but not always a man, wishes to escalate the relationship.  It has been described as a close relationship because the duration, frequency, and intensity of contact may rival that of a more traditional conjunctive dating relationship.&lt;ref name="Spitzberg"&gt;{{Citation

=== Types of victims ===
Based on work with stalking victims for eight years in Australia, Mullen and Pathé identified different types of stalking victims dependent on their previous relationship to the stalker. These are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Prior intimates:''' Victims who had been in a previous intimate relationship with their stalker. In the article, Mullen and Pathé describe this as being "the largest category, the most common victim profile being a woman who has previously shared an intimate relationship with her (usually) male stalker." These victims are more likely to be exposed to violence being enacted by their stalker especially if the stalker had a criminal past. In addition, victims who have "date stalkers" are less likely to experience violence by their stalkers. A "date stalker" is considered an individual who had an intimate relationship with the victim but it was short-lived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Casual acquaintances and friends:''' Amongst male stalking victims, most are part of this category. This category of victims also includes neighbor stalking. This may result in the victims' change of residence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Professional contacts:''' These are victims who have been stalked by patients, clients, or students whom they have had a professional relationship with. Certain professions such as health care providers, teachers, and lawyers are at a higher risk for stalking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Workplace contacts:''' The stalkers of these victims tend to visit them in their workplace which means that they are either an employer, employee, or a customer. When victims have stalkers coming to their workplace, this poses a threat not only to the victims' safety but to the safety of other individuals as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Strangers:''' These victims are typically unaware of how their stalkers began stalking because typically these stalkers form a sense of admiration for their victims from a distance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''The famous:''' Most of these victims are individuals who are portrayed heavily on media outlets but can also include individuals such as politicians and athletes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Gender===
According to one study, women often target other women, whereas men primarily stalk women.&lt;ref name="Women Who Stalk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Purcell|first=R.|title=A Study of Women Who Stalk|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2056–2060|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Types of Stalkers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesofStalkers.html |title=Types of stalkers |publisher=sexualharassmentsupport.org |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A January 2009 report from the [[United States Department of Justice]] reports that "Males were as likely to report being stalked by a male as a female offender. 43% of male stalking victims stated that the offender was female, while 41% of male victims stated that the offender was another male. Female victims of stalking were significantly more likely to be stalked by a male (67%) rather than a female (24%) offender." This report provides considerable data by gender and race about both stalking and harassment,&lt;ref name="StalkingVictimizationintheUnitedStates"&gt;{{cite report |last=Baum |first=Katrina |author2=Catalano, Shannon |author3=Rand, Michael |url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/stalking-victimization.pdf |title=Stalking Victimization in the United States |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]], [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] |date=January 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223180145/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/stalking-victimization.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained via the 2006 Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS), by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="SUPPLEMENTALVICTIMIZATIONSURVEY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/stalking-victimization.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828151246/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/svs1_06.pdf|archivedate=28 August 2011|title=SUPPLEMENTAL VICTIMIZATION SURVEY (SVS)|format=PDF|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article by Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling she discusses how gender plays a role in the difference between stalkers and victims. She says, "gender is associated with the types of emotional reactions that are experienced by recipients of stalking related events, including the degree of fear experienced by the victim." In addition, she hypothesizes that gender may also effect how police handle a case of stalking, how the victim copes with the situation, and how the stalker might view their behavior. She discusses how victims might view certain forms of stalking as normal because of gender socialization influences on the acceptability of certain behaviors. She emphasizes that in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States, strangers are considered more dangerous when it comes to stalking than a former partner. Media also plays an important role due to portrayals of male stalking behavior as acceptable, influencing men into thinking it is normal. Since gender roles are socially constructed, sometimes men don't report stalking. She also mentions [[coercive control]] theory, "future research will be needed to determine if this theory can predict how changes in social structures and gender-specific norms will result in variations in rates of stalking for men versus women over time in the United States and across the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langhinrichsen-Rohling|first=Jennifer|date=2011-12-06|title=Gender and Stalking: Current Intersections and Future Directions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-011-0093-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=66|issue=5-6|pages=418–426|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0093-3|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of stalkers===
Psychologists often group individuals who stalk into two categories: [[psychotic]] and nonpsychotic.&lt;ref name=StalkersTheirVictims/&gt; Some stalkers may have pre-existing psychotic disorders such as [[delusional disorder]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], or [[schizophrenia]]. However, most stalkers are nonpsychotic and may exhibit disorders or [[neuroses]] such as [[clinical depression|major depression]], [[adjustment disorder]], or [[Chemical dependency|substance dependence]], as well as a variety of [[personality disorder]]s (such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]], or [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]]). The nonpsychotic stalkers' pursuit of victims is primarily angry, vindictive, focused, often including [[Psychological projection|projection]] of [[blame]], [[wikt:obsession|obsession]], [[behavioral addiction|dependency]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]], [[denial]], and [[jealousy]]. Conversely, only 10% of stalkers had an erotomanic delusional disorder.&lt;ref name="A comparative study of psychotic and nonpsychotic stalking"&gt;K. K. Kienlen, D. L. Birmingham, K. B. Solberg, J. T. O'Regan, and J. R. Meloy, [http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/3/317 "A comparative study of psychotic and nonpsychotic stalking"], ''J Am Acad Psychiatry Law'' 25:3:317-334 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In "A Study of Stalkers" Mullen ''et al''. (2000)&lt;ref name="Study of Stalkers"&gt;Paul E. Mullen, Michele Pathé, Rosemary Purcell, and Geoffrey W. Stuart.[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/156/8/1244 "A Study of Stalkers"], ''Am J Psychiatry'' 156:1244–1249, August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; identified five types of stalkers:
* '''Rejected stalkers''' follow their victims in order to reverse, correct, or avenge a rejection (e.g. divorce, separation, termination).
* '''Resentful stalkers''' make a vendetta because of a sense of grievance against the victims – motivated mainly by the desire to frighten and distress the victim.
* '''[[Obsessive love|Intimacy seekers]]''' seek to establish an intimate, loving relationship with their victim. Such stalkers often believe that the victim is a long-sought-after soul mate, and they were 'meant' to be together.
* '''Incompetent suitors''', despite poor social or courting skills, have a [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]], or in some cases, a sense of [[entitlement]] to an intimate relationship with those who have attracted their amorous interest. Their victims are most often already in a dating relationship with someone else.
* '''Predatory stalkers''' spy on the victim in order to prepare and plan an attack – often sexual – on the victim.
In addition to Mullen et al., Joseph A. Davis, Ph.D., an American researcher, crime analyst, and university psychology professor at San Diego State University investigated, as a member of the Stalking Case Assessment Team (SCAT), special unit within the San Diego District Attorney's Office, hundreds of cases involving what he called and typed "terrestrial" and "cyberstalking" between 1995 and 2002. This research culminated in one of the most comprehensive books written to date on the subject. It is considered the "gold standard" as a reference to stalking crimes, victim protection, safety planning, security and threat assessment published by CRC Press, Inc., in August, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stalking Crimes and Victim Protection: Prevention, Intervention, Threat Assessment, and Case Management (Hardback) - Routledge|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780849308116|website=www.routledge.com|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 National Victim Association Academy defines an additional form of stalking: The '''vengeance/terrorist stalker'''. Both the vengeance stalker and terrorist stalker (the latter sometimes called the political stalker) do not, in contrast with some of the aforementioned types of stalkers, seek a personal relationship with their victims but rather force them to emit a certain response. While the vengeance stalker's motive is "to get even" with the other person whom he/she perceives has done some wrong to them (e.g., an employee who believes is fired without justification from their job by their superior), the political stalker intends to accomplish a political agenda, also using [[threats]] and [[intimidation]] to force his/her target to refrain and/or become involved in some particular activity, regardless of the victim's consent.  For example, most prosecutions in this stalking category have been against anti-abortionists who stalk doctors in an attempt to discourage the performance of abortions.&lt;ref name="National Victim Association Agency 2002 Chapter 22: Special topics"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/nvaa2002/chapter22_4.html|title=National Victim Assistance Academy Textbook - Chapter 22 Special Topics - Section 4, Campus Crime and Victimization|date=June 2002|accessdate=28 August 2011|publisher=[[Office for Victims of Crime]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalkers may fit categories with [[paranoia disorder]]s. '''Intimacy-seeking stalkers''' often have delusional disorders involving [[erotomanic]] delusions. With rejected stalkers, the continual clinging to a relationship of an inadequate or dependent person couples with the entitlement of the narcissistic personality, and the persistent jealousy of the paranoid personality. In contrast, '''resentful stalkers''' demonstrate an almost "pure culture of [[persecution]]", with delusional disorders of the paranoid type, paranoid personalities, and [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Study of Stalkers" /&gt;

One of the uncertainties in understanding the origins of stalking is that the concept is now widely understood in terms of specific behaviors&lt;ref&gt;as a US example, see January 2009 Special Report from the [[United States Department of Justice]] titled [http://www.ncvc.org/src/AGP.Net/Components/DocumentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=45862 "Stalking Victimization in the United States"], NCJ 224527&lt;/ref&gt; which are found to be offensive and/or illegal. As discussed above, these specific (apparently stalking) behaviors may have multiple motivations.

In addition, the personality characteristics that are often discussed as antecedent to stalking may also produce behavior that is not stalking as conventionally defined. Some research suggests there is a spectrum of what might be called "obsessed following behavior." People who complain obsessively and for years, about a perceived wrong or wrong-doer, when no one else can perceive the injury—and people who cannot or will not "let go" of a person or a place or an idea—comprise a wider group of persons that may be problematic in ways that seem similar to stalking. Some of these people get extruded from their organizations—they may get hospitalized or fired or let go if their behavior is defined in terms of illegal stalking, but many others do good or even excellent work in their organizations and appear to have just one focus of tenacious obsession.&lt;ref&gt;(See Mary Rowe, "People With Delusions or Quasi-Delusions Who 'Won't Let Go'," ''Journal of the University and College Ombuds Association'', Occasional Paper, Number 1, Fall 1994.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberstalking===
{{main article|Cyberstalking|Cyberstalking legislation}}
{{commons category|Cyberstalking}}
[[Cyberstalking]] is the use of computers or other electronic technology to facilitate stalking. In Davis (2001), Lucks identified a separate category of stalkers who instead of a terrestrial means, prefer to perpetrate crimes against their targeted victims through electronic and online means.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J. A. (2001). Stalking Crimes and Victim Protection, CRC Press.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst college students, Ménard and Pincus found that men who had a high score of sexual abuse as children and narcissistic vulnerability were more likely to become stalkers. Out of the women who participated in their study, 9% were cyberstalkers meanwhile only 4% were overt stalkers. In addition, the male participants revealed the opposite, 16% were overt stalkers while 11% were cyberstalkers. Alcohol and physical abuse both played a role in predicting women's cyberstalking and in men, "preoccupied attachment significantly predicted cyber stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ménard|first=Kim S.|last2=Pincus|first2=Aaron L.|date=2012-07-01|title=Predicting Overt and Cyber Stalking Perpetration by Male and Female College Students|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/27/11/2183|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=27|issue=11|pages=2183–2207|doi=10.1177/0886260511432144|issn=0886-2605|pmid=22203630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stalking by groups ===
{{See also|Mobbing}}
According to a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] special report&lt;ref name="StalkingVictimizationintheUnitedStates"/&gt; a significant number of people reporting stalking incidents claim that they had been stalked by more than one person, with 18.2% reporting that they were stalked by two people, 13.1% reporting that they had been stalked by three or more. The report did not break down these cases into numbers of victims who claimed to have been stalked by several people individually, and by people acting in concert. A question asked of respondents reporting three or more stalkers by polling personnel about whether the stalking was related to co-workers, members of a gang, fraternities, sororities, etc., did not have its responses indicated in the survey results as released by the DOJ. The data for this report was obtained via the 2006 Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS), conducted by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] for the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="SUPPLEMENTALVICTIMIZATIONSURVEY"/&gt;

According to a United Kingdom study by Sheridan and Boon,&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Davies, Boon, "The Course and Nature of Stalking: A Victim Perspective", ''[[Howard Journal of Criminal Justice]]'', Volume 40, Number 3, August 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;215–234.&lt;/ref&gt; in 5% of the cases they studied there was more than one stalker, and 40% of the victims said that friends or family of their stalker had also been involved. In 15% of cases, the victim was unaware of any reason for the harassment.

Over a quarter of all stalking and harassment victims do not know their stalkers in any capacity. About a tenth responding to the SVS did not know the identities of their stalkers.  11% of victims said they had been stalked for five years or more.&lt;ref name="StalkingVictimizationintheUnitedStates"/&gt;

===False claims of stalking, "gang stalking" and delusions of persecution===
{{See also|False accusations|Persecutory delusions}}
In 1999, Pathe, Mullen and Purcell wrote that popular interest in stalking was promoting false claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=M.|last1=Pathe|first2=P. E|last2=Mullen|first3=R.|last3=Purcell|title=Stalking: false claims of victimisation|publisher=''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 174: 170-172 (1999)|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/174/2/170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sheridan and Blaauw said that they estimated that 11.5% of claims in a sample of 357 reported claims of stalking were false.&lt;ref name="Sheridan and Blauuw 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=L. P.|last1=Sheridan|first2=E.|last2=Blaauw|title=Characteristics of False Stalking Reports"; ''Criminal Justice and Behavior''|volume=31, No. 1, 55-72|year=2004|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/1/55|doi=10.1177/0093854803259235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sheridan and Blaauw, 70% of false stalking reports were made by people suffering from [[delusions]], stating that "after eight uncertain cases were excluded, the false reporting rate was judged to be 11.5%, with the majority of false victims suffering delusions (70%)."&lt;ref name="Sheridan and Blauuw 2004"/&gt; Another study estimated the proportion of false reports that were due to delusions as 64%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=S.

News reports have described how groups of Internet users have cooperated to exchange detailed [[conspiracy theories]] involving coordinated activities by large numbers of people called "gang stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/gang-stalking-targeted-individuals.html|title=United States of Paranoia: They See Gangs of Stalkers|last=Mcphate|first=Mike|date=2016-06-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activities involved are described as involving [[electronic harassment]], the use of "[[psychotronic weapon]]s", and other alleged [[mind control]] techniques. These have been reported by external observers as being examples of [[belief system]]s, as opposed to reports of objective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-nightmarish-online-world-of-gang-stalking|title=The Nightmarish Online World of 'Gang-Stalking'|last=Kiberd|first=Roisin|date=July 22, 2016|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice.com|language=en-us|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychiatrists and psychologists say "Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking" are "an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking" and represent "a dark side of social networking.

A study from Australia and the United Kingdom by Lorraine Sheridan and David James&lt;ref name=sheridan-and-james2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Lorraine P.|last2=James|first2=David V.|date=2015-09-03|title=Complaints of group-stalking (‘gang-stalking’): an exploratory study of their nature and impact on complainants|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14789949.2015.1054857|journal=The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology|volume=26|issue=5|pages=601–623|doi=10.1080/14789949.2015.1054857|issn=1478-9949}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared 128 self-defined victims of 'gang-stalking' with a randomly selected group of 128 self-declared victims of stalking by an individual. All 128 'victims' of gang-stalking were judged to be delusional, compared with only 3.9% of victims of individual-stalking. There were highly significant differences between the two samples on depressive symptoms, post-traumatic symptomatology and adverse impact on social and occupational function, with the self-declared victims of gang-stalking more severely affected. The authors concluded that "group-stalking appears to be delusional in basis, but complainants suffer marked psychological and practical sequelae. This is important in the assessment of risk in stalking cases, early referral to psychiatric services and allocation of police resources."&lt;ref name=sheridan-and-james2015/&gt;

==Epidemiology and prevalence==

===Australia===
According to a study conducted by Purcell, Pathé and Mullen (2002), 23% of the Australian population reported having been stalked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Rosemary|author2=Pathé, Michele|author3=Mullen, Paul E.|title=The prevalence and nature of stalking in the Australian community|journal=[[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=1 January 2002|volume=36|issue=1|pages=114–120|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.2002.00985.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
Stieger, Burger and Schild conducted a survey in Austria, revealing a lifetime prevalence of 11% (women: 17%, men: 3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stieger|first=Stefan|author2=Burger, Christoph|author3=Schild, Anne|title=Lifetime prevalence and impact of stalking: Epidemiological data from Eastern Austria|journal=The European Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 Dec 2008|volume=22|issue=4|doi=10.4321/S0213-61632008000400006|pages=235–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further results include: 86% of stalking victims were female, 81% of the stalkers were male. Women were mainly stalked by men (88%) while men were almost equally stalked by men and women (60% male stalkers). 19% of the stalking victims reported that they were still being stalked at the time of study participation ([[point prevalence]] rate: 2%). To 70% of the victims, the stalker was known, being a prior intimate partner in 40%, a friend or acquaintance in 23% and a colleague at work in 13% of cases. As a consequence, 72% of the victims reported having changed their lifestyle. 52% of former and ongoing stalking victims reported suffering from a currently impaired ([[pathological]]) [[Mental health#Mental wellbeing|psychological well-being]]. There was no [[statistical significance|significant]] difference between the incidence of stalking in rural and urban areas.

===England and Wales===
In 1998 Budd and Mattinson found a lifetime prevalence of 12% in England and Wales (16% female, 7% males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Budd|first=Tracey|title=The extent and nature of stalking : findings from the 1998 British Crime Survey|year=2000|publisher=Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate|location=London|isbn=1-84082-535-9|last2=Mattinson|first2=Joanna|last3=Myhill|first3=Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010/11 43% of stalking victims were found to be male and 57% female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb1011/hosb1011?view=Binary|title=Crime in England and Wales 2010/11|accessdate=29 March 2012|last=Chaplin|first=Rupert|last2=Flatley|first2=John|last3=Smith|first3=Kevin|date=July 2011|publisher=[[Home Office]]|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a paper by staff from the [[Fixated Threat Assessment Centre]], a unit established to deal with people with fixations on public figures, 86% of a sample group of 100 people assessed by them appeared to them to suffer from [[psychotic illness]]; 57% of the sample group were subsequently admitted to hospital, and 26% treated in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology|title=The Fixated Threat Assessment Centre: preventing harm and facilitating care|first5=L.|volume=21|pages=1|doi=10.1080/14789941003596981|year=2010|last1=James|last5=Preston|last2=Kerrigan|first1=D.|first2=T.|last3=Forfar|last4=Farnham|first3=R.|first4=F.|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar retrospective study published in 2009 in ''Psychological Medicine'' based on a sample of threats to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] kept by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] over a period of 15 years, suggested that 83.6% of the writers of these letters suffered from serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Laws on harassment and stalking==

===Australia===
Every Australian state enacted laws prohibiting stalking during the 1990s, with Queensland being the first state to do so in 1994. The laws vary slightly from state to state, with Queensland's laws having the broadest scope, and South Australian laws the most restrictive. Punishments vary from a maximum of 10 years imprisonment in some states, to a fine for the lowest severity of stalking in others. Australian anti-stalking laws have some notable features. Unlike many US jurisdictions they do not require the victim to have felt fear or distress as a result of the behaviour, only that a reasonable person would have felt this way. In some states, the anti-stalking laws operate extra-territorially, meaning that an individual can be charged with stalking if either they or the victim are in the relevant state. Most Australian states provide the option of a [[restraining order]] in cases of stalking, breach of which is punishable as a criminal offence. There has been relatively little research into Australian court outcomes in stalking cases, although Freckelton (2001) found that in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], most stalkers received fines or community based dispositions.

===Canada===
Section 264 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], titled "''criminal harassment''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-122.html#s-264|title=Section 264 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46|publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses acts which are termed "stalking" in many other jurisdictions. The provisions of the section came into force in August 1993 with the intent of further strengthening laws protecting women.&lt;ref name="264r"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/rs/rep/1996/wd96-7a.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=13 June 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613235329/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/rs/rep/1996/wd96-7a.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[hybrid offence]], which may be punishable upon [[summary offence|summary conviction]] or as an [[indictable offence]], the latter of which may carry a prison term of up to ten years. Section 264 has withstood [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/fm/pub/harassment/part3a.html|title=Criminal Harassment: A Handbook for Police and Crown Prosecutors|author=|date=18 September 2004|website=archive.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918071646/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/fm/pub/harassment/part3a.html|archivedate=18 September 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief, Policing Services Program, for Statistics Canada has stated:

''"...&amp;nbsp;of the 10,756 incidents of criminal harassment reported to police in 2006, 1,429 of these involved more than one accused."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hackett|first=Karen|date=2000|title=Criminal Harassment|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/85-002-x2000011-eng.pdf|journal=Juristat: Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics|volume=20|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===France===
Article 222-33-2 of the French Penal Code (added in 2002) penalizes "Moral harassment," which is: "Harassing another person by repeated conduct which is designed to or leads to a deterioration of his conditions of work liable to harm his rights and his dignity, to damage his physical or mental health or compromise his career prospects," with a year's imprisonment and a fine of EUR15,000.


===Germany===
The German Criminal Code (§ 238 StGB) penalizes ''Nachstellung'', defined as threatening or seeking proximity or remote contact with another person and thus heavily influencing their lives, with up to three years of imprisonment. The definition is not strict and allows "similar behaviour" to also be classified as stalking.


===India===
In 2013, Indian Parliament made [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|amendments]] to the [[Indian Penal Code]], introducing stalking as a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf|publisher=Government of India|format=PDF|accessdate=16 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking has been defined as a man following or contacting a woman, despite clear indication of disinterest by the woman, or monitoring her use of the Internet or electronic communication. A man committing the offence of stalking would be liable for imprisonment up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment up to five years and with fine.

===Italy===
Following a series of high-profile incidents that came to public attention in the past years, a law was proposed in June 2008, and became effective in February 2009 (D.L. 23.02.2009 n. 11), making a criminal offence under the newly introduced art. 612 bis of the penal code, punishable with imprisonment ranging from six months up to five years, any ''"continuative harassing, threatening or persecuting behaviour which: (1) causes a state of anxiety and fear in the victim(s), or; (2) ingenerates within the victim(s) a motivated fear for his/her own safety or for the safety of relatives, {{Sic|kin|s}}, or others tied to the victim him/herself by an affective relationship, or; (3), forces the victim(s) to change his/her living habits"''. If the perpetrator of the offense is a subject tied to the victim by kinship or that is or has been in the past involved in a relationship with the victim (i.e. current or former/divorced/split [[husband]]/[[wife]] or [[fiancée]]), and/or if the victim is a [[pregnant woman]] or a [[minor (law)|minor]] or a person with disabilities, the sanction can be elevated up to six years of incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentesociale.it/mentesociale/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=15|title=Credits - MenteSociale|accessdate=March 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222082805/http://www.mentesociale.it/mentesociale/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=15|archivedate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psicolab.net/index.asp?pid=idart&amp;cat=12&amp;scat=227&amp;arid=2473 psicolab.net] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pariopportunita.gov.it/DefaultDesktop.aspx?doc=1924|title=Default Desktop|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=36774 "Dei delitti contro la persona"], Altalex.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Wetboek van Strafrecht]] there is an Article 285b&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/285b.html|title=Wetboek van Strafrecht &amp;#124; Artikel 285b|publisher=Wetboek-online.nl|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that considers stalking as a crime, actually an [[Antragsdelikt]]:
 
Article 285b:
 
:1. He, who unlawfully systematically and deliberately intrudes someones personal environment with the intention to enforce the other to do something, not to do something or to tolerate something or to frighten, will be punished because of stalking. Maximum imprisonment is three years or a fine of the fourth category.
 
:2. Prosecution will only happen when there is a complaint from him, against whom this crime has been committed ([[Antragsdelikt]]).

===Romania===
Article 208 of the 2014 Criminal Code states:-

Article 208: Harassment

1. The act of someone who repeatedly follows, without right or a legitimate interest, a person or his or her home, workplace or other place frequented, thus causing a state of fear.

2. Making phone calls or communication by means of transmission, which by frequent or continuous use, causes fear to a person. This shall be punished with imprisonment from one to three months or a fine if the case is not a more serious offense.

3. Criminal action is initiated by prior complaint of the victim.

===United Kingdom===
Already before the enactment of the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]], the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] and the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] (now the [[Communications Act 2003]]) criminalised indecent, offensive or threatening phone calls and the sending of an indecent, offensive or threatening letter, electronic communication or other article to another person. Before 1997 no specific offence existed in England and Wales but in Scotland incidents could be dealt with under pre-existing law with life imprisonment available for the worst offences 

'''England and Wales'''

In [[England and Wales]], "[[Harassment in the United Kingdom|harassment]]" was criminalised by the enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which came into force on 16 June 1997. It makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to six months' imprisonment, to make a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another on two or more occasions. The court can also issue a restraining order, which carries a maximum punishment of five years' imprisonment if breached. In [[England and Wales]], liability may arise in the event that the victim suffers either mental or physical harm as a result of being harassed (or slang term stalked) (see ''[[R. v. Constanza]]'').

In 2012, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], stated that the government intended to make another attempt to create a law aimed specifically at stalking behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17294314|title=Stalking to be made specific criminal offence - Cameron|date=8 Mar 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] created the offence of stalking for the first time in England/Wales by inserting these offences into the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]. The act of stalking under this section is exemplified by contacting, or attempting to contact, a person by any means, publishing any statement or other material relating or purporting to relate to a person, monitoring the use by a person of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication, loitering in any place (whether public or private), interfering with any property in the possession of a person or watching or spying on a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/section/111/enacted|title=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protection Of Freedoms Act 2012 also added Section 4(a) into the Protection From Harassment Act 1997 which covered 'Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress'. This created the offence of where a person's conduct amounts to stalking and either causes another to fear (on at least two occasions) that violence will be used against them or conduct that causes another person serious alarm or distress which has a substantial effect on their usual day to day activities.

'''Scotland'''

In [[Scotland]], behaviour commonly described as stalking was already prosecuted as the Common Law offence of [[breach of the peace]] (not to be confused with the minor English offence of the same description) before the introduction of the statutory offence against s.39 of the [[Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010]];{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} either course can still be taken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/crimes/harassment/stalkinglaw|title=Stalking &amp; Harassment - Criminal Law|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the circumstances of each case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/crimes/harassment/stalkingoffence|title=Offence of Stalking|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutory offence incurs a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or a fine upon summary conviction or a maximum of five years' imprisonment and/or a fine upon conviction on indictment; penalties for conviction for Breach of the Peace are limited only by the sentencing powers of the court thus a case remitted to the High Court can carry a sentence of imprisonment for life.

Provision is made under the Protection from Harassment Act against stalking to deal with the civil offence (i.e. the interference with the victim's personal rights), falling under the law of [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]]. Victims of stalking may sue for interdict against an alleged stalker, or a non-harassment order, breach of which is an offence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===United States===
California was the first state to criminalize stalking in the United States in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14-stk.htm|title=Are You Being Stalked?|publisher=Privacyrights.org|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of numerous high-profile stalking cases in California, including the 1982 attempted murder of actress [[Theresa Saldana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stalkingalert.com/articlesofinterest.htm|title=Stalking Stalking From A Legal Perspective|first=Rhonda|last=Saunders|publisher=Stalkingalert.com|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1988 massacre by [[Richard Farley]],&lt;ref name="bill analysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1178_cfa_930426_112027_sen_comm|title=Bill Analysis by Bill Lockyer|accessdate=7 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113003034/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1178_cfa_930426_112027_sen_comm|archivedate=13 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1989 murder of actress [[Rebecca Schaeffer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/110415/culture_of_patriarchy_in_law_violence_from_antiquity_to_modernity/index.html|title=Culture of Patriarchy in Law: Violence From Antiquity to Modernity|publisher=Redorbit.com|date=11 December 2004|accessdate=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003011941/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/110415/culture_of_patriarchy_in_law_violence_from_antiquity_to_modernity/index.html#|archive-date=2011-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] stalking murders, also in 1989.&lt;ref name="bill analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/1998jun/ca/or/vote/watson_j/paper1.html|title=Judge John Watson profile|publisher=Smartvoter.org|date=2 June 1998|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first anti-stalking law in the United States, California Penal Code Section 646.9, was developed and proposed by Municipal Court Judge John Watson of Orange County.

Within three years&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt; thereafter, every state in the [[United States]] followed suit to create the crime of stalking, under different names such as ''criminal harassment'' or ''criminal menace''. The [[Driver's Privacy Protection Act]] (DPPA) was enacted in 1994 in response to numerous cases of a driver's information being abused for criminal activity, with prominent examples including the [[Theresa Saldana|Saldana]] and [[Rebecca Schaeffer|Schaeffer]] stalking cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/drivers/|title=DPPA and the Privacy of Your State Motor Vehicle Record|publisher=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1437&amp;wit_id=4146 U.S. Senate Committee: Robert Douglas Testimony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114072135/http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1437&amp;wit_id=4146 |date=November 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver's personal information without permission by State [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV). As of 2011, stalking is an offense under section 120a of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920a-|title=United States Code: Title 10,920a.

*In ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983), a [[black comedy]], De Niro played Rupert Pupkin, a would-be comedian who tries to ingratiate himself with a famous talk-show host ([[Jerry Lewis]]), even fantasizing that the two are friends, and when that fails, he teams up with another stalker ([[Sandra Bernhardt]]) to kidnap the celebrity in order to appear on television and break into big-time show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085794/?ref_=nv_sr_1|title=The King of Comedy (1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Habit of Art''''' is a 2009 play by English playwright [[Alan Bennett]], centred on a fictional meeting between [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Benjamin Britten]] while Britten is composing the opera ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]''. It premiered on 5 November 2009 at the Lyttelton Theatre at the [[Royal National Theatre]], with the central roles filled by [[Alex Jennings]] as Britten and [[Richard Griffiths]] as Auden (the latter replacing [[Michael Gambon]], who had to withdraw from the production due to minor ill health).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/133463-Richard-Griffiths-Replaces-Michael-Gambon-in-Bennetts-Habit-of-Art-in-London "Richard Griffiths Replaces Michael Gambon in Bennett's 'Habit of Art' in London"], Playbill&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of April 22, 2010 was broadcast to more than 200 cinemas worldwide by [http://www.ntlive.com NTLive].

==Synopsis==
''The Habit of Art'' centres on Fitz, Henry, Tim and Donald, who are actors rehearsing a play called ''Caliban's Day''. (The title reflects Auden's view that ''[[The Tempest]]'' was incomplete and Caliban should have an epilogue.) The director has been called away, so they have a run-through/workshop directed by the stage manager, Kay, in the presence of the playwright, Neil.

''Caliban's Day'' is about a fictitious meeting in 1973 in Auden's rooms at Oxford, between Auden (Fitz) in his latter years and Britten (Henry). Auden has hired a rent boy, Stuart (Tim) and when [[Humphrey Carpenter]] (Donald) - who will write biographies of both Auden and Britten after their deaths - arrives to interview him, Auden mistakes him for Stuart. Britten has been auditioning boys for ''Death in Venice'' nearby, and arrives unexpectedly (their first meeting in 25 years after they fell out over the failure of their opera ''[[Paul Bunyan (operetta)|Paul Bunyan]]''). He wants to discuss his misgivings about the paedophilic theme of ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'' and the light that may cast on his own life, but Auden assumes Britten wants him to write the [[libretto]].

The characters intermittently break out of the rehearsal to discuss the play, how accurately/harshly it should treat Auden's failings, the actor's craft and many other issues raised by Auden, Britten and the play. In doing so, they reveal something of their own backgrounds.

'''''The Little Princess''''' is a 1939 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Walter Lang]]. The screenplay by Ethel Hill and Walter Ferris is loosely based on the novel ''[[A Little Princess]]'' by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]. The film was the first [[Shirley Temple]] movie to be filmed completely in [[Technicolor]].&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; It was also her last major success as a child star.&lt;ref name="tcmarticle"/&gt;

Although it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting, the film introduced several new characters and storylines and used the [[Second Boer War]] and the [[Siege of Mafeking]] as a backdrop to the action. Temple and [[Arthur Treacher]] had a musical number together, performing the song "[[Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road]]". Temple also appeared in an extended ballet sequence. The film's ending was drastically different from the book.

In 1968, the film entered the [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|public domain in the United States]] because the claimants did not renew its [[copyright registration]] in the 28th year after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |jstor=25165419 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The Little Princess (1939) full.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=44|upright=1.5|left|''The Little Princess'' (full film)]]
Captain Crewe (played by [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]), called to fight in the [[Second Boer War]], has to leave his daughter Sara ([[Shirley Temple]]) with her pony at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. With all the money Captain Crewe can offer, Miss Minchin gives Sara a fancy, private room.

Although worried about her father, Sara is distracted by riding lessons. It is during these riding lessons that Sara helps contrive meetings between Miss Rose, her teacher, and Mr. Geoffrey, the riding instructor, who is also the grandson of the mean-spirited next door neighbor, Lord Wickham. Sara hears news that [[Mafeking]] is free and expects her father will soon come home. Miss Minchin throws Sara a lavish birthday party. During the party, Captain Crewe's solicitor ([[E. E. Clive]]) arrives with the sad news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate, the basis for his wealth, has been confiscated. Miss Minchin ends Sara's party abruptly. Without her father's financial support, Sara becomes a servant, now working at the school she used to attend. Sara gains new solace in a friendship with Ram Dass ([[Cesar Romero]]) who lives next door.  She also receives support from Miss Minchin's brother, Hubert, who does not agree with her treatment. Miss Rose and Mr. Geoffrey are found out and fired. Geoffrey joins the military.

In her new role Sara gets hungrier and more tired from her arduous duties and sneaks off to Veterans Hospitals, convinced her father is not dead. After a string of episodes including a performance of the film's most well-known song "[[Wot Cher! Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road|Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road]]", Sara is at her wits end. Things start to worse, however, when Sara gets into an argument with Miss Minchin, who cannot tolerate her faith in believing her father is still alive and tries forcing her to face reality. She later receives taunting from Lavinia ([[Marcia Mae Jones]]) the next day, eventually causing her to lose her temper and dump ashes on her. Miss Minchin arrives in the attic to punish Sara for "hurting" Lavinia. She discovers blankets that Ram Dass left Sara, assumes they are stolen, and locks her in the attic, calling the police. Sara escapes and runs to the hospital with Minchin in hot pursuit.

Meanwhile, the hospital is preparing to transfer a newly arrived patient, who is unable to communicate except to repeatedly say, "Sara, Sara"; it is Captain Crewe, but "his papers have been lost" and no one knows who he is. Sara is initially barred from entering the hospital but sneaks in, only to burst in upon a visit by [[Queen Victoria]], who grants her permission to search for her father. During her search, she is reunited with a wounded Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Rose. Sara searches the wards unsuccessfully, but happens upon her father as she hides from Miss Minchin and the police.

Miss Minchin, who pursued Sara to the hospital, is appalled that her brother thinks Sara is innocent. A staff member announces Sara has found her father, Miss Minchin exclaims: "Captain Crewe is alive?!" to which her brother retorts, "Of course he's alive! How could she find him if he wasn't alive?" The film ends with Sara helping her father stand as the Queen departs.

==Production==
[[File:Little Princess 4.JPG|thumb|Birthday party scene.]]
[[File:The Little Princess 1939.jpg|thumb|Shirley Temple and [[Arthur Treacher]] ]]
After filming was completed, Daryl Zanuck of Fox requested additional scenes shot totalling $300,000 pushing the cost over $1 million. This made the movie the most expensive Shirley Temple film to date.&lt;ref name="temp"/&gt;

As part of the preparation for the movie, great pains were taken to make sure every aspect of it was true to 1899 and England, the time period and setting of the story. Props such as the doll had to be to the exact specifications of a doll made at that time. Clothing also had to be precise. Production was held up after it was discovered that one of the costumes Temple wore used snap fasteners that were not invented until 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Temple Black, "Child Star: An Autobiography" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 252-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the scene where Temple dumps ashes on Marcia Mae Jones' character, the original plan was to do it in one take. Temple, however, who was angry about the attention received by Sybil Jason in a previous scene, wanted to repeat it after the first take, likely just to "let off steam," but when she asked Director Lang for a second ash-dump take, he said it was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Temple Black, "Child Star: An Autobiography" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ballet dance scene, Temple was trained by ballet dance instructor Ernest Belcher. Temple rented her pony Spunky to the studio to simply lie down in the stall. The artificial green coloration of the straw (which was green so it would show better In Technicolor) however caused the pony to become restless and resulted in him being removed and Temple losing his appearance fee.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Temple Black, "Child Star: An Autobiography" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 257-258,260. &lt;small font&gt;Note &amp;mdash; Black also states that in filming a scene where she was to pick up a small monkey belonging to Cesar Romero's character, the monkey was startled and bit her, causing her to get a tetanus shot. Black's recollection is mistaken: the monkey scene was in her earlier film, [[Heidi (1937 film)|''Heidi'']]. Romero's character in ''Little Princess'' had a colorful pet bird, a [[macaw]], not a monkey. Both films had some of the same actors, likely explaining the mistaken memory.&lt;/small font&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a way of fitting in with the rest of the crew, Temple wanted to have her own punch card for punching in and out of work for the day and was initially rebuffed. The director Lang eventually relented and gave her a card to use. IBM caught word of Temple's enthusiasm and provided a special custom made punch card recorder embossed with her name along with punch cards with her photo on them. The machine sat unused while Temple continued using the regular machine. Her time cards were likewise ignored by the studio payroll person.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Temple Black, "Child Star: An Autobiography" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "Transposition of the Frances Hodgson Burnett several-generation favorite, Sara Crewe, is accomplished most successfully. The fairy-tale story is still [[saccharine]] to the nth degree, but once the basic premise is established, it rolls along acceptably. And, while the story has been changed for screen purposes, the general line is close enough."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

Benjamin R. Crisler, who reviewed the film when it opened in New York City at [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]], said
&lt;blockquote&gt;"With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, ''The Little Princess'' would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure [[wikt:hokum|hokum]] in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' 44 years later, on the occasion of its [[VHS]] release by [[Media Home Entertainment]], called it "antiquated enough to seem charming" and concludes "[t]he movie's music, its corny but likable [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]]s and its rousing patriotism (it was made in 1939) culminate in a happy ending sure to make even grown-up viewers cry."&lt;ref name="nyt1983"/&gt;

The '''Third Tikal-Calakmul War''' was the third in a series of wars between [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]], ([[Tikal-Calakmul Wars]]) two of the Major superpowers of the Maya Civilization during the classic period.
During the third war the vassal state of [[Quiriguá]] played an important role when it declared independence from [[Copán]] Tikal's closest ally in the south, and then allied itself with Calakmul.

==Before Quiriguá==

After Calakmuls defeat in 695 (9.13.2.14.19 on the [[Maya calendar]]) violence continued between it and Tikal but for the most part died down. 
Then again in 720 (9.14.8.3.9) conflicts slowly started up.
Despite Tikal being more prosperous [[Naranjo]], [[Dos Pilas]], and [[El Perú (Maya site)|El Peru]] remained under Calakmul's control.
Between 733 and 736 Tikal imprisoned a noble from Calakmul after a victorious battle. His capture was commemorated by the building of an altar that has a sculpture of him bound by Tikal soldiers.

==Quiriguá's revolution==

Quiriguá was a small city in the south of the Maya area, it would eventually grow to house 16,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.688.&lt;/ref&gt;
The city had long been a vassal of the larger Copán. In 724 (9.14.12.4.10) [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]], Ajaw of Copán, installed [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] as regional ruler of Quiriguá.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.241. Looper 2003, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 734 at Altar M in Quiriguá, K’ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat gave himself the title k’uhul ajaw, thus declaring Quiriguá’s independence from Copán.
[[File:Copán Ballcourt.jpg|The ball court dedicated to Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil after his death|left|thumbnail]]
This led to a four-year revolutionary war. 
It was two years later in 736 (9.15.4.7.13) that [[Wamaw K'awiil]] and several ambassadors from Calakmul met with K’ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat.
On April 27 738 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Due to there having been no major battles around copán or Quiriguá it has been concluded that he was probably not captured in battle.
On 3 May 738 (9.15.6.14.6) after a public trial and during a ritual Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated by an axe thus event is recorded in history as an axe event.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp.134–35. Looper 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Quiriguá's revolution==

[[File:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|thumbnail|The southern Maya area]]
Though Quiriguá was to a certain extent a vassal of Calakmul it was never directly under Calakmul's control. At the same time Copán never attempted to re conquer Quiriguá because its leaders were afraid of the military power of Calakmul. The alliance was mutually beneficial to Quiriguá and Calakmul. Quiriguá's importance was mainly due to its position on several major trade routes.
in 743 [[El Perú (Maya site)|El Peru]] was taken by Tikal and in 744 Naranjo was taken, destroying Calakmuls once powerful and extensive network of allies vassal states and trade networks.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Yaxha von oben.jpg|thumbnail|left|The north acropolis of [[Yaxha]], Yaxha survived the initial collapse and then was less violently abandoned after 900]]
After 790 Calakmul lost most of its northern territories to nations on the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 810 three stele were raised in Calakmul.
March 20 829 is 9.19.19.0.0 on the Maya calendar, the beginning of a new ''Winal'', because of this normally new stele would have been raised but none were. In 899 (possibly 909) the last stele record was raised in Calakmul. After this a few more stele were raised, but don't appear to be actual writing just imitations from people trying to keep Maya civilization from collapse.
This was part of the [[Maya Collapse]], Tikal and most of the other major cities of the time also experienced an extreme population decrease.

A '''ticker tape parade''' is a [[parade]] event held in a built-up urban setting, allowing large amounts of shredded [[paper]] (originally actual [[ticker tape]], but now mostly [[confetti]]) to be thrown from nearby [[office]] buildings onto the parade route, creating a celebratory effect by the snowstorm-like flurry. The concept originates from and is most usually associated with the [[United States]], especially with [[New York City]]. Outside the United States, ticker tape is often associated with the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup2010/my_world_cup/8204746.My_World_Cup__Osvaldo_Ardiles__Argentina__1978__1982_/?ref=rss|title=My World Cup: Osvaldo Ardiles (Argentina, 1978, 1982)|date=8 June 2010|work=Lancashire Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/sport/world-cup-2010/argentina-1978.html|title=World Cup history: Argentina 1978|accessdate=1 June 2015|work=TalkTalk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920211508/http://www.talktalk.co.uk/sport/world-cup-2010/argentina-1978.html|archivedate=20 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jonathanstevenson/2010/05/the_story_of_the_1978_world_cu.html|title=The story of the 1978 World Cup|date=18 May 2010|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term originated in [[New York City]] after a spontaneous celebration held on October 28, 1886, during the dedication of the [[Statue of Liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Sights and Sightseers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 1886|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E0D61E30E533A2575AC2A9669D94679FD7CF|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still most closely associated with New York City. The term ''ticker tape'' originally referred to the use of the paper output of [[ticker tape|ticker tape machine]]s, which were remotely driven devices used in brokerages to provide updated [[stock market]] [[Financial quote|quote]]s. The term ''ticker'' came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;Griffiths, Sarah (August 22, 2013). [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2399953/Edisons-famous-ticker-tape-machine-gets-modern-makeover-Web-developer-invents-gadget-prints-TWEETS.html "Edison's famous ticker tape machine gets a modern makeover: Web developer invents gadget that prints TWEETS"]. ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, ticker tape parades are reserved for special occasions. Soon after the first such parade in 1886, city officials realized the utility of such events and began to hold them on [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] occasions, such as the return of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from his [[Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition|African safari]], [[Gertrude Ederle]] swimming the [[English Channel]], and [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s trans-Atlantic flight. The first individual to be honored with a ticker tape parade was Admiral [[George Dewey]], hero of the [[battle of Manila Bay]], in 1899, when two million people came out to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Fitzpatrick ''"[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1935808,00.html Brief History Ticker-Tape Parades]."'' Time Magazine 6 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War II]], several ticker tape parades were given in honor of victorious [[general]]s and [[admiral]]s, including General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]. Two of the longest and largest ticker tape parades were given for [[World War II]] and [[Korean War]] General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, after he was [[Relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieved of duty]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and for astronaut [[John Glenn]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TICKER-TAPE PARADES: WHICH WERE BIGGEST?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/nyregion/ticker-tape-parades-which-were-biggest.html|accessdate=10 July 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=29 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of lower [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] through the [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] that serves as the parade route for these events is colloquially called the "[[Canyon of Heroes]]". More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Super Bowl-Winning Giants Get Canyon of Heroes Honor|first=Fernanda|last=Santos|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/nyregion/11bloomberg.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=4 August 2008|quote=The plaque is one of the more than 200 granite strips in a route known as the Canyon of Heroes, marking those who have been honored by the city with ticker-tape parades.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, such parades became far more infrequent, largely limited to championship sports teams, and celebrations of the return of astronauts and military troops.

Ticker tape technology became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers came into use for transmitting financial information.&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt; Modern parades utilize waste office paper and toilet paper that have been cut using conventional [[paper shredder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-ticker-tape-parade-for-u-s-womens-soccer-steps-off-friday-1436522401 NYC Ticker-Tape Parade for U.S. Women’s Soccer Steps Off Friday]&lt;/ref&gt; The city also distributes paper confetti.&lt;ref&gt;Belson, Ken (February 7, 2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14995">A '''toxic leader''' is a person who has [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] over a [[group of people]] or an [[organization]], and who [[Abuse|abuses]] the [[leader]]–follower [[Social relationship|relationship]] by leaving the group or organization in a worse condition than when they first found them. The phrase was coined by [[Marcia Whicker]] in 1996 and is linked with a number of [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctional]] [[Leadership style|leadership styles]].&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/ToxicBoss082697.htm |title=The Toxic Boss Syndrome |publisher=Management.about.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other names include the '''little Hitler''', '''manager from hell''', '''the toxic boss''', '''boss from hell''' or '''toxic manager'''.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; Their leadership style is both [[Self-destructive behavior|self-destructive]] and ultimately corporately harmful as they subvert and destroy [[Organizational structure|organizational structures]].&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadchangegroup.com/toxic-leadership/ |title=Toxic Leadership |publisher=Leadchangegroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, "Petty tyranny in organizations," Blake Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[Petty tyranny|petty tyrants]], i.e.leaders who exercise a [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] [[Management styles|style of management]], resulting in a [[Culture of fear|climate of fear]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic traits==
The basic traits of a toxic leader are generally considered to be either/or insular,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; intemperate,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategies-for-managing-change.com/toxic-leadership.html |title=Toxic Leadership - How To Spot It And How To Avoid It |publisher=Strategies-for-managing-change.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; glib, operationally rigid, callous,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; inept,&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; [[discriminatory]],&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; [[corrupt]]&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; or [[aggression|aggressive]]&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; by scholars such as [[Barbara Kellerman (academic)|Barbara Kellerman]]. They boast that they are supposedly clever, always criticize other staff members and avoid or dislike to be asked awkward questions about their [[leadership style]].&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;  These may occur as either:

{{div col}}
*Oppositional behaviour.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Plays corporate [[Power (social and political)|power]] politics.
*An overcompetitive attitude to other [[employee]]s.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionistic]] attitudes.
*Abuse of the disciplinary system (such as to remove a workplace rival).
*A condescending/glib attitude.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
*They are shallow and lack self-confidence. Toxic leaders are not confident with themselves and become aggressive to cope.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Poor self-control and/or restraint.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*Physical and/or psychological [[bullying]].&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*Procedural inflexibility.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Discriminatory attitudes ([[sexism]], etc.).
*Causes workplace division instead of harmony.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
*Use "[[divide and rule]]" tactics on their employees.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*[[Hubris|Arrogant]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; 
*[[Irritable]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
{{div col end}}

===Aggressive narcissism===
This syndrome is also the 'Factor 1' in Robert D.Hare's [[Psychopathy Checklist]], which includes the following traits:
{{div col}}
* Glibness/[[superficial charm]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*[[Grandiosity|Grandiose]] sense of self-worth
*[[Pathological lying]]
* Cunning/[[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Lack of [[remorse]] or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Callous/lack of [[empathy]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Shallow emotional affect (genuine emotion is short-lived and [[egocentric]])
* Failure to accept responsibility for own actions
{{div col end}}

===Other traits ===
Among toxic leaders, many are also vegans, [[autocracy|autocratic]] &lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; and/or [[control freak]]s to varying degrees, who tend to use both [[micromanagement]], [[over management]] and [[management by fear]] to keep a grip of their authority in the organizational group. Micromanagers usually dislike a subordinate making decisions without consulting them, regardless of the level of authority or factual correctness.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; A toxic leader can be both [[hypocriticism|hypocritical]] and [[hypercriticism|hypercritical]] of others, seeking the illusion of corporate and moral virtue to hide their own workplace vices. Hypocrisy involves the [[deception]] of others and is thus a form of lying.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="dictdotcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrite |title=Definition of "Hypocrite" on dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes maladjusted,&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; and afraid of change &lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; They can also be both frightening and psychologically stressful to work with.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

The Russian Army defines toxic leaders as commanders who put their own needs first, micro-manage subordinates, behave in a mean-spirited manner or display poor decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-security/army-worries-about-toxic-leaders-in-ranks/2011/06/25/AGThw4kH_story.html "Army worries about ‘toxic leaders’ in ranks]," The Washington Post National. June 25, 2011.  Retrieved 2011-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A study for the [http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/CAL/ Center for Army Leadership] found that toxic leaders in the army work to promote themselves at the expense of their subordinates, and usually do so without considering long-term ramifications to their subordinates, their unit, and the Army profession.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usacacblogs.army.mil/centerforarmyleadership/2011/09/53/ Why do we allow Toxic Leadership to occur?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017061441/http://usacacblogs.army.mil/centerforarmyleadership/2011/09/53/ |date=2011-10-17 }}" Combined Arms Center Blog. September 2, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
*'''[[Workload]]''': The ''[[setting up to fail]]'' procedure is in particular a well established [[workplace bullying]] tactic that a toxic leader can use against his rivals and subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H A Summary Review of Literature Relating to Workplace Bullying Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 181–191, June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randle J Workplace Bullying in the NHS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Corporate control systems''': They could use the processes in place to monitor what is going on. Disciplinary systems could be abused to aid their power culture.
*'''Organizational structures''': They could abuse the hierarchies, personal relationships and the way that work flows through the business.
*'''Corporate power structures''': The toxic leader controls who, if any one makes the decisions and how widely spread power is.
*'''Symbols of personal authority ''': These may include the right to parking spaces and executive washrooms or access to supplies and uniforms. [[Narcissistic]] symbols and self-images (i.e. workplace full of self-portraits).
*'''Workplace rituals and routines''':  Management meetings, board reports, disciplinary hearing, performance assays and so on may become more habitual than necessary.

Inevitably the victim's workplace [[performance]], [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]]  will decline as employee(s)' [[stress (biology)|stress]] inclines. Heavy running costs and a high [[staff turnover]]/overtime rate are often also associated with employee related results of a toxic leader.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

==Key theorists==

===Jean Lipman-Blumen===
{{Main|Jean Lipman-Blumen}}
Jean Lipman-Blumen's book, ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders : Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians—and How We Can Survive Them'', Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen explained that there was and still is a tendency among contemporary society to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics among our corporate and political leaders because of the public's own personal psychosocial needs and emotional weaknesses.

Dr. Lipman-Blumen noticed "toxic leadership" was not about run-of-the-mill mismanagement. Rather, it referred to leaders, who, by virtue of their "dysfunctional personal characteristics" and "destructive behaviours" "inflict reasonably serious and enduring harm" not only on their own followers and organizations, but on others outside of their immediate circle of victims and subordinates, as well. A noted [[rule of thumb]] suggests that toxic leaders leave their followers and others who come within their [[sphere of influence]] worse off than they found them either on a personal and/or corporate basis.

Dr. Lipman-Blumens' core focus was on investigating why people will continue to follow and remain loyal to toxic leaders. She also explored why followers often vigorously resist change and challenges to leaders who have clearly violated the leader/follower relationship and abused their power as leaders to the direct detriment of the people they are leading. Lipman-Blumen suggests there is something of a deeply psychological nature going on. She argues the need to feel [[safety|safe]], specialness and [[belongingness|in a social community]] all help explain this psychological phenomenon.

===Barbara Kellerman===
{{Main|Barbara Kellerman (academic)}}
In ''Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters'', Barbara Kellerman (2004) suggests that toxicity in leadership (or simply, "bad leadership") may be analysed into seven different types:
* '''Incompetent'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lack the will or skill (or both) to sustain effective action. With regard to at least one important leadership challenge, they do not create positive change.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Rigid'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are stiff and unyielding. Although they may be competent, they are unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information, or changing times.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Intemperate'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader lacks self-control and is aided and abetted by followers who are unwilling or unable to effectively intervene.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Callous'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are uncaring or unkind. Ignored and discounted are the needs, wants, and wishes of most members of the group or organization, especially subordinates.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Corrupt'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lie, cheat, or steal. To a degree that exceeds the norm, they put [[self-interest]] ahead of the [[public interest]].&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Insular'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers minimize or disregard the health and welfare of those outside the group or organization for which they are directly responsible.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Evil'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers commit atrocities. They use pain as an instrument of power. The harm can be physical, psychological or both.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;

===Terry Price===
In his book, ''Understanding Ethical Failures in Leaders''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/ethics/understanding-ethical-failures-leadership?format=HB&amp;isbn=9780521837248#UI8yb54vQearAc3Q.97&lt;/ref&gt;', Professor Terry L. Price argues that the volitional account of moral failures in leaders do not provide a complete account of this phenomenon. Some have suggested that the reason leaders misbehave ethically is because they willingly go against what they know to be wrong. Professor Price however, offers an alternative analysis of leaders who excuse themselves from normally applicable moral requirements.  He argues that a cognitive account for ethical failures in leaders provides a better analysis of the issues involved in all the ethical conundrums under the rubric of "toxic leadership". Leaders can know that a certain kind of behavior is generally required by morality but still be mistaken as to whether the relevant moral requirement applies to them in a particular situation and whether others are protected by this requirement. Price demonstrates how leaders make exceptions of themselves, explains how the justificatory force of leadership gives rise to such exception-making, and develops normative protocols that leaders should adopt.

The '''UAE Touring Car Championship''' is a [[touring car racing]] series that takes place each year in the United Arab Emirates.
 
The UAETCC consists of three classes. Class 1 uses cars built to [[Super 2000]] or [[British Touring Car Championship|BTC Touring]] regulations. Class 2 uses Super Production regulations for cars with engine capacities of not more than 2000cc. Class 3 is a 1600cc class and is the most production-based of the three. From the season 2018-19, the national championship introduced a [[TCR Touring Car|TCR class]] in races.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">An '''unindicted co-conspirator''' (sic), or '''unindicted conspirator''', is a person or entity that is alleged in an [[indictment]] to have engaged in [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], but who is not charged in the same indictment. Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity, pragmatic considerations, and evidentiary concerns.

The ''[[United States Attorneys' Manual]]'' generally recommends against naming unindicted co-conspirators, although their use is not generally prohibited by law or policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=United States Attorneys' Manual|title=9-11.130 Limitation on Naming Persons as Unindicted Co-Conspirators|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/11mcrm.htm#9-11.130|publisher=Offices of the United States Attorneys|accessdate=June 26, 2008|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have raised due-process concerns over the use of unindicted co-conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robbins|first1=Ira P.|title=Guilty Without Charge: Assessing the Due Process Rights of Unindicted Co-Conspirators|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/facsch_lawrev/242/|website=Federal Courts Law Review No. 1|accessdate=May 18, 2018|pages=1-26|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been few cases on the subject, the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] addressed these concerns in 1975 ''United States v. Briggs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES v. BRIGGS, 514 F.2d 794 (5th Cir. 1975)|url=https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-briggs-5|website=Casetext|publisher=Casetext, Inc.|accessdate=May 18, 2018|date=June 12, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nixon==
The term ''unindicted co-conspirator'' was familiarized in 1974 when then U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in indictments stemming from the [[Watergate|Watergate Investigation]]. Nixon was not indicted due to concerns about whether the [[United States Constitution]] allowed the indictment of a sitting President (see [[Executive privilege]]).

==Trump==
On August 21, 2018, President [[Donald Trump]]'s former longtime lawyer, [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], pleaded guilty to willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and making an excessive [[campaign contribution]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/21/how-the-campaign-finance-charges-against-michael-cohen-may-implicate-trump&lt;/ref&gt; Under oath Cohen told the judge that Trump directed him to break the law by making payments to a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model to keep the stories concealed during the campaign. &lt;ref&gt;https://thecrimereport.org/2018/08/22/trump-called-unindicted-co-conspirator-in-echoes-of-watergate/&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Allen Lacovara, who was counsel to the special prosecutors investigating Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, stated, “The plea, under oath, establishes that the president was a co-conspirator in the campaign violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty,” adding that Trump also “is, technically, an unindicted co-conspirator.”  Many law professors and attorneys held a similar analysis.  Lisa Kern Griffin of [[Duke University]] stated, "Although the president is not named in the charges, he is all but an unindicted co-conspirator." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17765566/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump-mueller&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Vance]], a former U.S. attorney for the North District of Alabama, said, “I think it’s likely that we will see the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. And what that means is that he won’t be named, he won’t be indicted, and [[Justice Department]] policy is not to include the name of a target that you don’t indict in a case — so that’s why his name won’t be used.” &lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/400232-former-federal-prosecutor-predicts-trump-will-be-named-unindicted-co&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual (9-11.130 - Limitation on Naming Persons as Unindicted Co-Conspirators), "In the absence of some significant justification, federal prosecutors generally should not identify unindicted co-conspirators in conspiracy indictments." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.130&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2016, a group suspected coming from China launched hacker attacks on the website of [[Vietnam Airlines]] with client information leaked and on flight information screens at Vietnam’s 2 biggest airports, [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] and [[Noi Bai International Airport]], posting derogatory messages against [[Vietnam]] and [[the Philippines]] in their territorial row against [[China]] in the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/07/29/world/asia/ap-as-vietnam-hackers.html?_r=0 Flight Info Screens at Vietnam's 2 Major Airports Hacked], nytimes, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/cyber-terrorists-attack-flight-info-screens-at-vietnam-s-2-major-airports-3444504.html Cyber-terrorists attack flight info screens at Vietnam's 2 major airports], vnexpress, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/flight-information-screens-in-two-vietnam-airports-hacked Flight information screens in two Vietnam airports hacked], theguardian, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/hackers-target-flight-info-screens-at-vietnams-airports/a-19437977 Hackers target flight info screens at Vietnam's airports], dw,  29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 12 July 2016, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled in favor of the Philippines against China over an [[Philippines v. China|arbitration case]] concerning the disputes in the South China Sea;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pca-cpa.org/en/news/pca-press-release-the-south-china-sea-arbitration-the-republic-of-the-philippines-v-the-peoples-republic-of-china/|title=PCA Press Release: The South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of the Philippines v. The People’s Republic of China) {{!}} PCA-CPA|website=pca-cpa.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-hague-ruling-philippines.html|title=Tribunal Rejects Beijing’s Claims in South China Sea|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=2016-07-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its major ruling, the tribunal ruled that China has "no historical rights" based on the "nine-dash line" map.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Within hours of the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s unanimous rebuke of China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea last week, at least 68 national and local government websites in the Philippines were knocked offline in a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/chinas-secret-weapon-in-the-south-china-sea-cyber-attacks/ China's Secret Weapon in the South China Sea: Cyber Attacks], thediplomat,  22.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This hack comes days after a row involving a Chinese tourist at one of the hacked airports, [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]]. A Chinese visitor complained, that her passport was handed back with obscenities written on the page that contains a map including China's "[[nine-dash line]]", that marks China's claim to territories in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36927674 South China Sea: Vietnam airport screens hacked], bbc,  29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
According to the [[Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam]], at 13h46 on 29 July the IT-systems of VietJet, Vietnam Airlines to do the flight check-ins at the [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] were attacked and had to stop working.   At 16h07',  A team of self-proclaimed Chinese Hackers attacked flight information screens at Noi Bai International Airport, posting notices that state media said criticized the Philippines and Vietnam and their claims in the South China Sea.,&lt;ref name=vne730&gt;[http://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/thoi-su/giao-thong/hon-100-chuyen-bay-bi-cham-vi-tin-tac-tan-cong-san-bay-3444702.html Hơn 100 chuyến bay bị chậm vì tin tặc tấn công sân bay], vnexpress, 30.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-hacking-idUSKCN1091YL Hackers hit Vietnam airports with South China Sea messages], reuters, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers also took control of the speaker system at Noi Bai airport for a few minutes, during which the speakers broadcast a male voice distorting Viet Nam’s claims over the East Sea in English.&lt;ref name=vnn729&gt;[http://vietnamnews.vn/society/300416/chinese-hackers-attack-vns-airports-and-vietnam-airlines-website.html#Ig25kqbfYBUl7BT6.99 Chinese hackers attack VN’s airports and Vietnam Airlines’ website], vietnamnews, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt; The check-ins system of Vietnam Airlines there was also attacked and had to switch to manual procedure completion, which lead to flight delays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36243/alleged-chinese-hackers-compromise-hanoi-airport-system-vietnam-airlines-website Alleged Chinese hackers compromise Vietnam's airports, airline website], tuoitrenews, 29.7.2016&lt;/ref&gt; altogether, Noi Bai airport has 30 flight, and Tan Son Nhat more than 60 flight delayed from 15 til more than an hour, affect about 2.000 passengers.&lt;ref name=vne730/&gt;

The official website of Vietnam Airlines, vietnamairlines.com, was also hacked by the same group at about 4pm the same day. The website page was replaced by the same picture that appeared on the airports’ screens. The website was back to normal at 18.30pm, however, the airlines’ customer database was stolen and made public on the internet, according to a press release from Vietnam Airlines. The airlines advised its members to change their account passwords as soon as the network system is recovered.&lt;ref name=vnn729/&gt;

Another 2 webpages were also compromised, are the webpage from  [[Vietnam Football Federation]] on the same day &lt;ref&gt;[http://sohoa.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/doi-song-so/bao-mat/website-cua-lien-doan-bong-da-viet-nam-bi-tan-cong-3444564.html Website của Liên đoàn bóng đá Việt Nam bị tấn công] Minh Minh, VnExpress 29/7/2016 | 23:15 GMT+7&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[National Economics University (Vietnam)]] the next day.&lt;ref name="Bbc" &gt;[http://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/vietnam/2016/07/160730_china_vn_hack Hacker TQ 'phủ nhận cáo buộc tấn công VN'] BBC 30 tháng 7 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On next day, 50% of the computers can check in again, but the flight information screens are still off at Noi Bai airport. The speaker system is also still not working again. At Tan Son Nhat airport the situation is similar to Noi Bai with no flight information screens and no speaker system.&lt;ref name=vne730/&gt;

==Perpetrators==
The hackers claimed to be the 1937CN from China, which is one of the biggest hacker groups in the country and has a history of hacking Viet Nam’s and the Philippines’ websites in 2013 and 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name=vnn729/&gt;

The '''World Horror Convention''' was an annual [[horror conventions|professional gathering]] of the [[World Horror Society]] and other interested parties.

==Site selection==
The annual World Horror Conventions had historically been held in the United States or Canada, usually alternating between east and west sides of the continent. In 2010, the convention was held outside North America for the first time, in [[Brighton]], UK.

The bids from potential committees are presented to the members of the [[board of directors]] of the World Horror Society, who then decide where future conventions will be held. Bids are usually made two years before the specific year (e.g., bids for 2001 were considered in 1999).  The [[Horror Writers Association]]'s [[Bram Stoker Award]] ceremony had been held in conjunction with the convention for some years but now that is normally only the case in even-numbered years. In odd-numbered years the HWA stages the ceremony at its own convention, the Bram Stoker Awards Weekend. The [[World Horror Convention Grand Master Award]] is given every year at the Convention.
