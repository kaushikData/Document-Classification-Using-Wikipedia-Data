'''Al-Ahsa''', '''Al-Hasa''', or '''Hadjar''' ({{lang-ar|الأحساء}} ''al-Aḥsāʾ'', locally ''al-Ahasā'') is a traditional [[oasis]] [[historical region]] in eastern [[Saudi Arabia]] whose name is used by the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate]], which makes up much of that country's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]]. The [[oasis]] is located about 60&amp;nbsp;km inland from the coast of the  [[Persian Gulf]].

Al-Ahsa is part of the region known historically for its high skill in tailoring, especially in making ''[[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]]'', a traditional men's cloak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/fashion/traditional-modern-saudi-mans-bisht |title=Traditional &amp; modern: The Saudi man's bisht |website=arabnews.com |last=al Mukhtar |first=Rima |date= 9 November 2012 |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Bahrain geographical province is in Eastern Arabia, which includes the eastern coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] down to the borders of the [[UAE]], [[Oman]], and also includes the island of [[Bahrain Island|Awal]] (modern-day [[Bahrain]]). Historically, Al-Ahsa was the main city in Al-Bahrain province, making up most of its population and providing most of its agricultural output.

The site has become a [[World Heritage]] site in 2018.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1563/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=2228|title=Al-Ahsa Oasis, an evolving Cultural Landscape|work=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been part of [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] since December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/849681|title=Al-Ahsa enters UNESCO Creative Cities Network|date=2015-12-13|work=Arab News|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Al-Ahsa is a plural word of "Al-Hisa" ({{lang-ar|الحِسَى}}) which refers to the accumulated sand with solid underneath. Thus, if the rain comes down, the sand would prevent the sun from drying the water up, and the solid base would stop it from submerging. Hence, the site would become when drilled like a sweet cold spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1/|title=تعريف و معنى الاحساء في معجم المعاني الجامع - معجم عربي عربي|work=almaany.com|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Al-Ahsa has been inhabited since prehistoric times, due to its abundance of water in an otherwise arid region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcci.org.sa/English/AlAhsa/Pages/AboutAlahsa.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural fresh-water springs have surfaced at [[oasis|oases]] in the region for millennia, encouraging human habitation and agricultural efforts ([[date palm]] cultivation especially) since prehistoric times.  Recently, Al-Ahsa Oasis has been nominated as one of the seven wonders of the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Its early history is similar to that of [[Eastern Arabia]]. In 899&amp;nbsp;A.D., the region came under the control of the [[Qarmatians|Qarmatian]] leader, [[Abu Tahir al-Jannabi]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-226-89428-2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheatley|first=Paul|title=The Places Where Men Pray Together: Cities in Islamic Lands, Seventh Through the Tenth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0ANg137kEMC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89428-7|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was declared independent from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] of [[Baghdad]]. Its capital was at al-Mu'miniya near modern [[Hofuf]]. By circa 1000, Al-Hasa became the 9th largest city worldwide supporting 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201c.htm Al Hasa population soared to 100,000 by circa 1000]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1077, the Qarmatian state of Al-Ahsa was overthrown by the [[Uyunids]].  Al-Ahsa subsequently fell under the rule of the [[Bahrani]] dynasty of the [[Usfurids]], followed by their relatives, the [[Jabrid]]s, who became one of the most formidable powers in the region, retaking the islands of [[Bahrain]] from the princes of [[Ormus|Hormuz]]. The last Jabrid ruler of Bahrain was [[Muqrin ibn Zamil]].

In 1521, the [[Portuguese Empire]] conquered the Awal Islands (the islands that comprise present day Bahrain) from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil, who fell strongly in battle.&lt;ref name="isbn0-86372-401-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Al-Juhany, Uwidah Metaireek |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Najd before the Salafi reform movement: social, political and religious conditions during the three centuries preceding the rise of the Saudi state |edition= |language= |publisher=Ithaca Press |location=London |year=2002 |origyear= |quote= |isbn=0-86372-401-9 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MzN1Mo8_bd4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=1521+Awal+portegese&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=nMlnSPGOMJSCjwHw6rX-BQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U3mjovC2GTKf3AYcJyVVudqoib4dA|accessdate=|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jabrids struggled to maintain their position on the mainland in the face of the [[Ottomans]] and their tribal allies, the [[Muntafiq]].  In 1550, Al-Ahsa and nearby [[Qatif]] came under the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-313-32021-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Long, David |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Culture and Customs of Saudi Arabia (Culture and Customs of the Middle East) |edition= |language= |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |origyear= |quote= |isbn=0-313-32021-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VKisHwiTxJQC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=Al-Hasa&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=TH1nSMaFJ5SCjwHw6rX-BQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U28Gti31PK9ZswE9JfChNzTo5jfHg|accessdate=|page= xiv, p8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Ahsa was nominally the [[Eyalet of Lahsa]] in the Ottoman administrative system, and was usually a [[vassal state|vassal]] of the Porte. Qatif was later lost to the Portuguese.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Ottomans were expelled from Al-Ahsa in 1670,&lt;ref name="isbn0-313-32021-7" /&gt; and the region came under the rule of the chiefs of [[Banu Khalid]] tribe.

Al-Ahsa, along with Qatif, was incorporated into the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabist]] [[Emirate of Diriyah]] in 1795, but returned to Ottoman control in 1818 with an invasion ordered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]].  The Banu Khalid were again installed as rulers of the region but, in 1830, the [[Emirate of Nejd]] retook the region.

Direct Ottoman rule was restored in 1871,&lt;ref name="isbn0-313-32021-7" /&gt; and Al-Ahsa was placed first under [[Baghdad Vilayet]] and with Baghdad's subdivision [[Basra Vilayet]] in 1875. In 1913, [[ibn Saud]], the founder of modern [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa|annexed]] Al-Ahsa and Qatif into his domain of [[Najd]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7614-7571-0"&gt;{{cite book |author= |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=World and its peoples |edition= |language= |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |location=London |year=2006 |origyear=  |quote= |isbn=0-7614-7571-0 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Al-Hasa+ottomans&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=2X1nSIuKD4egiwH8kMCGBg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1k6RLNXLf1VZgzM-q8xBoq43h16Q#PPA29,M1|accessdate=|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1922, [[Percy Cox]] officially notified Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah that Kuwait's borders had been modified.&lt;ref name="isbn1850435707"&gt;{{cite book|last=Finnie|first=David|title=Shifting Lines in the Sand|publisher=I B Tauris|date=1992-12-31|isbn=1-85043-570-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZrnZpS84xoC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;vq=december+2,+1922&amp;dq=1922+Percy++Cox&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U1E6dAs33YU2iib38PajYJaYYp87Q|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, Major John More, the British representative in Kuwait, had met with Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia to settle the border issue between Kuwait and [[Najd]]. The result of the meeting was the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922]], in which Britain recognized [[ibn Saud]]'s sovereignty over territories claimed by the emir of Kuwait.

[[File:BalthasarBekker.gif|thumb|200px|Balthasar Bekker by J. Hilarides (1691)]]

'''Balthasar Bekker''' (20 March 1634 – 11 June 1698) was a Dutch minister and author of philosophical and theological works. Opposing [[superstition]], he was a key figure in the end of the [[witchcraft]] persecutions in [[early modern Europe]].  His best known work is ''De Betoverde Weereld'' (1691), or ''The World Bewitched'' (1695).

==Life==
Bekker was born in [[Metslawier]] ([[Dongeradeel]]) as the son of a German pastor from [[Bielefeld]]. He was educated at [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], under [[Jacob Alting]], and at [[Franeker]]. Becoming the rector of the local [[Latin school]], he was appointed to his satisfaction in 1657 as a pastor in Oosterlittens ([[Littenseradiel]]), and started as one of the first to preach on Sunday afternoon.

From 1679 he worked in [[Amsterdam]], after being driven from [[Friesland]]. In 1683 he travelled to England and France. In two months time Bekker visited London, Cambridge, Oxford, Paris and [[Leuven]], with a great interest in the art of [[fortification]].&lt;ref&gt;Bekker, Balthasar (1998) ''Beschrijving van de reis door de Verenigde Nederlanden, Engeland en Frankrijk in het jaar 1683''. [[Fryske Akademy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
An enthusiastic disciple of [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he wrote several works on philosophy and theology, which by their freedom of thought aroused considerable hostility.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=661}} In his book ''De Philosophia Cartesiana'' Bekker argued that theology and philosophy each had their separate terrain and that Nature can no more be explained through Scripture than can theological truth be deduced from Nature.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=895}} 
[[File:Bekker - Betoverde weereld.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of ''De betoverde weereld'']]

His best known work was ''De Betoverde Weereld'' (1691), or ''The World Bewitched'' (1695), in which he examined critically the phenomena generally ascribed to spiritual agency.  He attacked the belief in sorcery and [[demonic possession|"possession" by the devil]].  Indeed, he questioned the devil's very existence.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=661}} He applied the doctrine of [[accommodation (religion)|accommodation]] to account for the biblical passages traditionally cited on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ThoemmesDutch|Bekker, Balthasar|74–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book had a sensational effect and was one of the key works of the Early [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe.  It was almost certainly the most controversial.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=925}} Bekker became a heroic figure defying an army of obscurantists.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=928}}

The publication of the book led to Bekker's deposition from the ministry. The orthodox among Dutch theologians saw his views as placing him among notorious atheists: [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Adriaan Koerbagh]], [[Lodewijk Meyer]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. [[Eric Walten]] came to his defence, attacking his opponents in extreme terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{ThoemmesDutch|Walten, Eric|1065–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bekker was tried for blasphemy, maligning the public Church, and spreading atheistic ideas about Scripture. Some towns banned the book, but Amsterdam and the States of Holland never did, continuing his salary, without formally stripping him of his post.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=930}}

''The World Bewitched'' is now considered interesting as an early study in comparative religion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=661}}&lt;ref&gt;Nooijen, Annemarie (2009) "Unserm grossen Bekker ein Denkmal?" Balthasar Bekkers 'Betoverde Weereld' in den deutschen Landen zwischen Orthodoxie und Aufklärung&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In July 1698 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bekker%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Amsterdam{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=661}}

}}[[File:Camel in arabia.jpg|thumb|A camel in Arabia]]
The '''Basus''' (or '''Basous''') '''War''' (often written '''al-Basus War'''; {{Lang-ar|حرب البسوس}} ''ḥarb al-basūs'') was a conflict for 40 years between two cousin tribes in [[Arabia]] of [[Late Antiquity]] which started by the killing a camel owned by a man named "ٍSaad Bin Shams", a refugee under the protection of a Woman named "Al-Basus". Al-Basus, like any other Arab at that time, considered this as great insult to her honor which started a chain of events that lead to the war.&lt;ref&gt;^ ثمار القلوب في المضاف والمنسوب الثعالبي ص 95 &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taghlib]] and [[Banu Bakr|Bakr]] tribes fought for roughly forty years (from 494-534 CE), locked in a perpetual cycle of vengeance. In parts of the [[Arab world]] today, the Basus War has been incorporated into an [[aphorism]] warning people against [[Feud|vendetta]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Detailed History of Arabs Prior to Islam by Jawad Ali, Baghdad University 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Story'''

The story happened long before the Islamic era in Arabia, the start of the 40-year war was when a woman called Al-Basous, went to visit her niece, Jalila bint Murrah, along with her nephew, Jassas ibn Murrah, all of them belonged to the tribe of Bakr.

Jalila was married to the leader of Taghleb tribe, his name was Kulayb, known to be extremely protective of his property and land. He saw a strange camel in his territory, and shot it with an arrow. The camel belonged to Al-Basous, who got furious and exaggeratingly complained to her nephew that she was humiliated and insulted by this act. Jassas, enraged by his aunt’s words went to the leader of Taghleb, his brother in-law, and killed him.
 
This triggered the war between the two tribes. One of Bakr’s allies, a tribe leader called Al-Harith ibn Abbad, thought that he would not drag himself into this silly battle, over and above, he took an initiative to stop the blood-shed by sending his son, Ojayr, to now leader of Taghleb and brother of the late Kulayb, Al-Mohalhal , for truce. It was a tradition at that time to send someone of great significance to sacrifice himself for the killing of someone, and it was expected that he would then be forgiven to start peace. But unexpectedly, and away from traditions and ethics, Al-Mohalhal killed Ojayr! The mourning father said a poem of 40 verses, stating that he is now part of it (the war). He ordered his men to shave their heads, and he cut his horse’s mane and tail hair, which became a tradition since then among the Arabs as a sign of grief until revenge. The war almost ended the last few of Taghleb, and Al-Harith said his famous word, I will not talk to Taghleb until earth talks to me, i.e never!

When Taghleb thought it was the end, they dug a trench along the road where Al-Harith ibn Abbad passes by, a man from Taghleb hid there and sang a poem asking for forgiveness, and fulfilling the condition of (earth talking to Al-Harith) . At the time he had avenged his son’s death, and didn’t have to back on his said word (I will not talk to Taghleb until earth talks to me). The 40 years war had ended!

Plavšić was infamous for some of her comments during the war and for her April 1992 appearance in Bijeljina with [[Željko Ražnatović]], aka Arkan. Plavšić declared that "six million Serbs can die so that the remaining six million can live in freedom" and considered the [[ethnic cleansing]] carried out against non-Serbs during the war to be a "natural phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-53854-1 |page=389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1993, in a statement to ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'', Plavšić reportedly claimed that Bosnian Serbs are ethnically-racially superior to [[Bosnian Muslims]] and claimed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilmer |first=Franke |title=The Social Construction of Man, the State and War: Identity, Conflict, and Violence in Former Yugoslavia |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-92963-9 |page=217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Serbs in Bosnia, particularly in the border areas, have developed a keen ability to sense danger to the whole nation and have developed a defense mechanism. In my family they used to say that the Serbs in Bosnia were much better than Serbs in Serbia [...] and remember, the defense mechanism was not created through a short period of time; it take decades, centuries [...] I am a biologist and I know: most capable of adapting and surviving are those species that live close to other species from whom they are endangered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1994 Plavšić stated that she and other Serbian nationalists were unable to negotiate with the “”Bosniaks”” due to genetics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shatzmiller |first=Maya |title=Islam and Bosnia: Conflict Resolution and Foreign Policy in Multi-Ethnic States |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7735-2413-2 |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was genetically deformed material that embraced Islam. And now, of course, with each successive generation it simply becomes concentrated. It gets worse and worse. it simply expresses itself and dictates their style of thinking, which is rooted in their genes. And through the centuries, the genes degraded further.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This statement by Plavšić, which equated a specific ethnic group with a disease or illness, has been compared to how the [[Nazi]]s identified the [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alvarez |first=Alex |title=Governments, Citizens, and Genocide: A Comparative and Interdisciplinary |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7735-2413-2 |page=126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s support for the "Vance Owen Plan" caused her to refuse to shake his hand, as she denounced him as a traitor to the Serbian nation. [[Vojislav Šešelj]] testified that "her positions were extreme, very extreme. She was popularly known as the Serbian Empress because of this extremism of hers."

The [[Dayton Agreement]], signed in 1995, banned the then [[Politics of Republika Srpska#List of Presidents of Republika Srpska .281992-Present.29|President of Republika Srpska]] [[Radovan Karadžić]] from office and Plavšić was chosen to run as the SDS candidate for President of the Republika Srpska for a two-year mandate.

Vojislav Šešelj, at the Milošević trial, described Karadžić's motives for nominating her.

&lt;blockquote&gt;She held very extremist positions during the war, insufferably extremist, even for me, and they bothered even me as a declared Serb nationalist. She brought [[Arkan]] and his [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] to Bijeljina, and she continued to visit him after their activities in [[Bijeljina]] and the surrounding area [...] Radovan Karadzic [...] believed her to be more extreme than himself in every way. He thought that the Western protagonists who tried eliminate him at any cost would have an even greater problem with her [...] Radovan Karadzic believed that she would continue to occupy her patriotic positions until the end. However, several months after she was elected, Biljana Plavsic changed her political orientation by 180 degrees under the influence of some Western protagonists and changed her policies completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vojislav Seselj Testimony|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/trans/en/050830IT.htm|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|date=30 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to a growing isolation of the Republika Srpska after the peace was signed, she severed her ties with the SDS and formed [[Serbian People's Alliance of the Republika Srpska|Srpski narodni savez]] (Serbian People's Alliance of the Republika Srpska), and nominated [[Milorad Dodik]], the then member of the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska]] whose [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats|SNSD]] party had only two MPs, for Prime Minister.

This marked the beginning of political reform in the Republika Srpska and the cooperation with the [[International Community]]. She lost the 1998 election to the joint candidate of the SDS and the [[Serbian Radical Party of the Republika Srpska]] [[Nikola Poplašen]]. She was a candidate of the reform "Sloga" coalition. Her political career was in decline until the release of the indictment by the [[ICTY]], after which it was completely terminated.
During her time in prison, she released a book called "Witnessings" (Svjedočenja), revealing many aspects of the political life of the war-time Republika Srpska and casting an especially dark shadow on the then President of the Republika Srpska Karadžić, another [[ICTY]] indictee.

In 1998, Plavšić rewarded [[Momčilo Đujić]], a [[Chetnik]] commander and collaborator, with an honorary award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosworth |first=R.J.B.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Fascism|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929131-1|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoare|first=Marko Attila|title=Bosnian Serbs and Anti-Bosnian Serbs |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=2803&amp;reportid=125|newspaper=Bosnian Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICTY indictment and sentence==
She was indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] together with [[Momčilo Krajišnik]] and [[Radovan Karadžić]] for the "creation of impossible conditions of life, [[persecution]] and [[fear|terror]] tactics in order to encourage non-Serbs to leave the area, [[deportation]] of those reluctant to leave, and the [[liquidation]] of others".

The Indictment charged Biljana Plavšić as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/plavsic/tjug/en/pla-tj030227e.pdf|title=Prosecutor v. Biljana Plavšić judgement|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two counts of genocide (Article 4 of the Statute of the Tribunal - genocide; and/or, complicity to commit genocide)
*Five counts of crimes against humanity (Article 5 thereof - extermination; murder; persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; deportation; alternatively, inhumane acts)
*One count of violations of the laws or customs of war (Article 3 thereof - murder)

She voluntarily surrendered to the ICTY on 10 January 2001, and was provisionally released on 6 September.

On 16 December 2002 she plea bargained with the ICTY to enter a guilty plea to one count of [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] for her part in directing the war and targeting civilians and expressed "full remorse" in exchange for prosecutors dropping seven other war crimes charges, including two counts of genocide. Plavšić's statement, read in her native [[Serbian language]], repeated her admission of guilt. It said she had refused to believe stories of atrocities against [[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats]] and accepted without question the claims that Serbs were fighting for survival.

However, in an [[interview]] she gave in March 2005 to the [[Banja Luka]] Alternativna Television, she admitted she had plead guilty because she couldn't prove her innocence, as she was unable to find witnesses who would testify on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zatvorski dani B.Plavšić|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2005&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=12&amp;nav_category=64&amp;nav_id=164146|newspaper=B92|date=12 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ne znam šta je s Mladićem, on ne bi nikada radio protiv Srba|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/03/13/srpski/P05031203.shtml|newspaper=Glas javnosti|date=13 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She repeated this in an interview for Swedish ''Vi'' magazine in January 2009.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Institute"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg|first=Daniel Uggelberg|title=Plavsic retracts war-crimes confession|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2544|newspaper=Bosnian Institute|date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed to have plead guilty in order to avoid the remaining charges against her, including genocide.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Institute"/&gt; Her pleading guilty led the Hague tribunal to lower her sentence and drop the remaining charges.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Institute"/&gt;  Plavšić would have likely have been sentenced to 20–25 years in prison if she had not plead guilty and all eight charges were taken into account.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Institute"/&gt;

She was sentenced to 11 years in prison. She served her sentence at the women's prison [[Hinseberg]] in [[Frövi]], [[Örebro County]], Sweden (since 26 June 2003).

In December 2008 the Swedish [[Ministry of Justice (Sweden)|Ministry of Justice]] rejected a request for pardon by Plavšić. She had cited "advancing age, failing health and poor prison conditions" as the reasons for her request.&lt;ref name="pardonplea"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sweden rejects Bosnian war crime pardon request |url=http://www.thelocal.se/16140/20081204/ |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205121753/http://www.thelocal.se/16140/20081204/| archivedate= 5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Željko Komšić]], a Croat member of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] had written a letter to the Swedish authorities in September 2008 urging them not to release Plavšić, stating that "any act of mercy would be big mistake and an insult to the victims and families of the victims".&lt;ref name="pardonplea"/&gt;

On 14 September 2009, [[Patrick Lipton Robinson|Patrick Robinson]], President of the [[United Nations]]' [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], said Plavšić "appears to have demonstrated substantial evidence of rehabilitation" and had accepted responsibility for her crimes. The Times continued that "Under Swedish law, she becomes eligible for release 27 October, after serving two-thirds of her term, though her release date has not been set."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Bosnian Leader May Be Freed Soon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/europe/16briefs-bosnia.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=16 September 2009 | first=Agence | last=France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released on 27 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 10 November 2009, Milorad Dodik revealed that he seriously considered giving Plavšić an office in the Senate.

'''Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd.''' was an American entertainment company founded by [[Jess McMahon]] and [[Toots Mondt]]. Operating as the '''Capitol Wrestling Corporation''' ('''CWC'''), the company was originally a [[professional wrestling]] and [[boxing]] promotion and later became the sanctioning body for the '''World Wide Wrestling Federation''' ('''WWWF''') and the '''World Wrestling Federation''' ('''WWF''').  The Capitol Wrestling Corporation is the precursor to today's [[WWE]], run by Jess' grandson, [[Vince McMahon]].

== History ==
===Early history (1952–1963)===
{{see also|History of WWE}}
[[Jess McMahon]] was a successful boxing promoter who began working with [[Tex Rickard]] in 1926. With the help of Rickard, he began promoting boxing 
at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|the third Madison Square Garden]]. A few years prior, professional wrestler [[Toots Mondt]] had created a new challenge of professional wrestling that he called “Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling”. He convinced wrestler [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]] and his manager [[Billy Sandow]] to implement this new solution and wrestlers to sign contracts with their [[Gold Dust Trio]]. After much success, a disagreement over power caused the trio to dissolve and, with it, their promotion. Mondt later formed partnerships with several other promoters, including [[Jack Curley]] in [[New York City]]. Mondt eventually took over the New York wrestling scene, due to the fact Curley was dying, with the aid of several bookers, one of whom was Jess McMahon.

Together, McMahon and Mondt created the Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd. (CWC) in 1952, which joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin|title=The WWE Championship: A Look Back at the Rich History of the WWE Championship|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QiGgs8szlwC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4|quote=McMahon ... went right to work creating his own wrestling company; and on January 7, 1953, he put on his first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation banner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1954, Jess McMahon died and Ray Fabiani, one of Mondt's associates, brought in [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent James McMahon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaelberer|first=Angie Peterson |title=Fabulous, Freaky, Unusual History of Pro Wrestling|year=2010|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=1-4296-4789-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon and Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated Northeast region.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963–1979)===
In early 1963, Capitol formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), the precursor to current-day [[WWE]], following a dispute with the NWA over [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] being booked to hold the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=won2011&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men left the company in protest following the incident and formed the WWWF in the process, awarding Rogers the new [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] in April of that year. He lost the championship to [[Bruno Sammartino]] a month later on May 17, 1963, after suffering a [[heart attack]] a week before the match.

The WWWF operated in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly, usually featuring a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] champion wrestling various [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] in programs that consisted of one to three matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|title=.|date=June 3, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining a television program deal and turning preliminary wrestler [[Lou Albano]] into a manager for Sammartino's heel opponents, the WWWF was doing sell out business by 1970.

Mondt left the company in the late 1960s and although the WWWF had withdrawn from the NWA, Vince McMahon, Sr. quietly rejoined in 1971. At the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and WWF employee [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] all withdrew from the organization.&lt;ref name=won2011/&gt;

=== Rebranding and sale to Titan Sports (1979–1982)===
By March 1979, for marketing purposes, the World Wide Wrestling Federation was renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).&lt;ref name="NWA193"&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|page=193|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Vincent J. McMahon's son, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]], founded Titan Sports, Inc., incorporated on February 21, 1980, originally in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19882005690FSupp1315_11786.xml/TITAN%20SPORTS,%20INC.%20v.%20COMICS%20WORLD%20CORP |title=Titan Sports, Inc.

In 1982, Titan Sports Inc. acquired Capitol's operations, effectively relocating its headquarters to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. In an attempt to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the world, McMahon began an expansion that fundamentally changed the industry.&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Johnson|title=Wrestling With Success|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=25 March 1991|accessdate=20 April 2014|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the elder McMahon would never live to see his company grow from a territorial promotion to what is now a worldwide organization. He died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at 69 years old on May 24, 1984.&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/vincemcmahon/|title=Vince McMahon Sr.|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, Titan moved to [[Stamford, Connecticut]] then establishing a new entity in 1987 in [[Delaware]] which later merged with the old company in 1988. Titan later changed its name to World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. before finally becoming World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. in 2002.&lt;ref name="2011name"&gt;{{cite web|title=The New WWE|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2011/2011_04_07.html|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|accessdate=2011-04-08|date=2011-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410204745/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2011/2011_04_07.html#|archive-date=2011-04-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caprivi conflict''' was an armed conflict between the [[Namibia]]n government and the [[Caprivi Liberation Army]], a [[Rebellion|rebel]] group that fought for the secession of the [[Caprivi Strip]].&lt;ref name=CLM/&gt;

==Background==
The [[Caprivi Strip]] in the north east of Namibia is mainly inhabited by the [[Lozi people]]. They share a common language and history, and often feel more connected with Lozi people in neighbouring countries [[Zambia]], [[Angola]], [[Botswana]] and South Africa.

The Namibian government has accused the CLA of being allied with the Angolan rebel movement [[UNITA]]. UNITA is very unpopular in Namibia since it helped [[South Africa]] fighting [[SWAPO]] during the liberation struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=[[Colin Leys]] |author2=[[John S. Saul]] |year=1994 |journal=[[Journal of Southern African Studies]] |jstor=2637123 |title=Liberation without Democracy? The Swapo Crisis of 1976 |volume=23 |issue=1 |publication-date=March 1994 |pages=123–147 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One cause of the conflict can be seen in a previous power struggle between [[Mishake Muyongo]] and the SWAPO leadership during exile in Angola. In July 1980 Muyongo was ousted from being SWAPO Vice-President under the accusation of being involved in subversive activities and pursuing secessionist ambitions. He was subsequently detained in Zambia and Tanzania, followed by an alleged purge against Caprivians in SWAPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqQPLQAACAAJ |author=Gustine Hunter |year=2008 |title=Die Politik der Erinnerung und des Vergessens in Namibia |location=Frankfurt |publisher=Peter Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Namibia in 1985 Muyongo formed the [[United Democratic Party (Namibia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) which joined the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA). He was President of DTA from 1991 until 1998 when he was expelled as a result of his support for the [[secession]] of his home region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1cOAQAAMAAJ |author=Graham Hopwood |year=2007 |title=Guide to Namibian Politics |location=Windhoek |publisher=Namibian Institute for Democracy |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the conflict==
[[File:Caprivistrip.png|thumb|230px|Map of the Caprivi]]
The [[Caprivi Liberation Army]] was formed in 1994. The [[Rebellion|rebel]] movement's goal is Caprivi self-rule.

In October 1998 the Namibian Defence Force with the support of the [[Special Field Force]] discovered and raided a CLA training camp. That resulted in more than 100 armed CLA men and about 2,500 civilians fleeing into Botswana. Amongst the refugees were leaders of the CLA, namely [[Mishake Muyongo]] and [[Mafwe]] Chief Boniface Mamili. Both were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in [[Denmark]]. Namibia unsuccessfully demanded Botswana and Denmark to hand over the rebels, and President [[Nujoma]] called the rebels "traitors and murderers" and stated that they would be punished for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/210444.stm |title=Namibia calls on Botswana to hand over rebels |work=BBC |date=8 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 1999 CLA launched unanticipated attacks on army base, border post, and the police station of [[Katima Mulilo]], the provincial capital of the Zambezi Region (Caprivi Region). They also occupied the state-run radio station. In the fighting that followed between rebel and government forces 14 people were killed. A [[state of emergency]] was declared in the province, and the government arrested alleged CLA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://namibweb.com/article2.htm |title=Civil supremacy of the military in Namibia: A retrospective case study |last=Lamb |first=Guy |publisher=Centre for Conflict Resolution via NamibWeb |date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishake Muyongo said that the rebellion was "just the beginning", but the government's crackdown forced it to come to an abrupt stop.

Both Angolan and Namibian forces, and UNITA, were accused of committing human rights violations against the population in the Caprivi Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr03/002/2000/en/ |title=Civilians suffer as Angolan conflict fuels insecurity on the Namibian border |publisher=Amnesty International |date=22 March 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Shortly after the unsuccessful secession attempt about 3,000 people sought refuge in neighbouring [[Botswana]] for fear of reprisals from the Namibian government. They were granted [[refugee status]] and accommodated at the [[Dukwe]] camp. {{As of|December 2015}} there are still several hundred Namibians living in the camp, although about 2,100 have returned to Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Namibian refugee status revocation postponed |author=[[NAMPA]] |newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=4 March 2016 |page=5 |url=https://www.namibian.com.na/148116/archive-read/Namibian-refugee-status-revocation-postponed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Caprivi treason trial}}
In 1999, 132 alleged participants were arrested and charged with high treason, murder and a host of other offences. Judgement in the resulting trial, known as the ''Caprivi treason trial'' was heavily delayed, and prisoners were only acquitted in 2012, a situation that [[Amnesty International]] repeatedly complained about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr42/001/2003/en/ |title=Namibia – Justice delayed is justice denied: The Caprivi treason trial |publisher=Amnesty International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2002, the Itengese nation severed all ties with Namibia and declared the independent, sovereign Free State of Caprivi Strip/Itenge their national homeland.&lt;ref name=CLM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/caprivi.htm |title=Caprivi Liberation Front / Caprivi Liberation Movement (CLM) |website=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nation is not recognised by any other government, though, least of all Namibia.

'''Danbury''' is a village in the [[City of Chelmsford]], in the county of [[Essex, England|Essex]], [[England]]. It is located {{convert|33.5|miles|km}} northeast of [[Charing Cross]], [[London]] and has a population of 6,500.{{when|date=February 2011}} It is situated on a hill {{convert|367|ft|m}} above sea level.

The City of [[Danbury, Connecticut]] in the United States is named after the village.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Danbury, Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The village was built on the site of a [[Neolithic]] or early [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] noted for its oval shape, sometimes confused with the [[Megalithic]] enclosure at [[Danebury]] in Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/8059/danbury.html/ |title=Modern Antiquarian Website|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official parish publication, ''Danbury Parish Plan 2003'', first [[Iron Age]] settlers, then the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and finally the Dæningas tribe of [[Saxon]]s occupied the Danbury area.

The place-name 'Danbury' is first attested as ''Danengeberia'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086. The name means 'the burgh or fort of Dene's people'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English a Place-names'', p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; The same name is the origin of [[Dengie]] in Essex.

After the Norman Conquest, King [[William I of England|William]] took the lands and settlement and granted it to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who was made [[Earl of Essex]].

==Medieval to Georgian period==
[[File:'The Griffin' inn, at the heart of Danbury village - geograph.org.uk - 732673.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Griffin Inn where Walter Scott stayed in 1808]]

In medieval times Danbury developed from two manors, St Cleres/Herons and Runsell.  Traces of both still exist. There was also a small part of a third, now extinct, manor of Gibcracks. The church of St John the Baptist is the oldest building in the village, dating from the 13th century, and is grade I listed.&lt;ref name = EH&gt;{{NHLE| num = 1122201|desc=  CHURCH OF ST JOHN THE BAPTIST |accessdate = 21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a local folk tale that the church's spire was damaged by the Devil in the guise of a monk in the year 1402. According to the legend, the Devil passed between the legs of a parishioner as he departed, and the man later died of a wasting disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ash |first=Russell |date=1973 |title=Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain |publisher=Reader's Digest Association Limited |page=234 |isbn=9780340165973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village has a long connection with the [[Sinclair (surname)|Sinclair]] family, known locally as St Clere. There are three wooden [[effigy|effigies]] in the church which date back to the thirteenth and fourteenth century &lt;ref name = EH/&gt; One has been identified as being that of William St Clere. In 1968 it was taken to be exhibited at the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

In 1779 the tomb of a knight was disturbed, and the body therein was discovered to be perfectly preserved in what was described as "pickle", but this was contested by [[Joseph Strutt (MP)|Joseph Strutt]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]]. Strutt also attempted to write a romance with a book called ''Queenhoo Hall''. In 1808, [[Walter Scott]] was asked to complete the book by his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]. Scott visited the village and stayed at the Griffin Inn in order to attempt his first venture into [[romantic fiction]].

The church also contains some memorial slabs to the Mildmays. Sir [[Walter Mildmay]] was the founder of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and built [[Danbury Place]] in 1589. The original building has disappeared but another was built in 1832 in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style, with red brick. It was acquired by the [[Church of England]] in 1845 and became a residence of the [[Bishop of Rochester]]. From then on it became known as [[Danbury Palace]]. The mansion sits within the historic landscape of Danbury Country Park, a former [[medieval deer park]], with later additions dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The history of the park and garden was researched by [[Kate Felus]] in 2007.

==Modern day==
The village is at the centre of extensive areas of woodland and heath owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and other conservation organisations.  '''Danbury Common''', a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] lies due south of the village centre. The woodlands extend into the parish of Little Baddow.  However the quietude of the surrounding countryside contrasts with the [[A414 road]], a major trunk route running through the village centre linking it with [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] to the east and [[Chelmsford]] to the west. Several bus services running from Chelmsford link Danbury with Maldon, [[Great Baddow]], [[Little Baddow]], [[South Woodham Ferrers]], [[Sandon, Essex|Sandon]] and other villages around Maldon.

Danbury has its own community magazine called The Danbury Journal. It covers local issues, events and is a way for local businesses to advertise the services they provide. Printed and published by maypole press in South Woodham Ferrers, it is delivered to every house in Danbury, Bicknacre and Little Baddow.

==Geodesy==
Danbury Church Spire was the origin (meridian) for the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Originally it also was the origin for Essex, but that county was recalculated on the meridian of St. Paul's, London, in about 1919, due to the fact that Greater London started to spill out well into Essex.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charlesclosesociety.org/files/153Meridians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are several primary schools in Danbury but no secondary schools. The primary schools are: Danbury Park Community Primary School, St. John's Church of England Primary School, Heathcote Preparatory School and Elm Green Preparatory School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danbury-essex.gov.uk/local-info/schools&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Cassel''' (7 March 1818 – 22 January 1893) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]] and [[Jewish theologian]].

==Life==

Cassel was born in [[Głogów|Gross-Glogau]], a city in [[Province of Silesia|Prussian Silesia]] with a large Jewish community. He graduated from its [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]]. His brother was [[Paulus Stephanus Cassel|Selig Cassel]].

Cassel's name is intimately connected with the founders of [[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Jewish science]] in [[Germany]]—[[Leopold Zunz|Zunz]], [[Abraham Geiger|Geiger]], [[Steinschneider]], [[Zecharias Frankel|Frankel]], and others. In appreciating his great scholarship in [[Jewish literature]] it must not be forgotten that he was born in a city in which Jewish learning had been maintained at a very high standard, and which has given to the world many noted scholars: [[Salomon Munk]], [[Joseph Zedner]], [[Michael Sachs]], [[Heymann Arnheim]], and others.

Cassel became a student at the [[Berlin University]], where he attended the lectures of the orientalist [[Julius Heinrich Petermann]], the philosopher [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]], the philologist [[Philipp August Boeckh]], and others. He, besides, maintained very friendly relations with [[Moritz Steinschneider]], [[Heimann Jolowicz]], [[Leser Landshuth]], and [[Paul de Lagarde]]. During the whole time of his university studies he supported himself by giving lessons; and having thus experienced all the bitterness of poverty, he became later one of the founders of the ''Hülfs-Verein für Jüdische Studierende'', a society for assisting poor Jewish students in [[Berlin]], which is still in existence.

Cassel began his career as an author with his doctor's thesis on "Die Psalmenüberschriften" (published in the "Literaturblatt des Orients," [[Leipzig]], 1840). He received his [[rabbi]]nical diploma in 1843 from [[Jacob Joseph Oettinger]] and [[Zecharias Frankel]], but never accepted, a rabbinical position, although he possessed a decided talent for the [[pulpit]], as may be seen from his "''Sabbath-Stunden zur Belehrung und Erbauung''" (Berlin, 1868), a collection of 52 homilies on the [[Pentateuch]], originally delivered as [[Sabbath]] lectures in a school for boys. In 1846 Cassel became principal of an educational institute called the "''Dina-Nauen-Stift''," in which position he remained until 1879. He was, besides, in 1850 and 1851 teacher of religion in Berlin at the Congregational School for Jewish Girls, and from 1852 to 1867 at the Jewish school for boys. From 1862 to 1873 he was also a teacher at the Jewish Normal School. In 1872, when the ''[[Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums]]'' ("''[[Hochschule]]''") was established in Berlin, Cassel was elected one of the docents. He died in Berlin.

==Works==

Cassel wrote a great number of valuable books, besides many essays for the Jewish magazines. Some of his works were written mainly for educational purposes; e.g., the above-mentioned "Sabbath-Stunden" and the following:
* "Leitfaden für den Unterricht in der Jüdischen Gesch. und Litteratur," Berlin, 1868 (translated into various languages);
* "Gesch. der Jüdischen Litteratur," 2 vols., Berlin, 1872–73, dealing only with Biblical literature;
* "Hebräisch-Deutsches Wörterbuch," etc., Berlin, 1871, last ed., 1891;
* "Lehrbuch der Jüdischen Gesch. und Litteratur," Leipzig, 1879; 2d ed., Berlin, 1896.

In addition to these he edited, or contributed introductions and notes to, several scientific works of great value, of which the following may be mentioned:
* "Cat. Hebräischer Schriften," Latin part by himself, and Hebrew by Rebenstein (Bernstein), Berlin, 1845;
* [[David Conforte]]'s "Ḳore ha-Dorot," a biographical and bibliographical lexicon of Jewish scholars with introduction and notes, Berlin, 1846;
* "Zikron Yehudah," responsa of [[Judah ben Asher]], published by Rosenberg, with introduction and notes by Cassel, Berlin, 1846;
* "Teshubot Geonim Ḳadmonim," responsa of the earlier Geonim, edited from a Berlin manuscript, with an introduction by [[J. L. Rapoport]], in "He-Ḥaluẓ," Berlin, 1848, viii.138;
* the "Yesod 'Olam" of [[Isaac Israeli ben Joseph|Isaac Israeli]], an astronomical work edited by [[B. Goldberg]] and [[L. Rosenkranz]], with an introduction and a German translation by Cassel, Berlin, 1848; published by Rosenberg with notes and references by Cassel, Berlin, 1856;
* Index to [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi|De Rossi]]'s "Dizionario Storico," Leipzig, 1846;
* the "[[Cuzari]]" of [[Judah ha-Levi]], with a German introduction and translation and very numerous explanatory and critical notes, which fully testify to Cassel's erudition in Jewish-Arabic philosophy, Leipzig, 1840–53, Berlin, 1869 (in this work Cassel was assisted to some extent by H. Jolowicz);
* "''[[Meor 'Enayim]]''" of [[Azariah dei Rossi]]—a classical edition, Vilna, 1866;
* the [[Apocrypha]], translated into German from the Greek, Berlin, 1864–71;
* "''Die [[Pesach]]-[[Haggadah]]''", with German introduction, translation, and critical notes (latest edition, Berlin, 1895);
* "''Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache''" of [[H. Arnheim]] (died 1870), with introduction, notes, and additions by Cassel, Berlin, 1872.

Cassel further wrote pamphlets on questions of the day, such as:
"''Woher und Wohin? Zur Verständigung über Jüdische Reformbestrebungen''," Berlin, 1845;
* "Die Cultusfrage in der Jüdischen Gemeinde von Berlin," Berlin, 1856, a defense of his friend Michael Sachs against the attacks by the Orthodox;
* "Offener Brief eines Juden an [[Rudolf Virchow|Prof. Dr. Virchow]]," Berlin, 1869;
* "[[Joseph Caro]] und das Buch [[Maggid Mesharim]]," published in the "Jahresbericht" of the [[Berlin Hochschule]], Berlin, 1888, in which he proves, against [[Heinrich Graetz|Grätz]], that this book was not written by Caro.

Cassel is also the author of all the articles dealing with [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish literature]] in [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]]' "''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon|Konversations-Lexikon]]''". He also wrote articles for the publications of the [[Society of Hebrew Literature of London]].

Finally, it must be mentioned that Cassel, while still a young man, conceived the plan of publishing a Jewish [[encyclopedia]] containing everything of interest to Judaism. With the assistance of [[M. Steinschneider]] he composed the "''Plan der Real-Encyclopädie des Judenthums''," [[Krotoschin]], 1844; but, inasmuch as [[Jewish studies]] were still in their infancy, the plan, though pursued for some time, could not be carried out.

'''Devaneya Pavanar''' (Tamil: {{lang|ta|ஞா. தேவநேயப் பாவாணர்}}; ''{{transl|ta|ISO|Ñānamuttaṉ Tēvanēya Pāvāṇar}}''; also known as '''G. Devaneyan''', '''Ñanamuttan Tevaneyan'''; 7 February 1902 – 15 January 1981) was a prominent Indian [[Tamil literature|Tamil author]] who wrote over 35 books. Additionally, he was a staunch proponent of the "[[Pure Tamil movement]]" and initiated the Etymological Dictionary Project primarily to bring out the roots of Tamil words and their connections and ramifications.

In his 1966 ''Primary Classical language of the World'', he argues that the [[Tamil language]] is the "most natural" (''{{transl|ta|ISO|iyal-moḻi}}'') and also a [[proto-world language]], being the oldest (''{{transl|ta|ISO|tol-moḻi}}'') language of the world, from which all other major languages of the world are derived. He believed that its literature, later called [[Sangam literature]] and usually considered to have been written from 200 BCE and 300 CE, spanned a huge period from [[Stone Age India|10,000 to 5,500 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Heritage of the Tamils |author=Ca. Vē Cuppiramaṇiyan̲ and Ka. Ta Tirunāvukkaracu |publisher=International Institute of Tamil Studies |year=1983|page= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are fringe ones and mainstream linguists, geologists and historians do not acknowledge them to be true.

Devaneya Pavanar composed many musical pieces (''Isaik kalambakam'') and many noteworthy poems, including the collection of ''Venpa.'' The title ''{{transl|ta|ISO|Senthamiḻ Selvar}}'' was conferred on him by the [[Tamil Nadu]] State Government in 1979, and he was also addressed as Dravida Mozhi nool Nayiru''{{transl|ta|ISO|Moḻi Ñayiru}}'' ({{lang|ta|திராவிட மொழி நூல் ஞாயிறு}}) "Sun of language".&lt;ref name=pressrelease&gt;[http://www.tn.gov.in/tamilarasu/dec2007/page24-31.pdf Tamil Nadu Government press release]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gnanamuthu Devaneyan Pavanar was born on 7 February 1902 in Gomathimuthupuram, Sankarankovil Taluk, Tamil Nadu, to his parents Thiru Gnanamuthu Devendrar and Paripuranam Ammaiyar. He attended and graduated from C.M.J. High School, [[Palayamkottai]], S.S.L.C. and trained as a teacher in [[Madras University]]. He married in 1930 and had four sons and one daughter, the daughter being the fourth child.

He worked as a Tamil teacher in several high schools from 1922 to 1944. During this time, he pursued [[autodidactic]] studies of Dravidian philology and comparative linguistics.

He was a Tamil professor at Municipal College, [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], from 1944 to 1956. From 1956 to 1961, he was the head of Dravidian department at [[Annamalai University]].&lt;ref&gt;PRudrayya Chandrayya Hiremath, Jayavant S. Kulli, "Proceedings of the Third All India Conference of Dravidian Linguists", 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Tamil Development and Research Council, set up by the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government in 1959, entrusted with producing Tamil school and college textbooks. From 1974, he was director of the Tamil Etymological Project, and he acted as president of the International Tamil League, Tamil Nadu. (U. Tha. Ka.)

Devaneya Pavanar studied his elementary education in Murumbu and worked as a First Teacher also in Murumbu under the control of Young Durai.  Devaneya Pavanar's life size statue, research library, centunary arch, reading room is located in Murumbu, near [[Sankarankovil]], Tamil Nadu.

The Chennai District Central Library is named after Devanaya Pavanar and is located at Anna Salai, Chennai.

==Views on Tamil versus Sanskrit==
[[File:Kumari Kandam map.png|thumb|280px|"Lemuria" according to Pavanar, connecting [[Madagascar]], [[South India]] and Australia (covering most of the Indian Ocean). [[Mount Meru]] stretches southwards from [[Sri Lanka]].]]
Pavanar's ''Vadamoli Varalaru'' argues that hundreds of Sanskrit words can be traced to a Tamil origin, and at the same time he insisted that pure Tamil equivalents existed for Sanskrit loan words. He claimed that Tamil is a "superior and more [[divine language|divine]]" language than [[Sanskrit]]. In his view the Tamil language originated in "[[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]" ({{lang|ta|இலெமூரியா}} ''{{transl|ta|ISO|Ilemūriyā}}''), the [[cradle of civilisation]] and place of [[origin of language]]. He believed that evidence of Tamil's antiquity was being suppressed by Sanskritists.

Pavanar's timeline for the evolution of mankind and Tamil is as follows:
* ca. [[Lower Paleolithic|500,000 BC]]: origin of the human race,
* ca. [[Middle Paleolithic|200,000 to 50,000 BC]]: evolution of "the Tamilian or ''Homo Dravida''&lt;ref&gt;a term of [[Edgar Thurston]]'s: see Ajay Skaria, ''Shades of Wildness Tribe, Caste, and Gender in Western India'', The Journal of Asian Studies (1997), p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt; ",
* c. 200,000 to 100,000 BC, beginnings of Tamil
* c. 100,000 to 50,000 BC, growth and development of Tamil,
* 50,000 BC: [[Kumari Kandam]] civilisation
* [[Upper Paleolithic|20,000 BC]]: A lost Tamil culture on [[Easter Island]] which had an advanced civilisation
* 16,000 BC: Lemuria submerged
* [[7th millennium BC|6087 BC]]: Second Tamil Sangam established by a [[Pandya]] king
* 3031 BC: A Chera prince wandering in the Solomon Islands saw wild sugarcane and started cultivation in Tamil Nadu.
* 1780 BC: The Third Tamil Sangam established by a Pandya king
* 7th century BC: [[Tolkappiyam]], the earliest extant Tamil grammar

In the preface to his 1966 book ''[[The Primary Classical Language of the World]]'' he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no other language in the whole world as Tamil, that has suffered so much damage by natural and human agencies, and has been done so much injustice by malignant foreigners and native dupes.

The general belief that all arts and sciences are progressively advancing with the passage of time, is falsified in the case of philology, owing to the fundamental blunder of locating the original home of the Tamilians in the Mediterranean region, and taking Sanskrit, a post-Vedic semi-artificial composite literary dialect, the Indian Esperanto, so to speak, for the prototype of the Indo-European Form of Speech.

Westerners do not know as yet, that Tamil is a highly developed classical language of [[Kumari Kandam|Lemurian]] origin, and has been, and is being still, suppressed by a systematic and co-ordinated effort by the Sanskritists both in the public and private sectors, ever since the Vedic mendicants migrated to the South, and taking utmost advantage of their superior complexion and the primitive credulity of the ancient Tamil kings, posed themselves as earthly gods ([[Bhusura|Bhu-suras]]) and deluded the Tamilians into the belief, that their ancestral language or literary dialect was divine or celestial in origin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a chapter entitled ''Tamil more divine than Sanskrit'', Pavanar gives the reasons why he judges Tamil to be "more [[divine language|divine]]" than Sanskrit, arguing for "Primary Classicality of Tamil", he enumerates:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Tamil language|Tamil]] Language

==Reception==
Although his theories hold no currency in the international [[linguistics]] community, Pavanar was considered by his followers to be a groundbreaking scholar in Dravidology with political leanings towards Dravidian nationalism. He does figure in works on [[linguistic purism|language activism]] and [[national mysticism]] (Ramaswamy 1997, 2004) and of [[Indian nationalism]] (Kaiwar et al. 2003).

''The Cultural Heritage of India; vol. V: Languages and literature'', p.&amp;nbsp;641 (ed. Chatterji, The Ramakrishna Mission, Institute of Culture, 1978) states that "but for his (Pavanar's) efforts the purity and antiquity of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] might have been a myth."

==Publishing history==
The ''Central Plan Scheme for Classical Tamil'' of the Centre of Excellence for Classical Tamil&lt;ref&gt;a body of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Department of Higher Education, Language Bureau, Ministry of Human Resource Development (under [[Arjun Singh]], [[Government of India]]; [http://www.ciil-classicaltamil.org/pdfs/nc-1stmeet.pdf First National Consultative Meeting (November 18 &amp; 19, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; recommends
:"To publish the translated but not yet published Sattambi Swamigal's ''Adhibhasa'' which seeks to establish that Tamil is the most ancient language. When published, it will provide an impetus to Pavanar's findings"

The literary works and books of Pavanar have been "nationalised" by the Government of Tamil Nadu in the course of the "Golden Jubilee year of National Independence" (2006). This means that the copyright for Pavanar's work is now owned by the state of Tamil Nadu, his legal heirs having been compensated financially.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080413140316/http://www.tn.gov.in/pressrelease/archives/pr2006/pr080706/pr080706fg.htm CM presented consideration amounts for the Nationalised books at Secretariat, Tamil Nadu, India].

{{Property law}}
In English [[common law]], '''fee tail''' or '''entail''' is a form of [[Trust law|trust]] established by deed or settlement which restricts the sale or [[inheritance]] of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] and prevents the property from being sold, devised by [[Will (law)|will]], or otherwise [[Alienation (property law)|alienated]] by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically by [[operation of law]] to an heir pre-determined by the settlement deed. The term ''fee tail'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''feodum talliatum'', which means "cut(-short) [[fiefdom|fee]]", and is in contrast to "[[fee simple]]" where no such restriction exists and where the possessor has an absolute title (although subject to the [[allodial title]] of the monarch) in the property which he can bequeath or otherwise dispose of as he wishes. Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere.

==Purpose==
The fee tail allowed a patriarch to perpetuate his blood-line, family-name, honour and armorials&lt;ref&gt;Frequently in default of a son and heir to the tenant-in-possession, the entail required the next male heir, if via a female line, to adopt the surname and arms of the patriarch, see for example [[Mark Rolle]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the persons of a series of powerful and wealthy male descendants. By keeping his estate intact in the hands of one heir alone, in an ideally indefinite and pre-ordained chain of succession, his own wealth, power and family honour would not be dissipated amongst several male lines, as became the case for example in Napoleonic France by operation of the [[Napoleonic Code]] which gave each child the legal right to inherit an equal share of the patrimony, where a formerly great landowning family could be reduced in a few generations to a series of small-holders or peasant farmers. It therefore approaches the true [[corporation]] which is a legal body or person which does not die and continues in existence and can hold wealth indefinitely. Indeed, as a form of trust, whilst the individual trustees may die, replacements are appointed and the trust itself continues, ideally indefinitely. In England almost seamless successions were made from patriarch to patriarch, the smoothness of which were often enhanced by baptising the eldest son and heir with his father's Christian name for several generations, for example the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all named Fulk. Such indefinite inalienable land-holdings were soon seen as restrictive on the optimum productive ability of land, which was often converted to deer-parks or pleasure grounds by the wealthy tenant-in-possession, which was damaging to the nation as a whole, and thus laws against perpetuities were enacted, which restricted entails to a maximum number of lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An entail also had the effect of disabling [[illegitimate child]]ren from inheriting. It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in [[debt]], often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch's widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute. Frequently in such cases the generosity of the settlor left the entailed estate as an uneconomical enterprise, especially during times when the estate's fluctuating agricultural income had to provide for fixed sum annuities. Such impoverished tenants-in-possession were unable to realise in cash any part of their land or even to offer the property as security for a loan, to pay such annuities, unless sanctioned by private Act of Parliament  allowing such sale, which expensive and time-consuming mechanism was frequently resorted to. The ''beneficial owner'' (or tenant-in-possession) of the property in fact had only a [[life interest]] in it, albeit an absolute right to the income it generated, the ''legal owners'' being the trustees of the settlement, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] passing intact to the next [[Inheritance|successor]] or [[heir]] in law; any purported bequest of the land by the tenant-in-possession was ineffective.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
Fee tail was established during [[feudal]] times by [[landed gentry]] to attempt to ensure that the high social standing of the family, as represented by a single patriarch, continued indefinitely. The concentration of the family's wealth into the hands of a single representative was essential to support this  process. Unless the heir had himself inherited the personal and intellectual strengths of the original great patriarch, often a great warrior, which alone had brought him from obscurity to greatness, he would soon sink again into obscurity, and required wealth to maintain his social standing. This feature of English gentry and aristocracy differs from the true aristocracy which existed in pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] France, where all sons of a nobleman inherited his title and were thus inescapably members of a separate noble caste in society. In England all younger sons of a nobleman were born as mere gentlemen and [[commoner]]s, and without the support of wealth  could quickly descend into obscurity, the eldest son alone being a nobleman. On this eldest son was concentrated the honour of the family, and to him alone was granted all its wealth to support his role in that regard, by the process of the fee tail.

===Statute of Westminster 1285===
The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster II]], passed in 1285, created and fixed the form of this estate. The new law was also formally called the statute ''[[De Donis Conditionalibus]]'' (Concerning Conditional Gifts).

===Opponents===
Fee tail was  never popular with the monarchy, the merchant class and many holders of entailed estates themselves who wished to sell their land.

===Abolition===
Fee tail as a legal [[estate (law)|estate]] in England was abolished by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=Jonathan|title=A Dictionary of Law|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199664927|page=258|edition=Eighth|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nTrvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing use===
A fee tail can still exist in England and Wales as an equitable interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested in the current 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but on the basis that any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e. a [[future interest]] where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a [[reversion (law)|reversionary]] fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a [[base fee]]; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.   No new "fees tail" can now be created following the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/schedule/1/paragraph/5 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 Schedule 1 Para 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[conservation easement]]s are a form of entail still in use.

==Creation==
Traditionally, a fee tail was created by a trust established in a [[deed]], often a [[marriage settlement]], or in a will "to A and the heirs of his body". The crucial difference between the words of conveyance and the words that created a [[fee simple]] ("to A and his heirs") is that the heirs "in tail" must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have "fee tail male", which only sons could inherit, and "fee tail female", which only daughters could inherit; and "fee tail special", which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain "heirs of the body" and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions was said to be "entailed" or "held in-tail", with the restrictions themselves known as ''entailments''.

==Breaking of fee tail==
The breaking of a fee tail was simplified by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1833/cukpga_18330074_en_1#l1g3 Fines and Recoveries Act 1833 s.15]&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the conveyance for making a tenant to the [[praecipe]] for suffering a common recovery. This was the usual preliminary to a recovery with a disentailing assurance, which had to be enrolled. The need for this to be followed by the [[Legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]] of a common recovery was abolished.

The requirement that a disentailing assurance should be enrolled was abolished in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property Act 1925, s. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortgage of entailed lands==
Lending upon security of a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] on land in fee tail was risky, since at the death of the tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor in fee tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore  impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Failure of issue==
{{main article|Failure of issue}}
Things did not always go as planned, however. Tenants-in-possession of entailed estates occasionally suffered "failure of issue" – that is, they had no legitimate children surviving them at the time of their deaths. In this situation the entailed land devolved to male cousins, i.e. back up and through the family tree to legitimate male descendants of former tenants-in-possession, or reverted to the last owner in fee simple, if still living. This situation produced complicated [[litigation]] and was an incentive for the production and maintenance of detailed and authoritative family pedigrees and supporting records of marriage, births, baptisms etc.

Depending on how the original deed or grant was worded, in the event of there being daughters but no sons, all the sisters might inherit jointly, it might pass to the eldest sister, it might be held in trust until one of them should produce a (legitimate) son, or it might pass to the next male-line relative (an uncle, say, or even a cousin, sometimes very distant).

==Common recovery==
In the 15th century, lawyers devised  "[[common recovery]]", an elaborate legal procedure which used collaborative lawsuits and [[legal fiction]]s to "bar" a fee tail, that is to say to remove the restrictions of fee tail from land and to enable its conveyance in fee simple.  Biancalana's book ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176–1502'' (2001) discusses the procedure and its history at length.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Biancalana, ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176-1502'', Cambridge Studies in English Legal History, 2001.  520 pages. {{ISBN|0521032946}} (2007 reprint).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement==
In the 17th and 18th centuries the practice arose whereby when the son came of age (at 21), he and his father acting together could bar the existing fee tail, and could then re-settle the land in fee tail, again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, but at the same time making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father's widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father's lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.

==Formedon==
Formedon (or ''form down'' etc.) was a right of writ exercisable by a holder in fee for claiming property entailed by a lessee beyond the terms of his feoffment.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} A letter dated 1539 from the [[Lisle Letters]] describes the circumstances of its use:&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981, vol.5, letter 1359, p.408, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I received your ladyship's letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one estate in tail to him and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir [[William Coffin (courtier)|William Coffyn]] in his life. Howbeit Mr Richard Coffyn, next heir to Sir William Coffyn, claimeth the same by his uncle's feoffment to him and to his heirs so that the law will put Mr John Basset from his entry and to compel him to take his action of ''form down'' which is much dilatory as Mr Basset knoweth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Marquess of Hertford===
An English example of a fee tail may be the main estates of the wealthy art collector [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]] (d. 1870). His only child was his illegitimate son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet]], to whom he left as much of his property as he could. The main land holdings and [[Ragley Hall]] were inherited by his distant cousin, [[Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford]], descended from a younger son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|1st Marquess]] who had died in 1794. Most of the 4th Marquess's art collection had been acquired by himself or his father, went to Wallace, and is now the [[Wallace Collection]]. Other works were covered by the fee tail, however, and passed to the 5th Marquess.

===Earl of Pembroke===
Another example was [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]], who died in 1827. He had quarreled with his eldest son, later the [[Robert Herbert, 12th Earl of Pembroke|12th Earl]], and left his unentailed estate to [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea]], his son by a second marriage.

==Fees tail in fiction==
Fees tail figure in the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of several well known [[novel]]s and stories, particularly in the 19th century, including:

* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]]
* ''[[Middlemarch]]'' by [[George Eliot]]
* ''[[The Belton Estate]]'' (1866) and ''[[Ralph the Heir]]'' (1871) by [[Anthony Trollope]]
* ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]
* ''[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]
* ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]]
* ''[[Wideacre]]'' by [[Philippa Gregory]]
* ''[[The Quincunx]]'' by [[Charles Palliser]] (written in 1989, but it takes the form of a Dickensian mystery set in early-19th-century England)
* ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' by [[Julian Fellowes]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2015/04/The-Tale-of-the-Fee-Tail-in-Downton-Abbey.pdf The Tale of the Fee Tail in ''Downton Abbey'']", J. B. Ruhl, Vanderbilt Law Review, April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (written in 2009–2015, but set in England in the period 1912–1927)
* ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by Harper Lee (referred to as an "entailment")

===''Pride and Prejudice''===
''Pride and Prejudice'' contains a particularly thorny example of the kind of problems which could arise through the entailing of property. Mr. Bennet, the father of protagonist [[Elizabeth Bennet]], had only a life interest in the Longbourn estate, the family's home and principal source of income. He had no authority to dictate to whom it should pass upon his death, as it was strictly arranged to be inherited by the next male heir. Had Mr. Bennet fathered a son it would have passed to him, but since he did not it could not pass to any of his five daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Martin|title=Modern Land Law|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317821459|edition=Ninth|page=8 (footnote)|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ro78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the next nearest male heir would inherit the property—Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a boorish minister in his mid-twenties. The inheritance of the Longbourn property completely excluded the five Bennet daughters, who were thus to lose their home and income upon their father's death. The need for the daughters to make a good marriage to ensure their future security is a key motivation for many episodes in the novel. Many fees tail arose from wills, rather than from marriage settlements which usually made some provision for daughters. Austen was very familiar with the law of entail; her brother, Edward, had inherited similarly entailed estates at [[Chawton]], [[Godmersham]] and [[Winchester]] from distant cousins under the will of Elizabeth Knight, who died in 1737.&lt;ref name=grover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=Christine|title=Edward Knight’s Inheritance: The Chawton, Godmersham, and Winchester Estates|journal=Persuasions|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no1/grover.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Scotland===
{{main article|Tailzie}}
In [[Scotland]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] (section 50) abolished all feudal tenures including the entail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/50 ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act'' 2000, section 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the doctrines of ''[[legitime|legitim]]'' and ''[[jus relictae]]'' restrict owners from willing property out of their family when they die with children or have a surviving partner.

A Scottish example of fee tail is the case of [[Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton]], who in 1895 inherited from the 12th Duke, his fourth cousin, who had attempted to marry his daughter to the heir.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 abolished the fee tail in Ireland and converted existing fees tail to [[fee simple|fees simple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/sec0013.html#sec13 ''Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act'' 2009, section 13.]&lt;/ref&gt; For constitutional reasons, this section is subject to a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to fees simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, fees tail still exist in Ireland.

===United States===
The fee tail has been abolished in all but four states in the [[United States]]: [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]]. However, in the first three states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. [[New York (state)|New York]] abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a [[fee simple]]; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.

In [[Louisiana]], the common law concept of estates in land never existed.  The concept of forced heirship and the marital portion protects force heirs and surviving spouses from total divestment of value of the estate of the decedent, who has a duty to provide for their care.

Fee tail-like restrictions still exist though contractual obligations. For example, owners of [[inholdings]] inside public lands may be prevented from selling or gifting their land to non-family members. In this case, the restrictions result from an agreement between the government and the land owner, and is not a part of a deed or settlement.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and later in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], fee tail estates were called ''ordynacja'' ({{IPA-pl|ɔrdɨˈnatsja|lang}}; landed property in ''fideicommis''). ''Ordynacja'' was an economic institution for governing of landed property introduced in late 16th century by king [[Stefan Batory]]. ''Ordynacja'' was abolished by the [[agricultural reform]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. ''Ordynat'' was the [[title]] of the principal [[heir]] of ''ordynacja''.

According to the rules of ''ordynacja'', which became a statute approved by the [[Sejm]]&lt;!--when?--&gt;, the estate was not to be divided between the heirs but inherited in full by the eldest son ([[primogeniture]]).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;Peter Paul Bajer. "[http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm Short history of the Radziwill Family]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231031433/http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm |date=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from inheritance ([[Salic Law]]).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; ''Ordynacja'' could not be sold or [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

''Ordynacja'' was similar to the French law of ''[[majorat]]'' or German and Scandinavian ''fideicommis'',&lt;!-- Link to [[fee tail]] removed - not mentioned at that article --&gt; and succession to such resembles that of British [[peerages]].

Many Polish [[magnate]]s' fortunes were based on ''ordynacja'', among them those of the [[Radziwiłł]]s, [[Zamoyski]]s, [[Czartoryski]]s, [[Potocki]]s and [[Lubomirski]]s. Most important ''ordynacja'' were veritable little [[principalities]]. The earliest and most extensive ''ordynacjas'' include:
* [[Ordynacje Radziwiłłów]], created for [[Mikołaj VII Radziwiłł]], [[Albrecht Radziwiłł]] and [[Stanisław Radziwiłł]] in 1589, centered on [[Olyka]], [[Nesvizh]], and [[Kletsk]]
* [[Ordynacja Ostrogska]], created for [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1609, later inherited by the [[Zaslawski]], [[Lubomirski]] and [[Sanguszko]] families, centered on [[Ostroh]]
* [[Ordynacja Zamojska]], created for [[Jan Zamoyski]] in 1589, centered on [[Zamość]]
* [[Ordynacja Jarosławska]], created for [[Rafał Jarosławski]] in 1470, centered on [[Jarosław]]
* [[Ordynacja Pińczowska]], created for Piotr and Zygmunt [[Myszkowski]] in 1601, later inherited by the [[Wielopolski family]], centered on [[Pińczów]]

===Other===
Other European legal systems had comparable devices to keep estates together, especially in Spain and Northern European countries like [[Prussia]]. They are derived from ''[[fideicommissum]]'', a legal institution in [[Roman law]]. Unlike most of the English aristocracy, the [[Prussian Junkers|Prussian ''junkers'']] supported fees tail, and succeeded in reinstating them in 1853, after they had been abolished in a recent Constitution. In Germany and Austria the ''Familienfideikommiss'' was only abolished in 1938, and in [[Scandinavia]] they persisted even later – a few old Swedish fees tail still remain in force, though no new ones may be established. For the law of German and Austrian fideicommissa in particular, an 862-page manual by the German legal scholar [[Philipp Knipschildt]], entitled ''Tractatus de fideicommissis nobilium familiarum – von Stammgütern'' ({{Google books|V2tBAAAAcAAJ|De fideicommissis}}), was the standard reference work. First published in 1654, this grand systematization of existing legal opinion was frequently reprinted and continued to be consulted until well into the 19th century.

'''Fergus Gordon Thomson Kerr''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Preachers|OP]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (born 16 July 1931) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] of the English [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] province. He has published significantly on a wide range of subjects, but is famous particularly for his work on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Following his education at Banff Academy and his service in the RAF (1953–1955), Kerr entered the [[Order of Preachers]] in 1956. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1962. Kerr studied in [[Aberdeen]], [[Paris]], [[Munich]], and [[Oxford]]. He was a student of Donald M. MacKinnon, John Holloway, and Cornelius Ernst. From 1966 to 1986 he taught [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

In service to the English Dominican province, Kerr was [[Prior]] at Blackfriars Hall, Oxford from 1969 to 1978. From 1992 to 1998 he served as Prior at Blackfriars, Edinburgh.  In 1998, he returned to [[Blackfriars, Oxford]], where he served as Regent until 2004. Kerr served as the Director of the Aquinas Institute, [[Blackfriars, Oxford]] and is the editor of ''[[New Blackfriars]]'', the bimonthly journal of the English Dominicans (1995–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=List of Fergus Kerr's Publications|journal=New Blackfriars|year=2001|volume=82|issue=968|pages=478–480|doi=10.1111/j.1741-2005.2001.tb01778.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Kerr is affiliated with Blackfriars, Edinburgh, where he lives and works. He holds an honorary fellowship in the School of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]] ([[New College, Edinburgh]]). He is also an Honorary Professor of [[St. Andrews University]], a distinction he has held since 2005. Kerr belongs to the [[Catholic Theological Society of Great Britain]], of which he was President from 1992 to 1994.

The '''history of [[baseball]]''' can be broken down into various aspects: by era, by locale, by organizational-type, game evolution, well as by political and cultural influence. Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].

References to baseball date back to the 1700s, and in 1871 the first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], was founded. Five years later, the [[National League]] was created; it was followed by the [[American League]] in 1901. The first [[World Series]] between the champions of the two major leagues was held in 1903, and by 1905 it became an annual event. Baseball early in the 20th century was characterized by low-scoring games, but the [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with rule changes and the rise of power hitter [[Babe Ruth]]. The major leagues had a color barrier that lasted until 1947, when [[Jackie Robinson]] made his debut. The major leagues began the process of expansion in 1961 and attendance increase from the mid-1970s to 1994, when a work stoppage led to the cancellation of the World Series.

Professional baseball leagues featured teams from Canada as early as 1877, and the sport spread to numerous countries in the 1800s and 1900s. It was played in the Olympics as a [[Olympic sport|medal sport]] from 1992 to 2008. Other competitions between national teams include the [[Baseball World Cup]] and the [[World Baseball Classic]], which was first held in 2006.

== Origins ==
{{Further|Origins of baseball}}

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A [[Medieval French literature|French]] manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly ''[[la soule]]'', with similarities to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Other old French games such as ''thèque'', ''la balle au bâton'', and ''la balle empoisonnée'' also appear to be related.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 71–72, 75, 89, 147–149, 150, 160, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game [[rounders]], popular in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. ''[[Baseball Before We Knew It]]: A Search for the Roots of the Game'' (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of [[stoolball]] and "tut-ball".&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 86, 87, 111–113, 118–121, 135–138, 144, 160; Rader (2008), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been believed that [[cricket]] also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mason, Chris|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm|title=Cricket 'Was Invented in Belgium'|date=2009-03-02|accessdate=2009-03-03|publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302235755/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm|archivedate=March 2, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', by [[John Newbery]]. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a [[woodcut]] that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 139, 140, 151, 164, 178, 179, et seq.; {{cite web|author=Hellier, Cathy|url=http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume2/june04/pocketbook.cfm|title=Mr. Newbery's Little Pretty Pocket-Book|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg Foundation}} See [[s:A Little Pretty Pocket-book/Base-Ball|Wikisource edition of ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book'']].&lt;/ref&gt; Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in [[Surrey]], and featured the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why isn't baseball more popular in the UK?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23425907|accessdate=26 July 2013|work=BBC News|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on [[Easter Monday]] 1755 in [[Guildford]], Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/baseball/2799671/Major-League-Baseball-told-Your-sport-is-British-not-American.html|title=Major League Baseball Told: Your Sport Is British, Not American|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 58, 160, 300, 307, 310; {{cite web|author=Miller, Doug|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050802&amp;content_id=1154441&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Pittsfield: Small City, Big Baseball Town|date=August 2, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321043321/http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050802&amp;content_id=1154441&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|archivedate=March 21, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, "''englische Base-ball''" involved a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire a side.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 67–75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as "[[town ball]]", though other names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 4–5, 11–15, 25, 33, 59–61, et. seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' magazine—took place in [[South-West Oxford#Communities|Beachville, Ontario]], in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or ''byes''); first bye just {{convert|18|ft|m|}} from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doubleday myth|once widely accepted story]] that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented baseball in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. xiv–xix, 15–18, 32–38, 42–47, et seq.; Rader (2008), pp. 7, 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Cartwright, photograph by J. J. Williams (PP-69-3-005).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Alexander Cartwright, father of modern baseball]]

In 1845, [[Alexander Cartwright]], a member of New York City's [[Knickerbocker Club]], produced a code of baseball rules now called the [[Knickerbocker Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of "soaking" or "plugging"—effecting a [[putout]] by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), p. 84; Koppett (2004), p. 2; Rader (2008), p. 8; Sullivan (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are reports that the [[New York Knickerbockers]] played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 32, 80, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), pp. 8–14; Rader (2008), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional leagues develop ===
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game."&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a [[fair ball]] on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by [[African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 27; Sullivan (1997), pp. 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 43, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute [[National Association as a major league|its status as a major league]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more formally structured [[National League]] was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the "senior circuit."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 83, 130, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American [[Moses Fleetwood Walker|Moses Walker]] (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a [[gentlemen's agreement]] in the form of the [[baseball color line]] effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstormers]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized.&lt;ref name=R71&gt;Rader (2008), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, [[softball]], under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game.&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy, Leslie, "Women Playing Hardball", in ''Baseball and Philosophy: Thinking Outside the Batter's Box'', ed.

A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's [[minor league baseball|minor professional leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 110; Zimbalist (2006), p. 22. See {{cite web|title=National Agreement for the Government of Professional Base Ball Clubs|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|publisher=roadsidephotos.sabr.org|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Series]], pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]] of the American League defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] of the National League.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], under [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 141–150; Sullivan (1998), pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted [[strike action|strikes]], which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the [[reserve clause]], which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 56, 100, 102, 103, 113, 143, 147, 170, et seq.; Powers (2003), pp. 17–21, 27, 83, 121, 122, 160–164, 177; Rader (2008), pp. 60–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner [[Charles Comiskey]] and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] conspired to [[match fixing|throw]] the [[1919 World Series]]. The [[Black Sox Scandal]] led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 39, 47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Commissioner of Baseball|major league baseball commissioner]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the [[Negro National League (1920–1931)|Negro National League]]; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the [[Eastern Colored League]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 117, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of Ruth and racial integration ===
[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1920, the year he joined the [[New York Yankees]]]]
Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers, including stars [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Christy Mathewson]], were more dominant. The "[[Inside Baseball (strategy)|inside game]]", which demanded that players "scratch for runs", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent [[Ty Cobb]] epitomized this style.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the [[spitball]] and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, followed the death of [[Ray Chapman]] after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making [[home run]]s more common.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the legendary player [[Babe Ruth]], the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the [[New York Yankees]], built a reputation as the majors' premier team.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] invested in several [[minor league baseball|minor league clubs]] and developed the first modern "[[farm team|farm system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Negro National League (1933–1948)|Negro National League]] was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the [[Negro American League]]. The [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first elections]] to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] took place in 1936. In 1939 [[Little League Baseball]] was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for [[Amateur baseball in the United States|children's baseball leagues]] across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|title=History of Little League|accessdate=2007-06-26|publisher=Little League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514082459/http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|archivedate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. [[Chicago Cubs]] owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] existed from 1943 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/pages/league/12/league-history|title=League History|author=Lesko, Jeneane|year=2005|publisher=All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724213445/http://aagpbl.org/index.cfm/pages/league/12/league-history|archivedate=July 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-01-29|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural [[College World Series]] was held in 1947, and the [[Babe Ruth League]] youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: [[Jackie Robinson]] was signed by the National League's [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league [[Montreal Royals|team in Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; [[Larry Doby]] debuted with the American League's [[Cleveland Indians]] later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 180, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born [[Chico Carrasquel]] and black Cuban-born [[Minnie Miñoso]], became the first Hispanic [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]].&lt;ref name="P111"&gt;Powers (2003), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3DD113FF935A15753C1A9639C8B63|title=Baseball: White Sox and Fans Speak Same Language, with a Spanish Accent|date=October 26, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing competition as varied as television and [[American football|football]], baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 3; Bjarkman (2005), p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simm"&gt;Simmons, Rob, "The Demand for Spectator Sports", in ''Handbook on the Economics of Sport'', ed. Wladimir Andreff and Stefan Szymanski (Edward Elgar, 2006), pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial integration|Integration]] proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.&lt;ref name="P111" /&gt; That year, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; No major league team had been located west of [[St. Louis]] until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The majors' final all-white bastion, the [[Boston Red Sox]], added a black player in 1959.&lt;ref name="P111"/&gt; With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy (2003), pp. 121, 218–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the [[Los Angeles Angels]] [[expansion team]], and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped [[Roger Maris]] break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 307, 308; Sullivan (2002), pp. 163, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2012), pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attendance records and the age of steroids ===
[[File:D7K 4969 Roy Halladay.jpg|thumb|In May 2010, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' [[Roy Halladay]] pitched the 20th major league [[perfect game]]. That October, he pitched only the second [[no-hitter]] in MLB postseason history.]]

The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former [[United Steelworkers]] chief economist and negotiator [[Marvin Miller]], who was elected executive director in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 170, 172–175.&lt;/ref&gt; On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the [[strike zone]] was reduced and the height of the [[pitcher's mound]] was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4&amp;nbsp;cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, [[Curt Flood]] of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|first general players' strike]] took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 156–168, 175, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (2002), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was [[Seitz decision|effectively struck down]], leading to the [[free agent|free agency system]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 178, 180, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]] and [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994]], the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 184–187, 191, 192, 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.&lt;ref name="Simm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 376, 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 249, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|both surpassed]] Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Barry Bonds]] established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by [[Banned substances in baseball|the abuse of illegal steroids]] (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271; Zimbalist (2007), pp. 195, 196; {{cite news|author=Verducci, Tom|title=To Cheat or Not to Cheat|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/05/29/baseball.steroids/index.html?|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing [[Hank Aaron]], as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.&lt;ref name="MajorAtRec"&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Regular-Season Attendance Just Shy of Last Year's Record|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/124427|work=Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Daily|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinorAtRec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minor League Baseball History|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=2009-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120173052/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|archivedate=January 20, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher [[Roger Clemens]]—have been implicated in the [[steroid era|steroid abuse scandal]], their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 292–293; Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271, 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hilgers, Laura|title=Youth Sports Drawing More than Ever|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/07/03/rise.kids.sports/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the "Year of the Pitcher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Drellich, Evan|title=Year of the Pitcher Extends to Postseason|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&amp;content_id=15461864&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=October 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031041829/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&amp;content_id=15461864&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|archivedate=31 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}} {{cite news|author=Gregory, Sean|title=Giants Win World Series: Year of the Pitcher Ends with a Fitting Duel|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/11/02/giants-win-world-series-year-of-the-pitcher-ends-with-a-fitting-duel/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107215049/http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/11/02/giants-win-world-series-year-of-the-pitcher-ends-with-a-fitting-duel/|archivedate=7 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Speier, Alex|title=Year of the Pitcher, or Year of the Umpire?|url=http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/alex-speier/2010/10/08/year-pitcher-or-year-umpire|publisher=WEEI|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017135536/http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/alex-speier/2010/10/08/year-pitcher-or-year-umpire|archivedate=October 17, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], featured teams from both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. 73; Burk (2001), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada: Baseball participation, popularity rising across the nation|publisher=World Baseball Softball Confederation|date=October 12, 2016|url=http://www.wbsc.org/canada-baseball-participation-popularity-rising-across-the-nation/|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Flaherty, David H.|editor2=Manning, Frank E.|title=The Beaver Bites Back?: American Popular Culture in Canada|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1993|pages=157–158|isbn=9780773511200}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the [[Montreal Expos]] joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion [[Toronto Blue Jays]] joined the American League.

In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at [[Parque Los Berros]] in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]]. A few days after the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], they used the "wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]".&lt;ref&gt;Terry (1909), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the [[Cuban Revolution]]).

After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently [[Baseball in Venezuela|Venezuela]] (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv, xxv; Burgos (2007), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1970s, the annual [[Caribbean Series]] has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Mexican Pacific League]], [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]], and [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]]. In Asia, [[South Korea]] (1982), [[Taiwan]] (1990) and [[China]] (2003) all have professional leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 362, 368; Gmelch (2006), pp. 100, 75, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being admitted to the Olympics as a [[Olympic sport|medal sport]] beginning with the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Games]], baseball was dropped from the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]] at the 2005 [[International Olympic Committee]] [[117th IOC Session|meeting]]. It remained part of the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games|2008 Games]]. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fewer Sports for London Olympics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4658925.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=July 8, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the [[National Hockey League]] now does during the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

The '''history of bras''' is inextricably intertwined with the [[social history]] of the status of women, including the evolution of fashion and changing views of the female body.

Women have used a variety of garments and devices to cover, restrain, reveal, or modify the appearance of [[breasts]]. Bra- or bikini-like garments are depicted in some female athletes of the [[Minoan civilization]] in the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/fashion/g1291/bra-history/?slide=1|title=Evolution of the bra|access-date=10 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310135900/http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/fashion/g1291/bra-history/?slide=1|archive-date=10 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century onward, the [[undergarment]]s of wealthier women in the [[Western world]] were dominated by the [[corset]], which supported the breasts by transferring their weight to the rib cage{{Citation needed|reason=makes historical references|date=June 2017}}. [[Corset]]s varied in length from  short ones which only supported the bust to longer ones also used to shape the waist. In the latter part of the 19th century, women experimented with various alternatives such as splitting the corset into a [[girdle]]-like restraining device for the lower torso and transferring the upper part to devices suspended from the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the late 19th century, [[bra]]s replaced the [[corset]] as the most widely used means of breast support.

By the early 20th century, garments more closely resembling contemporary bras had emerged, although large-scale commercial production did not occur until the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. Since then bras have replaced corsets (although some women prefer [[camisole]]s) and some, as well, go without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Free|first1=Cathy|title=Montana Teen Stages Protest After School Demands She Wear Bra: 'I Was Told a Male Teacher Had Complained He Was Uncomfortable'|url=http://people.com/celebrity/montana-teen-stages-protest-after-school-demands-she-wear-bra/|website=people.com|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204649/http://people.com/celebrity/montana-teen-stages-protest-after-school-demands-she-wear-bra/|archive-date=22 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal shortages of World War II encouraged the end of the corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,&lt;ref name=angel/&gt; although we have no information about what arrangements, if any, immediately preceded the adoption of the bra across Asia, Africa and Latin American .

During the 20th century, greater emphasis has been given to the fashion aspects of bras. The manufacture of bras is a multibillion-dollar industry dominated by large multinational corporations{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

==Ancient==

===Egypt===
In [[ancient Egypt]], women were generally bare breasted. The most common items of female [[attire]] were the [[skirt]] and the sheath dress, also described as a [[tunic]] or ''kalasiris'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/The-Ancient-World-Egypt/Kalasiris.html|title=Kalasiris - Fashion, Costume, and Culture: Clothing, Headwear, Body Decorations, and Footwear through the Ages|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326040058/http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/The-Ancient-World-Egypt/Kalasiris.html|archivedate=26 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rectangular piece of cloth that was folded once and sewn down the edge to make a tube. The kalasiris might cover one or both shoulders or be worn with shoulder straps. While the top could reach anywhere from below the breast to the neck, the bottom hem generally touched the ankles. A variant was a single cross strap, partially over the left breast. The shorter kalasiris was mostly worn by common women or slaves, to be more comfortable when working.

===India===
Although the majority of female figures in ancient Indian sculptures are devoid of a blouse, there are several instances of ancient Indian women wearing bras. The first historical reference to bras in India is found during the rule of King [[Harshavardhana]] (1st century AD). Sewn bras and blouses were very much in vogue during the [[Vijayanagara empire]] and the cities brimmed with tailors who specialized in tight fitting of these garments. The half-sleeved tight bodice or ''kanchuka'' figures prominently in the literature of the period, especially ''Basavapurana'' (1237 AD), which says ''kanchukas'' were worn by young girls as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/ancient/wonderbra.htm |first=Dr. Jyotsna |last=Kamat |title=Ancient brassieres |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621221610/http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/ancient/wonderbra.htm |archivedate=21 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
[[File:Snake Goddess - Heraklion Achaeological Museum retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Faience]] figurine of the Snake Goddess from ancient Crete, with the breasts supported by a fitted corset-like garment]]

Wearing a specialized garment designed to restrain a woman's breasts may date back to ancient [[Greece]]. Wall paintings in Crete, the center of the [[Minoan civilization]], show a woman performing athletics in what has been described as a "bikini".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Minoan women on the island of [[Crete]] 3,000 years ago apparently wore garments that partially supported and also revealed their breasts; the best known example of this style is the [[Snake Goddess]]. Their clothing looked somewhat like modern fitted and laced corsets or a corselette. The support device was worn outside other clothing and supported and exposed the breasts, pushing them upwards and making them more visible. The succeeding [[Mycenae]] civilization emphasized the breast, which had a special cultural and religious significance, associating the mature figure with fertility and procreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Bettany|title=Helen Of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore|date=2013|publisher=Pimlico|isbn=1845952146|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A belt could also be fastened over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the ''apodesmos'' was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them.

==Middle Ages==
In Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]] it was exceptional for women to restrict or support their breasts and if they did, they probably used something like a cloth binder, as is suggested in descriptions of the time{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. A widely quoted statement is that an edict of [[Strasbourg]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], dated 1370 states, "No woman will support the bust by the disposition of a blouse or by tightened dress."{{dubious|date=September 2015}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} An archeological find circa 1390 to 1485 revealed that women did in fact support their breasts in the Middle Ages. Four lace-decorated bras were found among 3,000 textile fragments during a renovation project in an Austrian castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lobell|first1=Jamrett|title=Medieval Fashion Statement|journal=Archaeology|date=Nov–Dec 2012|volume=65|issue=6|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/600-year-old-linen-bras-found-in-austrian-castle/|title=600 year old linen bras found in Austrian castle|year=2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220141104/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/600-year-old-linen-bras-found-in-austrian-castle/|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Charles VII of France]] (1403–1461), a gauze drape was used over the bust.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Generally, in the Middle Ages the breasts were minimized in dresses with straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and snugly to the body and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. This look is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], [[décolletage]] became very fashionable. There was some status to firm breasts in upper class women, who did not [[breast feed]]. Infants were given to [[wet nurse]]s to breast feed, since nursing was considered bad if a woman wanted to maintain an ideal form.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Among the wealthier classes, the corset was beginning to appear by the mid-15th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589, wife of King [[Henry II of France]]) is widely, and wrongly, blamed for the corset. She was reported to have prohibited wide waists at court in the 1550s, legend suggesting she made them wear steel framework corsets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Elaborate constraints placed on women's figures over the years were not universal. Corsetry made it virtually impossible to work, so simpler functional garments were worn by women who worked inside or outside the home. Support for the breasts was often provided by a simple tie under the breast line, in the bodice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Renaissance==
[[File:Lippo lippi woman.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Painting illustrating Renaissance ideals.]]

Early corsets of the 16th century consisted of paste-stiffened linen and a primitive [[busk]] at the front but later included iron supports at the side and back. The emphasis now was on form, with compression of the breasts forcing them upwards to the point of almost spilling out, so a considerable part of the breast was exposed. The ideal form was a flat torso, which inevitably pushed the breasts upwards and out. The labouring class by contrast wore a simple front-lacing [[cotte]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

During the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], any garment associated with the aristocracy was frowned upon, including those with visible décolletage. The breasts were often supported by a tie below the bust, and extant bust-support garments ranged from soft stays to wrap-front items similar to sports bras. In 1814, the court and the corset returned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===French Empire===
{{Main|1795–1820 in fashion}}
[[Empire silhouette|Empire]] fashion originated during the [[Directoire style|Directoire]] period, popularized by women such as [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]]. "Inspired by the mania for the Graeco-Roman, with its connotations of artistic excellence and political liberty, fashionable women discarded corsets and adopted sleeveless transparent tunics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Andrea|title=The rose of Martinique : a life of Napoleon's Josephine|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333739334|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embracing the classical silhouette, in [[Great Britain|Britain]] this period was known as the [[1795–1820 in fashion|Regency]]. During this era, "fashion-conscious women ... pored over fashion journals like ''Le Journal des Dames et de la Mode'', the era's version of [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']], in order to see what Josephine was wearing and attempt to copy her style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Andrea|title=The rose of Martinique : a life of Napoleon's Josephine|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333739334|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular chest support in this period were short stays, a type of lightly boned corset.

===Victorian era in Britain=== 
In the [[Victorian era]], despite contemporary ideas about morality, women's clothing was paradoxically designed to emphasize both the breasts and hips by [[tightlacing]] the waist. Victorian women were encumbered with many layers of clothing, including a [[chemise]] with a drawstring neckline, usually [[Undergarment|drawers]], then the corset and corset cover, the under [[petticoat]], the hoop skirt, the over petticoat, and finally the dress. According to the social expectations of the times, even the lowest-cut evening gown should dip no lower than three finger breadths below the clavicles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Edwardian era in Britain===
 
By the [[Edwardian period|Edwardian era]], with some increase in women's physical activities, the corset started to retreat southward again, becoming more like a girdle and accompanied by the appearance of a separate upper garment, the ''Bust Bodice'', or BB. For those who instead wore a one-piece undershift (''unionsuit''), this separated into the camisole and drawers. These were not designed for support but merely coverage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Women's dress emphasized an "S" shape, with an indrawn stomach giving prominence to the posterior and bust. In the late 19th century and early 20th century the bosom could still be displayed. "The high-water mark of modesty would ebb after sunset some six inches!"&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington C.W. A Handbook of English Costume in the 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; Corsets remained the main form of support, but war and its impact on lifestyle and materials meant that its future was uncertain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==The Clothing Reform Movement==
{{Anchor|The Clothing Reform Movement}}
{{Main|Victorian dress reform}}
The evolution of the bra from the corset was driven by two parallel movements: health professionals' concerns about the cruel, constraining effects of the corset, and the clothing reform movement of feminists who saw that greater participation of women in society would require emancipation from corsetry. Prominent amongst these were the Rational Dress Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/hendrick/women.html |title=The Possibility of Mobility |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329041457/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/hendrick/women.html |archivedate=29 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Dress Reform Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galenahistorymuseum.org/bloomergirls.htm |author=Nancy Wolfe |title=The Bloomer Girls: America's Dress Reform Movement of the 1850s|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214202826/http://www.galenahistorymuseum.org/bloomergirls.htm |archivedate=14 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Reform Dress Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=1800|title=Upstate New York and the Women's Rights Movement|accessdate=13 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521191026/https://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=1800|archivedate=21 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were a number of voices warning about the considerable health risks of corsets, health professions were generally muted, and women ignored "unfashionable" advice. The health professions concentrated more on psychosomatic complaints, which were in fact probably related to corsetry. Ill health was considered synonymous with femininity, and a pale and sickly demeanor was normative. (Fictional heroines often died from tuberculosis, or "consumption." This made them pale and kept them immobile.) Corsets were supposed to provide both physical and moral support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Some physicians ignored colleagues who felt corsets were a medical necessity because of women's biology and the needs of civilized order. The physicians who raised the alarm pointed to nausea, bowel disturbances, eating disorders, breathlessness, flushing, fainting, and gynecological problems. [[Bed rest]] was a common prescription for the "weaker sex," which of course implied relief from corsetry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Women's interest in sport, particularly bicycling, forced a rethinking, and women's groups called for "emancipation garments." [[Elizabeth Stuart Phelps]] urged women to "burn the [[corsets]]!" in 1874.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indirectly and directly, sports empowered women in other social climates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Not surprisingly, corsetieres fought back, embellishing their products to be frilly and feminine in the 1870s. Advertising took on overtones of erotic imagery, even if in practice they acted as a deterrent to sexuality, especially when they started appearing in men's magazines, stressing [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] and bare arms (then taboo). Dolls assumed the corseted image, implanting an image of the "ideal" female form. Corsets certainly reinforced the image of a weaker sex, unable to defend themselves, and also made it a challenge to disrobe.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In practice, early bras made little market penetration. They were expensive, and only educated wealthy reformers wore them to any extent.&lt;ref name="uplift"/&gt;

American women who made important contributions included [[Amelia Bloomer]] (1818–1894) ("When you find a burden in belief or apparel, cast it off")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashion-era.com/rational_dress.htm#Amelia%20Bloomer%201818-1894 |author=Pauline Thomas |title=Fashion Era: Rational dress reform |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115045046/http://www.fashion-era.com/rational_dress.htm#Amelia%20Bloomer%201818-1894 |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]] (1832–1919).

===The emergence of the bra in the 19th century===

There are considerable differences of opinion as to who "invented" the modern brassière or bra. Patent dates indicate some of the landmark developments; a large number of patents for bra-like devices were granted in the 19th century. However, what is regarded as the world's oldest push-up bra was discovered in storage at the Science Museum in London. Designed to enhance cleavage, the bra is said to be from the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2944282/Worlds-oldest-Wonderbra-found.html?OTC-RSS&amp;ATTR=News |title=World's oldest Wonderbra found |location=London |work=The Sun |first=Kate |last=Wighton |date=22 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023061436/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2944282/Worlds-oldest-Wonderbra-found.html?OTC-RSS&amp;ATTR=News |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bra-like device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|24033}}&lt;/ref&gt; that gave a ''symmetrical rotundity'' to the wearer's breasts was patented in 1859 by [[Henry S. Lesher]] of Brooklyn, New York. In 1863, a "corset substitute" was patented by Luman L. Chapman of Camden, New Jersey. Historians refer to it as a "proto-bra."&lt;ref name="uplift"/&gt;

In 1876, dressmaker Olivia Flynt was granted four patents covering the "true Corset" or "Flynt Waist." It was aimed at the larger-breasted woman. Reformers stimulated demand for and probably purchased these early garments on "hygienic" grounds because of their concerns about the corset. Initially Flynt's garments were only available by mail order, but they eventually appeared in department and clothing stores and catalogues. Her designs won a bronze medal at the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association in 1878, at the Cotton Centennial Exposition in Atlanta in 1884–5, and at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRJt7QqA7GEC&amp;dq=Mothers+and+Daughters+of+Invention:+Notes+for+a+Revised+History+of+Technology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |last=Stanley |first=Autumn |title=Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=1993 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627003513/http://books.google.com/books?id=uRJt7QqA7GEC&amp;dq=Mothers+and+Daughters+of+Invention:+Notes+for+a+Revised+History+of+Technology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=27 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}

According to ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' magazine, in 1889 [[Herminie Cadolle]] of France invented the first modern bra.&lt;ref&gt;Pechter E. A new method for determining bra size and predicting post-augmentation breast size. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 102 (4) September 1998, 1259–1265&lt;/ref&gt;
It appeared in a corset catalogue as a two-piece undergarment, which she originally called the ''corselet gorge'', and later ''le bien-être'' (or "the well-being"). Her garment effectively cut the traditional corset in two: The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper part supported the breasts with shoulder straps. Her description reads "designed to sustain the bosom and supported by the shoulders." She patented her invention and showed it at the Great Exhibition of 1889. The company, still family-owned, claims today that Herminie "freed women by inventing the first Bra."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadolle.com/fr/histoire|title=House of Cadolle, Histoire|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204170542/http://cadolle.com/fr/histoire|archivedate=4 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1905, the upper half was sold separately as a ''soutien-gorge'', the name by which bras are still known in France. She also introduced the use of "rubber thread" or [[Elastomer|elastic]].

In 1893, Marie Tucek received a U.S. patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|494397}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a device that consisted of separate pockets for each breast above a metal supporting plate and shoulder straps fastened by hook-and-eye. This invention more closely resembled the modern bra known today, and was a precursor to the [[underwire bra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 494397 | y = 1893| m = 03| d = 28| inventor = Marie Tucek| title = Breast Supporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucek"&gt;{{cite news| last = Riordan| first = Teresa| title = Patents; In bra technology, an incremental improvement can translate into comfort.| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| accessdate = 13 June 2017| date = 28 October 2002| work = The New York Times| quote = Professor Farrell-Beck said the antecedents for underwire in bras date to at least 1893, when Marie Tucek of New York City patented a ''breast supporter'', a sort of early push-up bra made of either metal or cardboard and then covered with fabric.| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5gHMwNkFs?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| archivedate = 24 April 2009| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home-sewn garments competed with factory-made, ready-to-wear garments. The bra was at first an alternative to the corset, as a [[negligée]] or at-home wear, or worn by women with medical issues stemming from corsets. After the [[History of corsets|straight-fronted corset]] became fashionable in the early 20th century, a bra or "bust supporter" became a necessity for full-busted women because the straight-fronted corset did not offer as much support and containment as the Victorian styles. Early bras were either wrap-around [[bodice]]s or boned, close-fitting [[camisole]]s (both worn over the corset). They were designed to hold the bust in and down against the corset, which provided upward support.

Advertising of the times, typically in periodicals, stressed the advantages of bras in health and comfort over corsets and portrayed garments with shoulder supports in a mono-bosom style and with limited adaptability. Their major appeal was to those for whom lung function and mobility were priorities, rather than outer appearance.&lt;ref name="uplift"/&gt;

The first modern bra was patented by the German Christine Hardt in 1889.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Sigmund Lindauer from Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Germany developed a bra for mass production in 1912 and patented it in 1913. It was mass-produced by Mechanischen Trikotweberei Ludwig Maier und Cie. in Böblingen, Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}  With metal shortages, World War I encouraged the end of the corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angelasancartier.net/brassiere|title=Brassiere - Clothing and Fashion|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129043157/http://angelasancartier.net/brassiere|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Mary Phelps Jacob (known later in life as [[Caresse Crosby]]), a 19-year-old New York socialite, purchased a sheer evening gown for a debutante ball. At that time, the only acceptable undergarment was a [[corset]] stiffened with whalebone. Mary had large breasts and found that the whalebone visibly poked out around her plunging neckline and from under the sheer fabric. Dissatisfied with this arrangement, she worked with her maid to fashion two silk handkerchiefs together with some pink ribbon and cord.&lt;ref name="hamalian"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamalian |first=Linda |title=The Cramoisy Queen: A Life of Caresse Crosby |publisher=Southern Illinois University|year=2005|isbn=0-8093-1865-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

for the "Backless Bra." Crosby's patent was for a device that was lightweight, soft, comfortable to wear, and naturally separated the breasts, unlike the corset, which was heavy, stiff, uncomfortable, and had the effect of creating a "monobosom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashion-era.com/edwardian_corsetry.htm |title=Edwardian Corsetry Fashion History |first=Pauline Weston |last=Thomas |publisher=Fashion-Era.com |date=September 2004 |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828090322/http://www.fashion-era.com/edwardian_corsetry.htm |archivedate=28 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing through American History, 1900 to the Present |first= Amy T. |last= Peterson |others=Valerie Hewitt, Heather Vaughan, and Ann T.

Crosby managed to secure a few orders from department stores, but her business never took off. Her husband [[Harry Crosby]] discouraged her from pursuing the business and persuaded her to close it.&lt;ref name="hamalian"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} She later sold the bra patent to the [[Warnaco|Warners Brothers]] Corset Company in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], for $1,500 (roughly equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1500|1922}}}} in current dollars). Warner manufactured the "Crosby" bra for a while, but it did not become a popular style and eventually was discontinued.&lt;ref name=uplift&gt;{{cite book |title=Uplift: The Bra in America |author1=Jane Farrell-Beck |author2=Colleen Gau |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2002 |volume=xvi|pages=243|ISBN=0-8122-3643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner went on to earn more than $15 million from the bra patent over the next 30 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Bras became more common and widely promoted over the course of the 1910s, aided by the continuing trend towards lighter, shorter corsets that offered increasingly less bust support and containment. In 1917 at the beginning of the U.S. involvement in [[World War I]], the U.S. War Industries Board asked women to stop buying corsets to free up metal for war production. This was said to have saved some 28,000 tons of metal, enough to build two battleships.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/rosenthal_hi.html |title=Ida Rosenthal, Brassiere Tycoon |work=Who Made America? |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618141809/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/rosenthal_hi.html |archivedate=18 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that the bra took off the way it did in large part because of World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in factories and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.&lt;ref name ="uplift"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===The 1920s===
As the corset became shorter during the later 1910s, it provided less support to the bust. By 1920 the corset started at the waist, and bust containment yielded entirely to the bra. A low, sloping bustline became more fashionable. Brassieres from the late 1910s and early 1920s were merely slightly shaped bandeaus (bandeaux) style, holding the bust in and down by means of a clip attached to the corset.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

This culminated in the "boyish" silhouette of the [[Flapper]] era of the 1920s, with little bust definition. The term (which in the mid-1910s referred to preteen and early-teenage girls) was adopted by the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in the 1920s for their younger adult customers. The [[androgyne|androgynous]] figure then in style downplayed women's natural curves through the use of a bandeau bra, which flattened breasts. It was relatively easy for small-busted women to conform to the flat-chested look of the Flapper era. Women with larger breasts tried products like the popular Symington Side Lacer that, when laced at the sides, pulled and helped to flatten women's chests. Yet some "bras" of the early 1920s were little more than camisoles.

In 1922, Russian immigrant [[Ida Rosenthal]] was a seamstress at the small New York City dress shop Enid Frocks. She and her husband William Rosenthal, along with shop owner Enid Bissett, changed the look of women's fashion. They noticed that a bra that fit one woman did not fit another woman with the same bra size. With $4,500 invested in their new business, they developed bras for all ages. Their innovation was designed to make their dresses look better on the wearer by increasing the shaping of the bandeau bra to enhance and support women's breasts. They named the company [[Maidenform|Maiden Form]], a deliberate contrast with the name of a competitor, "Boyishform Company."&lt;ref name=uplift/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Museum of American History Archives |title=Maidenform Collection, 1922–1997 No. 585 |author1=Jennifer Snyder |author2=Mimi Minnick |date=August 1997 – July 1999 |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d7585.htm |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016082310/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d7585.htm |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiden Form routed Boyishform by 1924, accenting and lifting rather than flattening the bust. In 1927, William Rosenthal, the president of [[Maidenform|Maiden Form]], filed patents for nursing, full-figured, and the first seamed uplift bra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/maidenform-inc-history |title=Maidenform Inc. History |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182250/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/maidenform-inc-history/ |archivedate=6 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fashion changes coincided with health professionals beginning to link breast care and comfort to motherhood and lactation, and campaigned against breast flattening. The emphasis shifted from minimizing the breasts to uplifting and accenting them. Women, especially the younger set, welcomed the bra as a modern garment.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

While manufacturing was beginning to become more organized, homemade bras and bandeaux were still quite popular, usually made of white cotton, but they were little more than bust bodices with some separation.

===The 1930s===
The word "brassiere" was gradually shortened to "bra" in the 1930s. According to a 1934 survey by ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', "bra" was the most commonly used expression for the garment among college women.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The bra was becoming more sophisticated, and home-sewn versions vanished in the 1930s. In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet, A through D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of ''Corset and Underwear Review''. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Two other companies, Model and Fay-Miss, began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s.&lt;ref name=uplift/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lingerie Handbook |first=Rebecca |last=Apsan |others=Sarah Stark |pages=186 |publisher=Workman Publishing Company |date=20 October 2006 |isbn=0-7611-4323-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBobur5ZgX0C&amp;pg=PA30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512203239/http://books.google.com/books?id=KBobur5ZgX0C&amp;pg=PA30 |archivedate=12 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;{{rp|101}} Adjustable bands were introduced using multiple eye and hook positions in the 1930s.

As with other women's products, consumer adoption was encouraged by successful advertising and [[marketing]] campaigns. Saleswomen played a key role, helping clients find the right garment, as did the changing role of women in [[society]]. Much of this [[marketing]] was aimed at young women.

Bras rapidly became a major industry over the 1930s, with improvements in fiber technology, fabrics, colours, patterns, and options, and did much better than the retail industry in general. Innovations included Warners' use of elastic, the adjustable strap, the sized cup, and padded bras for smaller-breasted women. In the US production moved outside of New York and Chicago, and advertising started to exploit [[Hollywood glamour]] and become more specialised. Department stores developed fitting areas, and customers, stores and manufacturers all benefited. Manufacturers even arranged fitting training courses for saleswomen. International sales started to form an increasing part of the U.S. bra manufacturer's market. Prices started to make bras available to a wider market, and home-made competition dwindled. Other major manufacturers of the 1930s included Triumph, Maidenform, Gossard, ([[Courtaulds]]), [[Spirella]], Spencer, Twilfit, and Symington.

The culturally preferred silhouette among Western women during the 1930s was a pointy bust, which further increased demand for a forming garment.

===The 1940s===

In the United States, military women were enlisted for the first time in the lower ranks and were fitted with uniform underwear. Willson Goggles, a Pennsylvania firm that manufactured safety equipment for manual workers, is believed to have introduced the plastic "SAF-T-BRA", designed to protect women on the factory floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcdermott|first=Kerry|title=The armoured bra!

Dress codes appeared{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] informed their workers that bras must be worn because of "good taste, anatomical support, and morale".

[[Military terminology]] crept into product marketing, as represented by the highly structured, conically pointed [[List of brassiere designs|Torpedo or Bullet bra]], designed for "maximum projection". The bullet bra was worn by the [[Sweater Girl]], a busty and wholesome "girl next door" whose tight-fitting outergarments accentuated her artificially enhanced [[curve]]s. Underwire began to be used in bra construction. Actresses like [[Jane Russell]] appeared in photographs wearing the new bras that emphasized the "lift and separate" design, which influenced later bra design.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For the movie, ''The Outlaw'', which features actress Jane Russell, the producer and airplane designer Howard Hughes constructed the Cantilever bra for Russell to wear in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apsan|first1=Rebecca|title=The Lingerie Handbook: Transform Your Body, Transform Yourself|date=2006|publisher=Workman Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes constructed the bra so that it would fit and support Jane Russell's breasts. Hughes created the bra on the basis of bridge building. After seeing Jane Russell and her bust in the movie, women sought to recreate the look on their own chests.

The war presented unique challenges for industry. Women's occupations shifted dramatically, with far more employed outside the home and in industry. Severe material shortages limited design choices. Advertising, promotion, and consumerism were limited but started to appear directed at minorities (e.g., ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' in 1945) and teens. Many manufacturers only survived by making tents and parachutes in addition to bras. American industry was now freed from European influences, particularly French, and it became more distinctive. Again there was concern about the use of badly needed steel in corsets and the British Government carried out a survey of women's usage of underwear in 1941. This showed that "on average, women owned 1.2 bras (housewives 0.8 and agricultural workers 1.9)".

===The 1950s===

[[File:Patti Page 1955.JPG|thumb|[[Patti Page]] wearing a bullet bra in 1955.]]
Following the Second World War, material availability, production and marketing, and demand for a greater variety of consumer goods, including bras. The [[baby boom]] specifically created a demand for maternity and [[nursing bra]]s, and television provided new promotional opportunities. Manufacturers responded with new fabrics, colours, patterns, styles, padding and elasticity. Hollywood fashion and glamour influenced women's fashion choices including bras like the cone-shaped, spiral-stitched  [[List of brassiere designs|bullet bra]] popularized by actresses like [[Patti Page]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Lana Turner]], who was nicknamed the "[[Sweater Girl]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lingerie from History We Would (Probably) Never Wear Again|url=http://www.nowthatslingerie.com/bradoctor/blog/blog-updates/lingerie-from-history-we-would-probably-never-wear-again/2012/02/02|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606063620/http://www.nowthatslingerie.com/bradoctor/blog/blog-updates/lingerie-from-history-we-would-probably-never-wear-again/2012/02/02|archivedate=6 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullet bras allowed women to add a cup size to their bust.

===The 1960s===
The 1960s reflected increasing interest in quality and fashion. Maternity and mastectomy bras began to find a new respectability, and the increasing use of washing machines created a need for products that were more durable. While girdles gave way to pantyhose, the bra continued to evolve. Marketing campaigns like those for the "Snoozable" and "Sweet Dreams" &lt;ref&gt;Maidenform Sweet Dreams Campaign (November 1962). Family Circle Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; promoted wearing a bra 24 hours a day.

In 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a "Freedom Trash Can." These included bras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dow, Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=6 |issue=1 |date= Spring 2003 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were among items the protestors called "instruments of female torture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Duffett, Judith |title=WLM vs. Miss America |work=Voice of the Women's Liberation Movement |date=October 1968 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced [[femininity]].

This might lead individuals to believe, as she wrote in her 2003 article "Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology," that the women were merely trying to be "trendy, and to attract men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dow |first=Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal= Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=6 | issue = 1| year=2003|pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/unknown/viewarticle.aspx?id=299050 |author=Loughran, Jane |title=You don't have to be a bra-burning feminist to want to keep your name |publisher=News &amp; Star |date=01/11/2005 |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230647/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/unknown/viewarticle.aspx?id=299050 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://menz.org.nz/menz-issues/october-1996 |last=Williams |first=Ginny |title=Women of Goodwill |publisher=MENZ Issues |date=October 1996 |volume=1 |issue=4 |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717013212/https://menz.org.nz/menz-issues/october-1996/ |archive-date=17 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spongberg |first=Mary|title=If she's so great, how come so many pigs dig her?

Gernreich followed that in October 1964 with the "No Bra", a soft-cup, light-weight, seamless, sheer nylon and elastic tricot bra in sizes 32 to 36, A and B cups, manufactured by Exquisite Form. His minimalist bra was a revolutionary departure from the heavy, torpedo-shaped bras of the 1950s, initiating a trend toward more natural shapes and soft, sheer fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "No Bra" Brassiere|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64190/the-no-bra-brassiere-bra-gernreich-rudi/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006013311/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64190/the-no-bra-brassiere-bra-gernreich-rudi|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foreman|first1=Katya|title=The Bra: an Uplifting Tale|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150220-the-bra-an-uplifting-tale|accessdate=12 October 2015|publisher=BBC|date=20 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009025019/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150220-the-bra-an-uplifting-tale|archivedate=9 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed an "All-in-None" design with a deep, plunging front, and a "No-Back" long-line version, which featured a contoured stretch-waistband that allowed a woman to wear a backless dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rudi Gernreich's 'No-Bra ' Bra… Comes In Threes |date=October 1965 |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/rudi-gernreichs-no-bra-bra-comes-in-threes-slightly-nsfw/ |newspaper=[[Playgirl]] |pages=32–35 |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318224906/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/rudi-gernreichs-no-bra-bra-comes-in-threes-slightly-nsfw/ |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wonderbra]] was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It has 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

===The 1970s ===
{{Original research|section=1|date=February 2016}}
[[Germaine Greer]]'s book ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' (1970) became associated with the anti-bra movement because she pointed out how restrictive and uncomfortable a bra could be. "Bras are a ludicrous invention", she wrote, "but if you make bralessness a rule, you're just subjecting yourself to yet another repression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/germaine-greer.html | title=German Greer Biography | accessdate=7 April 2010 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Cnil4GK?url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/germaine-greer.html | archive-date=25 August 2011 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, like other garment makers, bra manufacturers moved production offshore. The evolution of the bra reflects the constantly changing idea of what an "ideal" woman should look like{{spaced ndash}}flat, round, pointy, conical, or even "natural". The contemporary bra also reflects advances in manufacturing and availability of fabric types and colours, enabling it to be transformed from a utilitarian item to a fashion statement, countering the negative attitudes some women had about bras. Designers have also incorporated numerous devices to produce varying shapes, cleavage, and to give women bras they could wear with open-back dresses, off-the-shoulder dresses, plunging necklines, and the like.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

=== The 1980s ===

Throughout the 1980s fashion led the way in the look and feel of bras. Western TV shows featured classy, powerful, and well-formed ladies, usually donning low cut tops to show an enhanced chest with an equally classy matching bra.

The onset of classy and stylish Teddy suits also encompassed this decade and sales of silicone increased the need for bigger and more supportive bras.

Models and celebrities all donned fashionable and extravagant bras, showing these off at red carpets events become the norm.

In contrast, feminist [[Susan Brownmiller]] in her book ''Femininity'' (1984) took the position that women without bras shock and anger men because men "implicitly think that they own breasts and that only they should remove bras."{{sfn|Young|2005|p=192}}

=== The 1990s ===
[[File:JogBra DSCF2208.jpg | thumb|right | JogBra]]
Manufacturers' marketing and advertising often appeals to fashion and image over fit, comfort and function.&lt;ref name="mintel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGhee"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGhee|first=DE|others=Steele JR|title=How do respiratory state and measurement method affect bra size calculations?|publisher=Sports Medicine|year=2006|volume=40|pages=970–974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since about 1994, manufacturers have re-focused their advertising, moving from advertising functional bras that emphasize support and foundation, to selling lingerie that emphasize fashion while sacrificing basic fit and function, like linings under scratchy lace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/opinion/13SEIG.html |title=The Cups Runneth Over |last=Seigel |first=Jessica |date=13 February 2004 |work=New York Times |accessdate=26 April 2010 |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423163138/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/opinion/13SEIG.html |archivedate=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of jogging and other forms of exercise, it became apparent that there was a need for an athletic garment for women's breasts.

=== The 2000s ===

Two design challenges that bra manufacturers face at present seem paradoxical. On the one hand, there is a demand for minimal bras that allow plunging necklines and reduce interference with the lines of outer garments, such as the [[Bra#Types of bras|shelf bra]]. On the other hand, body mass and bust size is increasing,&lt;ref name="seigel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessicaseigel.com/articles/bra.shtml |author=Jessica Seigel |title=Bent out of shape: Why is it so hard to find the perfect bra? |work=Lifetime Magazine |date=May–June 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Cnpilky?url=http://www.jessicaseigel.com/articles/bra.shtml |archivedate=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
leading to a higher demand for larger sizes.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050602/ai_n14651255 |author=King, Stephanie |title=A short history of lingerie: Doreen the bra that conquered the world |work=The Independent  |date=2 June 2005|quote=See Victoria Hiley, ''Bra-burning a myth'' 4 June.

The 2000s brought two large design changes to the bra.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The molded one-piece, seamless bra cup became ubiquitous.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} They are heat-molded around round forms of synthetic fibers or foam that keeps their rounded shape. This construction can include padded bras, contour bras and so-called T-shirt bras. Also new and ubiquitous in the 2000s was the popularity of printed designs such as floral or patterned prints.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Bras are a billion-dollar industry ($15&amp;nbsp;billion in the US in 2001, £1 billion in UK.&lt;ref name="mintel"/&gt;) that continues to grow. Large corporations such as [[HanesBrands Inc.]] control most bra manufacturing,&lt;ref name="mintel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanesbrands.com/hbi/en-us/ |title=Hanesbrands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114111939/http://www.hanesbrands.com/hbi/en-us/ |archivedate=14 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gossard, [[Berlei]] and Courtaulds with 34% of the UK market. [[Victoria's Secret]] is an exception.

Feminist author [[Iris Marion Young]] wrote in 2005 that the bra "serves as a barrier to touch" and that a braless woman is "[[Sexual objectification|deobjectified]]", eliminating the "hard, pointy look that phallic culture posits as the norm." Without a bra, in her view, women's breasts are not consistently shaped objects but change as the woman moves, reflecting the natural body.{{sfn|Young|2005|p=192}} Other feminist anti-bra arguments from Young in 2005 include that [[training bra]]s are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects and to accentuate their sexuality.{{sfn|Young|2005|p=192}} Young also wrote in 2007 that, in American culture, breasts are subject to "[c]apitalist, [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] American media-dominated culture [that] objectifies breasts before such a distancing glance that freezes and masters."{{sfn|Burns-Ardolino|2007|p=31}} Academic Wendy Burns-Ardolino wrote in 2007 that women's decision to wear bras is mediated by the "[[male gaze]]".{{sfn|Burns-Ardolino|2007|pp=30–32}}

===Modern production===

Like other clothing, bras were initially sewn by small production companies and supplied to various retailers. The term "cup" was not used to describe bras until 1916, and manufacturers relied on stretchable cups to accommodate different sized breasts.&lt;ref name=farrell&gt;{{cite book |title=Uplift: The Bra in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtRbdACUkqgC |first1=Jane |last1=Farrell-Beck |first2=Colleen |last2=Gau |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |edition=illustrated |date=22 October 2002 |isbn=978-0-8122-1835-0 |accessdate=13 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723035935/https://books.google.com/books?id=MtRbdACUkqgC |archivedate=23 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}} Women with larger or pendulous breasts had the choice of long-line bras, built-up backs, wedge-shaped inserts between the cups, wider straps, power Lastex, firm bands under the cup, and even light boning.

In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet: A, B, C and D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of ''Corset and Underwear Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_h5-Ov5fm8&amp;feature=related |title=How to Measure for a Bra |publisher=HerRoom.com |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831163645/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_h5-Ov5fm8&amp;feature=related |archivedate=31 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products.

There is an [[urban legend]] that the bra was invented by a man named [[Otto Titzling]] ("tit sling") who lost a lawsuit with ''Phillip de Bra'' ("fill up the bra"). This originated with the 1971 book ''Bust-Up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra'' and was propagated in a comedic song from the movie ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/origins/bra.asp|title= Brassiere (origin of name)|publisher=Snopes.com Urban Legends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of bras==
In 1964, Danish Fashion historian [[Rudolf Broby-Johansen|Rudolf Kristian Albert Broby-Johansen]] wrote that the topless look, which liberated breasts from bras, should be treated seriously. He asserted that it was a way for a new generation of women to express themselves. In 1969, he wrote an article titled "Obituary for the Bra" in which he predicted the imminent demise of bras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Thesander | first1 = Marianne. | title = The Feminine Idea | year = 1997 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-86189-004-7 | pages =232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brassieres are worn by the great majority of women in Western society. Estimates about what proportion of [[Western culture|Western]] women wear bras varies, but most surveys report from 75% to 95%. About 90% of Australian women wear a bra as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antibra.com/why_wear_bras.php |title=Why wear a bra? |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513140505/http://www.antibra.com/why_wear_bras.php |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are now an unprecedented array of [[list of brassiere designs|styles and models]], including full-coverage bras, [[Balconette brassiere|balconette cup bras]], and [[sports bra]]s that can sometimes be worn as outerwear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''Ivy Pinchbeck''', (9 April 1898 – 10 May 1982) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Economic history|economic]] and [[Social history|social historian]], specialising in the history of women. Her book of 1930,''Women Workers and the Industrial Revolution, 1750 – 1850''  was a pioneering effort in women's history, and highly influential in the next half-century.  She concluded that women overall gained more than they lost from the Industrial Revolution, as compared to the dangers and unsanitary and harsh working conditions of the previous era.&lt;ref&gt;K. Boyd, ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Volume 1 '' (1999), pp.921–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Pinchbeck studied at University of Nottingham, graduating B.A. in 1920; at [[London School of Economics]], M.A., 1927 and Ph.D., 1930. She taught in the Department of Sociology, Social Studies and Economics at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], University of London from 1929 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=74424|first=K.|last=Honeyman|title=Pinchbeck, Ivy (1898–1982)|volume=15|page=1194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her classic work, ''Women workers and the industrial revolution, 1750–1850'', based on her Ph.D. thesis, Pinchbeck argued that in the long run, the [[Industrial Revolution]] increased women's employment opportunities, was beneficial to women's social and economic position and therefore was a liberating factor. This conclusion was in contrast to the earlier view of [[Alice Clark]], who believed that industrial capitalism was responsible for the exclusion of women from paid employment, and thus played a crucial role in modern women's oppression.

Pinchbeck's two-volume ''Children in English Society'', co-authored with the help of Margaret Hewitt, a former student, described the conditions of poor and orphaned children, from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, and discussed how legislative and voluntary responses to them had changed over the period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7738">The '''Jewish Talmudic Calendar''' is a [[lunisolar calendar]] using [[Tishri-years]], observed by the [[Jewish people]] since the [[Late Antiquity]] (AD 300-700). While it is based on [[Nisan-years]], which began from the prebiblical Babylonian times (c. 2000 BC), and the [[Tishri-years]] was formed in the time of [[David]] (c. 1000 BC), the full formation of the Jewish Talmudic Calendar was during the time of the writing of [[Talmud]] (c. AD 300-600), usually attributed to [[Hillel II]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Spier, ''The Comprehensive Hebrew Calendar: Its Structure, History, and One Hundred Years of Corresponding Dates: 5660-5760, 1900-2000'' (New York: Behrman House, Inc. Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The ancient Israelite Calendar, no matter [[Nisan-years]] or [[Tishri-years]], was determined by the astronomical observation of the [[New Moon]], and the agricultural observation of the growth of ''Abib'' (the spikes on the Barley) in late Winter and early Spring. After the second (Roman) [[Diaspora]], in order for the [[Jewish people]] away from the [[Land of Israel]] to be able to observe their [[Spring Feasts]] and [[Fall Feasts]] in the same calendar, the Jewish Talmudic Calendar was formed, based on mathematical algorithms, and free from the required observations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Waskow, ''Seasons of Joy: a modern guide to the Jewish holidays'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
The Jewish Talmudic Calendar, in agreement with the [[Almagest]] and the writings of [[Kidinnu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dershowitz|first1=Nachum|last2=Reingold|first2=Edward|title=Calendrical Calculations|date=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521885409|page=92|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; assumes that a month is uniformly of the length of an average [[synodic month]], taken as exactly 29{{frac|13753|25920}} days (about 29.530594 days, which is less than half a second from the modern scientific estimate); it also assumes that a [[tropical year]] is exactly 12{{frac|7|19}} times that, i.e. about 365.2468 days. Thus it overestimates the length of the [[tropical year]] (365.2422 days) by 0.0046 days (about 7 minutes) per year, or about one day in 216 years. This error is less than the [[Julian Calendar|Julian years]] (365.2500 days) make (0.0078 days/year, or one day in 128 years), but much more than what the [[Gregorian Calendar|Gregorian years]] (365.2425 days/year) make (0.0003 days/year, or one day in 3333 years).

==The Day==
A day is defined to begin from the previous evening, at the time of sunset, when three mediums sized stars appear. Practically it begins from 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (18:00) Jerusalem time (16:00 [[Universal Time]]). A day is divided into 24 hours, each with 1080 parts (halakim). Thus each minute is composed of 18 halakim; each halakim is 3.33 seconds.

==The Months==
There are twelve months in a [[common year]], and thirteen months in a [[leap year]]. The [[New Years Day]] ([[Rosh Hashana]]) is Tishri 1. The months are 30 days and 29 days in turns. A regular common year is 354 days; while a regular leap year is 384 days (adding in a 30-day Adar I, and making the 29-day month Adar II).

==The Year==
There are times when a common year is 353 days, or a leap year is 383 days; these are called the Defective Years. When a common year is 355 days, or a leap year is 385 days, these are called the Excessive Years. In Defective years, the regularly 30-day Kislev is made 29 days; in Excessive Years, the regularly 29-day Heshvan is made 30 days.

==The Era==
Jewish Talmudic Calendar is coupled with the [[Rabbinical Chronology]], taking Monday, (Julian) Oct 7, 3761 BC. as the date of creation, and the beginning of the Era of the World (Anno Mundi). The reference junction of the Sun and the Moon (Molad 1) on the day of creation is considered to be at 5 hours and 204 halakim, or 11:11:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., in the evening of Sunday, Oct 7, 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Frank, ''Talmudic and Rabbinical Chronology: The System of Counting Years in Jewish Literature,'' (New York: Philip Feldheim, Inc., Publisher, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cycles==
In every 19 years, the solar and lunar calendars basically synchronize, with only about 2 hours of difference. Thus each 19 years is called a [[Small Mahzor]] in Jewish Talmudic Calendar, which is equivalent to the Greek [[Metonic Cycle]], although they do not start on the same year. The year of creation according to the [[Rabbinical Chronology]] (3761 BC) is taken as year 1 in the first [[Small Mahzor]]. The Greek cycle begins from an arbitrarily year, usually from the beginning of the [[Common Era]] ([[Anno Domini]]).

If every 13 [[Small Mahzor]] is called an Iggul, because 12 times 2 hours is a day, and 30 days are a month, in less than 30 Igguls a whole intercalary month should be removed.

==The Year Patterns==
The position of the years in a [[Small Mahzor]] is called the [[Golden number (time)|Golden Number]]. The pattern of the [[leap years]] will change slightly each Iggul, but the Jewish Talmudic Calendar fixd the [[leap years]] in the year with these [[golden numbers]]: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19. If we mark a [[Leap year]] as L, the Followship Year as F, and the Other common year as O, we have

Because the Julian years are 365 and a quarter days, in every 28 years the weekday pattern will repeat. This is call the Sun Cycle. The beginning of this cycle is arbitrary.

Because every 50 years is a Jubilee year, there is a Yobel Cycle; Because every seven years is a sabbatical year, there is a seven-year Release Cycle. The placement of these cycles is controversial. Historically there are enough evidences to fix the sabbatical years in the [[Second Temple Period]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Zuckermann, ''A Treatise on the Sabbatical Cycle and the Jubilee,'' trans. A. Löwy (New York: Hermon Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; But it may not match with the sabbatical cycle derived from the biblical period; and there is no consensus on whether or not the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year or the latter half of the forty ninth year.

==Hebrew Calendar==
A few suggestions were made to improve the Jewish Talmudic Calendar, in order to reduce its accumulated error for the remote past and future. One is to delay the [[leap years]] gradually so that a whole intercalary month is taken out at the end of Iggul 21; another is to adopt the [[synodic month]] to be the more accurate 29.53058868 days, thus the length of the year would be (235*13*26-1)/(19*13*26) = 365.2426 days, very close to the actual 365.2422 days of the [[tropical year]]. The result is the "Hebrew Calendar" in the program CalMaster2000.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Scheffler and P. P. Scheffler, Calmaster2000: Dates, Holidays, Astronomical Events (Pittsburgh, PA: Zephyr Services).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan María Gutiérrez''' (May 6, 1809 &amp;ndash; February 26, 1878) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] statesman, jurist, surveyor, historian, critic, and poet.

He was a major figure in Argentine liberalism and one of the most prominent promoters of Argentine culture during the 19th century. His oeuvre includes novels, [[Costumbrism|Costumbrist]] dramas, biographies, literary criticism, and scientific works.

His political career began after the fall of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1852. He represented [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] at the Argentine constitutional convention the following year. Between 1854 and 1856 he served as minister of foreign relations for the [[Argentine Confederation]]. Along with [[Esteban Echeverría]], he was one of the founders of the [[Asociación de Mayo]], an intellectual movement of the [[Rio de la Plata]] region.

Gutiérrez was also a major figure of science and technology within Argentina. He was rector of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] from 1861 until his retirement in 1874. During his tenure, numerous distinguished European professors joined the university's faculty. Along with [[Hermann Burmeister]], he launched the study of natural sciences in Argentina.
:"Fortunately I have a malleable character and always find as much promise in a book of poetry as in a book of mathematics." - Juan María Gutiérrez
:"By virtue of his heart's loftiness and his spirit's luster, Gutiérrez was a poet without compromising himself as a mathematician. This yields the precious alliance of good taste and good sense that pervades his intelligence." - Juan Bautista Alberdi

==Biography==
Gutiérrez was acquainted with letters from an early age, but did not disdain the sciences, and was especially fond of mathematics. He studied engineering as much as he did law. He earned his doctorate in jurisprudence at age 27 with the thesis ''Sobre los tres poderes públicos'' ("On the three public powers"). He was exempt from paying tuition due to his family's poor economic standing, but chose to pay his own way as a surveyor and engineer with the Topographical Department, by producing translations, and by contributing to literary journals.

He formed and presided over the ''Association of Historical Studies'' and regularly attended meetings of the ''Literary Salon'' founded by [[Marcos Sastre]]. In 1837 he delivered his lecture ''Physiognomy of Spanish learning''.

During the rule of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], Gutiérrez's support for Argentine exiles in [[Montevideo]] led to his dismissal and imprisonment. He himself moved to Uruguay in 1840 when it was discovered that he had collaborated anonymously to ''El Iniciador'', a periodical critical of Rosas. At the same time he continued to produce works as an engineer and topographer. Along with [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] and [[Esteban Echeverría]], he founded the [[Asociación de Mayo]]. In 1843 he and Alberdi traveled through the Americas and Europe. During a sojourn in [[Valparaíso]], Chile, Gutiérrez devoted himself to teaching and writing. Among his works from this period was the critically acclaimed ''América Poética''. He became the first director of the Naval Academy in Valparaíso. He published biographies translated from the French, as well as the results of his investigations of the new world.

The fall of Rosas in 1852 allowed Gutiérrez to return to Argentina, where he attended the Constitutional Convention of 1853 as a supporter of the [[San Nicolás Agreement]]. As minister of foreign relations of the [[Argentine Confederation]] under [[Justo José de Urquiza]], he contributed to the success of the [[San José de Flores Agreement]] in 1859, which reunited [[Buenos Aires]] and the provinces of the Argentine Confederation.

Gutiérrez began a career as a journalist in Buenos Aires and also served as a national deputy. President [[Bartolomé Mitre]] appointed him rector of the [[University of Buenos Aires]], in which capacity he served from 1861 to 1874.; he established the university's School of Engineering in 1866. He later attended the Constitutional Convention of Buenos Aires between 1870 and 1873.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1689">'''Kalistrate Salia''' ({{lang-ka|კალისტრატე სალია}}) (1901–1986) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] émigré historian and philologist active in [[France]].

Salia was born on July 18, 1901, in [[Mingrelia]], western Georgia. He studied at [[Zugdidi]] and [[Khashuri]] before enrolling into the [[Tbilisi State University|University of Tbilisi]] in 1920. After the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet takeover of Georgia]] in 1921, he went to [[Germany]] where he studied at the Institute of German Language, [[University of Berlin]]. He moved to [[France]] in 1924 and graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1927. In 1948, together with his wife [[Nino Salia]], he founded and edited the journal ''[[Bedi Kartlisa]]'' dedicated to the [[Kartvelian studies]]. He published a series of scholarly works on the history and literature of Georgia and wrote Georgia-related entries for foreign encyclopedias. His 1980 work ''Histoire de la nation géorgienne'' (translated into English as ''History of the Georgian Nation'' in 1983) was awarded the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

== Corporate history ==
[[File:Salon national de la Mode Lenthéric.png|thumb| A lithographic poster promoting ''soins de beauté Lenthéric'' (Paris, before 1900).]]
The  name of the company was taken from Guillaume Lenthéric, a [[French people|French]] distiller and dispenser of perfumes in late 19th century [[France]]. He operated a small salon in 245 [[rue Saint-Honoré]] in [[Paris, France]], beginning in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;“Display Ad 94 — No Title”,
''Wall Street Journal'', 7 December 1954, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm incorporated in 1924.  Lenthéric became a [[subsidiary]] of [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Squibb]], and was 90% controlled by the parent company in January 1942.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt;

In 1947 Lenthéric, Inc., experienced a decline in earnings due to higher wages, advertising expenses, and vast returns of merchandise from retail stores, which trimmed inventories.&lt;ref&gt;“Abreast of the Market”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 11 October 1947, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the company hoped to increase sales by introducing a new line of makeup called ''Sheer Beauty''. It sold for less than $5. The firm also reduced the price of ''Debo'' deodorant from $1.35 to $1.00. This was accomplished by making the product in a plastic squeeze bottle rather than a glass bottle with [[atomizer nozzle|atomizer]].&lt;ref&gt;“Perfume and Powder Purveyors, Introduce Novelties”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 24 August 1951, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squibb had manufacturing plants in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] in July 1952. It controlled the Squibb Building at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 58th Street in [[New York City]]. Squibb was acquired by the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation in the late summer of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;“Business Milestones”, ''Wall Street Journal'', 11 July 1952, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.]], of [[Chicago, Illinois]] acquired the Lentheric, Inc., division of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation in October 1956.&lt;ref name="acquires" /&gt;

In 1990, Old Bond Street, 88.5% owned by [[Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.]], purchased Lenthéric and [[Yardley of London|Yardley]] from [[SmithKline Beecham]].&lt;ref&gt;“Investor Group acquires SmithKline-Yardley,Lentheric from GlaxoSmithKline PLC through a leveraged buyout”, ''Thomson Financial Mergers &amp; Acquisitions'', 7 July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, Old Bond Street collapsed and Lenthéric was sold to Shaneel Enterprises Ltd.

Dr. Grinin is the author of more than 440 scholarly publications in Russian and English, including 30 monographs and other scholarly publications dealing with his research interests. In 2012 he was awarded with the Gold Kondratieff Medal&lt;ref&gt;[http://ikf2010.ru/comments.php?id=265_0_1_0_C The International N. D. Kondratieff Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[International N. D. Kondratiev Foundation|the International N. D. Kondratieff Foundation]].

==Major contributions==

Leonid Grinin's current research interests include  [[Big History]] and macro-evolution, [[globalization]] studies, economic cycles, the long-term trends in the cultural [[evolution]] and evolution of technologies, periodization of history, political [[anthropology]] and long-term development of the political systems, world-systems studies.

===Periodization of history===
Grinin suggests a four-staged [[periodization]] of historical process. The transition from one stage to another is the change of all basic characteristics of the respective stage. As the starting point of such a change Grinin proposes the [[Production (economics)|production]] principle that describes the major qualitative stages of the development of the world [[productive forces]]. Grinin singles out four principles of production: [[Hunter-gatherer]]; Craft-Agrarian; Industrial; and Information-Scientific. To clear up the chronology of the beginning of each respective stage he proposes the three production revolutions: the Agrarian or [[Neolithic Revolution]]; the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the Information-Scientific Revolution&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L. Production Revolutions and Periodization of History: A Comparative and Theoretic-mathematical Approach. Social Evolution &amp; History. Vol. 6, num, 2, 2007. [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future technological development===
Leonid Grinin connects major technological achievements with the Cybernetic revolution. He thinks that the technologies will develop in the direction of self-regulating systems which will penetrate many spheres starting from medicine to food production. With respect to possible dramatic changes of the human organism he argues that they may rise unprecedented ethical issues and seriously damage many vital aspects of our life including familty relations, gender, and morals &lt;ref&gt; Grinin, Leonid; Grinin, Anton L. Global Technological Perspectives in the Light of Cybernetic Revolution and Theory of Long Cycles. Journal of Globalization Studies. Volume 6, Number 2 / November 2015. [http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/396111/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of political systems===

Grinin insists that the two-stage scheme of the state macroevolution (Early State – Mature State) proposed by [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri Claessen]] and Peter Skalnik is not sufficient, and suggests that it should be modified as "Early State – Developed State – Mature State", emphasizing that the differences between developed and early states are no less pronounced than the ones between the former and the mature states.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L. Early State, Developed State, Mature State: The Statehood Evolutionary Sequence. Social Evolution &amp; History. Vol. 7, num. 1, 2008, pp. 67-81  [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/128479/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and sovereignty===
In the world political science the subject of change, ‘diffusion’, or ‘disappearing’ of national [[sovereignty]] is widely debated. Grinin argues that on the whole globalization contributes to the change and reduction of state sovereign powers, and he investigates the reasons and consequences of the deliberate voluntary reduction of sovereign prerogatives as most states voluntarily and deliberately limit the scope of their sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L. Globalization and Sovereignty: Why do States Abandon their Sovereign Prerogatives? Age of Globalization. Number 1, 2008 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/127716/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===People of celebrity===
Grinin also investigates the influence of the personal [[celebrity]] factor on the social life of modern society, analyses celebrities as a special stratum and reasons for the rapid increase in the importance of social role of personal celebrity. He argues that personal celebrity is to be added to the list of those features that determine the major forms of inequality and by analogy with [[Peter L. Berger]]'s '[[knowledge class]] people' suggests defining the stratum of people whose occupation is connected with celebrity and whose major capital is celebrity with the notion ‘people of celebrity’.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L. ‘People of celebrity’ as a new social stratum and elite. In Hierarchy and Power in the History of Civilizations: Cultural Dimensions (pp. 183–206). / Ed. by Leonid E. Grinin and Andrey V. Korotayev. Moscow: KRASAND, 2009.  [http://www.socionauki.ru/authors/grinin_l_e/publ_eng/#2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Among other things it has been suggested by Grinin to view social [[Anagenesis]]/aromorphosis as a universal / widely diffused social innovation that raises social systems’ complexity, adaptability, integrity, and interconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Grinin &amp; Andrey Korotayev. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a915173573~db=all~jumptype=rss Social Macroevolution: Growth of the World System Integrity and a System of Phase Transitions.  World Futures, Volume 65, Issue 7 October 2009 , pages 477–506].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Divergence and Great Convergence===
Together with [[Andrey Korotayev]] he has also made a significant contribution to the current [[Great Divergence]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319177793 ''Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective''] (Springer, 2015, with [[Andrey Korotayev]]).&lt;/ref&gt; As is noted by [[Jack Goldstone]], the "new view, carefully presented and rigorously modeled by Grinin and Korotayev, provides a richer and more nuanced version of the “Great Divergence,” bridging many of the differences between the traditional and California viewpoints. Yet they go further. Amazingly, by building a model utilizing human capital (education), global population growth, and regional productivity, they show how both the Great Divergence and the recent “Great Convergence” (the economic catching up of developing countries) are phases of the same process of global modernization." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sociostudies.org/upload/sociostudies.org/journal/seh/2016_2/194-200.pdf Goldstone, Jack A. "Great Divergence and Great Convergence in a Global Perspective." Social Evolution &amp; History 15.2 (2016): 197-198.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2445">'''Liberatus of Carthage''' (6th century) was an archdeacon and the author of an important history of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and [[Monophysite]] controversies in the 5th- and 6th-century [[Christian Church]].

==Life==
In 535 he was sent to Rome, as legate of a great African national synod of two hundred and seventeen bishops, to consult [[Pope Agapetus I]] (535-6) about a number of questions ([[Harduin]], II, 1154; [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]], VIII, 808). Like most north Africans he was vehemently opposed to [[Justinian]]'s edict against the [[Three Chapters Controversy|"Three Chapters"]] (544). He was frequently employed by the African bishops as their ambassador in the disputes that arose from that question. "Tired with the fatigue of traveling, and resting the mind a little from temporal cares" (according to the introduction to his book), he used his leisure to compose a summary history of the two great heresies of the preceding century. His object in writing it was avowedly to show how misjudged the emperor's condemnation of the Three Chapters was. The work is called ''Breviarium causae Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum'' ("A Short Account of the Affair of the Nestorians and Eutychians"), most often simply the ''Breviarium'' of Liberatus. 

The ''Breviarium''  begins with the ordination of [[Nestorius]] (428) and ends with the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. From the fact that the author mentions [[Patriarch Theodosius I of Alexandria]] as being still alive, it is evident that it was written before 567, the year that Theodosius died. On the other hand, Liberatus records the death of [[Pope Vigilius]] (June 555). His authorities are the ''Historia tripartita'' of [[Cassiodorus]], acts of synods, and letters of contemporary Fathers. In spite of Liberatus's controversial purpose and his indignation against Monophysites and all of those involved in the condemnation of the Three Chapters, his short history is well and fairly written. It forms an important document for the history of these movements.

The [[Churches Conservation Trust]], which was initially known as the Redundant Churches Fund, is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] whose purpose is to protect historic churches at risk, those that have been made [[redundant church|redundant]] by the [[Church of England]]. The Trust was established by the Pastoral Measure of 1968.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us.html | title = About us | accessdate = 15 October 2016| publisher = Churches Conservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legally defined object of the Trust is "the preservation, in the interests of the nation and the Church of England, of churches and parts of churches of historic and archaeological interest or architectural quality vested in the Fund&amp;nbsp;... together with their contents so vested".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = | date = | year = 1983| title = Pastoral Measure 1983:Section 44(4)| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]| pages = | page = | format = | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukcm/1983/1/section/44| accessdate =1 April 2011}} (Pastoral Measure 1983 consolidates Pastoral Measure 1968 with later legislation.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The charity cares for over 350&amp;nbsp;churches.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;  The Trust is financed partly by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] and the Church Commissioners, but grants from those bodies were frozen in 2001, since when additional funding has come from other sources, including the general public. In the 12&amp;nbsp;months ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010 the charity's income was £6,161,653, and its spending was £6,035,871.  During that year it had 44&amp;nbsp;employees, and used the services of 2,000&amp;nbsp;volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=258612&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 | title = Churches Conservation Trust| accessdate = 20 December 2010| publisher = [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charity is run by a board of trustees, who delegate the day-to-day management to a chief executive and his senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/board-of-trustees.html | title = Board of Trustees| accessdate = 15 October 2016 | publisher = Churches Conservation Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust's primary aim is to ensure that the buildings in its care are weatherproof and to prevent any deterioration in their condition.  The majority of the churches remain [[consecration|consecrated]], and many are occasionally still used for worship.  Local communities are encouraged to use them for appropriate activities and events, and the buildings provide an educational resource, allowing children and young people to study history and architecture. Nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million people visit the Trust's churches each year.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;  As most of the churches remain consecrated, they are used for occasional services where this is practical, and some are venues for concerts and other purposes.

This list contains the 62&amp;nbsp;churches cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England, covering the counties of [[Bristol]], Wiltshire, [[Somerset]], Dorset, [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | title = Find a CCT church&amp;nbsp;– South West England | accessdate = 20 October 2010 | publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219124035/http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | archivedate = 19 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority are rural village churches, often with declining populations. In one extreme case at [[Imber]] in Wiltshire, part of the [[British Army]]'s [[Salisbury Plain#Army Training Estate Salisbury Plain|training grounds]] on the [[Salisbury Plain]], the entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the [[invasion of Europe]] during the Second World War. Non-military access to the [[St Giles' Church, Imber|Church of St Giles]] has been limited to several open days a year since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11345287|title=The lost village of Imber|publisher=BBC|date=10 September 2010| accessdate = 23 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the churches are in major centres of population, such as [[St Martin's Church, Exeter|St Martin's Church]] in [[Exeter]] and the [[Church of St John the Baptist, Bristol|Church of St John the Baptist]] in Bristol. Many of the churches are built on the sites of earlier places of worship, but the oldest building in the list is the [[Old Church of St Nicholas, Uphill|Old Church of St Nicholas]] at [[Uphill]], Somerset, which is largely roofless but is still occasionally used for services. The most recent is [[St Mary's Church, South Tidworth|St Mary's Church]] in South [[Tidworth]], Wiltshire, which was built in 1878. Some of the buildings, such as [[St Mary's Church, Wilton|St Mary's Church]] in [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]], Wiltshire, are partially ruined, but many have impressive interiors, often dating back several hundred years. [[St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham|St John the Baptist Church]] in [[Inglesham]], Wiltshire, has [[mural|wall paintings]] and other churches have highly decorated [[pulpit]]s or [[reredos]]. Many still host [[Anglican]] services, but others are used by different denominations or have been converted for secular use. [[St Thomas à Becket Church, Pensford|St Thomas à Becket Church]] in [[Pensford]], Somerset, has been converted into a private house, however the tower remains in the care of the trust. [[St. Paul's Church, Bristol|St Paul's Church]] in Bristol is now used as a performance space and [[circus]] skills school, [[Circomedia]], but remains consecrated.

'''Mikhail Petrovich Pogodin''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Петро́вич Пого́дин}}; {{OldStyleDate|23 November|1800|11 November}}{{spaced ndash}}{{OldStyleDate|20 December|1875|8 December}}) was a [[Russia]]n historian and journalist who, jointly with [[Nikolay Gerasimovich Ustryalov|Nikolay Ustryalov]], dominated the national historiography between the death of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] in 1826 and the rise of [[Sergey Solovyov]] in the 1850s. He is best remembered as a staunch proponent of the [[Normanist theory]] of Russian statehood. [[Image:Портрет историка Михаила Петровича Погодина.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mikhail Pogodin.]]

Pogodin's father was a serf housekeeper of [[Count Stroganov]], and the latter ensured Mikhail's education in the [[Moscow University]]. As the story goes, Pogodin the student lived from hand to mouth, because he spent his whole stipend on purchasing new volumes of [[Nikolay Karamzin]]'s history of Russia.

Pogodin's early publications were panned by [[Mikhail Kachenovsky]], a Greek who held the university chair in Russian history. Misinterpreting [[August Ludwig von Schlözer|Schlozer]]'s novel teachings, Kachenovsky declared that "ancient Russians lived like mice or birds, they had neither money nor books" and that ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' was a crude falsification from the era of Mongol ascendency. His teachings became exceedingly popular, spawning the so-called sceptical school of imperial historiography.

In 1823, Pogodin completed his dissertation in which he debunked Kachenovsky's idea of [[Khazar]] origin of [[Rurik]]id princes. He further stirred up the controversy by proclaiming that serious scholars should not only trust but worship [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]]. The dispute ended with Kachenovsky's chair being devolved on Pogodin. In the 1830s and 1840s he augmented his reputation by publishing many volumes of obscure historical documents and the last part of [[Mikhail Shcherbatov]]'s history of Russia.

Towards the end of the 1830s, Pogodin turned his attention to journalism, where his career was likewise a slow burner. Between 1827 and 1830 he edited ''The Herald of Moscow'' with [[Alexander Pushkin]] as one of the regular contributors. Upon first meeting the great poet in 1826, Pogodin (in)famously remarked in his diary that "his mug doesn't look promising".  However, this remark is usually taken out of context as Pogodin wrote glowing reviews of Pushkin's work as early as 1820.

In 1841 Pogodin joined his old friend [[Stepan Shevyrev]] in editing ''[[Moskvityanin]]'' (The Muscovite), a periodical which came to voice [[Slavophile]] opinions. In the course of the following fifteen years of editing, Pogodin and Shevyrev steadily slid towards the most reactionary form of Slavophilism. Their journal became embroiled in a controversy with the Westernizers, led by [[Alexander Herzen]], who deplored Pogodin's "rugged, unbroomed style, his rough manner of jotting down cropped notes and unchewed thoughts".

Pogodin's main focus during the last segment of his scholarly career was on fending off [[Nikolay Kostomarov|Kostomarov]]'s attacks against the [[Normanist theory]]. By that period, he championed the [[pan-Slavic]] idea of uniting [[Western Slavs]] under the aegis of the tsars and even visited [[Prague]] to discuss his plans with [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] and [[František Palacký]]. In the 1870s he was again pitted against a leading historian, this time [[Dmitry Ilovaisky]], who advocated an [[Iran]]ian origin of the earliest East Slavic rulers.

His grandson Mikhail Ivanovich Pogodin (1884–1969) was a museologist.

'''Museum of the City of Athens''' Vouros - Eutaxias is a [[museum]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It houses a collection of a variety of Athens-related items collected by art collector Lambros Eutaxias (1905-1996). It includes antiquities, Byzantine art, sculptures, paintings, drawings, photographs and metal, glass and textile works. Also it includes furniture arranged in typical living rooms of the Athenian aristocracy of the 19th century.

This building was the first royal palace of Greece under the reign of King [[Otto of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;John Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellenes: The Greek Kings 1863–1974 (Sutton Publishing, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

NISP counts each bone and fragment as one unit.

NISP can often be an overestimate of the actual number of individuals at the site, especially when preservation is good but bones are highly fragmented.  Multiple fragments of the same bone lead to it being counted multiple times.  However, too much fragmentation can lead to an inability to identify a bone as a particular type in the first place.  At many sites with poor preservation the total NISP severely underestimates the total possible number of individuals that contributed to the assemblage.  Some paleoindian sites, which often exhibit poor organic preservation, are a case in point. However, this and some other problems can be corrected analytically.

A more serious problem is the one of interdependence. There is generally no reliable way to determine if individually counted specimens originated from the same organism on the ancient landscape and are therefore interdependent. Since dependence is generally possible, NISP consistently overestimates, and to some unmeasurable extent, the actual number of individual animals represented in a recovered assemblage.

An alternative estimate to NISP, often done in concert, is [[minimum number of individuals]] (MNI).  Both are influenced by fragmentation and limited preservation, but in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, F. &amp; Pilgram, T. (1993) NISP vs. MNI in Quantification of Body-Part Representation. ''American Antiquity'', 58(2), 261-269.&lt;/ref&gt;  NISP tends to overestimate the number of individuals under moderate fragmentation, but the overestimate lessens as fragmentation increases due to the inability to classify the bones.  MNI tends to underestimate the actual number under medium fragmentation, and even more severely when bones are highly fragmented.  Under hypothetically perfect preservation and no fragmentation, these estimates should be the same. MNI also suffers from the aggregation problem, in which different aggregations will generate at least two values, a MNI minimum and maximum, which are generally empirically indistinguishable. Both NISP and MNI are likely only ordinals scale measurements, which means at best they can only give an ordered series of taxonomic abundance, i.e. "Taxon A is more numerous than Taxon B."

NISP should not be used when calculating a sample size for inferential statistics, because it will inflate the statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall &amp; Pilgram (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in these situations [[Minimum Number of Individuals|MNI]] should be used instead.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}

'''Ogboni''' (also known as '''Osugbo''' in [[Ijèbú]]) is a [[fraternal institution]] indigenous to the [[Yoruba language]]-speaking polities of  [[Nigeria]], [[Republic of Bénin]] and [[Togo]], as well as among the [[Edo people]]. A similar group in [[Igbo language|Igbo]]-speaking areas is called [[Nze na Ozo]]. The society performs a range of political and religious functions, including exercising a profound influence on [[monarch]]s and serving as [[Supreme court|high court]]s of [[jurisprudence]] in [[capital offense]]s. 

Its members are generally considered to constitute the [[nobility]] of the various [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdoms of [[West Africa]].

==The Iwarefa==
Each Ogboni lodge is led by a group of six principal officers that are collectively known as the ''Iwarefa'' ( lit. "The Six Wise Men"). These individuals are the most powerful figures in the [[polity]] that the lodge serves and are the inner council of advisors to its [[king]] or [[viceroy]]al [[chieftain]].

==Influence==
Though versions of this fraternal group are found among the various types of [[Yoruba (people)|Yoruba]] states – from highly centralized [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s like [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], to the independent towns and villages of the [[Ègbá]] and the [[Ekiti State|Èkiti]] – the Ogboni are recognizable for their veneration of the personified earth (Ilè or Oduduwa) and their emphasis on both gerontocratic authority and benevolent service to the community. While membership in the Ogboni generally signified a high level of power and prestige, the society held pre-eminent political authority among decentralized groups like the Ègbá, where they were intimately involved in the selection of rulers that served as little other than figureheads in practice. In contemporary [[Yorubaland]], Ogboni members still command great power and influence in the affairs of their societies, although this is largely due to the history of their respective [[chieftain]]cies and not to any official authority.

Ogboni lodges were one of the main commissioners of brass [[jewelry]] and sculpture in pre-colonial Yorubaland, using the metal's [[rust]]-resistant qualities as an apt [[metaphor]] for the [[Immortality|immortal]] functions and beliefs of Ogboni adepts. The most recognizable of these symbols was a pair of Ogboni initiates, one male and one female, attached by a chain and worn around the neck. The pair are thought to symbolize the attachment of the sexes in procreation and balanced society. Generally, one or both figures will hold a thumb in the grip of the opposite hand, demonstrating the paramount Ogboni [[handsign]] denoting initiation and membership.

==Legacy==
A number of fraternities in Nigeria have incorporated references and insignia from the original Ogboni, including the Reformed Ogboni Fraternity, the Indigenous Ogboni, and various others. Many of these contemporary societies combine elements of Ogboni’s historical functions with superficially similar institutions like [[Freemasonry]] and the [[Rotary Club]].

Similar traditional institutions combining political, judicial, and sacred duties exist among the various ethnic nationalities of southern [[Nigeria]], including [[Nze na Ozo]] in [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-speaking southeast Nigeria and [[Ekpe|Ekpe/Ngbe/Ugbe]] in the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] region of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern [[Cameroon]]. Initiatory [[secret societies]] are a common feature of pre-colonial government across much of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].

'''Olof Melin''' (''Olof Werling Melin'') (b. 3 August 1861, [[Göteborg]], Sweden&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbr/0039.html Nordisk Familjebok Uggleupplagan. 18.], pp. 45–6&lt;/ref&gt; – d. 15 January 1940, [[Stockholm]], Sweden) was a Swedish [[colonel]] and the creator of [[Melin Shorthand]], the dominant shorthand system in Sweden.

== Biography ==
Melin taught the [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] system in the Swedish army. Being dissatisfied with it, he created an alternative system subsequently called [[Melin Shorthand]]. This system quickly became the dominant shorthand system in Sweden.

Olof Melin also published several books. The most notable among them are ''Stenografiens histora, första delen'' and ''Stenografiens historia, andra delen'' (''The history of shorthand – Part I and Part II''), which can be regarded as his [[masterpiece|Magnum Opus]]. In these two books Melin described the history of shorthand from the ancient Greece to modern times.

[[Image:PavleIngorokva.jpg|thumb|Pavle Ingorokva]]

'''Pavle Ingorokva''' ([[Georgian alphabet|Georgian:]] პავლე ინგოროყვა) (January 1, 1893 in [[Poti]] &amp;ndash; November 20, 1983 in [[Tbilisi]]) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[historian]], [[Philology|philologist]], and public benefactor.

He graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of St. Petersburg]] (1916). In 1917 he was one of the founders of the [[Union of Georgian Writers]]. In 1917-1919 he was a member of the "National Council of Georgia". On May 26, 1918 Ingorokva signed the "Act of Independence of Georgia". In 1921 he protested the occupation of Georgia by the Bolshevist Russia, in 1921-1923 Ingorokva was a member of the group "Shavchokhianebi" ("Blackchokhians"). In 1924-1925, he was the [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] of the Georgian scientific and literary Journal [[Kavkasioni]] ("The Caucasus"). The Journal was closed by the Bolshevik regime.

In 1925 Ingorokva founded the Publishing House "Kartuli Tsigni" ("The Georgian Book"). This Publishing House published works of [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] in the XI volumes (1926-1928) and works of other outstanding Georgian authors. In 1933 "Kartuli Tsigni" was closed.

In 1929-1940 Ingorokva was a Head of the Department of Manuscripts of the State Museum of Georgia (now the [[Georgian National Museum]]), in 1940-1950 a senior research fellow of the [[Institute of History]] ([[Tbilisi]]). In 1958 he was one of the founders of the Institute of Manuscripts (now the [[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]]). He was also a member of the Commission on Study of ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] (GAS) (now [[Georgian National Academy of Sciences]]).

Pavle Ingorokva's main fields of the scientific activity were the history of the Georgian literature, history of Georgia, source studies of the history of Georgia, Rustavelology (Study of the works of the mediaeval Georgian writer [[Shota Rustaveli]]), history of Georgian script, etc. Some of his findings have proved extremely contentious and most western scholars dispute them, claiming his work is biased from an [[ethno-nationalistic]] perspective; this is especially in regard to his discussion of the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Georgians and [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], and the age of the [[Georgian alphabet]]. A discussion of Ingoroqva’s work can be found in Bruno Coppieters, “In Defence of the Homeland: Intellectuals and the Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict” in Secession, History and the Social Sciences, ed. by Bruno Coppieters and Michel Huysseune, ('''VUB'''Press, 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;93-94.

The '''Sankey Canal''' in [[North West England]] connects [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] to the [[River Mersey]] at [[Spike Island (Cheshire)|Spike Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|53.4458|-2.6448|region:GB_scale:10000}}&lt;/ref&gt; When opened in 1757, it followed the valley of the Sankey Brook from where the brook joined the [[River Mersey]] past [[Warrington]] to [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]] at the north east of what became St Helens town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History, Opening of the canal|url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/sankey/sa2.htm|accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|53.3512|-2.7303|region:GB_scale:5000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions were constructed at the Mersey end to Fiddlers Ferry and then to Widnes, while at the northern end it was extended to [[Sutton, St Helens|Sutton]]. The canal was abandoned between 1931 and 1963 but has been the object of a restoration attempt since 1985 when the Sankey Canal Restoration Society was formed.

==History==
The Sankey Canal was built principally to transport [[coal]] from [[Haydock Collieries]] and Parr to the growing chemical industries of Liverpool, although [[iron ore]] and corn were important cargoes. The industries rapidly expanded, and spread along the line of the canal to St Helens, [[Haydock]], [[Newton le Willows]] and Widnes, which were small villages until this period. The canal was an important factor in the industrial growth of the region.

The line of the canal was surveyed by [[Henry Berry]] and William Taylor, for which they charged £66. Berry, who had previously worked with [[Thomas Steers]], [[Liverpool]]’s first dock engineer, on the [[Newry Canal]] in [[Northern Ireland]], was Liverpool’s second dock engineer, but was appointed engineer for the navigation when the promoters convinced the Dock Trustees to release him for two days a week. It is not known whether Berry or the promoters presented the plans to parliament as an upgrade to the river navigation, despite  building it as a true canal, but it is thought to be the only time a canal was authorised by parliament without anyone petitioning against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Act of Parliament]] authorising the construction of the navigation was passed on 20 March 1755, and was entitled ''An Act for making navigable the River or Brook called Sankey Brook, and Three several Branches thereof from the River Mersey below Sankey Bridges, up to Boardman's Stone Bridge on the South Branch, to Gerrard's Bridge on the Middle Branch, and to Penny Bridge on the North Branch, all in the county palatine of Lancaster.''&lt;ref name=priestley558&gt;{{harvnb |Priestley |1831|p=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal was open and carrying coal by 1757;&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |1998 |pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; carriage of all goods was charged at a flat rate of 10d (ten ''old'' pence &amp;ndash; £0.04) per [[long ton|ton]].&lt;ref name=priestley558/&gt;

As the title of the Act states, in addition to the mainline between the Mersey and Parr, three branches were built to nearby collieries: the South Branch to Boardman's Stone Bridge, Parr; the Middle Branch to Gerrard's Bridge; and the North Branch to Penny Bridge.

A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 8 April 1762, amending the earlier act, and was entitled ''An Act to amend and render more effectual, an Act made in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Reign of his late Majesty King George the Second, for making navigable Sankey Brook, in the county of Lancaster, and for the extending and improving the said Navigation''. This authorised the extension of the navigation to Fiddler's Ferry on the River Mersey, and to take an additional toll of two-pence per ton, making the rate one shilling (£0.05) per ton.&lt;ref name=priestley559&gt;{{harvnb |Priestley |1831|p=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line of this extension was surveyed by John Eyes, who acted as principal witness to see the bill through parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early trial of steam power took place&lt;ref name=priestley559/&gt; on 16 June 1797, when, according to the ''Billing's Liverpool Advertiser'', dated 26 June, John Smith's "vessel heavily laden with copper slag, passed along the Sankey Canal ... by the application of steam only ... it appears, that the vessel after a course of 10 miles [16 km], returned the same evening to St Helens whence it had set out". The boat was powered by a [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen engine]] working a paddle crankshaft through a beam and connecting rod.

To counter competition from the new railways, another extension was planned from Fiddler's Ferry across Cuerdley and [[Widnes]] Salt Marshes to Widnes Wharf, on the west bank of the River Mersey near Runcorn Gap, creating a second connection to the Mersey and another basin. This was authorised by a third Act of Parliament, granted on 29 May 1830, entitled ''An Act to consolidate and amend the Acts relating to the Sankey Brook Navigation, in the county of Lancaster; and to make a New Canal from the said Navigation at Fidler's Ferry, to communicate with the River Mersey at Widness Wharf, near West Bank, in the township of Widnes, in the said county,' repeals the former acts of the 28th George II. and 2nd George III. and incorporates the proprietors under the title of "The Company of Proprietors of the Sankey Brook Navigation."''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Priestley |1831|pp=559–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Giles]] was appointed engineer for this extension, which opened in 1833. In 1825 Giles, who was a pupil of [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] and involved in many canal projects of the period, had proposed a link from the Sankey, via an aqueduct across the Mersey, to the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, but this was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sankey viaduct.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Sankey Viaduct]]]]

The Sankey Canal was built for [[Mersey Flat]]s, the common sailing craft of the local rivers; they were used on the Mersey, [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[River Weaver|Weaver]] and along the Lancashire and [[North Wales]] coasts. To allow for the masts of the flats, [[swing bridges]] were constructed where roads crossed the canal. When the railways were built, they too had to cross in similar fashion. The exception was at [[Earlestown]], where [[George Stephenson]] erected the [[Sankey Viaduct]] for the [[Liverpool and  Manchester Railway]], leaving {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} headroom for the flats' sails. It is unclear how the flats' masts were accommodated at Great Sankey, where the Liverpool–Warrington–Manchester line built by the Cheshire Lines Committee in 1873 crosses the Sankey on a 12-arch viaduct less than twenty feet above the water level of the canal.

In 1877, it was reportedly the case that, due to the pollution of a local [[Leblanc process|Leblanc alkali works]], "The mud deposited in the Sankey Brook, near St Helens, has been found to contain ''no less than 2.26 percent of [[arsenic]]''...The water of the Sankey Brook is so acid that iron fittings cannot safely be used in the barges and lock gates."&lt;ref name="Pollution-1877"&gt;{{harvnb|Higgins|1877|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, by 1891, {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of nearby [[Widnes]] and [[Ditton, Cheshire|Ditton Marshes]] were buried under an average depth of {{convert|12|ft|m}} of toxic [[Leblanc process#Pollution issues|galligu]] from alkali operations near the Sankey Canal. The galligu detritus was estimated at 10 million tonnes in total weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contaminated Land: Galligu|url=http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/environmentalhealth/contaminatedland/galligu/?a=5441|accessdate=2009-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009223526/http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/environmentalhealth/contaminatedland/galligu?a=5441|archivedate=9 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown what level of pollution exists in said brook as of 2009, though [[Leblanc process#Pollution issues|galligu]], [[alkali|soap]] and [[soda ash|ash]] waste have been reported in the vicinity. In the present, discoveries of arsenic, lead and mercury have been found as common contaminants in the soil of local gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenic, lead and mercury is in gardens|url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2004/11/18/140109.html|publisher=This Is Cheshire|date=2004-11-18|accessdate=2009-05-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On top of this, St Michael’s Golf Course, a municipal golf course in nearby Widnes built atop "30 hectares of land from old chemical waste tips", was forced to close due to high levels of [[arsenic]] found in the soil, that created a public hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contaminated Land: St Michael's Golf Course|url=http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/environmentalhealth/contaminatedland/stmichealsgolfcourse/?a=5441|accessdate=2009-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009223645/http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/environment/environmentalhealth/contaminatedland/stmichealsgolfcourse?a=5441|archivedate=9 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==

A staircase [[Canal lock|lock]] was built on the Sankey Canal and a second staircase was built later when the Ravenhead Branch was constructed in 1775. They are known respectively as the Old Double Lock and the New Double Lock. The latter was restored by St Helens Borough Council&lt;ref name=jane2009&gt;{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992, although it has no navigable waterway either above or below it.

==Operation==

Built primarily to take coal from [[Haydock]] and [[Parr, St Helens|Parr]] down to the Mersey and so on to the saltfields of Cheshire and Liverpool, the final traffic on the Sankey Canal was very different, and in the opposite direction, consisting of raw sugar for the Sankey Sugar Works at Earlestown, [[Newton-le-Willows]], from Liverpool.
[[File:St Helen's Canal &amp; Railway Company.JPG|thumb|right|The seal of St Helens Canal and Railway Company]]
The canal’s immediate commercial success, followed soon after by that of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], led to a mania of canal building, and for further extension schemes to be proposed for the Sankey Canal. Francis Giles' proposal to link the canal to the Bridgwater Canal was not implemented, and neither was a plan to link the canal to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] near [[Leigh (Greater Manchester)|Leigh]], to the North-East. Apart from the early extension to Fiddlers Ferry, which provided better access to the River Mersey, and the 1775 extension to St Helens, the only major change came with the extension to Widnes in the 1830s.

In 1845 the [[St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway|St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway Company]] and the then more prosperous Canal Company merged to form the St Helens Canal and Railway Company.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt; Its occasionally used name is the St Helens Canal.

==Decline==
The ending of the sugar traffic in 1959 led to the closure of the canal in 1963.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt; North of the sugar works, closure had taken place in 1931,&lt;ref name=jane/&gt; and fixed bridges quickly replaced the old wooden swing bridges. The canal, however, remains largely in water right up into the centre of St Helens, although its terminus had been truncated in 1898, when Canal Street was built over it.

==Restoration==
Restoration of the canal began in 1980, when work began on the section between Bewsey and Liverpool Road, Great Sankey, funded by a Derelict Land Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Squires |2008 |p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the canal is still in water and much has been restored to navigable standard, with short sections at Fiddlers Ferry, Warrington and Spike Island, Widnes having locks into the Mersey which have allowed craft access to the canal for mooring since the locks were restored in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=jane2009/&gt; However, fixed bridges which replaced the original wooden swing bridges and other obstructions isolate the sections from one another. The route of the canal passes through the [[Sankey Valley Park]] and the towpath from Sankey Bridges to Widnes now forms part of the [[Trans Pennine Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/template.asp?ID=482&amp;parentID=478 Places on the Trail West] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913210516/http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/template.asp?ID=482&amp;parentID=478 |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to restore the canal, and to extend it to join the main canal system via the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The total cost of this would be in excess of £100m and it is therefore a long-term project. There are, however, plans to dig out an infilled section in the centre of St Helens as part of the town's Eastside development. A feasibility study for this work was funded by a grant from the Single Regeneration Budget Fund, while at the other end of the canal, the Widnes Waterfront plan, published by Halton Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Squires |2008 |pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the proposed new Mersey crossing between Widnes and Runcorn are expected to lead to further restoration at Widnes.

The section of the Sankey Canal running from St Helens to [[Newton le Willows]] is expected to be the most difficult to restore, and is likely to involve the laying of a complete new canal bed. Work on the new canal was due to begin in 2009.{{update inline|date=March 2012}}

'''Sheldon Garon''' is a [[Princeton University]] professor who has been described as "the world's leading historian on household saving." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Our-Means-America-Spends/dp/0691135991|title=Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the World Saves|first=Sheldon|last=Garon|date=20 November 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of both the Princeton history department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/history/people/display_person.xml?netid=garon|title=Department of History|website=www.princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and East Asian studies department. His field of interest centers on modern Japan, and particularly the relationship between state and society.

Born and brought up in Minnesota, he graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1973 and received a master's degree in [[East Asia|East Asian]] studies from [[Harvard]] in 1975, followed by a doctorate in history from [[Yale]] in 1981.  His first book, ''The State and Labor in Modern Japan,'' traced the history of the Japanese labor movement. In 1997, he published ''Molding Japanese Minds: The State in Everyday Life'', an account of the Japanese state’s success at mobilizing its people to act in the perceived interest of the nation in.

In  ''Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends and the World Saves'' (2011), he argues that the current savings imbalances between the United States and other developed nations are not the result merely of different individual choices. ''Beyond Our Means'' tells for the first time how other nations aggressively encouraged their citizens&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; to save by means of special savings institutions and savings campaigns. The U.S. government, meanwhile, promoted mass consumption and reliance on credit through policies such as tax breaks on borrowing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/05/143149947/why-americans-spend-too-much|title=Why Americans Spend Too Much, Save Too Little|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in the global credit crunch.

'''Siyadi House''', also known as Bayt Siyadi (Arabic: بيت سيادي) is a [[historic building]] in [[Muharraq]] City, [[Kingdom of Bahrain]]. It is part of a larger complex of buildings constructed for the pearl [[merchant]] Abdullah bin Isa Siyadi, which further includes a [[Bahrain_pearling_trail#Description|mosque]] and a [[majlis]]. While the Siyadi House was built under Ahmad bin Jassim Siyadi, the construction of the Siyadi Majlis was initiated by Ahmad bin Jassim Siyadi and the Siyadi Mosque was a shared initiative of Isa and Jassim bin Ahmad Siyadi.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Culture and Information: ''Pearling, Testimony of an island economy'', 2010, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a part of the [[Bahrain pearling trail]], the second [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the country.

==History==
The Siyadi family arrived to Bahrain in the early 19th century and settled close to the rulers’ houses in the Sh. Abdallah neighbourhood. The family's wealth originated from their involvement in the pearl trade, which blossomed in Muharraq in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Culture and Information: ''Pearling, Testimony of an island economy'', 2010, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The oldest part of the complex is Siyadi Mosque, which Isa and Jassim bin Yousif Siyadi donated to the Muharraq community in 1865. The original building was later revised and, according to Yarwood, the preserved structure dates to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;John Yarwood: ''Al-Muharraq: Architectural Heritage of a Bahraini City'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Siyadi Mosque is the oldest preserved mosque in Muharraq and is still used for [[daily prayers]].

Siyadi Majlis was constructed in two phases; the first phase initiated by Jassim bin Yousif Siyadi in 1850, which covered the ground floor and the upper-storey rooms constructed during the second phase in 1921. The largest part of the complex, Siyadi House is still used as a [[private residence]] and is inhabited by Abdallah bin Hassan Siyadi, the grandson of the builder Abdallah bin Isa Siyadi. It is not open to accessible to public and cannot be visited. The 450 square meters residence was the last construction and is dated to 1931.

The three buildings illustrate elaborate decorations of the late [[Pearl hunting|pearling]] era of Bahrain, in particular Siyadi Majlis has an inside room worth visiting.&lt;ref&gt;John Falagan: ''We're all men here'', 2007, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; At present the Siyadi Majlis is under the responsibility of the [[Culture minister|Ministry of Culture, Bahrain]].

The '''Society for Classical Studies''' ('''SCS'''), formerly known as the '''American Philological Association''' ('''APA'''), founded in 1869, is a non-profit North American scholarly organization devoted to all aspects of [[History of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization. It is the preeminent association in the field, and publishes a journal, ''[[Transactions of the American Philological Association]]'' (TAPA). 
The APA is currently based at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in [[Philadelphia]].

==History==
The APA was inaugurated by [[William D. Whitney]], of [[Yale University|Yale]], at [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], in 1869 as an outgrowth of the Classical Section of the [[Oriental Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://classicalstudies.org/about-scs/scs-glance|title=SCS at a Glance|publisher=Society for Classical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally its members studied a great variety of texts and languages, but as disciplines such as [[linguistics]] and modern languages have created their own societies, the APA came to be concerned with classical antiquity and fields closely related to the study of antiquity, while the definition of "philology" broadened to include many approaches to understanding the ancient world.

==Convention==
The Society holds its annual convention in January, meeting jointly with the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. About 400 scholarly papers are delivered at the Society's meeting, which is also the site for interviewing for college and university positions and for the meetings of the many committees and affiliated groups. It is also the occasion for the presentation of Society awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://classicalstudies.org/awards-fellowships|title=Awards &amp; Fellowships|publisher=Society for Classical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; for teaching at both pre-collegiate and collegiate level, for projects that bring classics to a wider public (outreach), and of the Goodwin Award of Merit, which recognizes a recently published book.

At every meeting, an Outreach Division conducts two events that are open to the general public. One is a special panel that is of interest to non-specialists. Topics have included the movie ''Troy'', Classics and Contemporary Fiction and the [[HBO]] series ''Rome'' and Classics and Comics. The second is the staged reading of a classical or classically themed play, by the Committee on Ancient and Modern Performance. The productions have been: ''[[The Invention of Love]]'' ([[Tom Stoppard]], directed by Mary-Kay Gamel, produced by [[Judith Hallett]]), ''The Heavensgate Deposition'' (based on ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' by [[Seneca the Younger]], adapted by Douglass Parker, directed by Amy R. Cohen, produced by Thomas Jenkins), ''The Golden Age'' (by [[Thomas Heywood]], directed by C. W. Marshall), ''Iran Man'' (based on ''Persa'' by [[Plautus]], directed by Mary-Kay Gamel), ''[[Thespis]]'' (by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[A. S. Sullivan]], with new music by Alan Riley Jones, directed by John Starks, produced by John Given), ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' (by [[Aristophanes]], directed by Thomas Talboy), ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'' (by [[Euripides]], directed by Laura Lippman and Mike Lippman), ''[[Thersites]]'' (perhaps by [[Nicholas Udall]], directed by C. W. Marshall), ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' (by [[Aristophanes]], directed by Bella Vivante), ''The Jurymen'' (by Katherine Janson, directed by Amy R. Cohen) and ''[[Alcestis]]'' (by [[Euripides]], translated by Mary-Kay Gamel, directed by Gamel and Mark Damen).

==Activities==
Through its divisions of Research, Education, Publications, Professional Matters, and Program, the Society conducts a variety of activities to support and disseminate knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. For example, it operates a Placement Service, gathers statistical information about the demographics of classicists, hears complaints of violations of professional ethics, provides advice and funding for major research projects (such as the [[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]]), and publishes monographs, textbooks and software. The Outreach Division produces a newsletter, ''Amphora,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://classicalstudies.org/outreach/amphora-blog|title=Amphora Articles|publisher=Society for Classical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; for non-specialists, and the electronic newsletter ''The Dionysiac,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://classicalstudies.org/about/vp-report/outreach-summer-2013|title=Outreach - Summer 2013|author=Adam Blistein|date=2013-11-21|publisher=Society for Classical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives information about performances of classical plays and other events related to ancient performance.

==Scholars==

'''Stephanus Brodericus''' ({{lang-hr|Stjepan Brodarić}}; {{lang-hu|Brodarics István}}; c. 1480 – 17 November 1539&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=9633 | title=Brodarić, Stjepan | language=hr | encyclopedia=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] | accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Croatia]]n–[[Hungary|Hungarian]] bishop, diplomat, chancellor and humanist writer. He started his studies in [[Pécs]] and continued at the universities of [[Bologna]] and [[Padua]], receiving his Doctorate in Canon Law in 1506.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stephanus Brodericus - Epistulae|last=Kasza|first=Péter|publisher=Argumentum|year=2012|isbn=|volume=Bibliotheca Scriptorum Medii Recentisque Aevorum, Series Nova XIV.|location=Budapest|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Hungary at the age of 35-36 he worked in Esztergom, then got into the chancellery of [[Szatmár County|Szatmár]] as a secretary in 1508. Brodericus participated in the coronation of the two-year-old [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] in 4 June.

In 1517 he was appointed canon to the bishop of [[Pécs]], received a diploma from Louis II that extended his crests, and shortly afterwards Brodericus was made head [[prelate]] of Pécs. The Hungarian-Croatian bishop spent most of his time in the chancellery: the most important organ of the Hungarian internal and foreign affairs. He mostly dealt with issues concerning forign affairs. His series of diplomatic tasks began in 1521, which only ended with his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fejezetek a XVI-XVII. századi magyarországi történetírás történetéből|last=Bartoniek|first=Emma|publisher=Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Irodalomtudományi Intézete|year=1975|isbn=|location=Budapest|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1521 he became secretary to the king, in 1524 [[Cantor (church)|dean cantor]] at the [[Esztergom Basilica]]. He also served as the king's chancellor and the bishop of [[Srijem]]. King [[János Szapolyai]] nominated Brodericus as [[Bishop of Pécs]] in 1536; he became [[Bishop of Vác]] in 1538 and served there until his death in 1539.

Brodericus participated in several diplomatic missions and wrote an account of the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]] in his 1568 book ''Clades in campo Mohacz''. Eight editions of the book were eventually published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/english/books/latinists.htm|title=Latin as a literary language among the Croats|publisher=Hrvatski Informativni Centar|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheAllegoryOfLove.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Clarendon Press]])]]
'''''The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition''''' ([[1936 in literature|1936]]), by [[C. S. Lewis]] ({{ISBN|0192812203}}), is an  exploration of the [[Allegory|allegorical]] treatment of love in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], which was released on May 21, 1936.

In the first chapter, Lewis traces the development of the idea of [[courtly love]] from the Provençal [[troubadour]]s to its full development in the works of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]. It is here that he sets forth a famous characterization of "the peculiar form which it [courtly love] first took; the four marks of Humility, Courtesy, Adultery, and the Religion of Love"—the last two of which "marks" have, in particular, been the subject of a good deal of controversy among later scholars. In the second chapter, Lewis discusses the medieval evolution of the allegorical tradition in such writers as [[Bernard Silvestris]] and [[Alain de Lille]].

The remaining chapters, drawing on the points made in the first two, examine the use of allegory in the depiction of love in a selection of poetic works, beginning with the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''. The focus, however, is on English works: the poems of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[John Gower|Gower's]] ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' and [[Thomas Usk|Usk's]] ''Testament of Love'', the works of Chaucer's epigones, and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser's]] ''[[The Faerie Queene|Faerie Queene]]''.

The book is ornamented with quotations from poems in many languages, including [[Classical Latin|Classical]] and [[Medieval Latin]], [[Middle English]], and [[Old French]].  The piquant English translations of many of these are Lewis's own work.

In a diagram from the book ''The Automated Society'',&lt;ref&gt; Bloomfield, Masse, ''The Automated Society'', Masefield Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield defines the history of humanity beginning over two million years ago and ending over a hundred thousand years in the future. The diagram is base on biological [[punctuated equilibrium]] and a parallel [[cultural evolution]]. The predictions of the [[future]] follow what has happened in the past.

The diagram of [[history]] shows humanity having long periods of stability interrupted with short periods of transition. Humanity is currently experiencing one of those short periods of transition, from a stable agricultural period going through a transitional [[industrial society]] leading to a stable automated period. [[Productivity]] is the key to the transition; when it is impossible to increase productivity, humanity will have arrived at the automated society.

Before humanity enters the automated society, we will suffer from two near term trends. One trend is the relentlessly increasing number of human beings. The second is the relentlessly decreasing number of jobs. Jobs will be eliminated by substituting men with machines. An example of this is agriculture where once in the peasant society there were ninety percent of the people working as farmers. With the introduction of tractors, only three percent of Americans work on the farm.

Once the problems of the lack of jobs, increased [[pollution]] and fewer natural resources are solved and the food factory put in operation, there should be a reconciliation of man to [[automation]]. In the automated society, men will live in affluence along with a total control of [[population]]. The one place where man will have an unlimited future will be in space. [[Space]] can provide for an unlimited increase in population and potentially the introduction of new human biological species.

This '''timeline of modern American conservatism''' lists important events, developments, and occurrences which have significantly affected [[conservatism in the United States]]. With the decline of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party after 1960, the movement is most closely associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP). [[Fiscal conservatism|Economic conservatives]] favor less government regulation, lower taxes, and weaker labor unions, while [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] focus on moral issues and neoconservatives focus on democracy worldwide. Conservatives generally distrust the United Nations (UN) and Europe and, apart from the [[Libertarian Republican|libertarian wing]], favor a strong military and give enthusiastic support to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Thomas (2007). ''American policy toward Israel: the power and limits of beliefs.'' Routledge. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conservatism has much older roots in American history, the modern movement began to gel in the mid–1930s when intellectuals and politicians collaborated with businessmen to oppose the liberalism of the [[New Deal]], led by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR), newly energized [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]], and big city Democratic machines. After World War II that coalition gained strength from new philosophers and writers who developed an intellectual rationale for conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt (2009). ''The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History.'' Yale University Press. ch 1–6 covers the story down to 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nixon's victory in the 1968 presidential election is often considered a realigning election in American politics. From 1932 to 1968, the Democratic Party was obviously the majority party. During that time period, the Democrats had won seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda gravely affected that undertaken by the Republican Eisenhower administration. The election of 1968 reversed the situation completely. The Vietnam war split the Democratic Party. White ethnics in the North and white Southerners felt the national Democratic Party had deserted them. The white South has voted Republican at the presidential level since the mid-1960s, and at the state and local level since the 1990s.

In the 1980s President [[Ronald Reagan]] solidified conservative Republican strength with [[tax cuts]], greatly increased [[Military budget of the United States|defense spending]], [[deregulation]], a policy of [[Reagan Doctrine|rolling back communism]] (rather than just containing it), a greatly strengthened military, and appeals to [[family values]] and conservative Judeo-Christian morality. His impact has led historians to call the 1980s the "[[Reagan Era]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974–2008.''

In recent years social issues such as abortion, gun control, and [[Same-sex marriage|gay marriage]] have become important. Since 2009 the [[Tea Party Movement]] has energized conservatives at the local level against the policies made by the [[presidency of Barack Obama]], leading to a Republican landslide in 2010 and again in 2014, eventually culminating in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Republican Donald Trump as president in 2016]].

===1930s===
As the nation plunges into its [[Great Depression in the United States|deepest depression ever]], Republicans and conservatives fall into disfavor in 1930, 1932, and 1934, losing more and more of their seats. Liberals (mostly Democrats with a few Republicans and independents) come to power with the [[United States presidential election, 1932|landslide 1932 election]] of liberal Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his first 100 days Roosevelt pushes through a series of dramatic economic programs known as the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Badger (2009). ''FDR: the first hundred days''. Hilland Wang. pp. 3–22, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major metropolitan newspapers generally opposed the New Deal, as typified by [[William Randolph Hearst]] and his chain (Hearst had supported FDR in 1932 but parted ways in 1934.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham J. White|title=FDR and the Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2_HXgc4u_4C&amp;pg=PA51|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=51–52|isbn=978-0226895123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert R. McCormick]], owner of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', compared the New Deal to communism. He was also an [[America First Committee|America First]] [[isolationist]] who strongly opposed entering World War II to rescue the [[British Empire]]. McCormick also railed against the [[League of Nations]], the [[World Court]], socialism and communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Norton Smith|title=The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert R.

* Opposition to New Deal policies first takes shape as the [[American Liberty League]].

* The liberal [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and more leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) labor federations are both growing and both support FDR. Their bitter feud over jurisdiction, however, produces numerous strikes, angers public opinion and weakens their political power.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Galenson (1960). ''The CIO challenge to the AFL.'' Harvard University Press. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;
;1938
* Opponents of conservatism weaken sharply. FDR's allies in the AFL and CIO battle each other; his court-packing plan is rejected; his attempt to purge the conservatives from the Democratic Party fails and strengthens them; the sharp [[recession of 1937–1938]] discredits his argument that New Deal policies would lead to full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leuchtenburg (1963). ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal: 1932–1940.'' HarperCollins. pp. 231–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not an activist but his ideas have been influential.&lt;ref&gt;John P.

[[File:RobertATaft.jpg|thumb|140px|alt=photograph of|Robert A. Taft]]
* As Republican senator from Ohio (1939–53), [[Robert A. Taft]] leads the conservative opposition to liberal policies (apart from public housing and aid to education, which he supported). Taft opposed most of the New Deal, entry into World War II, NATO, and sending troops to the [[Korean War]]. He was not so much an "isolationist" as a staunch opponent of the ever-expanding powers of the White House. The growth of this power, Taft feared, would lead to dictatorship or at least spoil American democracy, [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and civil virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Matthews, "Robert A. Taft, the Constitution and American Foreign Policy, 1939–53," ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' July 1982, Vol. 17 Issue 3, pp. 507–22&lt;/ref&gt;

* March: [[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born British economist, publishes ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', which is widely read in America and Britain.

===1960s===
Liberalism made major gains after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (LBJ) pushed through his liberal [[Great Society]] as well as civil rights laws. An unexpected bonanza helped conservatism in the late 1960s as liberalism came under intense attack from the [[New Left]], especially in academe. This new element, says liberal historian Michael Kazin, worked to "topple the corrupted liberal order."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin (1998). ''The populist persuasion: an American history.'' Cornell University Press. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; For the New Left "liberal" became a nasty epithet. Liberal commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] finds that, "If liberal ideology began to crumble intellectually in the 1960s it did so in part because the New Left represented a highly articulate and able wrecking crew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

[[Movement conservatism]] emerges as grassroots activists react to liberal and [[New Left]] agendas. It develops a structure that supports Goldwater in 1964 and [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1976–80. By the late 1970s, local evangelical churches join the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Perlstein, "Thunder on the Right: The Roots of Conservative Victory in the 1960s," ''OAH Magazine of History,'' Oct 2006, Vol. 20 Issue 5, pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A. Hijiya, "The Conservative 1960s," ''Journal of American Studies,'' Aug 2003, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp. 201–28&lt;/ref&gt;
Liberalism faces a racial crisis nationwide. Within weeks of the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964 Civil Rights law]], "long hot summers" begin, lasting until 1970, with the [[Long Hot Summer of 1967|worst outbreaks coming in the summer of 1967]]. Nearly 400 racial disorders in 298 cities saw blacks attacking shopkeepers and police, and looting stores.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Omi and Howard Winant (1994). ''Racial formation in the United States: from the 1960s to the 1990s.'' Routledge. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the urban crime rates shoot up. Demands for "[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]" escalate and the backlash causes disillusionment among working class whites with the liberalism of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Flamm (2007). ''Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s.'' Columbia University Press. ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s the GOP debates race and civil rights intensely. Republican liberals, led by Nelson Rockefeller, argue for a strong federal role because it was morally right and politically advantageous. Conservatives call for a more limited federal presence and discount the possibility of significant black voter support. Nixon avoids race issues in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thurber | first1 = Timothy N.  | year = 2007 | title = Goldwaterism Triumphant?

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 497''', adopted unanimously on 17 December 1981, declared that the Israeli [[Golan Heights Law]], which effectively annexed the [[Golan Heights]], is "null and void and without international legal effect" and further calls on [[Israel]] to rescind its action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://undocs.org/S/RES/497(1981) Text of the Resolution at undocs.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council requested the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] to report to the Council within two weeks on the implementation of the resolution, and in the event of non-compliance by Israel, the Council would reconvene, not later than 5 January 1982, to discuss further action under the United Nations Charter.
