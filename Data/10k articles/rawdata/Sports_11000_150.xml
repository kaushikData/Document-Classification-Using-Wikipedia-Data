'''1814 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Bandy]]==
'''Events'''
* The first recorded games of bandy take place in the [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] during the great frost of 1813–14, but it is probable that the game has been played there since the previous century.  A feature of the Fens is that large expanses of ice form on flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters and skating is a tradition.  Bury Fen bandy club from Bluntisham-cum-Earith, near [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], is the most successful team, remaining unbeaten until 1890–91.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship but no fights involving him are recorded in 1814, although he does stage an exhibition of sparring for the [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}.  Retrieved on 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The site of [[Lord's Middle Ground]] is requisitioned by Parliament for the building of the [[Regent's Canal]].  [[Thomas Lord]] contacts the Eyre family, erstwhile owners of the ground, and persuades them to lease to him another parcel of land in [[St John's Wood]], about half a mile further north at a place called North Bank.  This site has previously been a duckpond.  In the winter of 1813-14, Lord again has his turf literally dug up and removed.  He builds a high perimeter fence, a tavern and a pavilion at what is now [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] (Lord's).  
* On 22 June 1814, [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) plays the first match at Lord's against Hertfordshire, then as now a minor county.  
* The first match of importance at Lord's is played 13–15 July 1814 when MCC takes on a team called St John's Wood that includes a number of [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] players including [[Billy Beldham]], [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] and [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]].
* [[Jem Broadbridge]] makes his debut in [[first-class cricket]].
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] 126 (HS 59*)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] and [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] 11 apiece

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* Inaugural running of the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Charlotte (horse)|Charlotte]]
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Olive 
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Blucher (horse)|Blucher]] 
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Medora (horse)|Medora]]
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[William (horse)|William]]

The '''Aiken Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame and Museum''' was established in 1977 as a tribute to the famous [[flat racing]] and [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] [[Thoroughbred]] horses that trained in [[Aiken, South Carolina]].

The museum was a project of the local [[United States Junior Chamber|Jaycees]], aided by [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] expert [[Whitney Tower]], horse racing editor for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and Vice President of the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|National Racing Museum]] and Chair of its Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="MoreThan"&gt;Stephanie Turner, [http://www.aikenstandard.com/article/20150311/AIK0401/150319867 "Thoroughbred museum: More than a Hall of Fame exhibit"], ''[[Aiken Standard]]'', March 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is located on the grounds of Hopelands Gardens, the former home of [[Charles Oliver Iselin]] and [[Hope Goddard Iselin]] that is now owned by the City of Aiken. The museum occupies the Iselins' former carriage house and stables.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Pavey, [http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/aiken/2012-03-31/equestrian-legacy-celebrated-aiken-thoroughbred-hall-fame-and-museum "Equestrian legacy celebrated at Aiken Thoroughbred Hall of Fame and Museum"], ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'', March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hall of Fame commemorates 40 [[Eclipse Award]]-winning horses that trained in Aiken; the museum also includes a variety of other exhibits.&lt;ref name="MoreThan"/&gt;

The stadium is located by the Senador Salgado Filho Avenue ([[BR-101]] [[highway]]), a multi-lane road already served by the Complexo Viário do Quarto Centenário (Fourth Centennial Complex road or Complexo Viário Senador Carlos Alberto de Sousa).

The '''BAA Ground''' ('''Burma Athletic Association Ground''') was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]] (today Yangon, Myanmar).  The first and only recorded match on the ground came in 1927 when [[Burma national cricket team|Burma]] played its only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club cricket team in India and Ceylon in 1926–27|touring Marylebone Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on BAA Ground, Rangoon|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The match ended in a heavy defeat for Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12171.html|title=Burma v Marylebone Cricket Club, 1926/27|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket in Burma (which was at the time administered as part of the [[British Raj]]) was a mainly British affair, with the game played by British officials.  With Burmese independence in 1948, cricket became largely extinct in the country.

'''Cricket Australia''' ('''CA'''), formerly known as the '''Australian Cricket Board''' ('''ACB'''), is the governing body for professional and amateur [[cricket]] in Australia. It was originally formed in 1905 as the 'Australian Board of Control for International Cricket'. It is incorporated as an Australian Public Company, [[Company limited by guarantee|limited by guarantee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.asic.gov.au/cgi-bin/gns030c?acn=006_089_130&amp;juris=9&amp;hdtext=ACN&amp;srchsrc=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket Australia operates all of the Australian national representative cricket sides, including the [[Australian cricket team]], the [[Australia national women's cricket team]] and youth sides as well. CA is also responsible for organising and hosting [[Test cricket|Test tours]] and [[one day international]]s with other nations, and scheduling the home international fixtures.

==Background==
Cricket Australia is an administrative organisation responsible for [[cricket]] in Australia. Cricket Australia has six member organisations that represent each of the Australian states. These organisations are:

* [[New South Wales]] – [[Cricket NSW]]
* [[Queensland]] – [[Queensland Cricket]]
* [[South Australia]] – [[South Australian Cricket Association]]
* [[Tasmania]] – [[Tasmanian Cricket Association]]
* [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] – [[Cricket Victoria]]
* [[Western Australia]] – [[Western Australian Cricket Association]]

[[Cricket ACT]] and [[Northern Territory Cricket]] are non-member associations, although the ACT participates in Cricket Australia tournaments such as the [[Women's National Cricket League]] and the [[Futures League]], and previously briefly also competed in [[Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament|the domestic limited-overs competition]].

Cricket Australia is governed by eight independent directors, who work collectively in the national interest of Australian cricket.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The chief executive officer reports to the board of directors.

Each of the state cricket associations that are members of Cricket Australia also selects a representative side to participate in Australia's major domestic cricket tournaments.

Cricket Australia also maintains a healthy but independent association with the [[Australian Cricketers' Association]] to provide proper player's rights and welfare requirements.

==History==
The first centralised authority for the administration of cricket in Australia was established in 1892 when representatives from the state associations of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria came together to establish the Australasian Cricket Council. However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the "Australian Board of Control for International Cricket".&lt;ref name="page57"&gt;Pollard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  The predecessor organisation, the Australasian Cricket Council, had existed from 1892 to 1898 but was ineffective due to a lack of funding. Its one lasting action was to establish the [[Sheffield Shield]], the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

These early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting of the new board was held at [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] in [[Melbourne]] on 6 May 1905.

The foundation members were the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] and the [[Victorian Cricket Association]]. South Australia's delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The [[Queensland Cricket Association]] was represented as an observer only.&lt;ref name="page57"/&gt;

Queensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative. In 1907 Tasmania was also permitted to send a single representative, and Western Australia did likewise in 1913. Changes to this structure were made in 1914 and 1974 respectively when Queensland and Western Australia formally increased their representation to two each.

===Name changes===
Cricket Australia has had three different names since its foundation. They are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

*Australian Board of Control for International Cricket (1905–1973)
*Australian Cricket Board (1973–2003)
*Cricket Australia (2003&amp;nbsp;– present)

==Finances==
The organisation's revenue was A$380.9&amp;nbsp;million in the year ended 30 June 2015, with a net surplus of $99&amp;nbsp;million largely attributed to the success of co-hosting the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Competitions==
As well as responsibility for Australian international sides, Cricket Australia organises domestic inter-state cricket in Australia, including the three premier competitions in each of the major forms of the game. These are the [[Sheffield Shield]] in [[first-class cricket]], the [[Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament|JLT One-Day Cup]], which is the [[List A cricket|domestic one-day competition]], and the [[KFC Twenty20 Big Bash|KFC Big Bash League]], which is the domestic [[Twenty20]] competition.

Cricket Australia's competitions:

* [[Sheffield Shield]]
* [[Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament|JLT One-Day Cup]]
* [[Big Bash League]]
* [[Futures League]] (Second XI)
* [[Women's National Cricket League]]
* [[Women's Big Bash League]]

Cricket Australia also runs the Under 19 and Under 17 Male Championships, the Under 18 and Under 15 Female National Championships, the [[National Indigenous Cricket Championships]] and the National Cricket Inclusion Championships.

==Honours==
Cricket Australia also provides awards for various categories of players, including:
* Male: Test Player of the Year, One-Day Player of the Year, Bradman Young Player of the Year, Domestic Player of the Year, and the [[Allan Border Medal]] for the overall best Australian men's cricketer of the year. 
* Female: the Belinda Clark Award for the best Australian women's cricketer of the year, the Betty Wilson Young Player of the Year, and the Domestic Player of the Year 

Cricket Australia also honours players for exceptional service to the game of cricket in Australia by annually adding former players of great distinction to the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]].

The '''Derby Italiano''' is a [[Group races|Group 2]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Italy]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at [[Capannelle Racecourse|Capannelle]] over a distance of 2,200 metres (about 1 mile and 3 furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in May.

It is Italy's equivalent of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], a famous race in England.

==History==
The event was established in 1884, and it was originally run in the district of Capannelle over 2,400 metres. It was initially called the Derby Reale, and most of the prize money for the inaugural running was donated by [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Big Race Focus: The Derby Italiano | url = http://www.godolphin.com/BigRaceFocusDetail.aspx?id=460 | publisher = [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] | accessdate = 9 October 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721163714/http://www.godolphin.com/BigRaceFocusDetail.aspx?id=460 | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race was transferred to its current venue in 1926. It was known as the Gran Premio del Re in the 1930s, and for a brief period it was titled the Gran Premio del Re Imperatore. It was renamed the Derby Italiano in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Il Derby | url = http://www.capannelleippodromo.it/ippodromo_derby.html | language = Italian | publisher = [[Capannelle Racecourse|Ippodromo Capannelle]] | accessdate = 9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present system of race grading was introduced in the early 1970s, and the Derby Italiano was initially classed at Group 1 level. It was opened to horses born and bred outside Italy in 1981.

The Derby Italiano was cut to 2,200 metres in 2008, and it was downgraded to Group 2 status in 2009. With a current prize fund of €814,000, it is the most valuable horse race in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Italian Derby Downgraded | first = James | last = Crispe | url = http://www.racingandsports.com.au/breeding/rsNewsArt.asp?NID=144228&amp;story=Italian_Derby_Downgraded | publisher = racingandsports.com.au | date = 5 February 2009 | accessdate = 9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24201">The '''[[FIDE Women's Grand Prix]] 2009–11''' was a series of six [[chess]] tournaments exclusively for women, which formed part of the qualification cycle for the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2011]]. The winner of the Grand Prix (the one with most Grand Prix points) was to challenge [[Hou Yifan]]—the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2010|2010 world champion]]— in the third quarter of 2011. As Hou Yifan also won the Grand Prix, [[Koneru Humpy]] as the runner-up qualified for the championship match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7060|title=Humpy pulls it off – wins Doha GM and qualifies|date=March 5, 2011|author=[[ChessBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/koneru-shares-first-with-danielian-in-doha-qualifies-for-title-match/|title=Koneru shares first with Danielian in Doha, qualifies for title match|date=March 6, 2011|author=chessvibes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/chessnews/events/6th-fide-women-grand-prix-2011/koneru-ties-for-first-with-danielian-in-doha-and-qualifies-for-world-title-match|title=Koneru ties for first with Danielian in Doha and qualifies for World Title Match|date=March 5, 2011|author=chess.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305013157/http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/chessnews/events/6th-fide-women-grand-prix-2011/koneru-ties-for-first-with-danielian-in-doha-and-qualifies-for-world-title-match|archivedate=March 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tournament was originally scheduled to take place in [[Santiago de Chile]] starting on October 23, 2010. However, due to problems with financing, the host was replaced and the final tournament was then played in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://qatar2011.fide.com/qatar2011.fide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Eighteen of the top female players in the world were to be selected to compete in these tournaments. Each player would contract to participate in exactly 4 of these tournaments. Players must rank their preference of tournaments once the final list of host cities was announced and the dates allocated to each host city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-||s/3089-regulations-and-bidding-procedure-for-the-womens-grand-prix-2009-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Each tournament was staged as a 12-player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, ½ point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 160 points for first place, 130 for second place, 110 for third place, and then 90 down to 10 points for places four to twelve (decreasing by 10 points for each place). Grand Prix points were split between players on equal tournament points.

Players only counted their best three tournament results in the overall standings. The player with the most total grand prix points for those three tournaments was the winner.

==Players and qualification==
The 18 players qualified were:&lt;ref&gt;http://istanbul2009.fide.com/women-gp-regulations.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a9wo$gix.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* The top '''four''' from the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2008|World Championship 2008]]:
**''[[Alexandra Kosteniuk]]'' (declined to participate), [[Hou Yifan]], [[Pia Cramling]], and [[Koneru Humpy]].
* The '''six''' highest rated players (average of October 2007 and October 2008 lists) not already qualified:
**''[[Judit Polgár]]'' (declined), ''[[Susan Polgar]]'' (declined), ''[[Xie Jun]]'' (declined), [[Zhao Xue]], [[Marie Sebag]], and [[Zhu Chen]].
* '''Two''' players nominated by the FIDE president:
**[[Nana Dzagnidze]] and [[Elina Danielian]].
* One nominee from each of the '''six''' host cities:
**[[Betul Cemre Yildiz]] (Istanbul), [[Shen Yang (chess player)|Shen Yang]] (Nanjing), [[Zeinab Mamedyarova]], [[Lilit Mkrtchian]] (Jermuk), [[Batkhuyag Munguntuul]] (Ulaanbaataar), and [[Martha Fierro]] (Santiago).

The four players who declined to participate were replaced by the following reserves (on rating): [[Antoaneta Stefanova]], [[Tatiana Kosintseva]], [[Maia Chiburdanidze]], and [[Xu Yuhua]]. Although Santiago was replaced as host city by Doha, their nominee Fierro was allowed to stay in the series.

Mamedyarova was excluded from the series after the first tournament in Istanbul and replaced by [[Baira Kovanova]] due to change of host city to Nalchik. Kosintseva was unable to play in Nanjing and reserve [[Ju Wenjun]] took her place in that tournament.

==Tie-breaks==
With the objective of determining a clear, single winner to play in the championship match in the case that two or more players had equal cumulative points at the top, the following criteria (in descending order) would be utilized to decide the overall winner:
# The fourth result not already in the top three performances
# The number of actual game points scored in the four tournaments
# The number of first-place finishes
# The number of second-place finishes
# The number of won games
# Drawing of lots

==Prize money and Grand Prix points==
The prize fund was €40,000 per Grand Prix event and €60,000 for the overall Grand Prix placement.&lt;ref name=regulations&gt;[http://istanbul2009.fide.com/women-gp-regulations.html: Regulations for the 2009–2010 Women's FIDE Grand-Prix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Prix standings===
The Grand Prix was won by [[Hou Yifan]], but as she was already qualified for the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2011|championship match]] as title holder, runner-up [[Koneru Humpy]] qualified as challenger. Her tied first place in Doha was just enough to overtake [[Nana Dzagnidze]] and secure second place in the overall standings.

The '''Glass Bowl''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It is primarily used for [[American football]], and is the home field of the [[University of Toledo]] Rockets. It is located on the school's Bancroft campus, just south of the banks of the Ottawa River. Known for its blend of old and new, it retains the traditional stonework around the field throughout all its expansions.

==History==
Originally known as '''University Stadium''', it was completed in 1937 at a cost of only $313,558 as a [[Works Progress Administration]] project. Originally the natural seating bowl held 8,000 in two sideline grandstands. There was a grass hill at the south end of the stadium, and at the open (north) end of the bowl were two stone towers (still standing), that served as makeshift housing for the football team in its early years. Following [[World War II]], the stadium was renovated, with many glass elements. Because of this, and the city's concentration on the industry, the stadium was renamed the Glass Bowl in 1946. South end zone stands were added in 1966, and further expansion came following Toledo's 35-game win streak from 1969 to 1971, bringing capacity up to 18,500.

In 1999, the Toledo-based Ohio Cannon of the [[Regional Football League]] played at various stadiums, including the Glass Bowl, but did not finish the season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcsn.tv/news_article/show/372539&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted the [[2001 MAC Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=MAC Championship Game Set for Friday Night|url=https://www.nmnathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=42968&amp;SPID=3802&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9400&amp;ATCLID=1090391|publisher=Mid–American Conference|date=November 27, 2001|accessdate=August 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k4GaiEH3?url=https://www.nmnathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=42968|archivedate=September 26, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
In 1990, the stadium had its largest expansion take place, adding a second level of seats to both sidelines. As part of the $18.5 million dollar renovations, a three-story press box, 45 [[Luxury box|luxury suites]], a 400-seat Stadium Club, sports information offices, and the [[Larimer Athletic Complex]] were built. The three-story press box, the second largest in the nation, was the greatest improvement in terms of upgrades, as the former press box was barely 30 feet long and could only hold approximately 50 people.

Further improvements include a video scoreboard in the north end zone in 1999, and the upgrade to a [[FieldTurf|Field Turf]] playing surface in 2008. A new video board was installed in 2010.

In 2016, a $3.5 million dollar renovation took place, including replacement of the field turf, changes to the facade, updating concessions, restrooms, locker rooms, and ticket booths, as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the stadium.

==Attendance==
The largest crowd in Glass Bowl history for a [[University of Toledo]] football game was 36,852 for a game against the [[United States Naval Academy]] on October 27, 2001.

===Attendance records===
# 36,852 vs. Navy (2001)
# 36,502 vs. Northern Illinois (2001)
# 34,950 vs. Minnesota (2001)
# 34,900 vs. Marshall (2000)
# 33,040 vs. Indiana State (1994)
# 32,726 vs. Weber State (2000)
# 31,981 vs. Bowling Green (2004)
# 31,711 vs. Pittsburgh (2003)
# 31,458 vs. Bowling Green (1994)
# 31,369 vs. Bowling Green (1982)

==Features==
In 1961, the University of Toledo procured a genuine rocket from the U.S. Army missile program. The one-ton rocket, which sits outside the Glass Bowl — aimed to hit the 50-yard line of arch-rival [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]]'s [[Doyt Perry Stadium]] — carries two sets of fins and a propellant booster capable of guiding the missile to supersonic velocity. (source NCAA WIKI)

The Glass Bowl is often used by the [[Glassmen]] as a rehearsal facility during weekends in the late spring and early summer.  In addition, the Glass Bowl is used for [[monster truck]] rallies, commencements, and [[concerts]], among other uses.

'''Hobey Baker Memorial Rink''' is a 2,092-seat hockey [[arena]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. It is home to the [[Princeton University]] [[Princeton Tigers|Tigers]] [[Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey|men's]] and [[Princeton Tigers women's ice hockey|women's]] [[College ice hockey|ice hockey]] teams as well as the venue for club and intramural hockey teams, intramural [[broomball]], [[figure skating]] and recreational skating. It is the only ice skating rink on the Princeton University campus.  It is named in honor of former Princeton star [[Hobey Baker|Hobart A.H. "Hobey" Baker]], '14.  Baker was a football and hockey star who died shortly after World War I.  In December 1921, it was decided to build an on-campus arena for the hockey team, and to name it after Baker.  Efforts to modernize the arena began in the mid-1970s with major improvements including the addition of locker rooms, a skate sharpening room and a stick storage room in 1981, a new scoreboard and lighting improvements in 1984 and a renovation of the roof in 2002.  It is the second-oldest arena still in use in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] hockey, behind only [[Matthews Arena]] at [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]]; however, Northeastern has only played at Matthews Arena since 1930, giving Princeton the distinction of being the school that has played in its current home the longest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Christopher|title=100 years on ice: What the puck?|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=4796116|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I formation''' is a doubles tennis strategy carefully planned to confuse the opponent returning the serve. "The name comes from its resemblance to American football's I-Formation, in which the fullback positions right behind the halfback, who positions right behind the quarterback.".&lt;ref&gt;(krajco "n.d.") http://www.tennisserver.com/wildcards/wildcards_02_10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

.&lt;ref&gt;"The net player on the serving team crouches down (so they don't get hit by the serve.) On the centre service line. The server hits the serve from directly behind her on the baseline".&lt;/ref&gt;  The net player then indicates, (privately); typically with their hands behind their back which side of the court they will move to as the return of serve is hit. These hand gestures let the server at the baseline know which side of the court they are to serve to, and than move to. For intermediate players such as league, or club players it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained) Advanced competitors such as professional; and tour players are known to use other combinations for example [[Tennis strategy|Australian Doubles]] which deliberately exposes one side of the court to entice the return of serve be hit into the open space.

The ultimate aim here is for the net player to cut off the return of serve hopefully ending the point.

'''Why I-formation is Effective'''
In tennis you want to keep the ball away from the net player, because it is easy to put the ball away from closer to the net than any other position on the court.

This tactic has the player returning the serve guess as to which side the opponents net player will be. So basically there is a 50–50 chance the person returning the server is going to hit the ball right into their opponents net player which effectively can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles.

'''Tips''' 
To play this tactic successfully It's important players be comfortable serving the ball with enough precision to place the ball out wide, into the body; and down the 'T" in each service box. Accuracy is also required so you don't hit the net-player in the back or head.

Another key to success with this tactic is understanding the ins and outs of returning a serve, and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is harder to change the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also, there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt, because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net.

It helps to know your opponent's weaknesses and strengths before playing this strategy; so if your opponent has a whopping big crosscourt return of serve,  this is good to know beforehand; because you can force them to return the ball down the line where the net is higher, the distance is shorter and the angle is harder; this  can [[Intimidation|intimidating]] the player returning the serve into making an error.

The net-player is required to get low, and it is important that they be able to move quickly out of this position, so it's recommended the net player be on their feet, crouching, as opposed to one or both knees. Also, it is easier to move to the ball from the balls of the feet as opposed to being flat-footed. Also typically you want this position to be uncomfortable because you are going to want to move out of it quickly. 

==Communicating to the Server==

Often the net player will put their hands behind the back to indicate where the server should serve. So if the server is serving on the deuce side of the court the index finger is used to point to the ad side, The middle finger is used to indicate a to-the-body shot, and the pinkie finger is used to reflect the down-the-line position.&lt;ref&gt;(Westermann 2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXoOGJkBIuQ&lt;/ref&gt; The net-player then communicates if they are going to move to the ad or deuce service-box. It's also common for the net-player to walk back to the service line and whisper his/her choice of combinations to the server; this helps to slow the game down, which can frustrate the returning team's [[rhythm]]; and also helps the server to stay calm.

'''Inbuan''' is a form of [[wrestling]] native to the people of [[Mizoram]] in [[India]]. Inbuan is said to have originated in the village of [[Dungtlang]] in 1750. It was recognized as a sport after the [[Mizo people]] migrated from [[Burma]] to the Lushai Hills.

Inbuan involves very strict rules prohibiting kicking, stepping out of the circle and even bending of the knees. The contest is held in a circle 15–16 feet in diameter on carpet or grass. The objective is to lift one's opponent off his feet while strictly adhering to the rules. The matches are held in three rounds each of 30–60 seconds of duration, the match generally continues till a wrestler either breaks a rule or is lifted off his feet.

Another feature of this form of wrestling is the catch-hold belt worn by the wrestlers around the waist. It has to remain tight all through the match.

In [[American English]], a '''journeyman''' or '''journeywoman''' is an athlete who is technically competent but unable to excel.&lt;ref name=Allred&gt;{{cite book|title=Atta Girl!: A Celebration of Women in Sport|author=Alexandra Powe Allred|year=2003|publisher=Wish Publishing|isbn=1-930546-61-0|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used elsewhere (such as in [[British English|British]] and [[Australian English|Australian]] contexts) to refer to a professional sportsman who plays for a large number of different clubs during their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/features/roma-totti-journeyman-toni/|title=Roma captain’s loyalty contrasts journeyman Toni|date=22 March 2015|work=Gazzetta dello Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the term is also used derogatorily, along with ''mercenary'', to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts rather than to further their career; usually clubs which they would likely never join otherwise.
 
==American English==
Journeymen players are usually distinguished from an elite or "star" player.  Quirk and Fort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard Ball: the abuse of power in pro team sports|author=James P. Quirk and Rodney D. Fort|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-05817-2|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that the concerns of journeymen players and superstars, with respect to contract and other negotiations, differ: Superstars are concerned with the preservation of their rights to be free agents, whilst journeymen players are concerned with issues such as league minimum salaries and player pensions.  Fort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pay Dirt: The Business of Professional Team Sports|author=Rodney D. Fort|year=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01574-0|nopp=true|page=xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that this leads to conflicts between journeymen and superstars, such as (Fort's example) the 1995 attempt by a group of superstar players to derail the agreement between the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and its players' association.  Holt and Mason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport in Britain 1945&amp;ndash;2000|author=Richard Holt and Tony Mason|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-17154-1|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that in [[football (soccer)|football]], [[golf]], [[flat racing]], [[snooker]], [[cricket]], and other sports there is a clear distinction in earnings between the few rich stars in each sport and the journeyman professionals. They state that snooker has "an élite of perhaps twenty players" and point to a distinction between high earning [[test cricket]]ers with six figure wages and "the average [[county cricket|county]] professional" (for whom they give [[Simon Hughes (cricketer)|Simon Hughes]], who earned £50,000 in the whole of his twelve years in county cricket, as an example).  Vamplew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pay Up and Play the Game: Professional Sport in Britain, 1875&amp;ndash;1914|author=Wray Vamplew|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-89230-9|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how league cricket in the 1890s provided little attraction for star cricketers but was greatly attractive to journeymen players in county cricket, eventually forcing the counties to raise their conventional maximum wage, offer winter pay to more players, and expand the fixture lists.

O'Leary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drugs and Doping in Sport: Socio-legal Perspectives|author=John O'Leary|year=2001|publisher=Routledge Cavendish|isbn=1-85941-662-4|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes as significant the fact that whilst star football players will be treated with lenience by clubs, for journeyman footballers the taking of recreational drugs usually terminates their careers.  (He gives [[Roger Stanislaus]] and [[Craig Whitington]] as examples.)  Clubs will regard it as worthwhile to wait for stars to become available for team selection after suspension or imprisonment, but not for journeymen.

The journeyman can, however, be quite valuable in the team sports context.  Because it is almost always economically non-viable for even the richest teams in sports without salary caps to have a roster made up fully of superstar players and because such a scenario would likely not occur even with economic viability because of the lack of attention some players would end up getting, journeymen often make up a large part of a team.  This is especially true in the context of [[baseball]], where journeymen often make up large parts of a team's pitching staff and contribute crucially to a team's success. Many journeymen can be highly experienced, and they often play a "utility" role to cover for injuries or tactical changes as required.

The term is also used in this context for [[journeyman (boxing)|boxing journeymen]].

==British English==
[[ File:Lutz Pfannenstiel.JPG|thumb|[[Lutz Pfannenstiel]] played for 27 clubs on six continents.]] 
In British English, a journeyman is a player who has represented many different clubs over his career. Prime examples from [[association football]] are: German goalkeeper [[Lutz Pfannenstiel]], who represented 27 different clubs, and he is currently the only athlete to have played professionally in all six [[list of football federations#FIFA Confederations|FIFA Confederations]]; [[Trevor Benjamin]], who has represented 29 different clubs since 1995; [[Drewe Broughton]], who has made 18 transfers in his career; [[John Burridge]], who played for 29 different clubs in a career spanning almost 30 years; there is [[Jefferson Louis]] who, since the 1990s, has represented 34 clubs and Dominica once; and his [[cousin]] [[Richard Pacquette]] who boasts 19 different clubs and even international honours in 10 seasons. The term is also used in Australian English in the same context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/07/15/248595_sport.html|title=Crocs sign 148-game journeyman|date=15 Jul 2011|newspaper=Townsville Bulletin|first=Andrew|last=Aloia|accessdate=23 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used derogatorily, along with ''mercenary'', to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts, clubs which they would likely never join otherwise.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Football mercenaries - Sport - The Observer | website=The Guardian | date=9 February 2011 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1229623,00.html | access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bairner 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bairner | first=Robin | title=Why Dimitri Payet's Marseille transfer does not make him a mercenary | website=Goal.com | date=30 January 2017 | url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2017/01/30/32124352/why-payets-marseille-transfer-does-not-make-him-a-mercenary | access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no convention for the number of transfers required for a player to be considered a journeyman or a mercenary and as such is an arbitrary epithet given by those who resent the player's actions. Journeymen's direct opposite, players who play for the same club, or only a few different clubs, throughout their entire careers, are called [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club men]].

==Plot==

Wives and girlfriends sit together at a Sox game to watch Wacky Waters pitch. He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy $300 worth.

In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money.

Sure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married. While they are happy for the couple, Hazel schemes to have a Hollywood producer require Pepita's presence to shoot a movie there. This could keep Wacky focused on baseball until the World Series.

Pepita finishes the film faster than expected. She hurries to Kansas City to see Wacky and the Sox, so the wives take matters into their own hands, tying up Pepita in a hotel room against her will. Wacky eventually wins the World Series for the Sox, but this time, it's only because the woman he loves is there.

*Matches of doubtful status,
*Matches between full international sides and non-national XVs, and
*Other games of note.

It is included as some nations have awarded full caps for these games and may include them as full internationals in their own records. In addition these games act as an indicator of the relative strength of some of the smaller nations, and the strength in depth of the larger.

==1990==

nohome = {{ruw-rt|Catalonia}}&lt;ref&gt;'''Status of Catalonia'''

The status of games played by Catalonia - especially the games in 1990 and 1995 against Wales and Germany respectively - appear to have been treated as if there were internationals by both opponents at the time. However the status of these games have changed following two retrospective rulings.

First, in 2009 Wales (via email correspondence confirmed by their website) changed the designation of their team to only a "Wales XV" and therefore not an international. This may have been influenced by a 2008 French court ruling (see [http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/medias/090105_NH_COM_Flash_Info_97_EN.pdf])that the Catalan Rugby Union was not a national union and therefore could not be a member of Rugby Europe (known at the time as FIRA).

As this ruling was retrospective the game between Catalonia and Germany in 1995 also cannot now be considered a game between teams from two nations unions.''&lt;/ref&gt; |

In addition, the NZRU records include no mention of the match. As a result it cannot be seen as an "official" test match.&lt;/ref&gt; |

noaway = {{ruw|USA|name=A USA XV}}&lt;ref&gt;The status of this game is confused. While it definitely took place, it is not listed on the USA Rugby website, and Fiji's RFU clearly state that their first international wasn't until 2006. This may be an oversight by Fiji, or it may be because this may not have been a full US side (there is a suggestion that it was mainly a [[Stanford University]] selection). However, for whatever reason, as neither RFU currently seems to consider this to be a full "international", it is listed here rather than in the main list.&lt;/ref&gt; |

'''Melaleuca Field''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]]. It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and is the home field of the [[Idaho Falls Chukars]] [[Minor League Baseball]] team.  It was built during the [[Pioneer Baseball League|Pioneer League]] 2006-07 offseason. American Legion and local high school games are also played at the field.

By 2004, the old stadium that used to sit on the same lot, McDermott Field, was outdated, deteriorating, and viewed as an unsuitable baseball venue. In May of that year, the Chukars approached the City of Idaho Falls about a major renovation; the estimated cost was $3.35 million. After the city agreed to allocate $2 million toward the project, the Chukars started a "Step Up To The Plate" fundraising campaign to come up with the remaining $1.35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step Up To The Plate: A Capital Campaign for Idaho Falls' New Ballpark|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t444&amp;ymd=20070125&amp;content_id=163476&amp;vkey=team1|website=www.milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a fundraising campaign launched by the city of Idaho Falls, a sharp rise in anticipated construction costs resulted in a budget shortfall of half a million dollars. Idaho Falls [[multi-level marketing]] company Melaleuca provided $600,000 to complete the construction and the stadium was renamed Melaleuca Field on June 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melaleuca Field History|url=http://www.melaleucafield.com/field-info/history/|website=www.melaleucafield.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menser|first1=Paul|title=Out with the old|url=http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1001-10312006&amp;today=2006-10-31|website=www.postregister.com|publisher=The Post Register|accessdate=3 November 2015|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old McDermott Field stadium was torn down on October 30, 2006, and the new Melaleuca Field stadium was dedicated on June 22, 2007. The new stadium includes a [[seating capacity]] of 3,400, eight luxury boxes, two large concession booths, and a sponsored hot tub on the right field line.&lt;ref name="bpdigest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Melaleuca Field|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/200901041224/minor-league-baseball/visits/melaleuca-field-idaho-falls-chukars|work=Ballpark Digest|date=January 4, 2009|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The grandstand includes 1,200 box seats, 1,459 bench seats with backs, eight custom suites with balcony seating, a large press box, two large concession booths, a souvenir shop and various offices.&lt;ref name="archeng"/&gt; The playing surface is natural grass (Kentucky bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melaleuca Field Information|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t444&amp;ymd=20070129&amp;content_id=166571&amp;vkey=team1|website=IFChukars.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concourse wraps around the playing field with a picnic area on the third base side and a party area with hot tub on the first base side. A separate building next to the field contains two locker rooms and extra storage.&lt;ref name="archeng"/&gt;

==Awards==

In 2007, Melaleuca Field was awarded “Best Ballpark Renovation” in the inaugural Ballpark Digest Awards of Distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reichard|first1=Kevin|title=Ballpark Digest announces inaugural Awards of Distinction|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/20070923608/minor-league-baseball/news/archives-sept-17-23-2007|website=BallparkDigest.com|publisher=Ballpark Digest|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the field was selected by fans as the top rookie-level ballpark in Ballpark Digest’s Best of the Ballparks contest and was named fourth best rookie-level ballpark by the Digest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of the Ballparks: Melaleuca Field|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/2015/06/26/best-of-the-ballparks-melaleuca-field/|website=BallparkDigest.com|publisher=Ballpark Digest|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 2017, Melaleuca Field welcomed the one millionth fan in the new ballpark's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keleher|first1=Katie|title=Chukars get one millionth fan|url=http://www.localnews8.com/sports/chukars-get-one-millionth-fan/605173093|website=LocalNews8.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Memorial Stadium''', also commonly known by its previous name of the '''Memorial Ground''', is a sports ground in [[Bristol]], England. It opened in 1921 dedicated to the memory of local [[rugby union]] players killed during the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolrugby.co.uk/fans/history/ |title=Bristol Rugby History |publisher=bristolrugby.co.uk |accessdate=30 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609204809/http://www.bristolrugby.co.uk/fans/history/ |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the home of [[Bristol Bears|Bristol Bears]] until they moved to [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] in 2014. It is currently the home stadium of [[Bristol Rovers F.C.]], who moved there in 1996.

==History==
[[File:Memorial Stadium (Bristol).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bristol Rovers]] v [[Manchester United]] at the Memorial Stadium, 1999]]
The site was created on an area of land called Buffalo Bill's Field, after Colonel William "Buffalo Bill" Cody's Wild West Show was held there between 28 September and 3 October 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cliftonrfchistory.co.uk/grounds/horfield/horfield.htm | title=Clifton Rugby Football Club History | publisher=	Clifton Rugby Football Club History | accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in September 1893 Clifton RFC played on the site for the first time.

During the [[First World War]] the site was converted into [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]] but after the war Buffalo Bill's Field was bought by Sir Francis Nicholas Cowlin (then the Sheriff of Bristol) and given to Bristol Rugby Club.

In 1921 it became the Memorial Ground, home of Bristol Rugby Club, and was opened on 24 September that year by G. B. Britton, the Lord Mayor of Bristol, as a home for [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol Rugby Club]].

Situated on Filton Avenue in [[Horfield]], Bristol, it has developed significantly over the years. A massive crowd turned out to watch the first (Bristol Rugby) game ever game to be held there against [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]], but did so from wooden terraces and stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial Stadium|url=http://footballtripper.com/memorial-stadium-bristol-rovers-fc/|publisher=Football Tripper|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of leagues in the late 1980s, Bristol looked to develop the ground, replacing the old Shed on the north side with the Centenary Stand to mark the club's 100th anniversary in 1988. The West Stand, an original feature of the ground, was demolished in 1995 having been condemned, and replaced.

In 1996, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] moved in as tenants of Bristol Rugby Club, and then entered into joint ownership through the Memorial Stadium Company. After just two years, in 1998, the rugby club was relegated from the Premiership (causing them severe financial difficulties) and under the terms of the agreement Bristol Rovers were able to buy Bristol Rugby's share of the stadium for a 'nominal fee', a clause designed to protect either party should one or the other fall into financial difficulties. The rugby club became tenants in their original home.

By 2005, the Memorial Stadium was hosting Bristol Rugby Club back in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Guinness Premiership]], with Bristol Rovers continuing to compete in the lower levels of the [[Football League]]. A roof was added to the Clubhouse Terrace (paid for by Bristol Rovers supporters' efforts) and temporary stands at the south and south-west of the ground have brought capacity up to 11,916. Bristol Rugby were again relegated out of the Premiership in 2009.

In February 2013, after months of speculation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Ashton-Gate-says-Bristol-Rugby-chief/story-17018226-detail/story.html | title=We might not move to Ashton Gate, says Bristol Rugby chief | publisher=ThisIsBristol | date=2 October 2012 | accessdate=17 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505063227/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Ashton-Gate-says-Bristol-Rugby-chief/story-17018226-detail/story.html | archivedate=5 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol Rugby announced that they would move and share a ground with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at the redeveloped [[Ashton Gate Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristolrugby.co.uk/news/8516/club-will-groundshare-with-bristol-city/ | title=Club Will Groundshare With Bristol City | publisher=Bristol Rugby | date=5 February 2013 | accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rugby club played their final game at the Mem on 4 June 2014, a [[RFU Championship|Championship]] play-off final second leg against [[London Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Rob-Perkins-Battling-Bristol-t-fairytale-finish/story-21191568-detail/story.html | title=Battling Bristol can't find a fairytale finish to life at the Memorial Stadium | publisher=Bristol Post | date=5 June 2014 | accessdate=5 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606210500/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Rob-Perkins-Battling-Bristol-t-fairytale-finish/story-21191568-detail/story.html | archivedate=6 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no fairytale ending for Bristol though as London Welsh won the game 21–20 to condemn the side to a sixth straight season outside the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Premiership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Brisotl-miss-promotion-Aviva-Premiership/story-21188040-detail/story.html | title=Bristol Rugby miss out on promotion to the Aviva Premiership | publisher=Bristol Post | date=4 June 2014 | accessdate=5 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606223121/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Brisotl-miss-promotion-Aviva-Premiership/story-21188040-detail/story.html | archivedate=6 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground has remained a focal point for the wider Bristol community, and a minute's silence is held annually at the closest game to [[Remembrance Sunday]], while on 11 November a service of remembrance is held at the Memorial Gates with players and officials from both Bristol Rovers and Bristol Rugby attending the service each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/memorial-gates-fall-silent-477233.aspx | title=Memorial Gates Fall Silent | publisher=bristolrovers.co.uk | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Christmas Eve 2015, the memorial gates were vandalized by supporters of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-35174164|title='Mindless' vandals target war memorial|date=2015-12-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time period of reconstruction, Bristol Rovers would have ground-shared with [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] at [[Whaddon Road]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6950967.stm Football and rugby stay in city] BBC News.

In June 2011, Bristol Rovers announced its intentions to relocate the club to the newly proposed [[UWE Stadium]] instead of redeveloping the Memorial Stadium. In order to fund the new stadium, the Mem is to be sold to supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]] with Rovers paying a [[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn rent]] with work to redevelop the site not beginning until Rovers complete their move to the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/page/StadiumRegeneration/0,,10328~2373698,00.html |title=ROVERS ANNOUNCE NEW STADIUM PLANS |publisher=bristolrovers.co.uk |accessdate=9 June 2011 |date=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611224103/http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/page/StadiumRegeneration/0%2C%2C10328~2373698%2C00.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted for the UWE Stadium site in July 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Councillors approve stadium plans |url=http://www.southglos.gov.uk/news/councillors-approve-stadium-plans/ |work=South Gloucestershire Council |publisher=southglos.gov.uk |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sainsbury's plans for the Memorial Stadium in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAINSBURY'S APPROVED |url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/sainsburys-approved-602688.aspx |work=Bristol Rovers Official Website |publisher=bristolrovers.co.uk |date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was expected to begin on the UWE Stadium shortly after but multiple delays caused by legal challenges held the project up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trashorfield.wordpress.com/judicial-review-granted/ |title=Judicial Review Granted |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/sajid-javid-visits-the-mem-1618031.aspx |title=SAJID JAVID VISITS THE MEM |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Sainsbury's pulled out of the project and were subsequently taken to court by Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;ROVERS IN THE HIGH COURT http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/update-rovers-in-the-high-court-2466521.aspx#iLoY93kjlk27wkRe.99&lt;/ref&gt; Sainsbury's won the court case and appeal that followed leaving the entire project again in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Rovers lose case over Sainsbury's stadium deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-33503419 |work=BBC News |date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STADIUM APPEAL TURNED DOWN |url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/stadium-appeal-verdict-3011291.aspx |work=Bristol Rovers F.C. |date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 following the takeover of the club by the Al-Qadi family, and extensive negotiations with the UWE, the club announced that it was no longer looking to build a new stadium in collaboration with the UWE but would once again explore redeveloping the Memorial Stadium instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/wael-al-qadi-confirms-bristol-298103|title=Wael Al-Qadi confirms Rovers plan to redevelop the Mem|last=Vittles|first=Jack|date=2017-08-08|work=bristolpost|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alfonso Zamora vs. Soo-Hwan Hong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Strikes to the head can result in a knockout]]

'''Punching power''' is the amount of [[kinetic energy]] in a person's [[punch (strike)|punches]]. '''Knockout power''' is a similar concept relating to the probability of any [[Strike (attack)|strike]] to the head to cause [[unconsciousness]]. Knockout power is related to the [[force (physics)|force]] delivered and precision of the strike.

In order to increase the mass behind a punch, it is essential to move the body as a unit throughout the punch.  Power is generated from the ground up, such that force from the ankles transfers to the knees; force from the knees transfers to the thighs; force from the thighs transfers to the [[core (anatomy)|core]]; from the core to the chest; from the chest to the shoulders; from the shoulders to the [[forearm]]s and finally the compounded force transfers through the fist into an opponent. So the most [[physical strength|powerful]] punchers are able to connect their whole body and channel the force from each portion of the body into a punch.

Generally, there are five components to punching power that must be present for a puncher to be considered truly powerful: lack of arm punching, proper weight shifting, stepping during a punch, pivoting with a punch, and using proper footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://heavyfists.com/increase-punching-power | title=Want to increase punching power? Follow this simple checklist |work=HeavyFists.com |date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This body connection requires the development of a strong core.  The core is perhaps the most important element in a powerful punch, since it connects the powerhouse of the legs to the delivery system of the arms.  Basic core conditioning [[physical exercise|exercises]] include abdominal [[crunch (exercise)|crunches]], [[sit-up (exercise)|situps]] and leg raises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Serjio Roberto Livingstone Pohlhammer''' (26 March 1920 – 11 September 2012), later simply known as '''Sergio Livingstone''', was a [[Chile]]an [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], who later became a well regarded journalist. He was nicknamed "El Sapo" for his typical posture in the goal mouth. From 1938–59 he played primarily for [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|CD Universidad Católica]] in Santiago. With [[Chilean national football team|Chile]] he took part in seven [[Copa América]] and one [[FIFA World Cup]].

==Career==
Serjio (later Sergio) Livingstone's family hailed from [[Scotland]]. His father John, who played for [[Santiago National|Santiago National FC]], was a pioneer of the game in Chile. Livingstone originally joined [[Unión Española]]. He abandoned football to study law at the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]]. Soon he acquainted himself with the university's football team, and from 1938 he began to establish himself as the goalkeeper of [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|CD Universidad Católica]].
[[File:Sergio Livingstone - Racing - 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Livingstone wearing his Racing Club jersey]]
He debuted in the [[Chilean national football team|national team]] at the [[1941 South American Championship]] which took place in Chile, winning 5–0 against [[Ecuador]]. By the end of the tournament Chile ended third, and Livingstone was considered the best player of the tournament. Altogether, Livingstone played between 1941 and 1954 in 52 matches for Chile,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Mamrud. [http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/chil-recintlp.html Chilean Record International Players] 19 February 2010, RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt; which made him the country's record international until 1962, participating in five more South American Championships, totaling 34 matches in this competition, which remains record. He also took part in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup 1950]] in Brazil, where Chile exited after the first group phase. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

At club level he spent 1943 in Argentina playing 30 matches for [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]. He cut short his time in [[Argentina]] for sentimental reasons and rejoined Católica in 1944, winning the national championships of 1949 and 1954. After the second title the club had the misfortune to be relegated in the season immediately thereafter, but managed to return to the first division as quickly. After a brief spell on loan in 1957 with [[CSD Colo-Colo|Colo-Colo]] he once more returned to Universidad Católica where he finished his career in 1959.
Following his football career, he became a well-known sports journalist and television personality with [[Televisión Nacional de Chile]], where he remained until his death (more than 60 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2012/09/11/560008/sergio-livingstone-en-la-tv-y-los-medios.html|title=Sergio Livingstone: El ex futbolista que llegó a lo más alto de la TV y el periodismo deportivo {{!}} Emol.com|last=S.A.P.|first=El Mercurio|date=2012-09-11|work=Emol|access-date=2018-08-31|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union Grounds''' was a [[baseball park]] located in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] section of [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].  The grounds opened in [[1862 in sports|1862]], its inaugural match being played on May 15.&lt;ref name=BE18620516&gt;{{cite news|title=Inauguartion of the Union Base Ball and Cricket Grounds--Grand Opening Game--2,000 to 3,000 Spectators present.|url=http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=BEagle&amp;BaseHref=BEG/1862/05/16&amp;PageLabelPrint=&amp;EntityId=Ar00203&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;GZ=T|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=Brooklyn Eagle|date=16 May 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first baseball park enclosed entirely by a fence, thereby allowing proprietor [[William Cammeyer]] or his tenant to charge admission. This permitted paying customers to watch the games from benches in a stand while non-paying spectators could only watch from embankments outside the grounds.&lt;ref name=BE18620722&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Base Ball Match.

==Overview==
The ball grounds was built on a large block bounded by Harrison Avenue, Rutledge Street, Lynch Street, and Marcy Avenue. A writer for the Brooklyn Eagle described the field in 1862: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The buildings occupied last winter are left standing, used pretty much for the same purposes as them.[sic] Near these a long wooden shed has been erected, capable of accommodating several hundred persons, and benches provided for the convenience of the fair sex... Several acres more have been added to the enclosure, which is fenced in with a board fence six or seven feet in height. On the southeast corner a large and commodious club house has been erected, containing accommodations for three clubs. The field is now almost a perfect level, covering at least some six acres of ground, all of which is well drained, rolled, and in a few weeks will be in splendid condition... Several flagstaffs have been put up, from which floated the banners of the clubs o'er shadowed by the nations' ensign."&lt;ref name=BE18620516 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During its early years Union Grounds was the home field for several ballclubs, notably including  the [[Eckford of Brooklyn|Eckford Club]], 1862 and 1863 champions of the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]].  In 1868, the [[New York Mutuals|Mutual Club of New York]] moved in from [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey]], long-time home of [[Manhattan]] clubs but never enclosed. The ballpark's entrance was on Rutledge Street, and a one-story building in right field, 350 feet away from home plate, was in play.

After formation of the first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players]], Union Grounds was home to the [[New York Mutuals|Mutual Club]] from [[1871 in sports|1871]] to [[1876 in sports|1876]] (the only year as a member of the new [[National League]]), [[Eckford of Brooklyn]] of the National Association in [[1872 in sports|1872]], and the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic Club of Brooklyn]] of the National Association from [[1873 in sports|1873]] to [[1875 in sports|1875]].  It also served as home field for the "[[Hartford Dark Blues|Hartford of Brooklyn]]" team during the [[1877 in sports|1877]]  [[National League]] season.  On July 26, 1878, the final major league game was played on the grounds, with Providence defeating Milwaukee 4-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1878/PKL_NYC011878.htm Retrosheet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The grounds continued to host barnstorming major league clubs, amateur clubs and independent clubs through the 1882 season.&lt;ref name="BrooklynBallParks.com"&gt;[http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/union.html BrooklynBallParks.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The park did not sit idle during the winter.  Its field was flooded and served as the rink for an ice skating club.&lt;ref name=nyt_obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Death List of a Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1898/09/07/archives/col-andrew-sheehan-dead.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 7, 1898 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual feature of the park was the presence of a pagoda in center field.&lt;ref name="BrooklynBallParks.com"/&gt;

[[File:Marcy Avenue Armory jeh.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Marcy Avenue Armory now occupies the southern half of the site of the Union Grounds.]]

''Valkyrie II'' existed for barely a single year. On July 5, 1894 this Cup contender was struck amidships by A. D. Clarke’s cutter yacht ''Satanita'' at the start of the Mud Hook Regatta on the [[Firth of Clyde]].  Lord Dunraven and all his crew and guests were rescued, though one crewman was severely injured and subsequently died. ''Valkyrie II'' broke up and sank nine minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;
