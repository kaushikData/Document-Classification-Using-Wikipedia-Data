'''''A Pallas nagy lexikona''''' (''Pallas's Great Lexicon'') was the first [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[encyclopedia]] which was not a translation from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mek.iif.hu/porta/szint/egyeb/lexikon/pallas/html/  A Pallas Nagy Lexicona.]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was published by the Pallas Literary and Press Corporation between 1893 and 1897. The encyclopedia comprised 16 volumes, 150 000 articles, and it was the work of 300 authors.

==History==
''A Pallas nagy lexikona'' (literally Pallas's large lexicon) is a great universal [[encyclopedia]] in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/00000/00060/index.phtml  A Pallas Nagy Lexicona.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/09300/09332/index.phtml A Pallas Nagy Lexicona.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It gradually developed in the years 1893 - 1897 in [[Budapest]]. In 1900 it was issued as two parts, but the Encyclopedia eventually reached a total of 18 volumes containing more than 150,000 entries. [[Chief editor]] was [[József Bokor]]. The authors were renowned [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[scientist]]s, most of whom were members of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. 
In 1911 the company published under the title ''[[Révai Nagy Lexikon]]''. In the [[20th century]] in Hungary it achieved great popularity. The latest edition was published in 1935 in 21 volumes. In 1998 [[Arcanum Adatbázis|Arcanum Adatbázis Kft]] encyclopedia was completely digitized and sold on CD-carriers.

'''Andorra''' was represented by [[Marian van de Wal]] with the song "La mirada interior", which was chosen over two stages organized by Andorran Television. Andorra began their search for a representative with Eurocàsting 2004, which eventually narrowed down 32 competitors into only 3. Marian van de Wal, Mar Capdevila, and Ishtar Ruiz each performed two song in the final. After a tie between Marian van de Wal and Mar Capdevila, the youngest jury member selected Marian van de Wal to represent Andorra at the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest. On January 22, Marian van de Wal performed three candidate songs in a show hosted by Meri Picart &amp; Josep Lluís Trabal. A combination of SMS Voting and a professional jury selected "La Mirada Interior".

Marian van de Wal is originally from the [[Netherlands]], but by the time she was selected, she had been living six years in Aldosa in the Principality of Andorra, running a small hotel. As well as Dutch, she speaks Catalan, English, Spanish and German. Marian had entered festivals in the Netherlands and performed in different Andorran venues.

At Eurovision, Marian and her team (which included [[Anabel Conde]] who came second for Spain at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995]]) wore green dresses, while the shirtless male dancers wore black pants and held black feathers. Everyone had simple choreography except the male dancers who moved around the stage in a more complex way.

The spokesperson who revealed Andorra's votes for other countries was Ruth Gumbau, a journalist and [[Andorra Televisió|ATV]] presenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/4409|title=The 39 spokespersons!|last=Philips|first=Roel|date=2005-05-17|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elwert., 1983, v.32, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; near modern [[Kolobrzeg]] ([[West Pomeranian Voivodship]]) was a [[Viking Age]] [[Slavs|Slavic]]-[[Norsemen|Scandinavian]] settlement on the southern [[Baltic coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lübke, Das östliche Europa, Siedler, 2004, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harck1516&gt;Ole Harck, Christian Lübke, Zwischen Reric und Bornhöved: Die Beziehungen zwischen den Dänen und ihren slawischen Nachbarn vom 9. Bis ins 13. Jahrhundert: Beiträge einer internationalen Konferenz, Leipzig, 4.-6. Dezember 1997, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2001, pp.15,16, {{ISBN|3-515-07671-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the modern villages of [[Bardy, Poland|Bardy]] and [[Świelubie, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Świelubie]].

Bardy-Świelubie differs from other emporia: The location is rather far from the coastline, and Bardy was built before 800, making it one of the earliest Slavic [[burgh]]s in the coastal area. Archaeological findings indicate participation in [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] trade, but evidence of non-Slavic presence is missing for this early stage.&lt;ref name=Harck1516/&gt;

In the 9th century, Scandinavians (men and women) settled the site, as is evident from the adjacent [[Hügelgrab]] grave field in [[Świelubie]].&lt;ref name=Harck1516/&gt;&lt;ref name=Luebke58/&gt; The Scandinavian colony is estimated to have held between 50 and 70 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Luebke58&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=mFJpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bardy+slawisch&amp;q=bardy+&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor Christian Lübke, Das östliche Europa, Siedler, 2004, p.58]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact site of the settlement, whether inside or close to the burgh, is not yet determined,&lt;ref name=Harck1516/&gt; A Slavic burgh as a predecessor for a Scandinavian settlement is not observed elsewhere, with the possible, but not yet evident exception of [[Wollin (town)|Wollin]].&lt;ref name=Harck1516/&gt;

Bardy-Świelubie was vacated in the late 9th century, when the [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|Slavic grad]] of [[Kołobrzeg]] became the new center of the region.&lt;ref name=Harck1516/&gt;

'''Bosnian Austrians''' (locally and colloquially known as '''Esterajheri''') are [[citizens]] of [[Austria]] whose ancestry can be traced to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The vast majority of [[Bosnians]] emigrated to Austria during and after the [[Bosnian War]] of the 1990s, though a large number emigrated as early as the 19th century.

==Communities==
The largest Bosnian communities in Austria are found in [[Graz]], [[Linz]] and [[Wels]]; followed by [[Salzburg]], [[Villach]],  and [[Vienna]].

A historic moment for the Bosnians of Austria took place on 29 June 2013 in the city of Wels. The Trg Bošnjaka (Bosniak Square) was opened in front of the Bosnian Austrian Cultural Center as a token of appreciation and the good cooperation between Bosnian Austrians and the city administration.

==Demographics==
According to the population census for 2014 conducted by "Statistik Austria" (Austrian federal agency for statistics), the total number of people of Bosnian background in Austria was 155,050 and they comprised 1.9% of the total population. As of 2017, some 41,000 Bosnians lived in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/pdf/menschen2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chŏnsa''''' is the first level [[Comparative military ranks of Korea|military rank]] of [[North Korea]].  It is a combined title held by [[soldier]]s, [[airman]], and [[seaman]] equivalent to an E-1 on most western military rank scales.  

The insignia for ''chŏnsa'' consists of a bare shoulder strap or collar tab.  The rank is typically held by conscripts and new recruits with six months to a year required in grade before promotion.

The '''[[coat of arms]]''' used by the 
'''[[United Arab Republic]]''' featured the [[Pan-Arab colours]] of the [[flag of the United Arab Republic]] (in vertical form) on a shield carried by the [[Eagle of Saladin (heraldry)|Eagle of Saladin]].  Below, a green scroll has the Arabic text for "United Arab Republic" الجمهورية العربية المتحدة ''al-Ǧumhūriyyah al-ʿArabiyyah al-Muttaḥidah''.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Flag Book in Color'' by Christian Fogd Pedersen (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the union of Egypt and Syria ended in 1961, Egypt retained the name "United Arab Republic" and continued to use this coat of arms, until the [[Federation of Arab Republics]] project caused a change in 1972.

'''Commentary on Edward Snowden's disclosure''' is part of the [[reactions to global surveillance disclosures]] made by [[Edward Snowden]].

==Executive branch==
On June 8, 2013, [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) [[James R. Clapper]] denounced as "reckless" the disclosures of "intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe."&lt;ref name="probereq"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/09/us-usa-security-clapper-idUSBRE9570GL20130609 |title= Spy agency seeks criminal probe into leaks |last1=Gardner |first1=Timothy |first2=Mark |last2=Hosenball |date=June 9, 2013 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the leaks as having done "huge, grave damage" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.&lt;ref name="washclapper"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/09/clapper-leaks-are-literally-gut-wrenching-leaker-being-sought/ |title=Clapper: Leaks are 'literally gut-wrenching,' leaker being sought |first1=Aaron |last1=Blake |date=June 9, 2013 |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was dismissive of Snowden, saying, "I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama downplays Snowden case, says US not 'scrambling jets' to get 'hacker'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/27/obama-downplays-snowden-case-says-us-not-scrambling-jets-to-get-hacker/|newspaper=Fox News|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pecquet|first=Julian|title=US won't 'scramble jets' to capture 'hacker' Snowden, Obama says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/global-affairs/africa/308117-obama-wont-scramble-jets-to-capture-hacker-snowden|newspaper=The Hill|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans would have been better off if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed.&lt;ref name=CNN081313&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Z. Byron|title=Fact-checking Obama's claims about Snowden|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower|publisher=CNN|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also said that he had "called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, and I think the American people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place."&lt;ref name=CNN081313/&gt;

On August 4, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Martin Dempsey]] said on the weekly ABC interview show ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' that Snowden "has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate."&lt;ref name="ThisWeek"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/joint-chiefs-chairman-gen-martin-dempsey-week-19865953. |title=Transcript for Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey on 'This Week' |date=August 4, 2013 |first=Martha |last=Raddatz |work=ABC News 'This Week' |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, DNI Clapper acknowledged that Snowden may have done a public service and started a needed debate about the balance between privacy and security.
"As loath as I am to give any credit for what's happened here, which was egregious, I think it's clear that some of the conversations that this has generated, some of the debate, actually probably needed to happen," he said. "It's unfortunate they didn't happen some time ago, but if there's a good side to this, that's it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waterman|first=Shaun|title=Congress will rein in NSA's domestic snooping, predicts top U.S. intel official|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/us-spy-congress-rein-in-nsa-domestic-snooping/|accessdate=September 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|title=Clapper: Snowden case brings healthy debate; more disclosures to come|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-clapper-snowden-disclosures-20130912,0,7438979.story|accessdate=September 15, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2014, DNI Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He asked that "Snowden and his accomplices" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word "accomplices" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, "Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs."&lt;ref&gt;

===Former executive branch officials===
In late June 2013, Former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] said: "He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far ... I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Tom (June 30, 2013). [http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/28/us/snowden-lawyer-offer "Father proposes deal for Snowden's voluntary return"], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier that month, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] suggested that Snowden might be a spy working for the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden is a 'traitor' and possible spy for China – Dick Cheney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/16/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-traitor-cheney|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former U.S. intelligence officials speculated that Chinese or Russian intelligence agents might have gleaned additional classified material from Snowden,&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, John R. (June 27, 2013). [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/snowden-the-us-russian-spywar-8668 "Snowden in the U.S.-Russian 'SpyWar'"].

[[Stewart Baker]], a former NSA general counsel in the early 1990s, said at a July 18, 2013 hearing, "I am afraid that hyped and distorted press reports orchestrated by Edward Snowden and his allies may cause us – or other nations – to construct new restraints on our intelligence gathering, restraints that will leave us vulnerable to another security disaster."&lt;ref name="wapo717hearing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-committee-holds-hearing-on-nsa-surveillance-programs/2013/07/17/ffc3056c-eee3-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html|title=Lawmakers of both parties voice doubts about NSA surveillance programs|date=July 17, 2013|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=William|last=Branigin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA and NSA chief [[General Michael Hayden]] in late June 2013 welcomed the public debate about the balance between privacy and security that the leaks had provoked: "I am convinced the more the American people know exactly what it is we are doing in this balance between privacy and security, the more they know the more comfortable they will feel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/30/former-cia-nsa-chief-michael-hayden-open-spy-progr/ Former CIA, NSA chief Michael Hayden: Open spy programs to reassure U.S. public], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', June 30, 2013.

Speaking at the [[University of Connecticut]] on April 23, 2014, former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] insinuated that she found Snowden's motives suspicious. "When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was puzzled because we have all these protections for whistle-blowers. If he were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have been," she said. "But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships, to put it mildly." Clinton added, "I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/defense/hillary-clinton-edward-snowden-s-leaks-helped-terrorists-20140425 |title=Hillary Clinton: Edward Snowden's Leaks Helped Terrorists |publisher=NationalJournal.com |date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) said on the August 11 edition of ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' that Snowden had become a hero to young Americans, as he reminded them of the [[Jason Bourne]] character.

The editors of [[Bloomberg News]] argued that, while the government ought to prosecute Snowden, the media's focus on Snowden took attention away from issues of U.S. government surveillance, the interpretations of the [[Patriot Act]], and the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) court actions, all of which are "what really matters in all this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editors |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-24/this-is-not-about-edward-snowden.html |title=This Is Not About Edward Snowden |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald accused the media in the U.S. of focusing on Edward Snowden instead of on wrongdoing by [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R.

Cybersecurity scholar [[P. W. Singer|Peter Singer]] divided the material disclosed by Snowden into three categories: "smart, useful espionage against enemies of the United States; legally questionable activities that involved US citizens through backdoors and fudging of policy/law; un-strategic (stupid) actions targeting American allies that has had huge blowback on US standing and US business."

That has huge long-term consequences. And the second is, it's been and will be a hammer-blow to American technology companies.

===Public opinion polls===
Surveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures, and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S.

====United States====
=====2013=====
*June 10–11, 2013: [[Gallup Poll|Gallup]] poll showed 44 percent of Americans thought it was right for Snowden to share the information with the press while 42 percent thought it was wrong.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/163043/americans-disapprove-government-surveillance-programs.aspx|title=Americans Disapprove of Government Surveillance Programs|newspaper=Gallup|first= Frank |last=Newport|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*November 14–17: ''The Washington Post''-ABC News poll found a significant shift in opinion as to whether or not Snowden ought to be charged with a crime. In contrast to the same organizations' June poll, November's results showed 52 percent favoring his prosecution (up from 43 percent) and 38 percent opposed (down from 48 percent). Similarly, when asked whether, irrespective of his being charged with a crime, Snowden was right or wrong to disclose the NSA intelligence-gathering efforts, 37 percent said he was right and 55 percent said he was wrong. All told, nearly two to one (60 percent versus 32 percent) thought Snowden's disclosures had harmed U.S. national security.&lt;ref name="WaPoPollNov2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/21/National-Politics/Polling/release_277.xml?uuid=76wqAlJpEeOe5iWACG2CVA |title=Snowden and the NSA - November 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2014=====
*January 15–19: ''USA Today''/Pew Research poll reported little change from the previous June on the question of the government pursuing a criminal case against Snowden, with 56 percent in favor and 32 percent opposed. The poll found that people younger than 30 offered the least support for prosecution, being evenly divided at 42 percent in favor and 42 percent opposed. Over all age groups, opinion was also nearly equally divided as to whether or not Snowden's disclosures had served the public interest: 45 percent said yes, while 43 percent said Snowden harmed the public interest.&lt;ref name="PewJan2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/01/20/obamas-nsa-speech-has-little-impact-on-skeptical-public/ |title=Obama's NSA Speech Has Little Impact on Skeptical Public |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*January 18–20: ''The Economist''/YouGov poll likewise found Americans evenly split, with 43 percent viewing Snowden favorably and 41 percent unfavorably; 46 percent approving his leaks and 43 percent disapproving; 28 percent supporting his prosecution and 29 percent opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll Results: Snowden |url=http://today.yougov.com/news/2014/01/22/poll-results-snowden/ |publisher=[[YouGov]] |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*January 22: [[CBS News]] poll revealed a larger split (almost 3:1) as to whether or not Snowden ought to stand trial for his actions, with 61 percent in favor and 23 percent saying he should be granted amnesty. CBS News also differed from Pew Research on the issue of whether or not Snowden's disclosures had been good for the country, with 40 percent saying yes and 46 percent saying it had been bad. When asked to come up with a word that best describes Snowden, nearly a quarter of respondents volunteered either "traitor" or a similar word questioning his loyalty to his country, while 8 percent said he is "brave" or "courageous" or "a hero." Just 2 percent volunteered that he is a "patriot" or "patriotic," and another 2 percent said "terrorist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Most think Edward Snowden should stand trial in U.S. |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-most-think-edward-snowden-should-stand-trial-in-us/|publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*June 1: An NBC News poll of registered voters found that 34 percent opposed Snowden's leaks, 24 percent backed him and another 40 percent had no opinion. Among those who closely followed the story, 49 percent opposed his actions and 33 percent supported them.

==Media==
On January 1, 2014, the editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Snowden as a whistleblower and wrote in favor of granting him clemency, arguing that while Snowden may have broken the law, he had "done his country a great service" by bringing the abuses of the NSA to light. "When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law," they wrote, "that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government." ''The Times'' cast doubt on the claim made by Snowden's critics that he had damaged national security, and concluded with a request to President Obama to discontinue the "vilification" of Snowden and to give him "an incentive to return home."&lt;ref name=NYTWhistleblower&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/opinion/edward-snowden-whistle-blower.html |title=Edward Snowden, Whistle-Blower |author=Editorial Board of ''The New York Times'' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/01/02/does-edward-snowden-deserve-clemency/4288535/ |title=Rieder: Why Edward Snowden should get clemency |work=USA Today |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article garnered an unusual amount of blowback for an editorial, with responses from multiple media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/weeks-in-the-making-an-editorial-on-snowden-may-go-beyond-what-is-realistic/ |work=The New York Times |first=Margaret |last=Sullivan |title=Weeks in the Making, an Editorial on Snowden May Go ‘Beyond What Is Realistic' |date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' called for a pardon in an editorial coincidentally published the same day, saying Snowden should be allowed to return home with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/snowden-affair-case-for-pardon-editorial |title=Snowden affair: the case for a pardon |work=The Guardian |date=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Satter |first=Raphael |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2-newspapers-calls-clemency-edward-snowden |title=2 newspapers call for clemency for Edward Snowden |work=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106091023/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2-newspapers-calls-clemency-edward-snowden |archivedate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 4, 2014 article, [[Peter Baker (author)|Peter Baker]] of ''The New York Times'' laid out the polarization of opinions throughout the U.S. and the impetus toward clemency gained by public reaction to Snowden's revelations. Yet despite a growing backlash against government surveillance, Baker noted, calls for leniency had made little headway in the White House, Justice Department, or national security establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Peter, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/moves-to-curb-spying-help-drive-the-clemency-argument-for-snowden.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20140105 Moves to Curb Spying Help Drive the Clemency Argument for Snowden]," ''The New York Times'', January 5, 2014, page A16&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the editorial board of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' characterized the issue of whether Snowden deserved a presidential pardon as "a complicated question" to which the president's answer should be "no".&lt;ref name="No Pardon"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/edward-snowden-doesnt-deserve-a-pardon/2016/09/17/ec04d448-7c2e-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html |title=No pardon for Edward Snowden |author=''Washington Post'' Editorial Board |date=September 17, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the ''Post'' credited Snowden for "necessary reforms" brought about by his revelations of ''en masse'' collection of telephone data by the NSA, but stressed Snowden's separate leak of information about the agency's [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program and other "basically defensible" intelligence operations as reasons why he should face trial, saying that Snowden hurt his credibility as "an avatar of freedom" by accepting asylum in Russia.&lt;ref name="No Pardon"/&gt; The editors of the ''Post'' dismissed calls from human-rights organizations for clemency because of Snowden's "noble purposes" and the policy changes resulting from the leaks, and urged the president not to pardon Snowden despite the ''Post'' itself being responsible for publishing some of the leaked material.&lt;ref name="Post says"&gt;{{cite news |author=Greenslade, Roy |date=September 19, 2016 |title=Washington Post says Obama should not pardon whistleblower Ed Snowden |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/19/washington-post-says-obama-should-not-pardon-whistleblower-ed-snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Guardian'', the editorial stunned many American journalists.&lt;ref name="Post says"/&gt; Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists to whom Snowden had initially leaked the classified documents, characterized the ''Post'' editorial as "an act of journalistic treachery" and "cowardice", noting that the ''Post'' had accepted a [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service|Pulitzer Prize]] for publishing Snowden's leaks concerning PRISM and the other operations mentioned in its editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/09/18/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-after-accepting-pulitzer/ |title=WashPost Makes History: First Paper to Call for Prosecution of Its Own Source (After Accepting Pulitzer) |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |date=September 18, 2016 |website=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental organizations==
[[File:Navanethem Pillay.jpg|thumb|[[Navi Pillay]], the United Nations' [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said: "Without prejudging the validity of any asylum claim by Snowden, I appeal to all States to respect the internationally guaranteed [[Right of asylum|right to seek asylum]]."&lt;ref name="unitednationshr"/&gt;]]
After [[Amnesty International]] met Edward Snowden in Moscow in mid July 2013, the organization said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What he has disclosed is patently in the public interest and as a whistleblower his actions were justified. He has exposed unlawful sweeping surveillance programmes that unquestionably interfere with an individual’s right to privacy. States that attempt to stop a person from revealing such unlawful behaviour are flouting international law. [[Freedom of expression]] is a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/amnesty-international-meets-us-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-07-12 Amnesty International meets US whistleblower Edward Snowden] July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Widney Brown, Senior Director of Amnesty, feared that Snowden would be at "great risk" of human rights violations if forcibly transferred to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA must not hunt down whistleblower Edward Snowden|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-hunt-down-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-06-24|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged no country to return Snowden to the US. Michael Bochenek, Director of Law and Policy at Amnesty International deplored the US pressure on governments to block Snowden's asylum attempts, saying "It is his unassailable right, enshrined in international law".&lt;ref name="amnesty1"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-persecute-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-07-02 USA must not persecute whistleblower Edward Snowden] July 2, 2013 Amnesty&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] said that if Snowden were able to raise the issue of NSA [[mass surveillance]] without facing espionage charges, he would not have left the United States in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US: Protect National Security Whistleblowers|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/18/us-protect-national-security-whistleblowers|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch writes that any country where Snowden seeks asylum should consider his claim fairly and protect his rights under international law, which recognizes that revealing official secrets is sometimes justified in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/03/countries-should-consider-snowden-s-asylum-claim-fairly Countries Should Consider Snowden’s Asylum Claim Fairly"].

[[Navi Pillay]], the United Nations [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said: "Snowden's case has shown the need to protect persons disclosing information on matters that have implications for human rights, as well as the importance of ensuring respect for the right to privacy".&lt;ref name="unitednationshr"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN rights chief urges protection for individuals revealing human rights violations|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?Cr=asylum&amp;NewsID=45399#.Uf7eH6y_S28|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblowers ===
[[Daniel Ellsberg]], the whistleblower and leaker of the top-secret [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971, stated in an interview with CNN that he thought Snowden had done an "incalculable" service to his country and that his leaks might prevent the United States from becoming a surveillance state. He said Snowden had acted with the same sort of courage and patriotism as a soldier in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Malley |first=Nick |title=NSA leaker reveals himself after fleeing US |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 10, 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/nsa-leaker-reveals-himself-after-fleeing-us-20130610-2nz6h.html |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed the following morning, Ellsberg added that "there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden's release of NSA material ... including the Pentagon Papers."&lt;ref name="ellsbergstasi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel |title=Edward Snowden: saving us from the United Stasi of America |work=The Guardian |date=June 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray McGovern]], a retired CIA officer turned political activist, agreed with Ellsberg and added, "This time today I'm feeling much more hopeful for our democracy than I was feeling this time yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Noor |first=Jaisal |title=Former CIA Analyst: Snowden Did The Right Thing |newspaper=The Real News Network |date=June 11, 2013 |url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a whistleblower who disclosed details of the NSA's mass surveillance activities, said that Snowden had "performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing."  After Snowden cited a conversation with a "reliable source" about allegations that the US was "hacking into China", Binney felt he was "transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor."&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;Eisler, Peter; Page, Susan (June 16, 2013).

[[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]], former senior executive of NSA and whistleblower, said that he feels "extraordinary kinship" with Snowden. "What he did was a magnificent act of civil disobedience. He's exposing the inner workings of the surveillance state. And it's in the public interest.

[[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] hailed Snowden as a "hero" who has exposed "one of the most serious events of the decade – the creeping formulation of a mass surveillance state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Addley |first=Esther |title=Julian Assange praises Edward Snowden as a hero |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 10, 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/10/julian-assange-praises-edward-snowden |accessdate= June 10, 2013 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After charges against Snowden were revealed, Assange released a statement asking people to "step forward and stand with" Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Tom (June 22, 2013).

[[Shamai Leibowitz]], who leaked details about an FBI operation, said that the legal threats and "smear campaign" against Snowden are a "grave mistake" because "If the government really wanted to keep more secrets from coming out, they would do well to let this man of conscience go live his life in some other country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/blowback-white-house-whistleblowers Blowback from the White House's vindictive war on whistleblowers]."

He further explained that Snowden "had to escape the US to ensure any chance of freedom", claiming the US had made Snowden stateless by revoking his passport while in Russia, leading to his temporary asylum in the country. Drake praised Russia, saying it had "actually recognized the international law and granted him political asylum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/rt-whistleblowers-snowden-prize-983/ 'US unchained itself from constitution': Whistleblowers on RT after secret Snowden meeting — RT News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danièle Dupré''' (1927-2015) was a French singer from the 1950s, most notable for representing [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957 Eurovision Song Contest]] with her song ''[[Amours mortes (tant de peine)]]'' – Faded Love (So Much Pain) – where she finished in a tie for fourth.

A fairly minor star, her recordings occasionally appear on [[eBay]] and other places where EPs and [[Single (music)|45 RPM]] singles are sold, and appear occasionally on compilations of 1950s French music.

She spent some time in Brazil as a child. After returning to France, she appeared in a movie, ''La Parisienne'', and went on to receive operatic training. She apparently injured her voice during this training, turning to what was then considered light music.

She toured France, and was invited to perform in the Eurovision contest for Luxembourg. The contest had nowhere near the prestige it has today, and she was ambivalent about the song she was to perform. Like a few performers at the time, she only practiced her song once, at the pre-show rehearsal. At the competition, she met [[Paule Desjardins]], the [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|French]] contestant, with whom she maintained a long friendship.

Her recordings include several [[Extended Play|EP]]s for [[Polydor]] that include songs such as "Merci mon Dieu, La chanteuse de blues", "Mon vieux marin" (with the orchestra of [[Armand Migiani]]), "Paris-java", "Sarah", "Tu me donnes", "Une femme est jolie", "Mon coeur est un violin", "Marjolaine", "Patricia" and "La gommeuse de 1900".

She retired from the music business in 1958, realizing that [[rock and roll]] was eclipsing the music she performed. She turned to interior design, where her most notable work is in the terminal of the [[São Paulo]] airport. She gave an interview for the French [[OGAE]] (Eurovision fanclub) magazine in 1999 that was later translated into English and published in Eurosong News (the continent-wide OGAE magazine).

She died in 2015 at the age of 88.

==History==
[[File:DGAC HQ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DGAC Headquarters, 50 rue Henry-Farman, Paris 15th arr.]]
The Secretariat General for Civil and Commercial Aviation (SGACC) was formed on 12 September 1946 by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. The first secretary general of the newly-formed organisation was [[Max Hymans]] (1900-1961), who had been named to the post nine months previously in December 1945. 

The SGACC then formed the Light and Sport Aviation Office (SALS) to cover flying clubs and instructors. In 1955 SALS became the Aeronautic Instruction and Aerial Sport Service (SFASA).

From 1971 to 1976 the secretary general was [[Maurice Grimaud]].

In 1976, following the removal of the post of secretary general across the [[French Civil Service]], the SGAC was renamed the DGAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/archivesdgac-2.pdf DGAC archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent directors general include [[Michel Bernard (administrator)|Michel Bernard]] (1993) and [[Michel Wachenheim]] (2002-7).

In 1993 the headquarters of the organisation moved from 93 Boulevard du Montparnasse, that had been its home since its foundation in 1946, to its present site on Rue Henry-Farman.&lt;ref&gt;Plaque on the present DGAC building&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the [[Windward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]] archipelago in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The island is located near [[Guadeloupe]] to the northwest and [[Martinique]] to the south-southeast. Its area is {{Convert|750|km2|abbr=on}}, and the highest point is [[Morne Diablotins]], at {{Convert|1447|m|abbr=on}} in elevation. The population was 71,293 at the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="2011 census"/&gt; The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few [[republic]]s.

The island was originally inhabited by the [[Kalinago]] and later colonised by Europeans, predominantly by the French from the 1690s to 1763. Columbus is said to have passed the island on Sunday 3 November 1493, and the island's name is derived from the Latin for "Sunday". [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] took possession in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]], and it gradually established English as its official language. The island republic gained independence in 1978.

Its name is pronounced with emphasis on the third syllable, related to its French name of ''[[Dominique (given name)|Dominique]]''. Dominica has been nicknamed the "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" for its natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Evans &amp; [[Lennox Honychurch|L. Honychurch]], [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dominica-Nature-Island-Caribbean-Hansib/dp/1870518179 ''Dominica: Nature Island of the Caribbean'']. Hansib (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, and in fact it is still being formed by [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]-[[volcano|volcanic]] activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest [[hot spring]], called [[Boiling Lake]]. The island has lush mountainous [[rainforests]], and it is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are [[xeric]] areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The [[imperial amazon|Sisserou parrot]], also known as the imperial amazon and found only on Dominica, is the island's national bird and featured on the [[Flag of Dominica|national flag]], which is the only national flag in the world containing the color purple.

== History ==
{{main|History of Dominica}}

=== Early European contact ===
Dominica's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the [[Island Carib]] people. They had named it ''Wai‘tu kubuli'', which means "Tall is her body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |title=Discover Dominica: an introduction to our Caribbean island |publisher=Dominica.dm |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923082054/http://dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]], sailing for Spain, named the island as Dominica, after the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''dies Dominica'' for [[Sunday]], the day on which the Spanish first saw it in November 1493. Some Spanish colonizers settled here. But, as European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers. They went to other areas that were easier to control and had more natural resources.

=== French colony ===
Spain had little success in colonising Dominica. In 1632, the French [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique]] claimed it and other ''"Petites Antilles"'' for [[Kingdom of France|France]], but no physical occupation took place. Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island.

In 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] should not be settled, but left to the Carib as neutral territory. But its natural resources attracted expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber.&lt;ref name="bn"&gt;"Background note: Dominica". [[U.S. Department of State]] (July 2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to ''Dominique'', as they called it in French.

In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé,&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Emmer &amp; BW Highman, (1999) ''General History of the Caribbean: Methodology and Historiography of the Caribbean,'' volume 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E12cpltazYgC&amp;lpg=PA637 p. 637]&lt;/ref&gt; caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up [[smallholding]]s. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, [[M. Le Grand]], took charge of the island with a basic French government. Dominique formally became a [[colony]] of France, and the island was divided into districts or "quarters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |title=Important Dates in Dominica's History |publisher=Lennox Honychurch |date=1990-07-05 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830091704/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |archivedate=30 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French had already developed plantation agriculture on  Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated [[sugarcane]] with enslaved African workers. In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations. They imported so many African [[slaves]] to fill the labour demands that the population became predominantly African in ethnicity.

In 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe, a [[British expedition against Dominica]] led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Andrew Rollo]] conquered the island, along with several other Caribbean islands. In 1763, France had lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. The same year, the British established a [[legislative assembly]], with only European colonists represented. French remained the official language, but [[Antillean Creole]], which had developed from it, was spoken by most of the population.

In 1778 the French, with the active co-operation of the population, began the [[Invasion of Dominica (1778)|Invasion of Dominica]]. This was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which returned the island to British control. But the island population, especially the class of [[gens de couleur|free people of color]], resisted British restrictions. The British retained control through French invasions in 1795 and 1805,&lt;ref name="bn" /&gt; the first taking place during the period of the [[Haitian Revolution]], which gained the independence of Haiti (formerly Saint-Domingue, France's richest Caribbean colony).

=== British colony ===
[[File:Agostino Brunias - Linen Market, Dominica - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|A linen market in 1770s Dominica]]
Great Britain established a small colony in 1805. It used Dominica as part of the [[triangular trade]], by which slaves were imported and sold as labour in the islands as part of a trade that included producing and shipping sugar and coffee as commodity crops to Europe. The best documented slave plantation on the island is Hillsborough Estate, which had 71 male and 68 female slaves.&lt;!-- when? --&gt;  The [[Quarry Bank Mill|Greg]] family were notable: Thomas Hodgson, a brother-in-law, owned a slave ship, and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg were part-owners of [[sugar plantation]]s on Dominica.  In January 1814, 20 slaves absconded from Hillsborough. They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females. The slaves reportedly said that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital, and they believed he had been poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0115/RCMS+266|title=Janus: Dominica Estate documents|website=janus.lib.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0cXAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA211 |title=Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter, volume 3|author=London Society for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions|year=1831}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferred political and social rights on [[free black]]s (mostly [[free people of colour]], who generally were of [[mixed race]], with African and European ancestry). With the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of 1833]], Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout [[British Empire|its empire]], except in India, where it was considered part of the culture.

With freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica. Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first colony of the [[British West Indies]] to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of color and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English [[plantation|planter]] class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one made up of one-half members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters, who were allied with colonial administrators, outmaneuvered the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. The political power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded. [[Crown colony]] government was re-established in 1896. All political rights were curtailed for people of colour and blacks, who were the overwhelming majority of the population. Development aid, offered as compensation for disfranchisement, resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;&lt;!--expand - needs population numbers so readers can understand proportions--&gt;

=== History post-1900 ===
In [[World War I]], many Dominiquais, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements#British West Indies|Representative Government Association]]. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Island Administration]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; During [[World War II]], some Dominiquais volunteered in British and Caribbean forces. Thousands of [[Free French]] refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled French islands. They stayed in [[Roseau]] and other villages.

Until 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the [[British Windward Islands]]. Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; After the federation dissolved, in 1967 Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom, and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. On 3 November 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence as a [[republic]], led by Prime Minister [[Patrick John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1031/contents/made|title=The Dominica Termination of Association Order 1978|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. After the 1980 elections, it was replaced by a government led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]]. She was the Caribbean's first female prime minister. Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe damages of hurricanes in [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season|1979]] and in 1980.

In 1981, Dominica was threatened with a takeover by [[mercenaries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3376.html |title=Caribbean Islands – Regional Security Threats, 1970–81 |publisher=Country-data.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Operation Red Dog]], led by Mike Perdue and [[Wolfgang Droege]]. They tried to overthrow Charles as Prime Minister and reinstall ex-Prime Minister John in exchange for control over the country's development. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] was also jailed for his part in the attempt, which violated US [[Neutrality Act of 1794|neutrality]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Pigs-Audacious-Tropical-Criminal/dp/0470153822 Stewart Bell, ''Bayou of Pigs''], presents the story of the planned coup.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1980s, the economy recovered. It weakened again in the 1990s due to a decrease in [[banana]] prices.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In the January 2000 elections, the Edison James [[United Workers' Party (Dominica)|United Workers Party]] (UWP) was defeated by the [[Dominica Labour Party|Dominican Labour Party]] (DLP), led by [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt P. "Rosie" Douglas]]. Douglas died after only a few months in office. He was replaced by Pierre Charles, who died in office in January 2004. [[Roosevelt Skerrit]], also of the DLP, replaced Charles as Prime Minister. Under Prime Minister Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-member Parliament, to the UWP's 8 seats. An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well. Later, the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle, making the total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In the December 2009 elections, DLP won 18 of 21 seats. UWP claimed campaign improprieties and boycotted Parliament; by-elections were conducted for two of its seats in July 2010, and the UWP again won the seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm |title=U.S. Department of State Background Note on Dominica|publisher=State.gov |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2012 [[Eliud Williams|Eliud Thaddeus Williams]] was sworn in as President, replacing Dr Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health.
On 30 September 2013, former Trade Union Leader and agitator Charles Savarin was elected President having only days before resigned as a Minister of Government.

On 18 September 2017, Dominica suffered a direct landfall from Category 5 [[Hurricane Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hurricane Maria 'devastates' Dominica: PM|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41317164|website=BBC News|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early estimates of damage suggested 90% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed, with infrastructure left in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dominica devastation emerges with fatalities and '90% of buildings destroyed'|url=http://wicnews.com/caribbean/dominica-devastation-emerges-fatalities-90-buildings-destroyed-44575828/|website=WIC News|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41394645|title=Dominica grieves after Hurricane Maria|first=Gemma|last=Handy|date=25 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, France and the Netherlands set up shipping and air lifts to take aid to the island; the scale of destruction having left most people homeless and desperate.

{{main|Geography of Dominica}}
&lt;!---Note:Before adding anything to this section make sure it's already in the main "Geography of Dominica" article---&gt;

Dominica is an [[island nation]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], the northernmost of the [[Windward Islands]] (though it is sometimes considered the southernmost of the [[Leeward Islands]]). The size of the country is about {{convert|289.5|sqmi|km²}}.

Dominica is largely covered by [[rainforest]] and is home to the world's second-largest [[hot spring]], [[Boiling Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominica.gov.dm/cms/index.php?q=node/520 |title=Between Two Reunions: Boiling Lake, 1988 to 2008 &amp;#124; |publisher=The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica's Official Website |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominica has many waterfalls, springs, and rivers. The [[Calibishie]] area in the country's northeast has sandy beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calibishiecoast.com/en/phototour.htm |title=A Photo Tour of the Calibishie Coast |publisher=Calibishiecoast.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Durand and Bertrand Jno. Baptiste, [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/userfiles/file/IBAs/CaribCntryPDFs/dominica.pdf "Dominica"] (Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division).&lt;/ref&gt; The island has several [[protected area]]s, including [[List of national parks of Dominica|Cabrits National Park]], as well as 365 rivers.

[[Morne Trois Pitons National Park]] is a tropical forest blended with volcanic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/814 |title=Morne Trois Pitons National Park by World Heritage Sites |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=7 December 1997 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised as a [[World Heritage Site]] on 4 April 1995, a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pitons|St. Lucia]] (2004), [[Brimstone Hill|Saint Kitts]] (1999), Hispaniola (Dominican Republic [1990]/Haiti [1982]) and Cuba (multiple).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with [[Venezuela]] over Venezuela's territorial claims to the sea surrounding [[Isla Aves]] (literally Bird Island, but in fact called Bird Rock by Dominica authorities),&lt;ref name="MitchellGold1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlyle L.

There are two primary population centres: Roseau (with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011) and [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]] (with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011).

Dominica, known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in the world possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Keith |title=Life in the Caribbean |year=2010 |publisher=New Africa Press |isbn=978-9987160150 |page=288 |id= {{ASIN|9987160158|country=uk}} }} p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands. More recently,{{when|date=May 2017}} the citizens of this island have sought to preserve the natural environment by discouraging the type of high-impact tourism which has damaged nature in other parts of the Caribbean.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Visitors can find large tropical forests, including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, hundreds of streams, coastlines and coral reefs.

Dominica is home to local artisans and traditional craftsman who cater to tourists, although not a thriving high end art scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[Imperial amazon|Sisserou parrot]] (''Amazona imperialis'') is Dominica's national bird and is [[endemism|endemic]] to its mountain forests. A related species, the Jaco or [[red-necked parrot]] (''A. arausiaca''), is also a Dominican endemic. Both birds are rare and protected, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.

The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many [[cetacean]]s. Most notably a group of [[sperm whale]]s live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[pantropical spotted dolphin]]s and [[bottlenose dolphin]]s. Less commonly seen animals include [[killer whales]], [[false killer whale]]s, [[pygmy sperm whale]]s, [[dwarf sperm whale]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[common dolphin]]s, [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]]s, [[humpback whales]] and [[Bryde's whale]]s. This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in [[whale-watching]].

Dominica is especially vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region. In 1979, [[Hurricane David]] struck the island as a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane, causing widespread and extreme damage. On 17 August 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]], a Category&amp;nbsp;1 hurricane at the time, hit the island.  A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a [[landslide]] caused by the heavy rains crushed their house.&lt;ref name="Forbes Haiti preps"&gt;{{cite news | title =  Hurricane Dean Gains Caribbean Strength | author = Jonathan Katz | agency = Associated Press | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/18/ap4033014.html | date = 18 August 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-18 | work=Forbes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house.&lt;ref name="cbc_2007-08-17"&gt;{{cite web |date=17 August 2007|title=Hurricane claims one life in St. Lucia and possibly two in Dominica|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Dominica|Prime Minister]] [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop.&lt;ref name="cbc_2007-08-17_02"&gt;{{cite web |date=17 August 2007|title=Dominica Badly Affected|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, [[Tropical Storm Erika]] caused extensive flooding and landslides across the island.

Dominica is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name="English_constitution" /&gt; The capital is [[Roseau]]. The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few [[republic]]s. The president is the [[head of state]], while executive power rests with the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], headed by the [[prime minister]].&lt;ref name="English_constitution" /&gt; The [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] consists of the 30-member [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]], which consists of 21 directly elected members and nine senators, who may either be appointed by the president or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.&lt;ref name="English_constitution" /&gt;

Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a [[Commonwealth realm]], instead becoming a republic on independence. Dominica is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

Dominica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of protection for the US military, as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]. In January 2008 Dominica joined the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 2008, Dominica had one of the lowest [[per capita]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) rates of Eastern Caribbean states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm|title=(Dominica 07/08, U.S. State Dept.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOECS/Resources/Dominica.AAG.pdf|title=(World Bank 'At A Glance')|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004, but Dominica's economy grew by 3.5% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2006, following a decade of poor performance. Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism, construction, offshore and other services, and some sub-sectors of the banana industry. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) recently praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms. The IMF also pointed out remaining challenges, including the need for further reductions in public debt, increased financial sector regulation, and market diversification.&lt;ref name="bn" /&gt;

Bananas and other agriculture dominate Dominica's economy, and nearly one-third of the labour force works in agriculture. This sector, however, is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices. In 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]] caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country's infrastructure, especially roads. In response to reduced [[European Union]] (EU) banana [[trade preference]]s, the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee, [[patchouli]], [[aloe vera]], cut flowers, and exotic fruits such as mango, guava, and papaya.

The expected increase of Dominica’s [[Immigrant investor programs|Citizenship by Investment]] (CBI) fees has been suspended with no implementation date in sight, as announced by Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, in the 2016 budget speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntltrust.com/news/2016/7/28/no-fee-increase-for-dominica-cip No Fee Increase for Dominica CIP]. ntltrust.com (2016-7-28)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International trade ===
Dominica is a beneficiary of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] (CBI) that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods. Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).&lt;ref name="bn" /&gt;

=== Financial services industry ===
The Commonwealth of Dominica is becoming in recent years a major international financial centre. The largest sectors are "[[offshore banking]], [[payment processing]] companies, and general corporate activities". Regulation and supervision of the [[financial services]] industry is the responsibility of the [[Financial Service Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica]] (FSU) under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. There are a number of service providers. These include global financial institutions including [[Scotiabank]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Cathedral Investment Bank]], [[First Caribbean International Bank]], and The Interoceanic Bank of the Caribbean.

Starting in the mid-late 1990s, [[offshore financial centres]], such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, came under increasing pressure from the [[OECD]] for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other [[financial centres]] on a "black list" and impose sanctions against them.&lt;ref name="Rogoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html |title=Haven or havoc? |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Commonwealth of Dominica successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.&lt;ref name="Rogoff" /&gt;

Dominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies locating from abroad. It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces, although it is known many [[Internet]] businesses and [[hedge fund]]s utilise Dominica for this reason. However, on 12 July 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbip.mf.gov.pl/bip/14227.html |title=Ministerstwo Finansów |publisher=Mf.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship by Investment Programme ===
The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated [[economic citizenship]] to those seeking a valid second citizenship. The nationality law of Dominica authorises the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for an investment into they country's economy. The required contribution for a main applicant starts at US$100,000 through the Economic Diversification Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cbiu.gov.dm/investment-options/economic-diversification-fund/|title=Economic Diversification Fund - Dominica|work=Dominica|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Alternatively, since 2014, applicants can make a US$200,000 minimum investment in pre-approved real estate from island exclusive resorts or global brands like Marriott, Kempinski or Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Dominica Citizenship by Investment Unit website http://cbiu.gov.dm/&lt;/ref&gt; According to officials, the [[citizenship by investment]] (CBI) programme was an economic and fiscal "lifeline" in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and Hurricane Maria in 2017, and its new investment option had become the main source of Foreign Direct Investment into Dominica by early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/general/dominicas-citizenship-programme-main-source-of-fdi-officials-say/ "Dominica’s Citizenship Programme 'Main Source of FDI', Officials Say"], Dominica News Online, 16 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Dominican citizens can travel without a visa, or obtain a visa upon entry, to nearly 140 countries and territories, including the United Kingdom and the Schengen Zone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goccp.com/ENG/travel.htm|title=Dominica Passport Visa Free Travel - Dominica Visa Free Countries|website=www.goccp.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents as the first step in the application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbiu.gov.dm/citizenship/authorised-agents/|title=Authorised CBIU Agents – Government Approved CBIU Agents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is currently valued at 16% of the government's total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/international/2018/09/29/selling-citizenship-is-big-business-and-controversial|title=Selling citizenship is big business—and controversial|journal=The Economist|date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's management of the economic citizenship programme and an initial perceived lack of transparency in the use of the revenues generated are a frequent topic of heated domestic political controversy. Referring to the opposition, Prime Minister Skerrit in 2016 stated that "If they can discredit the Citizenship by Investment Program and make Dominica an unattractive place to obtain citizenship, then revenues would fall and the government would not be able to rebuild the country. Or, the government would then have to increase taxes on the people; making itself unpopular in their sight."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/politics/full-speech-of-pm-skerrit-at-dlp-meeting-in-st-joseph/ "Full speech of PM Skerrit at DLP meeting in St. Joseph"], Dominica News Online, 3 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Government of Dominica has improved transparency of CBI funds. According to Prime Minister Skerrit's 2018-2019 Budget Address&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/general/full-budget-speech-of-prime-minister-roosevelt-skerrit/|title=Full budget speech of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit – Dominica News Online|website=dominicanewsonline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the island's CBI Programme has helped develop a National Health Insurance pilot that provides Dominican children in critical medical conditions with overseas treatment. Because many residents were displaced by Hurricane Maria's impact on the small Caribbean island, the government pledged to build 5,000 hurricane-proof homes, of which the first batch of 125 houses are scheduled for occupancy in February 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/first-phase-of-cbi-funded-housing-projects-ready-for-occupation-in-february-2019/|title=First phase of CBI-funded housing projects ready for occupation in February 2019 – Dominica News Online|website=dominicanewsonline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The CBI Programme also helps develop significantly the island's eco-tourism sector and creating jobs along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cbiu.gov.dm/how-dominicas-cbi-is-changing-the-lives-of-its-citizens/|title=How Dominica’s CBI is Changing the Lives of its Citizens - Dominica|date=2018-08-06|work=Dominica|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Skerrit administration sets aside EC$5m every month for the construction of a new airport&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/economy-development/land-acquisition-begins-for-international-airport-pm-skerrit/|title=Land acquisition begins for international airport – PM Skerrit – Dominica News Online|website=dominicanewsonline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/08/30/getting-over-hurricane-maria|title=Getting over Hurricane Maria|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Financial Times' Professional Wealth Management publication ranked Dominica as the [http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MISC_344359.html world's best citizenship by investment programme] in its annual CBI Index&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbiindex.com/rankings/|title=CBI Index {{!}} Rankings of the Best Programmes|website=cbiindex.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the FT Specialist report, investors choose Dominica's citizenship because it has the most affordable investment threshold, the application process is straightforward and streamlined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwmnet.com/Special-Reports/The-CBI-Index-key-findings-Caribbean-continues-to-dominate|title=The CBI Index: key findings - Caribbean continues to dominate|last=Team|first=CBI Index Research|website=www.pwmnet.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the due diligence (i.e. the security checks each applicant is subjected to) remains very strict&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwmnet.com/Special-Reports/The-CBI-Index-the-due-diligence-process-in-the-Caribbean|title=The CBI Index: the due diligence process in the Caribbean|last=S-RM|first=Heyrick Bond Gunning, CEO of|website=www.pwmnet.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Tourism ===
Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches; therefore, [[Tourism in Dominica|tourism]] has developed more slowly than on neighbouring islands. Nevertheless, Dominica's mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs, waterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive [[eco-tourism]] destination. Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau, the capital.&lt;ref name="bn" /&gt; Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked, Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008 (55,800 or 0.3% of the total). This was about half as many as visited Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookings started to fall along with stock market|date=19 January 2009|author1=DeLollis, Barbara|author2=Hansen, Barbara|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanic nature of the island has attracted [[scuba diving|scuba divers]].

== Infrastructure ==
=== Air ===
There are two regional airports on the island, but no international airports. Therefore, flying to Dominica requires travelling through [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] or other nearby islands in the Caribbean such as [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], or [[Barbados]]. The primary airport, [[Douglas-Charles Airport]] (DOM), is on the northeast coast and is about a 45-minute drive from Portsmouth (1 hour from Roseau). The second is [[Canefield Airport]] (DCF), about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast. Douglas-Charles Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length. Douglas-Charles currently has regular service by [[Air Sunshine]], [[Winair]], [[Seaborne Airlines]] and [[LIAT]] using twin turboprop aircraft like the [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] &amp; [[Saab 340]], as well as [[Conviasa]] and [[Amerijet]], which, using [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727 Freighters]], is the only airline with jet service to the republic. A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Douglas-Charles Airport around 2006 and was finished in 2010. In March 2013, airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labour costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/american-eagle-worries/ |title=American Eagle worries |publisher=Dominica News Online |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roads ===
Dominica's road network runs primarily along the coastline and along river valleys. Major roads are two-lane highways which connect the capital, Roseau, with Portsmouth (Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway) and the Douglas Charles Airport (Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway). It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau. Private minibuses form the major public transport system. These major roads were recently reconstructed with assistance from the People's Republic of China and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/economy-development/completion-ceremony-of-edward-oliver-leblanc-highway-today/ |title=Completion ceremony of Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway Friday |publisher=Dominica News Online |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gov.dm/index.php/news/1948-dr-nicholas-liverpool-highway-officially-commissioned|title=Dr Nicholas Liverpool Highway Officially Commissioned |publisher=Dominica Government Information Service |date= |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Tropical Storm Erika, several road surfaces and bridges were damaged by flooding and landslides, including on the newly completed E.O. LeBlanc (Roseau to Portsmouth) and Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highways (Pont Cassé to Douglas Charles Airport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/emergency-bridges-being-developed-pm-says/ |title=Emergency bridges being developed PM says |publisher=Dominica News Online |date= |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green energy ===

Dominica's electricity sector includes power from hydroelectricity, solar energy, and geothermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/emergency-bridges-being-developed-pm-says/|title=Emergency Bridges Being Developed PM Says|publisher=Dominica News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Dominica}}

The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent. There is a growing mixed population along with a small European origin minority (descendants of French and British colonists along with some people of Irish descent) and there are small numbers of Lebanese, Syrians and Asians. Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native Kalinago (previously called Caribs), who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. {{As of|2014}} there are more than 3,000 Kalinago remaining. They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica. This special [[Carib Territory]] (now Kalinago Territory) was granted by the British Crown in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm |title=The Carib Indians |publisher=Avirtualdominica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also about 1,000 medical students from the United States and Canada who study at the [[Ross University School of Medicine|Ross University]] School of Medicine in Portsmouth.

The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to other countries. In the early 21st century, emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows: the United States (8,560), the United Kingdom (6,739), [[Canada]] (605) and France (394).

Dominica has a relatively large number of [[centenarian]]s. As of March 2007, there are 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitants—three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries.&lt;ref name=FOOC&gt;Pickford, John ''From Our Own Correspondent'' BBC Radio 4. First broadcast 31 March 2007. Dominica report 17'49" – 22'55"&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this are the subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine.

Dominica was partially integrated into the federal colony of the [[Leeward Islands]] in 1832. Later, in 1871, it became a full part of the Federation of the Leeward Islands. From the start it was a peculiar relationship for previously Dominica had played no part in the political or cultural traditions of the other more Anglophone islands of the federation. Now, as a Leeward Island, this much larger territory, with thousands of acres of forested unclaimed land, was open to the people of [[Montserrat]] and [[Antigua]]. At the beginning of the 20th century the Rose's Company, which produced [[Rose's lime juice]], saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat. Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate. As a result, there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica, [[Wesley, Dominica|Wesley]] and [[Marigot, Dominica|Marigot]].

In 1902, on 8 May, the [[Mount Pelée]] volcano on Martinique erupted destroying the city of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]]. Refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island.

=== Languages ===
[[English language|English]] is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood. In addition, [[Dominican Creole]], an [[Antillean Creole]] based on [[French language|French]], is widely spoken. This is due to French migration to the island starting in 1690, a majority French Creole speaking population that resided on the island,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Honychurch|first1=Lennox|title=The Dominica story : a history of the island|date=1995|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333627761|pages=49–60|edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its location between the two French-speaking departments of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. Since 1979, Dominica has been a member of [[La Francophonie]]. Dominican Creole is particularly used among the older generation, which also speaks a [[patois]] language. Because of a decline in the use of Creole by the younger generation, initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation's history and culture.

Along with Creole, a dialect known as Kokoy (or Cockoy) is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0521710162/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link|title=Lesser-known varieties of English|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|display-authors=etal|author=Schreier, D|isbn=9780521710169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[List of English-based pidgins|pidgin English]] which is a mix of Leeward Island [[English Creole]] and Dominican Creole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/creole.htm|title=Creole for Beginners|date=|publisher=Avirtualdominica.com|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mainly spoken in the north-eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley, by the descendants of immigrants from [[Montserrat]] and [[Antigua]]. Over time there has been much intermarrying, but there are still traces of difference in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?id=402|title=Migration from Montserrat to Dominica|date=|publisher=Lennoxhonychurch.com|accessdate=2010-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511073901/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?id=402|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this mixture of languages and heritage, Dominica is a member of both the French-speaking Francophonie and the English-speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

[[Island Carib language|Island Carib]], also known as Igneri (Iñeri, Igñeri, Inyeri), was an [[Arawakan language]] historically spoken by the [[Island Caribs]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The Island Caribs lived throughout the southern Lesser Antilles such as Dominica, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St Vincent]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], supposedly having conquered them from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. Island Carib became extinct about 1920, but an offshoot survives as [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], primarily in Central America.

=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in Dominica}}
61.4% of the population is [[Roman Catholic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/do.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in recent years a number of [[Protestant]] churches have been established.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  About 10–12% of the population belongs to one of the 7th day (Saturday) denominations, which includes Yahweh Congregation, [[Church of God (Seventh-Day)]] and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?articleID=547&amp;issue=19|title=Tropical Islam|date=|publisher=Arabwashingtonian.org|accessdate=2010-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905155854/http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?articleID=547&amp;issue=19|archivedate=5 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], in 2010 the World Christian Database reported that the largest non-Christian religious groups included: [[spiritualism]] followed by 2.6% of the population; [[Bahai]] followed by 1.7%; [[Agnosticism]] followed by 0.5%; [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]] followed by 0.1% each; and [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Neoreligion]]s, and [[Atheism]] each followed by non-negligible (i.e. &lt;0.1%) of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_69_2.asp|title=The Association of Religion Data Archives {{!}} National Profiles|website=www.thearda.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's first [[mosque]] was built near Ross University.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Dominica}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
School in Dominica is mandatory up to secondary school. After pre-school, pupils attend primary school for six or seven years, and are admitted into secondary school on the basis of a Common Entrance Exam. After five years the students take the General Certificate of Education (GCE), widely replaced by the current Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC or CXC) administered by the Caribbean Examination Council (a 15-member confederation of the Caribbean community (CARICOM). The more advanced version of this examination (CAPE) can be taken upon completion of two years of community college. The island has its own [[Dominica State College|state college]], formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College. Some Dominicans attend universities in Cuba on scholarships offered by its government. Others go to the [[University of the West Indies]] or to universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, or other countries. [[Ross University School of Medicine|Ross University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossu.edu/medical-school/|title=Ross University School of Medicine, Dominica|date=|publisher=Rossu.edu|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medical school, is located at [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Dominica|Music of Dominica}}
[[File:Carib Territory.svg|thumb|left|Dominica's east coast [[Carib Territory]]]]

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]] (Tainos) and Carib (Kalinago) tribes occupied it at the time European settlers reached the island. "Massacre" is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the Native villagers by English settlers.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the French and British tried to claim the island and imported [[slaves]] from Africa for labour. The remaining Caribs now live on a {{convert|3700|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. This mix of cultures has produced the current culture.

Music and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture. The annual independence celebrations display a variety of traditional song and dance. Since 1997, there have also been weeks of Creole festivals, such as "Creole in the Park" and the "[[World Creole Music Festival]]".

Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, [[Gordon Henderson (musician)|Gordon Henderson]] founded the group [[Exile One]] and an original musical genre, which he coined "[[Cadence-lypso]]". This paved the way for modern Creole music. Other musical genres include "[[Jing ping]]" and "[[Cadence rampa|Cadence]]". Jing ping features the accordion and is native to the island. Dominica's music is a melange of Haitian, Afro-Cuban, African and European traditions. Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers, Bells Combo, the Gaylords, [[Windward Caribbean Kulture|WCK]], and Triple Kay.

The 11th annual World [[creole music|Creole Music]] Festival was held in 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November. A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008, marking 30 years of independence.

Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism. The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture. Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island.

The famed novelist [[Jean Rhys]] was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]].'' Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]], set her 1954 novel, ''The Orchid House'' ({{ISBN|0-8135-2332-X}}), in Dominica.

Much of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]] film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (the second in the series, released on 7 July 2006), was shot on location on Dominica (though in the film it was known as "Pelegosto," a fictional island), along with some shooting for the third film in the series, [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]] (released on 2 May 2007).

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Dominica cuisine}}

Dominica's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands, particularly Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago. Like other [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] islands, Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine. Breakfast is an important daily meal, typically including saltfish, dried and salted [[codfish]], and "bakes" (fried dough). Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby, together with fried chicken, fish and fruit and yogurt "smoothies". Other breakfast meals include cornmeal [[porridge]], which is made with fine cornmeal or ''polenta,'' milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten. Traditional British-influenced dishes, such as eggs, bacon and toast, are also popular, as are fried fish and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]].

Common vegetables include [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], tanias (a root vegetable), [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[potatoes]], [[rice and peas]]. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, and fish. These are often prepared in stews with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme. The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, [[brown stew chicken]], stew beef, fried and stewed fish, and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups. These are filled with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.

=== Sports ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}
[[Cricket]] is a popular sport on the island, and Dominica competes in [[test cricket]] as part of the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In West Indies domestic first-class cricket, Dominica participates as part of the [[Windward Islands cricket team]], although they are often considered a part of the [[Leeward Islands]] geographically. This is due to being part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony from 1940 until independence; its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control.

On 24 October 2007, the 8,000-seat [[Windsor Park (Dominica)|Windsor cricket stadium]] was completed with a donation of [[EC$]]33&amp;nbsp;million ([[US$]]17&amp;nbsp;million, [[euro|€]]12&amp;nbsp;million) from the [[government of the People's Republic of China]].

[[Netball]], [[basketball]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[tennis]] and [[Association football]] are gaining popularity as well.

During the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], a husband and wife team of Gary di Silvestri and Angela Morrone di Silvestri spent [[US$]]175,000 to register as Dominican citizens and enter the 15&amp;nbsp;km men's and 10&amp;nbsp;km women's [[Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]] events, respectively. Angela did not start her race, and Gary pulled out several hundred meters into his race. To date, they are Dominica's only Winter Olympic athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/dominicas-fake-ski-team-scammed-the-olympics-and-the-p-1529973935|title=Dominica's Fake Ski Team Scammed The Olympics And The Press|date=2014-02-24|publisher=Deadspin|author=McKenna, Dave|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Dominica has two major newspapers, ''The Sun'' and ''[[The Chronicle (Dominica)|The Chronicle]]''. There are two national television stations and a few radio stations, including Stations include: ZBC-AM 590, the first private local radio station is called Radio En Ba Mango 93.5/96.9FM in the Village of Berricoa Grand Bay and is owned by Urban Dangleben,   ZGBC-AM 740, ZGBC-FM 90.7 (Portsmouth), ZGBC-FM 102.1 (Roseau) and ZGBC-FM 106.1 (Marigot), Q95 FM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiceqfm.com/index.html |title=Q95 FM |publisher=Wiceqfm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dominica Broadcasting Corporation]], and Kairi FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kairifm.com/ |title=Kairi FM |publisher=Kairi FM |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2004, there were two telecommunication companies [[Cable and Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable and Wireless]] and [[Marpin TV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marpin2k4.com |title=Marpin TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Dominican, Ronald Bernard Maroni Abraham. In 2005, [[Digicel]] and a UK-based company [[Orange SA|Orange]] started to offer service to the island. There are a number of mobile networks operating on the island; LIME and Digicel compete for most of Dominica's wireless customers. Orange shut down in 2010 and is no longer operating on the island of Dominica.

He was the lord of [[Château de Hélicourt|Hélicourt]] in [[Picardy]], an estate near the chief seat of the main Balliol line at [[Bailleul-en-Vimeu]]; after his cousin died childless, in 1190 Eustace de Helicourt took over those estates and remarried.&lt;ref name=Stell-Balliol&gt;Stell, "Balliol, Bernard de (d. c.1190)".&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1189–95 he quitclaimed the manor of Long Newton, Durham to Hugh du Puiset, Bishop of Durham, as well as all the land that Bernard de Balliol held in the vill of Newhouse.  In 1199–1200, as heir of Bernard de Balliol, he rendered account of 60 marks for his scutage, of which he had paid 10 marks; he also owed £120 for the second and third scutages of King Richard I, which was remitted by brief of King John.  Sometime in the period, 1199–1205, he confirmed to St. Mary’s, York the advowsons of the churches of Gainford and Stainton, Durham and Stokesley, Yorkshire and their tithes which Guy de Balliol previously granted them.  In 1200 he and his son, Hugh, quitclaimed by fine to Robert, Abbot of York the advowsons of the church of Gainford, Durham, and the chapels of Barnard Castle, Middleton, Denton, Houghton-le-Side, and Snow Hall (in Gainford), Durham.  

He and his first wife, Petronilla FitzPiers, had four known sons, all of whom appeared in the [[Durham,_England|Durham]] ''[[Durham Liber Vitae|Liber Vitae]]'': [[Hugh de Balliol|Hugh]], Enguerrand (Ingram or Ingelram), Bernard, and [[Henry de Balliol|Henry]]; his eldest son Hugh succeeded him, while his younger sons Enguerrand and Henry gained the patronage of the Scottish kings and founded Scottish cadet branches based at [[Inverkeilor]] (Enguerrand) and at [[Cavers, Scottish Borders|Cavers]] (Henry).&lt;ref name=Stell-Balliol/&gt; Eustace's son Hugh had succeeded him by around 1209.&lt;ref name=Stell-Balliol/&gt;

'''Galaxy 25''' ('''G-25''') launched in 1997 (formerly known as '''Intelsat Americas 5''' ('''IA-5''') until February 15, 2007 when it was renamed as result of the merger between owner [[Intelsat]] and [[PanAmSat]] or '''[[Telstar]] 5''') is a medium-powered [[communications satellite]] formerly in a [[geostationary orbit]] at {{coord|0|-97|display=inline}}, above a point in the [[Pacific Ocean]] several hundred miles west of the [[Galapagos Islands]]. It was manufactured by [[Space Systems/Loral]], part of its [[LS-1300|FS-1300]] line, and is currently owned and operated by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite's main [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]] cluster covers the [[United States]], southern [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]; its main [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] transponder cluster covers the U.S., Mexico, and the northern [[Caribbean Sea]].  An additional C-band and a K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponder pair targets the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Islands]].

Galaxy 25 has a projected life of 12 years. It was replaced by [[Galaxy 19]] (formerly IA-9) in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelsat.com/network/satellite/scheduled-launch.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182823/http://www.intelsat.com/network/satellite/scheduled-launch.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }} Intelsat launch information&lt;/ref&gt; When it was last in service at 97 degrees west, Galaxy 25 transmitted both [[free-to-air]] (FTA) direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasting and [[conditional access|encrypted subscription]] channels / services. The replacement satellite, [[Galaxy 19]] was successfully launched on September 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080924/ap_on_re_us/rocket_launches Two Rockets Launched{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galaxy 25 has been moved to a different orbital position at {{coord|0|-93.1|display=inline}} where it is currently broadcasting several services on its K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders.

[[File:5 Greek leptons 1869 (1).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Obverse and reverse|Reverse]] of a Greek 5 ''lepta'' coin (termed "''[[obol (coin)|obolos]]''") of 1869.]]
The '''''lepton''''', plural '''''lepta''''' ({{lang-el|λεπτόν, pl. λεπτά}}) is the name of various [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]al units of [[currency]] used in the [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] world from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] until today. The word means "small" or "thin", and during [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic]] times a ''lepton'' was always a small value coin, usually the smallest available denomination of another currency.&lt;ref name="FdC"&gt;[http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/currency/greek50lepta.asp Fleur de Coin - Greek 50 Lepta Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coin in the [[lesson of the widow's mite]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|12:41-44}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|21:1-4}}) is referred to as a ''lepton'' and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]] also refers to the lepton or mite when stating that a person who does not make peace with his adversary in good time will be required to pay 'to the very last mite' before being released from [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Luke 12:59&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] the lepton was first minted under [[Alexander Jannaeus]] prior to 76 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;''Coins of the Bible'' Set 2 of 3, [[Whitman Publishing]], LLC, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7948-1889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of Modern Greece|modern Greece]], ''lepton'' (modern form: ''lepto'', λεπτό) is the name of the 1/100 [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of all the official currencies of the Greek state: the [[phoenix (currency)|phoenix]] (1827–1832), the [[Greek drachma|drachma]] (1832–2001) and the [[euro]] (2002–current) – the name is the Greek form of "[[euro cent]]". Its unofficial currency sign is Λ (lambda).&lt;ref name="FdC" /&gt; Since the late 1870s, and until the introduction of the euro in 2001, no Greek coin had been minted with a denomination lower than 5 ''lepta''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2928">'''Healthcare in [[San Marino]]''' is provided through a [[universal health care]] system, as well as private healthcare to compliment it. San Marino's healthcare system is consistently rated as one of the top three in Europe.

==State system==
State healthcare is provided through the ''Azienda Sanitaria Locale'' national health insurance fund. All employees must register with it upon starting a job, and upon registration, are issued with a health card and number, and are automatically registered with a doctor in their neighborhood. Employers pay a contribution for each employee, deducted from their salaries, while the self-employed must pay the full contribution. Employed persons' dependent family members are covered by their insurance. Vulnerable people, such as the unemployed, aged, diabetics, and those on long-term maternity leave, do not need to register with an employer, and are entitled to free treatment without paying contributions.

The state health system covers most basic healthcare, such as hospitalization, specialized care, prescription drugs, pregnancy and childbirth, and rehabilitation services.

==Private insurance==
Private health insurance is widely used, and there is a series of private clinics in the country. Private insurance grants shorter waiting lists than in the public system, a choice of one's doctor, and more comfortable facilities in hospital, with those who have private coverage entitled to their own single or double room, while those under state coverage must share a room.

==Quality==
The quality of healthcare in San Marino is high. There is a series of health centers which provide outpatient services, including general practice, maternity and child healthcare, dental care, emergency care, and diagnostic services including laboratory and radiology services. The standards of care in health centers is high.

The country has one hospital, called San Marino Hospital, with an emergency room and other services. There are some medical treatments not available in the country that require patients to go abroad.

San Marino has the highest proportion of doctors for its population in Europe – 4735 per 100,000 in 2015.  It has the lowest number of dentists – 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hiticeland_hellissandur_rif.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Hellissandur at Snæfellsnes Peninsula]]
'''Hellissandur''' is a village and part of the [[Snæfellsbær]] municipality at the northwestern tip of [[Snæfellsnes]] peninsula in western [[Iceland]].

Once an important fishing post, the village has recently experienced growth in tourism. The maritime museum has examples of the [[turf roof]] houses once common across Iceland, as well as marine engines and Iceland's oldest rowing boat (1826). According to the 2011 census, Hellissandur and nearby [[Rif, Iceland|Rif]] have 544 inhabitants. Hellissandur is one of the first and oldest fishing villages in Iceland and is traced back to the 16th century. &lt;ref&gt;http://hiticeland.com/towns_and_villages_in_iceland/hellissandur-and-rif&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the points of interest near Hellissandur is the [[Snæfellsjökull]] [[glacier]], made famous by [[Jules Verne]] in his ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''. Just outside the village, there is the northern entrance to the Snæfellsjökull National Park, which surrounds the western and southern sides of the glacier. Nearby is the 412 metre tall [[Longwave radio mast Hellissandur|Gufuskálar]] radio mast, the tallest structure in Western Europe, located 2 kilometres westward.

The '''International Agency for Research on Cancer''' ('''IARC'''; {{lang-fr|Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer, CIRC}}) is an intergovernmental agency forming part of the [[World Health Organization]] of the [[United Nations]].

Its role is to conduct and coordinate research into the causes of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="Colditz2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colditz, Graham A.  (ed.)|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Cancer and Society (International Agency for Research on Cancer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXxZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1323|year=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-0126-6|pages=1323–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also [[Cancer registry|collects]] and publishes [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] data regarding the occurrence of cancer worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-dep.iarc.fr/|title=CANCERMondial|website=www-dep.iarc.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[Monograph]]s Programme identifies carcinogenic [[hazard]]s and evaluates environmental [[Carcinogen|causes of cancer]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/|title=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|website=monographs.iarc.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Caballero, Benjamin et al. (eds.) |title=Encyclopedia of Food and Health|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-384953-3|page=658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2015, IARC announced it evaluated the hazard of the [[herbicide]] [[glyphosate]] to be "probably carcinogenic to humans".&lt;ref name="IARC press"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=IARC Monographs Volume 112: evaluation of five organophosphate insecticides and herbicides|date=2015-03-20|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|location=Lyon, France|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/MonographVolume112.pdf|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked an ongoing controversies in several countries which subsequently reassessed the risks associated with exposure to the substance through diet. Since the publishing, the agency claimed to have been the target of misinformation practices from the industry and media outlets such as [[Reuters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/2016/glyphosate_IARC2016.php|title=IARC Monograph on Glyphosate|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=1 March 2018|website=IARC, Media Centre – News section|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IARC has its own Governing Council, and in 1965 the first members were the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.&lt;ref name="Colditz2015"/&gt; Today, IARC's membership has grown to 25 countries.

The first IARC Director was John Higginson (1966–1981), who was followed by [[Lorenzo Tomatis]] (1982–1993), Paul Kleihues (1994–2003), [[Peter Boyle (epidemiologist)|Peter Boyle]] (2004–2008), and Christopher Wild (2009–present).

== History ==

In late February 1963, after he spectated his spouse suffering and dying of cancer, journalist and [[Mouvement de la Paix|peace activist]] Yves Poggioli sent a letter to [[Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie|Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vignerie]] relating his story, and urging support for the creation of an international center to fight against cancer, whose funding where to be directly debited from the national budgets allocated to nuclear weaponry. Touched by the letter, d'Astier assembled a group of French prominent figures, among which [[Pierre Victor Auger|Pierre Auger]], [[Francis Perrin]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[François Perroux]], [[Pierre Massé]], [[Louis Armand]], {{Interlanguage link|François Bloch-Lainé|fr||WD=}}, [[Jean Rostand]], [[François Mauriac]], {{Interlanguage link|Antoine Lacassagne|fr||WD=}}, [[Ambroise-Marie Carré]] and [[Le Corbusier]], to reach for French president [[Charles de Gaulle]]&lt;ref&gt;Sohier R., Sutherland A.G.B. (1990). [https://web.archive.org/web/20150908015907/http://www.iarc.fr/fr/publications/pdfs-online/treport-pub/treport-pub6/Rapport_Technique_du_CIRC_6_Genese_2015.pdf La genèse du CIRC/IARC], Rapport technique du CIRC no 6, p. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; in national newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' on the 8 November 1963. de Gaulle answered positively to the call and reached for the World Health Organization director M. G. Candeau on the 11 November. The project rapidly gained momentum, and IARC was created on 20 May 1965, by a resolution of the World Health Assembly, as the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="Colditz2015"/&gt; The Agency's headquarters building was provided by its host in Lyon, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Payer |first1=Lynn J. |title=IARC: An Environmental Approach to Cancer Research |journal=Science, New Series |date=November 24, 1972 |volume=178 |issue=4063 |pages=844-846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monographs==
In 1970, after IARC received numerous requests for lists of known and suspected human carcinogens, its Advisory Committee recommended that expert groups prepare a compendium on carcinogenic chemicals, which began publishing monographs series with this aim in mind.&lt;ref&gt;http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/CurrentPreamble.pdf IARC, Preamble&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ObeMarchant2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Obe, Günter |author2=Marchant, Gary E. |author3= Jandrig, Burkhard|title=Cancer Risk Evaluation: Methods and Trends, Chapter 4: The IARC Monographs Programme|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-63463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IARC identifies carcinogenic [[hazard]] based on qualitative assessment of animal and human evidence.&lt;ref name="Klaassen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaassen, Curtis |title=Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons, Eighth Edition|year=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-176922-8|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IARC Working Groups classify agents, mixtures and exposures into one of five categories. The categorization is a matter of scientific judgement that reflects the strength of evidence derived from studies in humans, experimental animals and other relevant data.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=September 2015|orig-year=1991|title=Preamble|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/CurrentPreamble.pdf|journal=IARC Monographs|edition=January 2006|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|volume=|pages=22–23|access-date=13 April 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is based only on the strength of evidence for carcinogenicity, not on the relative increase of cancer risk due to exposure, or on the amount of agent exposure necessary to cause cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/monoeval/eval.html|title=&lt;&lt;Introduction&gt;&gt;|accessdate=2010-05-16|date=January 1999|publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]] : The agent is carcinogenic to humans.'''

There is ''sufficient'' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Exceptionally, an agent (or mixture) may be placed in this category if there is ''less than sufficient'' evidence in humans, but ''sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals and ''strong'' evidence in exposed humans that the agent acts through a relevant mechanism of carcinogenicity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* '''[[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]] : The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans.'''

There is ''limited'' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and ''sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals. Occasionally, an agent (or mixture) may be classified here when there is ''inadequate'' evidence in humans but ''sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals ''and'' ''strong'' evidence that the carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism that also operates in humans. Exceptionally, an agent (or mixture) may solely be classified under this category if there is ''limited'' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, but if it clearly belongs to this category based on mechanistic considerations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* '''[[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]: The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans.'''

There is ''limited'' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and ''less than sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals. It may also be used if there is ''inadequate'' evidence in humans but ''sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals. Occasionally, an agent (or mixture) may be placed in group 2B if there is ''inadequate'' evidence in humans and ''less than sufficient'' evidence in experimental animals ''but'' there ''is'' ''supporting'' evidence of carcinogenicity from mechanistic and other relevant data. An agent or a mixture may also be classified in this category solely on the basis of ''strong'' evidence of carcinogenicity from mechanistic and other relevant data.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* '''[[List of IARC Group 3 carcinogens|Group 3]] : The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.'''

The evidence is ''inadequate'' in humans and ''inadequate'' or ''limited'' in experimental animals. Exceptionally, agents (or mixtures) where evidence is ''inadequate'' in humans but ''sufficient'' in experimental animals may be placed in this category only if there is ''strong'' evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans.

Substances that do not fall into any other group are placed in this category. This is not a determination of non-carcinogenicity or overall safety. It means that further research is needed, especially when exposurs are widespread or the cancer data are consistent with differing interpretations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

As of 29 March 2018, 50% of all substances analyzed by IARC fall into this category.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Group 4 : The agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans.'''

There is evidence ''suggesting'' ''lack of'' carcinogenicity in humans and in experimental animals. In some instances, agents or mixtures for which there is ''inadequate'' evidence in humans but evidence ''suggesting'' lack of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, consistently and strongly supported by a broad range of mechanistic and other relevant data may be classified group 4.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only one substance – [[caprolactam]] – falls into this category as of April 2018.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Transparency (1998–2004) ===
[[Lorenzo Tomatis]], IARC director from 1982 to 1993, was allegedly "barred from entering the building" in 2003 after "accusing the IARC of softpedaling the risks of industrial chemicals"&lt;ref name="Science2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ferber D|date=July 2003|title=Carcinogens. Lashed by critics, WHO's cancer agency begins a new regime|url=|journal=Science|volume=301|issue=5629|pages=36–7|doi=10.1126/science.301.5629.36|pmid=12843372}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 2002 article.&lt;ref name="Tomatis2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tomatis L|year=2002|title=The IARC monographs program: changing attitudes towards public health|url=|journal=Int J Occup Environ Health|volume=8|issue=2|pages=144–52|doi=10.1179/107735202800338993|pmid=12019681}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 thirty public-health scientists signed a letter targeting conflicts of interest and the lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="Science2003" /&gt; Tomatis accused the IARC of "highly irregular" voting procedures, alleging industrial interferences, and called for the agency to publish voting procedures and names in details for independent scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Science2003" /&gt;

The IARC rejected these criticisms, highlighting that only 17 of 410 of the working-group participants were consultants to industry and these people never served as chairs, nor were allowed to vote.&lt;ref name="Science2003" /&gt; The reason the details of the voting names were not published was to avoid political pressures on the participating Working Group scientists, and to protect the integrity of the deliberative process.&lt;ref name="Science2003" /&gt;

=== Glyphosate Monograph (2015–2018) ===
On 20 March 2015, IARC classified [[glyphosate]], the most widely used [[Herbicide|weed killing substance]] in the world sold under the brand name of ''Roundup'' by [[Monsanto]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-exclusive-idUSKCN12P2FW|title=Exclusive: WHO cancer agency asked experts to withhold weedkiller documents|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=2016-10-25|work=|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-11-28|location=London, U.K.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "probably carcinogenic to humans" ([[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]]).&lt;ref name="IARC press" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IARC Mono 112"&gt;{{cite book |last1=International Agency for Research on Cancer |title=IARC Monographs, Volume 112. Glyphosate, in:  Some Organophosphate Insecticides and Herbicides |publisher=IARC/WHO |location=Lyon |pages=321-412|date=2017 |url=https://monographs.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mono112.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, many national regulatory authorities underwent a reevaluation of the risk posed by the exposure to glyphosate. Regulators in Europe ([[European Chemicals Agency|ECHA]], [[European Food Safety Authority|EFSA]]), Canada, Japan and New Zealand reported that the glyphosate was unlikely to pose any carcinogenic risk to humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; California put glyphosate on its list of unsafe chemicals.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In September 2016 the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) withdrew a report that it had initially stamped as "final", a report that had said that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/06/the-stiletto-heel-of-state-regulation-why-american-business-cant-back-hillary/|title=The Stiletto Heel Of Regulation: Why American Business Can’t Back Hillary|last=Bakker|first=Eliot|date=2016-10-06|website=The Daily Caller|publisher=|location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publishing, IARC claimed it has suffered unprecedented large-scale attacks on its reputation from the agro-chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/IARC_response_to_criticisms_of_the_Monographs_and_the_glyphosate_evaluation.pdf|title=IARC response to criticisms of the Monographs and the glyphosate evaluation|last=|first=|date=January 2018|website=IARC|publication-date=2 February 2018|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Industry reactions  ====
The American Chemistry Council (ACC), the trade group for U.S. chemical companies, declared that IARC evaluates how hazardous a substance is based on whether the substance could "cause cancer in humans under any circumstances, including at exposure levels beyond what is typical."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain opposed IARC's "outdated hazard-based assessments" model. The industrial scientists suggested the IARC to update its methodology to the principles and concepts of what they regard as the "existing international consensus-based frameworks" such as the framework used by the World Health Organization International Programme on Chemical Safety.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/who-cancer-agency-criticised-for-outdated-chemical-risk-methods/1017633.article|title=WHO cancer agency criticised for outdated chemical risk methods|last=Träger|first=Rebecca|date=2016-11-02|work=|newspaper=Chemistry World|access-date=2016-11-28|publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain)|subscription=yes|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== U.S. Congressional reactions ====
In early 2016, members of the scientific panel that reviewed glyphosate in 2015 were issued legal requests in the U.S. related to their work. In April 2016, internal IARC officials told its experts to not release documents or comply with the legal requests related to its review of glyphosate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In the fall of 2016, the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] held a briefing to ask officials from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) about NIH's grant funding to the IARC.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/congress-probes-nih-backing-of-cancer-agency/1017582.article|title=Congress probes NIH backing of cancer agency|last=Träger|first=Rebecca|date=2016-10-21|work=|publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain)|newspaper=Chemistry World|subscription=yes|access-date=2016-11-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH grant database showed that it has given the IARC over $1.2 million in 2016. Chaffetz asked the NIH to give his committee details of its standards for awarding grants and vetting grant nominees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-idUSKCN1261WS|title=Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=2016-10-06|work=|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-11-28|location=London, U.K.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Congressman [[Robert Aderholt]] (Republican), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, wrote a letter in June 2016 to the head of the NIH questioning the funding of IARC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Further attacks on Monographs methodology and other findings ====
Republican congressman [[Jason Chaffetz]] argued that the IARC is too prone to conclude that substances are carcinogenic.{{cn|date=October 2018}} However, IARC respond that the Working Groups methods are "widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and for freedom from conflicts of interest."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Director of IARC Chris Wild further added that the IARC only chooses substances to evaluate from which there already exists a body of scientific literature that says there is a carcinogenic risk to humans. Wild said that because IARC does not select substances at random, it has a low rate of determining a substance as not being cancer-causing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On 26 October 2015, a Working Group of 22 experts from 10 countries evaluated the carcinogenicity of the consumption of [[red meat]] and [[processed meat]] and classified the consumption of red meat as "probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)", mainly related to colorectal cancer, and to pancreatic and prostate cancer. It also evaluated processed meat to be "carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)", due to "sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer".&lt;ref name="WHO-20151026"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf|title=World Health Organization – IARC Monographs evaluate consumption of red meat and processed meat|author=Staff|date=26 October 2015|work=International Agency for Research on Cancer|accessdate=26 October 2015|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151026"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/health/report-links-some-types-of-cancer-with-processed-or-red-meat.html|title=W.H.O.

Marcel Kuntz, a French director of research at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the classification because it didn't assess the risks associated with exposure (probability of getting a cancer from certain exposure).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slate.fr/story/126602/pourquoi-fausses-sciences-gouvernent-monde|title=Pourquoi les fausses sciences gouvernent le monde (et pourquoi il faut mettre un terme à ce règne)|newspaper=Slate.fr|access-date=2016-11-07|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Yong, a British science journalist, criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic-20151026"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Why is the World Health Organization so bad at communicating cancer risk?|author=[[Ed Yong]]|date=26 October 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IARC answered in a press release their mission was not to evaluate potency or to assess the risks but only to determine scientifically the strength of carcinogenetic evidence of glyphosate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/IARC_response_to_criticisms_of_the_Monographs_and_the_glyphosate_evaluation.pdf|title=IARC response to criticisms of the Monographs and the glyphosate evaluation|last=|first=|date=January 2018|website=IARC|pages=8–9|publication-date=2 February 2018|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the items that the IARC classifies, such as mobile phones (Group 2B) and processed meat (Group 1) have caused controversy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Irma Benčić was a native of [[Istria|Istria Province]], part of modern day [[Croatia]]; during Irma's lifetime, the province was part of [[Yugoslavia]]. When [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] Yugoslavia in 1940, a resistance movement, later widely referred to as the NOP ([[:hr:Istra u Narodnooslobodilačkom pokretu|hr]]), was formed in Istria to oppose the German occupiers of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]]. Benčić joined the partisans during the conflict, actively resisting against the Germans. She was killed by the German army on the night of 1 March 1945 in [[Novigrad, Istria County|Novigrad]], two months before the city was liberated by the advancing Yugoslav army.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buršić, Herman, ''Od ropstva do slobode: Istra 1918 - 1945.

The '''King of the May''' is a figure in the mythology of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], as well as a folk custom. Every year, or every seven years, a man from the village would be chosen to represent the King of the May. He would bring [[fertility]] to the village, and during the time that he was in power, he could impregnate any woman in the village. At the end of his "reign," he would be ritually sacrificed and a new King of the May would be chosen. According to J.G. Frazer's [[The Golden Bough]], this type of custom was derived from earlier Indo-European tree worship fertility rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, J. (1900). The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion. Macmillan, pp. 224-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakoena/Bakuena/Bakwena ("those who venerate the [[crocodile]]") are a large tribe in Southern Africa. They form part of the Sotho-Tswana people and can be found in different countries such as [[Lesotho]], Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland. Their main languages are [[Sesotho]] and [[Setswana]].

Their earliest known history is that Koena was the younger brother of Mohurutshe and left his home with his followers because he did not want to be ruled by his sister. This occurred in the area of what is now Pretoria in the 1100s. Kuena and his followers settled at Tebang now called [[Hielderberg]]. At Tebang he had a son named Napo who further led the tribe to cross the [[Lekoa]] or [[Vaal]] river and settled at Ntsoana-Tsatsi with the Bafokeng.

"Koena" (&lt;i&gt;"Kwena"&lt;/i&gt;) is a [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]]/Setswana word meaning "[[crocodile]]", and this animal is their [[totem]].

'''Live and let live''' is the spontaneous rise of non-aggressive co-operative behaviour that developed during the [[First World War]], particularly during prolonged periods of [[trench warfare]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Perhaps one of the most famous examples of this is the [[Christmas Truce]] of 1914.

It is a process that can be characterised as the deliberate abstaining from the use of violence during war.  Sometimes it can take the form of overt truces or pacts negotiated locally by soldiers.  At other times it can be a tacit behaviour—sometimes characterised as "letting sleeping dogs lie"—whereby both sides refrain from firing or using their weapons, or deliberately discharge them in a ritualistic or routine way that signals their non-lethal intent.

==Examples==
This behaviour was found at the small-unit level, sections, platoons or companies, usually observed by the "other ranks", e.g., privates and non-commissioned officers. Examples were found from the lone soldier standing sentry duty, refusing to fire on exposed enemy soldiers, up to snipers, machine-guns teams and even field-artillery batteries.

Upper echelon commanders—those of divisions, corps and armies—and their staffs were aware of this tendency towards non-aggression, and would sometimes analyse casualty statistics to detect it. Raids or patrols were often ordered to foster the correct "offensive spirit" in the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hLb7CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Combat Motivation: The Behaviour of Soldiers in Battle|last=Kellett|first=Anthony|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=1982|isbn=978-0-89838-106-1|location=Dordrecht|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Live and Let Live'' system was fragile at best and was easily broken by occurrences of lethal force, becoming even more tenuous as the war dragged on.

==Research==
Tony Ashworth&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Tony (2000). ''Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System.'' London: Pan. {{ISBN|0330480685}}.&lt;/ref&gt; researched this topic based upon diaries, letters, and testimonies of veterans from the war.  He discovered that 'live and let live' was widely known about at the time and was most common at specific times and places. It was often to be found when a unit had been withdrawn from battle and was sent to a rest sector.

==Game theory==
Some scholars of [[game theory]], like [[Robert Axelrod]], have characterised ''Live and Let Live'' as an iterated variant of the [[prisoner's dilemma]].  Axelrod linked ''Live and Let Live'' to the co-operative strategy referred to as [[Tit for Tat]].

Axelrod's interpretation of "Live and Let Live" as a prisoner's dilemma has been disputed by political scientists Joanne Gowa&lt;ref&gt;Anarchy, Egoism, and Third Images: The Evolution of Cooperation and International Relations The Evolution of Cooperation. by Robert Axelrod
Review by: Joanne Gowa. International Organization, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Winter, 1986), pp. 167-186. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2706746.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Gelman]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gelman, Game theory as ideology: some comments on Robert Axelrod's The Evolution of Cooperation. QA-Rivista dell'Associazione Rossi-Doria 2, 167-176 (1988). http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelmanaxelrod_001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who (separately) argue that the assumptions underlying the prisoner's dilemma do not hold in this example.

== Early life and education ==
Bradshaw was raised in [[Nottingham]], England and moved to [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1966.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.farvoyager.com/siov/voyage.html |title=SIOV 2002: The Voyage |publisher=farvoyager.com|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw began her work there on [[Devonian]] [[invertebrate palaeontology]], gradually incorporating [[Antarctica]] into her research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F55VAgAAQBAJ |title=Mountains of Madness: A Scientist's Odyssey in Antarctica |last=Long |first=John |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=[[Joseph Henry Press]] |isbn=978-0-309-07077-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and impact ==
Bradshaw focused her research on the structure and [[stratigraphy]] of Devonian rocks in New Zealand and Antarctica. Specifically she worked on the development and relationship of [[Paleozoic]] terrains in New Zealand, as well as the [[Biogeography|paleobiogeography]] of Devonian [[Bivalvia|Bivalves]] and the Paleontology and environmental significance of Paleozoic [[Trace fossil]]s in both New Zealand, Antarctica and Australia. Bradshaw was a curator at the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] and her initial trips to Antarctica were to collect fossils and rocks for the Antarctic display.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bradshaw was the curator of Geology at the Canterbury Museum for 17 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://antarctica.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/41256 |title=Pallets of equipment and supplies being delivered by Hercules |website=Antarctica NZ|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first trip to Antarctica was from 1975 to 1976 to collect specimens for the museum's Antarctic Hall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bradshaw was the first woman to lead an [[Antarctic Exploration|Antarctic deep field party]] in her 1979 to 1980 field season to the remote Ohio Range&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=135898 |title=Bradshaw Peak |website=Australian Antarctic Data Centre |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was the first to discover new fish fossils in the exposures of the [[Cook Mountains]] in her 1988 to 1989 field season.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bradshaw was the president of the [[New Zealand Antarctic Society]] for 10 years until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pages/journal/articles/art13.php |title=Antarctic |publisher=antarctic.org.nz|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the Association of Australian Paleontologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://docs.exdat.com/docs/index-361726.html?page=9 |title=Margaret Bradshaw |website=docs.exdat.com |publisher=Association of Australasian Palaeontologists|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
Bradshaw is the second woman to win the [[Queen's Polar Medal]], and the first New Zealand woman to be awarded this medal, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A&amp;nbsp;– L. |last=Mills |first=William James |date=1 January 2003 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-1-57607-422-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pages/history/polarmedallist.php |title=Polar Medal |publisher=antarctic.org.nz|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] Science &amp; Technology Medal in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC |title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic |last=Riffenburgh |first=Beau |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |isbn=978-0-415-97024-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw is a New Zealand Antarctic Life Member, nominated in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |year=2010|editor-last=Cadenhead|editor-first=Natalie|editor2-last=Bray|editor2-first=Janet |title=Antarctic |url=http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V28.1.2010.pdf|dead-url=no |magazine=The Magazine of the New Zealand Antarctic Society |type=pdf |publisher=Gusto |volume=28 |issue=211 |issn=0003-5327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630130225/http://antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V28.1.2010.pdf|archive-date=30 June 2016 |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Formation of Malaysia}}

The '''North Borneo Federation''', also known as '''North Kalimantan''' or '''Negara Kesatuan Kalimantan Utara''' (Unitary State of North Kalimantan) in [[Malay language|Malay]], was a proposed political entity which would have comprised the [[British Borneo|British Colonies]] of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]] (now known as the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Sabah]]) and the protectorate of [[Brunei]].

== Attempts for the establishment ==
In 1956, the governments of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and the State of [[Brunei]] announced that they would abandon the [[Malayan dollar]] and adopt a common currency of their own,&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Watson and S. Caine, ''Report on the Establishment of a Central Bank in Malaya'' (Kuala Lumpur, 1956), 1&lt;/ref&gt; but that never came into being.

The idea of the North Kalimantan was proposed by Brunei's People Party President, [[A. M. Azahari]], who had forged links with [[Sukarno]]'s nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in [[Java]] in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with [[British North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the federation with the [[Sultan of Brunei]] as the constitutional monarch.

However, the [[Brunei People’s Party]] was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own [[Brunei|Sultan]], and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Borneo (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-[[decolonisation]] alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. Joining to form Malaysia was seen as a new form of colonialism under Malaya.

The basic concept behind the formation of a union of British Borneo was partly based upon the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] in [[Southern Africa]]. After the defeat of the revolutionaries in the [[Brunei Revolt]], the idea was put to rest. Had the federation been formed, the capital city would probably have been chosen from [[Kuching]] (capital of Sarawak), [[Jesselton]] (present-day Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah) or [[Bandar Brunei]] (present-day Bandar Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei and the historical capital of the region).

The [[Sultanate of Brunei]] has traditionally opposed such a federation. When it was first proposed during the 1960s the [[Sultan of Brunei]] favoured joining Malaysia, though, in the end, disagreements concerning the nature of such a federation, and also disputes over oil royalties stopped this from happening.

== Contemporary politics ==
There remain groups of people who favour the creation of such an independent state and desire separation from the rest of [[Malaysia]].{{fact|date=June 2017}} These groups see union of [[Malaysia]] as unfair to the people of Borneo, particularly [[Sabah]],{{fact|date=June 2017}} as the majority of the region's wealth goes to the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]].{{fact|date=June 2017}} Only about 5% of the region's oil revenues go to the state government of Sabah and Sarawak.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The federal government has taken 15% and other 80% goes to [[Petronas]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

Malaysian politics have usually been centred in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and critics see the federation neglecting the needs of East Malaysians. Some opposition parties in the [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly]] have tried to promote a North Borneo federation. The matter was refused to be debated in the Assembly due to its sensitivity, by the coalition of governing parties in Sarawak, namely the [[Barisan Nasional]] led by [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]].

The Malaysian general elections in [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008]] and [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013]] saw the populations of both the East Malaysian states voted to keep the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition in power, which lost support in its traditional [[Peninsular Malaysia]]n strongholds. This has seen an increase in development in the two states.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

The '''Belgian Military Organisation of Resistance''' ({{lang-fr|Organisation Militaire Belge de Résistance}}) or '''OMBR''' was a group within the [[Belgian resistance]] in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German-occupied Belgium]] during [[World War II]]. It remained a reasonably small organisation throughout the war, comprising a total of 3,112 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Souvenir et Memoire|url=http://www.bel-memorial.org/books/je_me_promene_a_durbuy_souvenir_memoire.pdf|publisher=www.bel-memorial.org|accessdate=29 December 2012|pages=2|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym of the group was deliberately chosen as a [[homophone]] of the French word ''ombre'' meaning "shadow".

==History==
Founded in 1940, the group only adopted the acronym OMBR in July 1942.&lt;ref name="livredor"&gt;''Le livre d'or de la Résistance belge'', publié par le Ministère de la Défense nationale, Les éditions Leclercq, Bruxelles, 1949, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; The group's motto was "Better to die than to betray"&lt;ref group=note&gt;''« Mieux vaut mourir que trahir »''&lt;/ref&gt; and its vow "I swear to be faithful to the country, to observe the laws and constitution of the Belgian people, to obey my superiors and never to betray."&lt;ref&gt;''Le livre d'or de la Résistance belge'', publié par le Ministère de la Défense nationale, Les éditions Leclercq, Bruxelles, 1949, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable members==
*[[Herman Bodson]] - Belgian mineralogist, later author of a number of books about the Belgian resistance.
*G. Allaert, Commandant of the OMBR in 1944

'''Swingolf''' is a family-oriented variation of [[golf]] that has is played with a single golf club and softer, bigger balls, giving access to inexperienced and young players.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

This sport is usually played casually, similar to [[mini-golf]], but also has a league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leswin.com/|title=French League of Swingolf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golf courses are usually less well-kept than normal courses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} They are often planted with grass that fits local climate, reducing watering and maintenance and thus reducing cost.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

This sport is mainly popular in Europe, especially in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leswin.com/terrains/|title=Où jouer? – Fédération Sportive de Swin-Golf|website=www.leswin.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences with Golf ==
* The fees to play Swingolf is usually much lower, ranging from 8 to €15 for an adult per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingolfneuchatel.ch/prix.php|title=Swin Golf Pierre-À-Bot|website=www.swingolfneuchatel.ch|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.golfdeneuchatel.ch/en/tarifs|title=Tarifs - Golf &amp; Country Club de Neuchâtel|last=Utilisateur|first=Super|website=www.golfdeneuchatel.ch|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It can be played by kids starting at 8 year old and family without prior experience after a 10min introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laligue14.org/ufolep/IMG/pdf/Regles_de_jeu_swin_golf.pdf|title=Swingolf Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The balls, bigger than golf and made of soft polymeric foam reduces the risk of injuries or damage in case of impact.
* The game is played with a single club that is usually lent, reducing the hassle to carry several clubs.
* The course is much smaller than usual golf course and is ranging from 30'000 to 90'000m2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mguiheneuc.free.fr/topic3/index.html|title=Swin concept|website=mguiheneuc.free.fr|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The course is usually less kept than traditional golf, reducing maintenance cost and water usage.
* Due to the less kept course, ball trajectory might be less predictable.

'''The Mountain of Israeli-Palestinian Friendship''' is a {{convert|2770|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Summit (topography)|peak]] near the Bruce plateau in [[Antarctica]]. It was [[Mountaineering|climb]]ed and named in 2004 by an 8-member team consisting of four [[Israel]]is and four [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]s.&lt;ref name=summit/&gt;&lt;ref name=peace/&gt;

==Background and preparation==
The expedition was arranged by the organization [[Breaking the Ice (organization)|Breaking the Ice]]. The founder of this organization, Nathaniel Heskel, wanted to prove that Palestinians and Israelis could work together despite the troubles in Israel.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

The members of the expedition practiced sailing in [[Tel Aviv]], and trained in the [[French Alps]], about two months prior to leaving for Antarctica.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

==Team members==

===Israeli team members===
At the time of the expedition, Heskel Nathaniel was 40 years old, and was a property developer in Germany. He served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] for 10 years.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, Doron Erel was 44 years old. One of Israel's top mountaineers, he was the first Israeli to climb [[Mount Everest]] in 1992. Later, Erel climbed the [[Seven Summits]], the highest mountains of each of the seven continents. In 1990, he took a part in searching for survivors of an [[avalanche]] that killed 43 climbers at [[Lenin Peak]]. Erel served in the [[Sayeret Matkal]], an elite commando unit of the Israeli army.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Doron/&gt; His parents were [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors from Poland.&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, Avihu Shoshani was a 44-year-old attorney and part of the right-wing political scene in Israel. He spent four years as an elite commando in the Israel Defense Forces.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, Yarden Fanta, a PhD candidate, was 33 years old. She trekked from [[Ethiopia]] via [[Sudan]] to Israel when she was an [[illiterate]] 14 years old.  She spent the first 12 years of her life helping her family tend cows in a tiny Ethiopian village called Macha.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

===Palestinian team members===
At the time of the expedition, Nasser Quos, a football coach, was 35 years old. He had spent three years in an Israeli prison for attacking Israeli troops with fire bombs during the [[First Intifada]]. Later he had worked as a bodyguard to the PLO Jerusalem representative [[Faisal Husseini]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, Suleiman al-Khatib was 32 years old. A member of the [[Fatah]] party, he had been imprisoned in Israeli prison for 10 years, since he was 14 years old, for carrying out actions against Israeli troops. While in prison he had studied [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], English, [[literature]] and history.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, Ziad Darwish was a 53-year-old journalist. His brother, a member of a radical Palestinian movement, was killed in an Israeli army raid in 1982. His cousin was the famous Palestinian poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;

At the time of the expedition, 33-year-old Olfat Haider was the only Palestinian on the Israeli national [[volleyball]] team. She worked as a [[gymnastics]] teacher.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yarden/&gt;

==The expedition==

The expedition departed from [[Puerto Williams]] in [[Chile]] on January 1, 2004, aboard the ocean-going yacht ''Pelagic Australis''. The yacht navigated approximately 600 miles in the most hazardous oceans, including circling [[Cape Horn]], passing through the [[Roaring Forties]].

When they arrived in Antarctica, the team trekked for a week until they reached the foot of the mountain. In a high wind and low visibility, in terrain with many [[crevasse]]s, they started their climb. Roped together in mixed groups of four, using [[crampon]]s attached to their boots and [[ice axe]]s in their hands, the Israelis and Palestinians took responsibility for each other's lives. Climbing over a [[glacier]], they reached the summit at 4 p.m. on January 16, 2004.&lt;ref name=summit/&gt;

At the summit, the three [[Muslim]] men knelt in prayer, turned towards [[Mecca]]. The Israelis opened [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] for everybody. Ziad Darwish was moved to tears. He said: "This moment is so beautiful, seeing Israelis and Palestinians doing this kind of thing together. Yet, it also makes me think of all the horrible things we're doing to one another back home."&lt;ref name=peace/&gt; 13,000 kilometers from their homes in the Middle East the party made the summit statement, which all eight had previously agreed upon:

{{cquote|We, the members of Breaking the Ice, the Israeli-Palestinian expedition to Antarctica, having reached the conclusion of a long journey by land and sea from our homes in the Middle East to the southernmost reaches of the Earth, now stand atop this unnamed mountain.  By reaching its summit we have proven that Palestinians and Israelis can cooperate with one another with mutual respect and trust.  Despite the deep differences that exist between us, we have shown that we can carry on a sincere and meaningful dialogue. We join together in rejecting the use of violence in the solution of our problems and hereby declare that our peoples can and deserve to live together in peace and friendship.  In expression of these beliefs and desires we hereby name this mountain '''The Mountain of Israeli-Palestinian Friendship'''.&lt;ref name=peace/&gt;}}

Days prior to reaching the summit, the groups debated heatedly regarding the wording of the statement they were to give when reaching the summit.  Eventually the members agreed to reject any hint of violence in their joint statement.&lt;ref name=summit/&gt;&lt;ref name=peace/&gt;

In spite of bitter disagreements about everything concerning Middle East politics, the team members nonetheless bonded with one another, and helped each other's during [[sea sickness]], bad weather, and low visibility.&lt;ref name=summit/&gt;

[[Image:Tam5.jpg|thumb|right|TAM 5, bearing the late Maynard Hill's [[Academy of Model Aeronautics|AMA]] membership no."14".]]
'''''The Spirit of Butts' Farm''''' (also known as '''TAM 5''') was the first [[model aircraft]] to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on August 11, 2003. The aircraft was launched from [[Cape Spear]] &lt;sup&gt;({{coord|47|31.216|N|52|37.428|W}})&lt;/sup&gt; near [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], and landed at [[Mannin Beach]] &lt;sup&gt;({{coord|53|26.462|N|10|7.892|W|display=inline,title}})&lt;/sup&gt; near [[Clifden]], [[Ireland]] 38.9 hours later.&lt;ref name="STAR newsletter Oct, 2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Maynard|title=Progress Report XV From the President Maynard Hill|accessdate=2013-09-19|newspaper=STAR News - Society for Technical Aeromodel Research|date=October 2003|author2=Dible, Joe|author3=Molloy, John|url=http://aerospaceindustrynews.webs.com/STAR%20Oct%202003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognized by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] as a double world record&lt;ref name="fai" /&gt; flight for its duration of 38h 52 min 19 sec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7883|title=Fai Record File|author=Super User|work=fai.org|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and straight-line distance of {{convert|1881.6|mi|abbr=on}} using an autopilot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7882|title=Fai Record File|author=Super User|work=fai.org|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using the [[Argos System]] for telemetry to track the flight's progress;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Record Setting Transatlantic Flight|journal=Model Airplane News|date=January 2004|page=88|url=http://media.radiocontrolzone.com/mair/online_articles/transatlanticflight.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team's use of technology also spurred the FAI to create new record categories.&lt;ref name="fai"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAI WORLD RECORDS : NEW CATEGORY FOR AEROMODELLING F8 - Autonomous flight|url=http://www.fai.org/news/31938-fai-news-15-06|publisher=FAI|accessdate=18 September 2013|date=2006-09-14|quote=At its 2005 Plenary Meeting, the FAI Aeromodelling Commission (CIAM) recognized that new technology underlying autonomous flight was available and had been demonstrated by the World Records ratified in the names of Messrs Maynard L.

The aircraft was built by a team led by [[Maynard Hill]], a retired [[metallurgist]]. Hill had previously set 25 model airplane records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Chris|title=Aeromodeling legend Maynard Hill, 1926‐2011|url=http://www.modelaircraft.org/files/MediareleaseHill.pdf|publisher=Academy of Model Aeronautics|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAI Record Search Results|url=http://get-to-post.nickj.org/?http://www.fai.org/records?search-record-text=Maynard+Hill&amp;commission_text=&amp;redirecturl=&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100&amp;fd682271b193295bf24068285c92020d=1&amp;search-record-text-id=|publisher=FAI|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the Model Aviation Hall of Fame in 1977. ''The Spirit of Butts' Farm'' was the 25th of 28 airframes&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://tam.plannet21.com/FAQs.htm|publisher=Society for Technical Aeromodel Research|accessdate=2013-09-17|date=2003-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team had built in the attempt to cross the Atlantic; the five best models were selected for actual transatlantic flight attempts. The 25th airframe was the fifth selected for the record attempt and was redesignated TAM-5. Later, describing his reaction to learning that the flight had been successful, Hill said, "I just grabbed my wife, hugged her and cried like a baby."&lt;ref name="wash post"/&gt;

The aircraft was named after [[R. Beecher Butts]], an aviation enthusiast who allowed the use of his farm for testing of the aircraft. The name echoes that of the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the aircraft used by [[Charles Lindbergh]] in his transatlantic flight. The aircraft is on display at the [[National Model Aviation Museum]]. A backup plane for the transatlantic effort is in the collection of the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref name="wash post"/&gt;

An article on the flight can be found in the October 2003 edition of Model Aviation Canada magazine.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6986">'''VigiBase''' is a [[World Health Organization]]’s (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database that contains ICSRs submitted by the participating member states enrolled under WHO’s international drug monitoring programme. It is the single largest drug safety data repository in the world. Since 1978, the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]] (UMC; established in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]]) on behalf of WHO, have been maintaining VigiBase.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist M. Vigibase, the WHO Global ICSR Database System: Basic Facts. ''Drug Information Journal'', 2008, 42:409–419.&lt;/ref&gt;
Vigibase is used to obtain the information about a safety profile of a medicinal product. These data are used by pharmaceutical industries, academic institutions and regulatory authorities for statistical signal detection, updating periodic reports, ICSR comparisons with company databases and studying the reporting patterns.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who-umc.org/vigibase/vigibase/&lt;/ref&gt;
The data (pre-dominantly post-marketing serious and non-serious cases) is collected from each of its 110 member states which currently comprises to over 10 million ICSRs (October 2014).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who-umc.org/vigibase/vigibase/&lt;/ref&gt; About a hundred thousand ICSRs are added each year.

==Organisation==

===Contributors===

It is mandatory for all the participating countries (125 members states and 28 associate members) to submit ICSRs to UMC via its appointed national centre based in the respective member states, authorized by its [[competent authority]] or the [[health authority]] itself.  
These reports are usually sent to the respective national centre by marketing authorization holders, health care professionals (HCP), consumers or any regional centre. Most of participating member have a well established system for collection of ICSRs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who-umc.org/global-pharmacovigilance/members/who-programme-members&lt;/ref&gt;
These submissions are in [[International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|ICH]] E2B format and are reported more than once a month or at least every quarter. For some member states that lack an E2B compatible database for ICSR management, UMC in collaboration with ‘’Swissmedic’’ has developed ‘’VigiFlow’’, a web-based ICSR management system. VigiFlow functions as a national ICSR database management system and analysis tool, through which cases are sent to UMC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bridgetodata.org/node/1063

===Associated databases===

VigiBase is a [[relational database management system]] (RDMS) which is compatible with ODBC ([[open database connectivity]]) and uses [[SQL]] for the database communication. The RDMS can be accessed through client server applications, ODBC, and Internet applications. Apart from data management, the VigiBase system includes an automated signal detection process using advanced data mining tools (‘’VigiMine’’- a Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) data mining tool).&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist M. Vigibase, the WHO Global ICSR Database System: Basic Facts. ''Drug Information Journal'', 2008, 42:409–419.&lt;/ref&gt; VigiBase further includes a WHO Drug Dictionaries (WHO-DD and -DDE), and medical terminology dictionary such as WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART), [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), and the [[Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities]] (MedDRA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/WHO/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements===

Type of reports: Most preferred data includes post-marketing spontaneous serious and non-serious cases ICSRs. Case reports from studies, [[clinical trials]] or special monitoring and literature are sometimes included, but are flagged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bridgetodata.org/node/1063&lt;/ref&gt;
Type of medicine: Database includes ICSRs on ordinary [[allopathic]] medicines, traditional medicines (herbals), biologics, [[vaccines]] and [[medical devices]].

The '''''washint''''' is an end-blown wooden flute originally used in Ethiopia. Traditionally, Amharic musicians would pass on their oral history through song accompanied by the ''washint'' as well as the [[krar]], a six stringed lyre, and the [[masenqo]], a one string fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Construction and design ==
The ''washint'' can be constructed using wood, bamboo, or other cane.  Varieties exists in different lengths and relative fingerhole placement, and a performer might use several different flutes over the course of a performance to accommodate different song types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kimberlin |first1=Cynthia Tse|year=1974 |title=Ethiopian and Tribal Music |journal=Ethnomusicology |volume= 18| issue =  1 |page=178 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/850080|jstor=850080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally has four finger-holes, which allows the player to create a [[pentatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sárosi |first1=B.|year=1967 |title=The Music of Ethiopian Peoples |journal=Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae |volume= 9 |page=14 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/901579|jstor=901579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Čili''' is a restaurant chain in [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. It started as a [[pizza]] restaurant, but soon diversified into different areas.

== History ==
In 1997, the first Čili Pica restaurant was opened on Konstitucijos Avenue in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. From 1999 onwards the company, renamed UAB Čilija, began to diversify, adding [[bistro]]s in 2000, traditional [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian-style]] restaurants in 2002, [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]s in 2003, [[café|coffee shop]]s in 2004 and [[Drive-in restaurant|drive-ins]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

The first restaurant outside Vilnius was opened in [[Palanga]].&lt;ref name=pala/&gt; The company soon expanded into other countries, opening its first non-Lithuanian restaurant in December 2001 in the Latvian city of [[Liepāja]].&lt;ref name=liepa/&gt; As of May 2009, there were 79 outlets in five countries, some of them established via [[franchising]].&lt;ref name=may09/&gt;
