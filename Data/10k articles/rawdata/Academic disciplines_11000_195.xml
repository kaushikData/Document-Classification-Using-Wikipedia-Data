'''Aaron Marcus''' (born 22 May 1943)&lt;ref name=CAO&gt;{{cite book|title=Aaron Marcus|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] user-interface and information-visualization designer, as well as a computer graphics artist.

== Biography ==
Marcus was always interested in both science and technology as well as [[visual communication]]. He grew up in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], in the 1950s, he was interested in astronomy and paleontology, and drawing cartoons. He learned painting, and calligraphy. In secondary school, he studied science and art, and was editor of his high-school newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter for Alexenberg, Mel (2007). Educating Artists in a Digital Age. UK: Intellect Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his BA in Physics at  [[Princeton University]] in 1965. 
He obtained his BFA and MFA in 1968 at  [[Yale University]]’s School of Art and Architecture.
He learned about painting, drawing, printmaking, and letterpress printing workshops informally, photography, and art history. He also learned about book design, calligraphy, color, [[graphic design]], drawing, film making, printing, printmaking, painting, typography, and photography.

At Yale, while a design graduate student, he also began the study of [[computer graphics]], taking a course in basic functioning of computers, and he learned FORTRAN programming at the Yale Computer Center in the summer of 1966.

== Work ==
In 1967, Marcus spent a summer making [[ASCII art]] as a researcher at AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].

From 1968 to 1977, in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning and in the Visual Arts Program, he taught at Princeton University: color, computer art, [[computer graphics]], concrete/visual poetry, environmental graphics, exhibit design, [[graphic design]], history/philosophy of design/visual communication, [[information design]], [[information visualization]], layout, publication design, systematic design, semiotics/semiologie, typography, and [[visual design]].

In 1969-71, he programmed a prototype desktop publishing page-layout application for AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
In 1971-73, he claims to have programmed some of the first virtual reality art/design spaces ever created while a faculty member at Princeton University.

In the early 1980s, he was a Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, as well as a faculty member of the [[University of California at Berkeley]]’s College of Environmental Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationdesign.org/special/marcus_interview.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he founded [[Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc.]] (AM+A), a user-interface design and consulting company, one of the first such independent, computer-based design firms in the world.

'''''Angst und Vorurteil: AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung''''' (German: "Fear and prejudice: AIDS paranoia from the view of scientific prejudice studies") is a sociology book written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]] that was first published in 1989.

== Background ==

In 1988, due to her former scientific achievements Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was appointed member of the parliamentary inquiry commission ''Enquetekommission AIDS'' that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges. While the commission's 1990 final report focussed entirely on bio-chemical epidemiology and prevention, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's influence was incorporated mostly into its 1989 preliminary report dealing rather with sociological, cultural, and legal aspects.

The book ''Angst und Vorurteil - AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung'' was based on the work of the ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the [[Cabinet Kohl III|Helmut Kohl administration]].

== Content ==

=== ''Leibfeindlichkeit'', natural disasters, and epidemics ===

In ''Angst und Vorurteil'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in ''[[Tabu Homosexualität]]'' before, by pointing out in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' further aspects she had already brushed on in ''Der pädophile Impuls'' four years earlier. According to ''Angst und Vorurteil'', an important derivational motivation of ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' was an intense connotation that was at first numinous, then mythological, then religious in nature, of sexual deviance with divine punishments for it, particularly natural disasters and epidemics. An obvious, exemplary line originated from the [[Old Testament]] where [[leprosy]] was God's just answer to sensual sins, especially sins of the flesh; by the Medieval Age, the [[Black Death]] had taken the former place of leprosy in ecclesiastical dogma. Just when early science dawned, [[syphilis]] came from across the ocean to the Old World, perpetuating the ancient cultural notions repressive towards sensuality by seemingly confirming the idea that lose sexual morals resulted in severe epidemics of fatal diseases.

Western society's own cultural misconception of sexuality only supported perpetuation of these ancient cultural notions, as this misconception saw sexuality as purely procreative and thus purely penetrative in nature, whereas any non-penetrative sexual activity, while actually running a lower risk of STD infection, was regarded as deviant and sinful. Thereby Western science was barred from even just slightly disposing all the religious and cultural superstitions pertaining to sexuality that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] did away with in most any other field beside sexuality. Finally, the next significant loosening of traditional Western mores occurring after WWII, caused by penicillin and the anti-baby pill, was rolled back effectively in quite a similar reactionary process when HIV and AIDS arrived during the early 1980s, with quite similar cultural patterns as before of rationalizing derivations as ideological justifications, such as moral panics and witch hunts concerning factual or putative sexual minorities aka deviants.

=== Prejudice studies, sexuality, and ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' ===

On the other hand, in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re-inforcement of traditional Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots.

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice therein is largely informed by [[Frankfurt School|Critical Theory]] and its concept of the ''[[Authoritarian personality]]'' (also see ''[[Right-wing authoritarianism]]''), but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, ''[[Labeling theory]]'' by [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Howard S. Becker]], ''[[Social identity theory]]'' by [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]], ''[[Frustration aggression theory|Frustration-Aggression hypothesis]]'' by [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]], ''[[observational learning|Social learning theory]]'' by [[Albert Bandura]], as well as ''[[dispositif]]'' and ''[[discourse analysis]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]].

=== Prejudice's main function: In-group cohesiveness ===

As one important pattern of prejudice can be named, according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, that prejudice's main social function is creating and maintaining the in-group's [[group cohesiveness|social cohesiveness]], united against a constructed foe or enemy identity (''Feindbild'') tagged on marginalized out-groups that are thus perceived as threatening and must be overcome by harsh measures correlating to how outrageous and abominable these minorities are perceived by the majority in-group.

Without such a negative out-group identity, there is no cohesiveness for the majority in-group which itself is based on the Authoritarian personality type, and indeed the positive in-group identity is only created as a response to the constructed negative out-group identity. The majority in-group conceives itself, its own role and identity, as direct opposite of these marginalized out-groups down to every detail; filthy sinners and other outsiders or aliens, who are basically regarded as evil incarnate and often tagged with dehumanizing, partly zoomorphic attributes, are contrasted with good, decent, law-abiding citizens, as the most dichotomous, yet most basic socio-cultural and socio-psychological distinction in Western and [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] culture and civilization since the beginning of the [[Iron Age]].

Regarding the dehumanizing and zoomorphic attributes given to social out-groups, it is important to remember the influential cultural precursor quintessentially found in the archetype of the non-human, demonic, shape-shifting ''nithing'' fiend from ''Tabu Homosexualität'' (see [[Tabu Homosexualität|the book's own article]]).

=== The Authoritarian personality ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg links this in-group vs. out-group conflict model closely with neo-Freudian psychology, particularly the psychological apparatus of [[Id, ego, and super-ego]] and the defense mechanism of [[psychological projection]], in its socio-cultural interpretation of the Authoritarian personality type brought forth by Critical Theory. Early on, from earliest childhood, people's socialization consists of internalizing the difference of "good" and "evil" impulses, resulting in a psychological apparatus where those impulses labeled as the most "evil" and "filthiest" are separated from conscious ego by work of the super-ego consisting of the most forcefully internalized social values, and by means of [[psychological repression]] the repressed impulses turn into the unconscious Id.

The more forceful and restrictive the socialization, the more authoritarian a super-ego will result, and the behavioral result of internalizing these restrictive traditional values is at first learning to masochistically deny and repress certain impulses, then later on the continuously pent-up frustration is acted out as sadistically passing on these restrictive values on to others, which in case of the in-group's intention to inflict in-group values upon a minority out-group as a whole shows as discrimination all over [[Allport's Scale]].

Providing convenient targets for the Authoritarian personality's outlet, the negative out-group identity is created as a convenient [[psychological projection|projection screen]] made out of the repressed impulses; lowering the inhibition threshold for all kinds of discrimination including structural violence and even physical violence, the minority out-group is tagged with all kinds of negative attributes, partly dehumanizing, partly pathologizing, partly such mental and behavioral attributes that are factually harmful.

This process only works because the out-group is defined by not only imaginary or constructed attributes, but also by its factual attributes. The conscious mind of Authoritarian in-group members cannot even distinguish on the one hand between the out-group's factual and imaginary attributes, perceiving either as equally real. On the other hand, these in-group members are mentally incapable of distinguishing between any of the constructed imaginary attributes, as out-group members stereotypically appear to them as altogether and nothing but pathological, menacing, dangerous, abominable, and criminal, or, in a word, plain ''evil''.

=== Prejudice resembles intrusive thoughts, discrimination is OCD ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thus defines Authoritarian prejudice as socially learned manifest, recurring [[intrusive thoughts]] (''Zwangsvorstellungen'') that may spill over into [[Allport's Scale]] discrimination, including violent hate crimes, as a form of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive behavior]] (''Zwangshandlung''; also see [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms "distorted perception" (''verzerrte Wahrnehmung'', relating to Altemeyer's ''compartmentalized thinking'') of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of "natural order" and "society", and/or as protector of people they perceive as "victims" of the discriminated.

=== The Authoritarian and numinous characteristics of prejudice ===

Although ethnocentric prejudice is often pseudo-scientifically rationalized in Western modernity, it is inherently both modern Authoritarian and archaically [[numinous]] (i. e. a form of ''irrational'' related to [[magical thinking]]), in such that the following characteristics apply to prejudice:

*'''''"Das Vorurteil sucht seine eigene Bestätigung"''''' ("Prejudice seeks to self-corroborate"): The slightest imaginary or factual hint towards any individual out-group member conforming to prejudice is taken as undeniable corroborating evidence for the prejudice being justified (also see ''self-maintenance of prejudice'' below),
*'''Moral absolutism''': Particular prejudices are often presented in public and private discourse as an absolute, unquestionable social consensus, as the bare minimum standards of any civilized society, with a wide number of irrational ethnocentric derivations provided as rationalizations, and
*'''Guilt-by-association''': Any critic of prejudice is quickly suspected a sympathizer, even closeted member of the particular out-group.

=== Self-maintenance of prejudice: Prejudice, cognition, and social identity ===

As the human mind's cognitive structures are naturally disposed to both consciously and unconsciously gather and process information constantly in order to relate to the outside world, to oneself, and to one's own relations to the world (in other words, man constantly seeks and constructs sense, meaning, association, and belonging in order to understand and cope) also and most foremost in a social sense ("Who am I, and how do I relate to the social continuum around me?"), and because individual cognitive capabilities are as limited as that the individual is required to widely rely on social conventions in everyday life (which in combination with decreased instinctual drives is the origin of cognitive disposition towards ''social learning'' in primates), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg posits that if no more positive social identity relating to one's traits is available, then even the most negative social identity, no matter with what aggressive and harmful behavior it is associated, is preferred to total loss of identity.

As also individual social identity, i. e. what social group(s) an individual identifies with due to their traits, is socially learned, it is that the more Authoritarian and hostile the prejudiced discourse on a particular out-group, the fewer positive social identities are available to be acquired by individual out-group members. Therefore, the behavior-guiding individual social identity of out-group members is strongly influenced by the stigmatizing labels applied by the majority in-group, and prejudice may yield the very pathological traits, the very aggressive, harmful, even criminal behavior in individual out-group members that out-groups are said to indulge in. In short, the majority in-group's dominant prejudices can thereby result in a self-fulfilling prophecy, a process which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg dubs "self-maintenance of prejudice" (''Selbststabilisierung des Vorurteils''). For this reason, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg dedicated ''Angst und Vorurteil'' to the prefaced motto ''Minderheitenschutz ist Mehrheitenschutz'' ("Protecting minorities (from prejudice) helps protect the majority.")

Furthermore, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg expressly incorporates structural violence of the state, including involuntary medico-therapeutical intervention, as a form of discrimination, considering it a regulating, standardizing ''[[dispositif]]'' motivating further discrimination by "vigilant" individuals. Due to laws born out of ethnocentric prejudice, their potential to motivate "vigilant" hate crimes, and the tendency of dominant severe prejudice to self-fulfill, another prominent adage of the book is ''Falsche Gesetze zeitigen echte Verbrechen'' ("False laws ripen into true crimes.") which is also included in Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1972 fiction novel ''Deutschlands Hoffnung'', and her 1985/88 work ''Der pädophile Impuls''.

=== Sexual deviance and prejudice ===

Throughout Western history, particularly factual or putative sexual deviance could only be seen as pathologically and thus counter-naturally motivated, harmful and corrupting in its consequences, criminal according to the laws, heinous and despicable to any decent person's sentience and morals, basically just plain ''evil''. Most social out-groups in history were constructed by associating them with lewdness and sexual deviance, or, due to taboo making sexual deviance unmentionable directly, by means of cultural codifications for such that Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg related in detail after chronicling their cultural origins in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

Such cultural codes for lewdness and sexual deviance particularly included sadism, insidiousness, madness, weakness, cowardice, untrustworthiness, obsessive lying, betrayal, treason, evil sorcery, satanism, witchcraft, intoxicating drugs and poisoning potions, laziness, stubbornness, waywardness, incorrigibility, physical diseases and ailments (especially limping). These cultural codifications always have been, until the present day, largely identical with the imaginary, or constructed, attributes that sexual minorities were, and are, tagged with.

Additional such codifying associations were patterned according to particular sexual deviances, in such that these particular sexual minorities were perceived as either biologically or mentally faulted in a way that associated them with those social groups or social categories that their particular sexuality was regarded as naturally belonging to; for instance, gay males were regarded as effeminate, i. e. womanish, as women were regarded as the only category of people that could legitimately feel sexual desire towards men.

=== Countering strategies ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg criticizes as ineffective the traditional approach to prejudice of assuming that personal contact with out-group members might decrease prejudice towards their group, by pointing out, for instance, the societal situation of Jewish people in [[Austria-Hungary]] prior to [[World War I]]. Even though the percentage of Jews in population was much lower in the [[German Empire]] and thus Germans had much fewer personal contacts with Jews, [[anti-Semitism]] was much more common and radical in Austria-Hungary than it was in Germany at the time. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg explains this pattern as due to above-mentioned ''self-maintenance of prejudice'', the fact that ''prejudice seeks to self-corroborate'', and prejudice's tendency to self-fulfill.

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg lists three assumptively more effective countering strategies:
*Authorities, institutions, and the mass media must provide the general public with less biased, less emotional, and less scandalizing information regarding discriminated out-groups.
*More positive social identities relating to the particular factual traits of out-groups must be constructed and brought to attention both of the general public and individual out-group members.
*Collaborative goals must be provided in order to unite the majority in-group and minority out-groups for the same causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22675">In [[psychology]], '''anomalistic psychology''' is the study of human behaviour and experience connected with what is often called the [[paranormal]], with the assumption that there is nothing paranormal involved.

==Early history==
[[File:Henry Maudsley.jpg|thumb|180x180px|left|[[Henry Maudsley]] (1835–1918) an early researcher in anomalistic psychology.]]
According to anomalistic psychology, paranormal phenomena have naturalistic explanations resulting from [[psychological]] and [[Physics|physical]] factors which have given the false impression of paranormal activity to some people.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Holt, Christine Simmonds-Moore, David Luke, [[Chris French|Christopher French]]. (2012). ''Anomalistic Psychology (Palgrave Insights in Psychology)''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0230301504}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many early publications that gave rational explanations for alleged [[paranormal]] experiences.

The physician [[John Ferriar]] wrote ''An Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitions'' in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of [[ghosts]] were the result of [[optical illusions]]. Later, the French physician [[Alexandre Jacques François Brière de Boismont]] published ''On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism'' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of [[hallucinations]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane McCorristine. (2010). ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England, 1750–1920''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 44–56. {{ISBN|978-0521747967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Benjamin Carpenter]], in his book ''Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Etc: Historically and Scientifically Considered'' (1877), wrote that Spiritualist practices could be explained by fraud, delusion, [[hypnotism]] and [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benjamin Carpenter]]. (1877). ''Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Etc: Historically and Scientifically Considered''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1108027397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]], in ''Natural Causes and Supernatural Seemings'' (1886), wrote that so-called [[supernatural]] experiences could be explained in terms of disorders of the mind and were simply "malobservations and misinterpretations of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Leudar, Philip Thomas. (2000). ''Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity: Studies of Verbal Hallucinations''. Routledge. pp. 106–107. {{ISBN|978-0415147873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the German psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] and psychiatrist [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] formed the "critical occultism" position. This viewpoint interpreted psychical phenomena naturalistically. All apparent cases were attributed to fraud, [[suggestion]], [[Unconscious communication|unconscious cues]] or psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolffram, Heather. (2009). ''The Stepchildren of Science: Psychical Research and Parapsychology in Germany, C. 1870-1939''. Rodopi. pp. 83-130. {{ISBN|978-90-420-2728-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moll wrote that practices such as [[Christian Science]], Spiritualism and [[occultism]] were the result of fraud and hypnotic suggestion. Moll argued that suggestion explained the cures of Christian Science, as well as the apparently supernatural rapport between [[Animal magnetism|magnetisers]] and their somnambulists. He wrote that fraud and [[hypnotism]] could explain mediumistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wolffram, Heather. (2012). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381525/ ''‘Trick’, ‘Manipulation’ and ‘Farce’: Albert Moll’s Critique of Occultism'']. Medical History 56(2): 277–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel Weatherly (a psychiatrist) and [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] (a magician) wrote ''The Supernatural?'' (1891) which offered rational explanations for [[Apparitional experience|apparition]]s, paranormal and [[religious experience]]s and Spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Weatherly, [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. (2011). ''The Supernatural? (Cambridge Library Collection – Spiritualism and Esoteric Knowledge)''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1108029193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Jaspers]], in his book ''General Psychopathology'' (1913), stated that all paranormal phenomena are manifestations of psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Jaspers]]. (1913). ''General Psychopathology''. Baltimore. MD: Johns Hopkins. {{ISBN|978-0801858154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German ''Zeitschrift für Kritischen Okkultismus'' (Journal for Critical Occultism) operated from 1926-1928.&lt;ref name="Kurtz 1985"&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 487. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Richard Baerwald]] was the editor, and the journal published articles by Dessoir, Moll and others. It contained "some of the most important skeptical investigations of claims of the paranormal".&lt;ref name="Kurtz 1985"/&gt;

Other early scientists who studied anomalistic psychology include [[Millais Culpin]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] and [[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]].

==Modern research==

The phrase "Anomalistic Psychology" was a term first suggested by the psychologists [[Leonard Zusne]] and Warren Jones in their book ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'' (1989) which systematically addresses phenomena of human consciousness and behaviors that may appear to violate the laws of nature when they actually do not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Zusne]], Warren H. Jones. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-0805805086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian psychologist [[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]] published a major work on the subject ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]]. (1972). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience: A Cognitive Approach''. Hutchinson University Library. {{ISBN|978-0091132408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychological publications have explained in detail how reported paranormal phenomena such as [[mediumship]], [[precognition]], [[out-of-body experience]]s and [[psychic]]s can be explained by psychological factors without recourse to the supernatural. Researchers involved with anomalistic psychology try to provide plausible non-paranormal accounts, supported by empirical evidence, of how psychological and physical factors might combine to give the impression of paranormal activity when there had been none. Apart from deception or self-deception such explanations might involve [[cognitive bias]]es, anomalous psychological states, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative state]]s, hallucinations, personality factors, developmental issues and the nature of memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/apru/what/ What is Anomalistic Psychology?]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Chris French World Skeptics Congress Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|[[Chris French]] founder of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.]]

The psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] wrote that paranormal phenomena can be explained by [[magical thinking]], [[mental image]]ry, [[subjective validation]], [[coincidence]], hidden causes, and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David. (1988). ''The psychology of paranormal beliefs''. Experientia, 44, 332–337.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] wrote that many paranormal phenomena can be explained via psychological effects such as [[hallucination]]s, [[sleep paralysis]] and hidden memories, a phenomenon in which experiences that originally make little conscious impression are filed away in the brain to be suddenly remembered later in an altered form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1573920940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massimo Polidoro]], a professor of Anomalistic Psychology at the [[University of Milano Bicocca]], Italy, taught the course "Scientific Method, Pseudoscience and Anomalistic Psychology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massimopolidoro.com/english-version/bio-notes Biography of Massimo Polidoro]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable researcher is the British psychologist [[Chris French]] who set up the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit (APRU) in the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/weird-science/200909/anomalistic-psychology-what-is-it-and-why-bother Anomalistic psychology: What is it and why bother? by Chris French]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hauntings===

A psychological study (Klemperer, 1992) of [[ghost]]s wrote that visions of ghosts may arise from [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] hallucinations ("waking dreams" which are experienced in the transitional states to and from [[sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;Klemperer, Frances. (1992). [http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC1884722/pdf/bmj00105-0010.pdf ''Ghosts, Visions, And Voices: Sometimes Simply Perceptual Mistakes]''. BMJ: British Medical Journal, Vol. 305, No. 6868 (Dec. 19–26), pp. 1518–1519.&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment (Lange and Houran, 1997) 22 subjects visited five areas of a performance [[theatre]] and were asked to take note of the environment. Half of the subjects were informed that the locations they were in were [[Haunted house|haunted]], whilst the other half were told that the building was simply under [[renovation]]. The subjects' perceptions in both groups were recorded to an experiential questionnaire which contained 10 subscales related to psychological and physiological perceptions. The results showed more intense perceptual experiences on nine of the ten subscales from the group that was told the building was haunted, which has indicated that [[demand characteristics]] alone can stimulate paranormal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, R., and J. Houran. (1997). ''Context-induced paranormal experiences: Support for Houran and Lange's model of haunting phenomena''. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 84, 1455–1458.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study (Lange and Houran, 1998) suggested that [[poltergeist]] experiences are [[delusion]]s "resulting from the affective and cognitive dynamics of percipients' interpretation of ambiguous stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;Lange, R., Houran, J. (1998). ''Delusions of the paranormal: A haunting question of perception''. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 186 (10), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two experiments into alleged [[hauntings]] (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003) discovered that the data supported the "notion that people consistently report unusual experiences in ‘haunted’ areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations." Some of these factors included "the variance of local magnetic fields, size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware".&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R., C. Watt, P. Stevens, et al. (2003). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/BJP-hauntings.pdf ''An investigation into alleged “hauntings”'']. British Journal of Psychology, 94: 195–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediumship===

Research and empirical evidence from psychology for over a hundred years has revealed that where there is not fraud, [[mediumship]] and [[Spiritualism|Spiritualistic]] practices can be explained by psychological factors. Trance mediumship, which is claimed by the Spiritualists to be caused by discarnate [[spirit]]s speaking through the medium, has been proven in some cases to be the emergence of [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]] from the medium's [[Subconscious|subconscious mind]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Millais Culpin]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism and the New Psychology, an Explanation of Spiritualist Phenomena and Beliefs in Terms of Modern Knowledge''. Kennelly Press. {{ISBN|978-1446056516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium may obtain information about their clients, called sitters, by secretly [[eavesdropping]] on sitter's conversations or searching telephone directories, the [[internet]] and [[newspaper]]s before the sittings.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rowland. (1998). ''The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading''. London, England: Ian Roland. {{ISBN|978-0955847608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mediums are known for employing a technique called [[cold reading]] which involves obtaining information from the sitter's [[behavior]], [[clothing]], [[Human positions|posture]], and [[jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;Brad Clark (2002). ''Spiritualism''. pp. 220–226 in Michael Shermer. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1576076538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Smith. (2009). ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit''. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 141–241. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of fake [[Séance|seance]] experiments (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003), an actor [[Suggestion|suggested]] to [[paranormal]] believers and disbelievers that a table was [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] when, in fact, it remained stationary. After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake seances contained genuine paranormal phenomena. The experiments strongly supported the notion that in the seance room, believers are more suggestible than disbelievers to suggestions that are consistent with their belief in paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R., Greening, E., and Smith, M. (2003). [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2299/2278/1/103252.pdf ''Belief in the paranormal and suggestion in the seance room'']. British Journal of Psychology, 94 (3): 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment (O'Keeffe and Wiseman, 2005) involving 5 mediums found no evidence to support the notion that the mediums under controlled conditions were able to demonstrate paranormal or mediumistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keeffe, C. &amp; Wiseman, R. (2005). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/MediumBJP.pdf ''Testing alleged mediumship: Methods and results'']. British Journal of Psychology, Vol. 96, 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal healing===

A study in the [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]] (Rose, 1954) investigated [[Energy medicine|spiritual healing]], [[therapeutic touch]] and [[faith healing]]. In a hundred cases that were investigated no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rose. (1954). ''Some Aspects Of Paranormal Healing''. British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 4900, pp. 1329–1332.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial was carried out by a group of scientists (Beutler, 1988) to see whether three treatment groups, paranormal [[laying on of hands]], paranormal healing at a distance and no paranormal healing to test if they might reduce [[blood pressure]]. The data did not reveal any paranormal effects as no significant differences between the three treatment groups were found. The results concluded that the fall in blood pressure in all three of the groups was caused by the [[psychosocial]] approach and the [[placebo effect]] of the trial itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beutler, J., Attevelt, J., Schouten, S., Faber, J., Mees, E., &amp; Geijskes, G. (1988). ''Paranormal healing and hypertension''. British Medical Journal, 296, 1491–1494.&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of paranormal healing known as [[psychic surgery]] has been discovered to be the result of [[sleight of hand]] tricks. Psychic surgeons pretend to reach into the patient's body but the [[skin]] is never punctured, there are no scars and the [[blood]] is released from packets hidden in the surgeon's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Moore. (1992). ''Debunking the Paranormal: We Should Teach Critical Thinking as a Necessity for Living, Not Just as a Tool for Science''. The American Biology Teacher, Vol. 54, No. 1, pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychokinesis===

[[Cognitive bias]]es have been found in some cases of [[psychokinesis]]. A meta-analysis  by Bösch, ''et al'' (2006) of 380 studies found that "statistical significance of the overall database provides no directive as to whether the phenomenon is genuine or not" and came to the conclusion that "publication bias appears to be the easiest and most encompassing explanation for the primary findings of the meta-analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Bösch, H., Steinkamp, F., Boller, E. (2006). [http://www.ebo.de/publikationen/pk_ma.pdf ''Examining Psychokinesis: The Interaction of Human Intention with Random Number Generators. A Meta-Analysis Examining Psychokinesis: The Interaction of Human Intention with. Random Number Generators. A Meta-Analysis'']. Psychological Bulletin, 132 (4): 497–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Wiseman]] there are a number of ways for faking psychokinetic metal bending (PKMB) these include switching straight objects for pre-bent duplicates, the concealed application of force, and secretly inducing metallic fractures. Research has also suggested that (PKMB) effects can be created by [[Suggestion|verbal suggestion]]. On this subject (Harris, 1985) wrote:

{{cquote|If you are doing a really convincing job, then you should be able to put a bent key on the table and comment, ‘Look, it is still bending’, and have your spectators really believe that it is. This may sound the height of boldness; however, the effect is astounding – and combined with suggestion, it does work.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Harris. (1985). ''Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect''. Calgary: Micky Hades International. {{ISBN|978-0919230927}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an experimental study (Wiseman and Greening, 2005) two groups of participants were shown a [[videotape]] in which a fake psychic placed a bent [[key (lock)|key]] on a table. Participants in the first group heard the fake psychic suggest that the key was continuing to bend when it had remained stationary, whilst those in the second group did not. The results revealed that participants from the first group reported significantly more movement of the key than the second group. The findings were replicated in another study. The experiments had demonstrated that "testimony for PKMB after effects can be created by verbal suggestion, and therefore the testimony from individuals who have observed allegedly genuine demonstrations of such effects should not be seen as strong evidence in support of the paranormal".&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R. &amp; Greening, E. (2005). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/BJP-key.pdf ''It's still bending': verbal suggestion and alleged psychokinetic ability'']. British Journal of Psychology, 96, 115–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote viewing===
Research has suggested that in cases the participants of [[remote viewing]] experiments are influenced by [[subjective validation]], a process through which correspondences are perceived between stimuli that are in fact associated purely randomly. [[Sensory cue]]s have also occurred in remote viewing experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David. (1981). ''Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments''. Nature 292: 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telepathy===
Research has discovered that in some cases [[telepathy]] can be explained by a [[Covariance|covariation bias]]. In an experiment (Schienle ''et al''. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Schienle, A., Vaitl, D., and Stark, R. (1996). ''Covariation bias and paranormal belief''. Psychological Reports, 78, 291–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by [[Hindsight bias|hindsight]] and [[Confirmation bias|confirmation]] biases.&lt;ref&gt;Rudski, J. M. (2002). ''Hindsight and confirmation biases in an exercise in telepathy''. Psychological Reports, 91, 899–906.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with parapsychology==

Anomalistic psychology is sometimes described as a sub-field of [[parapsychology]], however, anomalistic psychology rejects the paranormal claims of parapsychology. According to [[Chris French]]:

{{cquote|The difference between anomalistic psychology and parapsychology is in terms of the aims of what each discipline is about. Parapsychologists typically are actually searching for evidence to prove the reality of paranormal forces, to prove they really do exist. So the starting assumption is that paranormal things do happen, whereas anomalistic psychologists tend to start from the position that paranormal forces probably don't exist and that therefore we should be looking for other kinds of explanations, in particular the psychological explanations for those experiences that people typically label as paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videojug.com/interview/anomalistic-psychology-2 Interview with Chris French on Anomalistic psychology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520125500/http://www.videojug.com/interview/anomalistic-psychology-2 |date=May 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anomalistic psychology has been reported to be on the rise. It is now offered as an option on many psychology degree programmes and is also an option on the A2 psychology syllabus in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/12/19/the-rise-of-anomalistic-psychology-%E2%80%93-and-the-fall-of-parapsychology The rise of anomalistic psychology – and the fall of parapsychology?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Cornazzano''' (c. 1430 in [[Piacenza]] – 1484&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Dance|last = Kassig|first = Gayle|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2007|isbn =9780736060356|location = Champaign, IL|pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ferrara]]) was an Italian poet, writer, biographer, and [[Choreography|dancing master]].

In the city of Piacenza, which was then in the Duchy of [[Milan]], Antonio Cornazzano was born probably in 1432. His father, Bonifacio Cornazzano was a well-known lawyer and his mother, Costanza Bagarotti, belonged to the small nobility from Piacentine territory. Cornazzano studied at the university of [[Siena]] between 1444–47, and in 1450 he was in Rome, probably in the service of a high prelate. He then found his way to Milan in 1455, where he served Duke [[Francesco Sforza]], and wrote a long poem in praise of the Duke, his 'De gestis Francisci Sfortiae' or 'Sforziade'. He also wrote a small treatise on the art of dancing, a life of the Virgin Mary and a Latin scurrilous collection of 'novellae' "De proverbiorum origine". After attending the Duke's funeral in 1466, he left Milan. He moved to Venetian territory and, for a time, worked with the condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, whose biography Cornazzano wrote in Latin. In Venice, he worked with the printer Nicolas Jenson, and published a "Life of Christ". In 1475, he moved to the court of Ferrara, where he wrote important works; a short treatise on government, and one on military art (c. 1476) in prose. He later turned the latter into a terza rima poem. He died in Ferrara in 1484.

==Cornazzano's Poetic Life==
There is a manuscript in the Estense Library in Modena, Italy, written in 15th or 16th century script. It contains four poetic Italian works by Corazzano in ''terza rima''- a form of stanza that requires a set of three lines that rhyme. ''Terza rima'' was first used by Italian Dante Alighieri. Of the four works, three were published, along with a number of his poems in the same style. The title of ''Opera nova'' were given to these selections published in 1517 and 1518. Of Cornazzano's four works mentioned above, one, the first of the series,''De mulieribus admirandis'', was never published (but see C. FAHY, "The 'De mulieribus admirandis' of Antonio Cornazzano" in LA BIBLIOFILIA, 52 (1960) pp.&amp;nbsp;144–174). It, in fact, has grown in obscurity over the many years since its creation until it has nearly been wiped from history's rich pages. It has even received little, if any attention from the scholarly men of Italy.
(The above is rather sketchy) for accurate, reliable and scholarly information,

See: R.L. BRUNI and D. ZANCANI, Antonio Cornazzano: La tradizione testuale, Florence, Olschki 1992.

There is another article in English on Cornazzano, apart from Fahy's, by D. ZANCANI, 'Antonio Cornazzano's "De l'integrita' de la militare arte"', in "Chivalry in the Renaissance, ed. by S. Anglo, Woodbridge, Boydell 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–24.

==Cornazzano's Life Of Dancing==
Cornazzano's dancing master was [[Domenico da Piacenza]], who was perhaps better known as Domenico da Ferrara. Cornazzano was a fellow student with Guglielmo Ebreo. He once said this concerning his dancing master, he is the ''king of the art''. Cornazzano published his Libro dell'arte del danzare in 1455 a treatise on dancing in the 15th century.

'''Applied Scholastics''' is a [[non-profit]] corporation founded in 1972 to promote the use of study techniques created by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]].  Hubbard called his theories on learning and education "[[study technology]]." Applied Scholastics runs the "Hollywood Education and Literacy Project" (HELP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html Hollywood Education and Literacy Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207202503/http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html |date=2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Literacy Crusade]], "Education Alive", and the "Literacy, Education and Abilities Program" (LEAP).

Applied Scholastics' declared mission is: "to promote and develop programs of effective education for educators, business trainers, tutors, parents, children and people in all walks of life who need improved study skills to enhance their scholastic, business and personal activities."

Applied Scholastics is sponsored by the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="times2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tighe|first1=Mark|title=Scientologists target schoolchildren|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/scientologists-target-schoolchildren-m0sv2xgk3|website=The Times|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |title=Scientology's Education Fronts - Applied Scholastics International |year=2007 |publisher=''studytech.org'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514032959/http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |archivedate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study Tech==
{{Main|Study Tech}}
Study Tech is a teaching methodology developed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]].

Hubbard's theories on education describe three "barriers to learning". The first is the absence of mass, pertaining to the lack of a physical object relating to a concept. The second is a steep study "gradient", meaning a necessary previous step was skipped to master a skill. The third is the "misunderstood word", which necessitates looking up unclear words in the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texts highlight scientology's role in education. |journal=Education Week |last=Walsh |first=Mark |issn=0277-4232 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-12-01 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are taught that "misunderstood words" are a major cause of confusion and misunderstanding. They are taught to use dictionaries extensively. Emphasis is also put on making sure children are taught at a "gradient", so that a subject's crucial elementary concepts come before more difficult concepts. "Mass" is described as a measure of mental tangibility that students ascribe to a subject, so that students have a picture in their mind of the thing they are learning about.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Applied Scholastics licenses [[Study Tech]] to a number of schools throughout the world. In return, these schools pay 4% of their [[gross income]] to Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref name="License Agreement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040715154510/http://www.able.org/pages/grp_forms/aps_lic_agr.pdf ABLE license contract for the use of Applied Scholastics trademarks] ([[PDF]] format. Archived March 18, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
In 1992, [[Applied Materials]] settled a lawsuit for an estimated $600,000. The lawsuit claimed that the three former employees who filed the lawsuit had been driven out of the company because they had complained about the seminars Applied Scholastics had been contracted to teach there. Applied Scholastics said regarding the case, "In ten years of business, we've never had anything come up like this." &lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{Cite news

In 1998, the group submitted five of its books for approval as supplemental classroom texts to the [[California Department of Education]]. The review board found no religious content to object to, although they did object to the lack of portrayals of disabled persons and people of color. The Southern California [[American Civil Liberties Union]], however, objected on the basis that the books used many of the terms and concepts that the Church of Scientology uses elsewhere in its [[Study Tech]].&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Szalanski|first=Andrea |title= 'Clearing' Johnny to read |journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=12 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Applied Scholastics convinced the principal of Prescott Middle School in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] to implement a program of Study Tech.&lt;ref name=door/&gt; Critics worried that the move was "an insidious plan ultimately aimed at promoting Scientology."&lt;ref name=door&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Farley | title = Scientology makes it in classroom door | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 2007-05-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919141137/http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml| archivedate= 19 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prescott's principal and two education experts claimed that they "saw [no] hidden Scientology agenda or proselytizing in the text."&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; The school's principal felt that the program was worthwhile.&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; In October 2005, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] Public Schools superintendent Creg Williams discovered the group's Scientology connections and immediately advised area principals to cease working with Applied Scholastics. Additionally, CEO Bennetta Slaughter falsely claimed a "partnership" with the Hazelwood School District in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kristen | last = Hinman | title = L Is for L.

Some parents were upset when Applied Scholastics methods were introduced in September 2008 at Bambolino [[Montessori method|Montessori]] Academy, a private school in [[Toronto]]. The owner/principal and dean of the school are both Scientologists but they say that Applied Scholastics is secular and that they do not teach Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html|title=Scientology link at Montessori school alarms parents|date=2009-09-18|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923044223/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a charter{{clarify|date=August 2017}} school group in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] came under criticism for using tools provided by Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2013/03/27/174441623/peter-o-dowd-tk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16542">'''Auditory imagery''' is a form of [[mental imagery]] that is used to organize and analyze sounds when there is no external auditory stimulus present.  This form of imagery is broken up into a couple of auditory modalities such as verbal imagery or musical imagery.  This modality of mental imagery differs from other sensory images such as [[motor imagery]] or [[visual imagery]].  The vividness and detail of auditory imagery can vary from person-to-person depending on their background and condition of their brain.  Through all of the research developed to understand auditory imagery [[behavioral neuroscience|behavioral neuroscientists]] have found that the auditory images developed in subject’s minds are generated in real time and consist of fairly precise information about quantifiable auditory properties as well as [[melody|melodic]] and [[harmonic]] relationships.  These studies have been able to recently gain confirmation and recognition due to the arrival of [[Positron emission tomography]] and [[fMRI]] scans that can confirm a [[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] correlation.

==Image properties==

===Tempo===

The accuracy of [[tempo]] within an auditory image usually suffers when recalled however the consistency of a person’s perception of tempo is preserved.  When surveying subject’s auditory imagery that their sense of tempo usually stays within 8% of the original tempo heard in a song that the subject heard at some point in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Levitin, D. J., &amp; Cook, P. R. (1996). Memory for musical tempo: Additional evidence that auditory memory is absolute. Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 58(6), 927-935.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was shown by having subjects compare the pitch of two words in a song.  For instance, people can sing through “[[Jingle Bells]]” in their head and determine if there is a difference in pitch between the word ‘Snow’ and ‘Sleigh’.  Experiments like this have shown it takes longer to compare the pitches of two words if the space between the two words is larger.  Therefore the tempo structure of the melody is preserved in the auditory image.  However, if someone had musical training then the person has more flexibility in his or her auditory imagery tempo representations.&lt;ref name = Hubbard&gt;Hubbard, T. L. (2010). Auditory imagery: Empirical findings. Psychological bulletin, 136(2), 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch===

Humans retain a relatively strong auditory image for details in [[pitch (music)|pitch]], which can be improved with musical training.   The development of cultivating an auditory image with [[absolute pitch]], which is being able to determine a note upon hearing a sound, however is dependent on childhood musical training and [[genetics|genetic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, M. (2005). Auditory imagery: a review and challenges ahead: Technical report, SSKKII-2005.01. SSKKII center for cognitive science, Göteborg University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;  People are able to improve their discrimination of pitch; however, they cannot improve their detection.  Auditory image pitch detection studies have shown that response time decreases when judging two high pitches as opposed to judging two low pitches.&lt;ref name="Hubbard" /&gt;

===Loudness===

Of the many aspects of sound, [[loudness]] is a characteristic of auditory imagery that is usually lost or impaired.  This is evident when people attempt to image a song and there is little noticeable volume dynamics in the auditory image.  According to Pitt and Crowder, the encoding of loudness into our auditory imagery was shown to have little correlation with any physiological neural factors.  Other scientists such as Intons-Petersons believe that there is encoding for loudness in our auditory images that if so it most likely occurs in a person’s [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name = Hubbard /&gt;

===Verbal===

The auditory imagery developed from [[lyrics]] or words generally is also considered a part of [[internal monologue|inner speech]].  When people image their voice or the voices of others it is considered inner speech but some researchers argue that it is a lack of self-monitoring of speech.  This generally refers to imagining speech which can occur when trying to remember what someone said or the sound of their voice which can be elicited voluntarily or involuntarily.  Auditory verbal imagery is considered useful for practicing and organizing things people would like to say in person.  For instance, practicing a speech or getting ready to sing a part in a song.&lt;ref&gt;Shergill, S., Bullmore, E., Brammer, M., Williams, S., Murray, R., &amp; McGuire, P. (2001). A functional study of auditory verbal imagery. Psychological medicine, 31(2), 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==

===Auditory imagery===

[[Cognitive science|Cognitive scientists]] are very interested in finding out what brain structures are involved with mental imaging in order to provide consistent, localized, and more tangible evidence.  It has been established that auditory imagery makes use of the right lobe since people with right lobe lesions tend to have difficulty generating auditory images.  This is because auditory imaging requires the usage of the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal]] right lobe as well as a lot of the right auditory association cortices.  These portions of the brain are usually involved with interpreting the inflections of sounds (such as sad or angry sounds).&lt;ref&gt;Zatorre, R. J., &amp; Halpern, A. R. (2005). Mental concerts: musical imagery and auditory cortex. Neuron, 47(1), 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[supplementary motor area]] is also involved in image generation and encodes motor processes to do, while the right [[thalamus]] is hypothesized to be a part of auditory image retrieval.  The activation of the supplementary motor area is also relevant since it is a portion of the brain that is involved when a motor task is imagined as opposed to overly executed.  This shows that developing an auditory image is partially a motor task.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, A. R., &amp; Zatorre, R. J. (1999). When that tune runs through your head: a PET investigation of auditory imagery for familiar melodies. Cerebral Cortex, 9(7), 697-704&lt;/ref&gt;

During auditory verbal imagery, the inferior [[frontal cortex]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] were activated as well as the supplementary motor area, left superior temporal/inferior parietal region, the right posterior [[cerebellar cortex]], the left precentral, and [[superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal gyri]].  Other areas of the brain have been activated during auditory imagery however there hasn’t been an encoding process attributed to it yet such as frontopolar areas, and the [[subcallosal area|subcallosal gyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zatorre, R. J., Halpern, A. R., Perry, D. W., Meyer, E., &amp; Evans, A. C. (1996). Hearing in the mind's ear: A PET investigation of musical imagery and perception. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 8(1), 29-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipatory imagery===

[[File:Anticipatory Imagery Figure.png|thumb|When people receive auditory input an auditory image is developed. As the associations with pieces of organized sound become stronger and more intricate, the silence involved in the sound can initiate auditory images in the brain.]]

As associations between pieces of sound such as music or repetitive dialogue become stronger and more complex even the silence involved in the sound can initiate auditory images in the brain.  Studies have been done in which people listen to a CD over and over with silence in between tracks and the neural activity was analyzed using [[fMRI]].  It was consistently found the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[premotor cortex|premotor cortical]] areas were active during the anticipation of auditory imagery.  The caudal PFC was used a lot during the early stages of learning of the song while in later stages the rostral PFC was used more indicating a shift in the cortex regions used during auditory imaging association.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, D. J. M., Macrae, C. N., Green, A. E., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2005). Musical imagery: sound of silence activates auditory cortex. Nature, 434(7030), 158-158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leaver, A. M., Van Lare, J., Zielinski, B., Halpern, A. R., &amp; Rauschecker, J. P. (2009). Brain activation during anticipation of sound sequences. The Journal of Neuroscience, 29(8), 2477-2485&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image perception==

===Musical training and experience===

Musical training has consistently shown to be a powerful way to refine auditory imagery enabling people to discern and manipulate various characteristics of sound such as pitch, timbre, tempo, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Lotze, M., Scheler, G., Tan, H. R. M., Braun, C., &amp; Birbaumer, N. (2003). The musician's brain: functional imaging of amateurs and professionals during performance and imagery. Neuroimage, 20(3), 1817-1829.&lt;/ref&gt;  Musical training can cause localized networks of [[neurons]] to fire synchronously a lot more easily through spatial temporal firing patterns ([[Hebbian theory]]), which may explain why non-musical auditory imagery is enhanced in musically trained subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Meister, I. G., Krings, T., Foltys, H., Boroojerdi, B., Müller, M., Töpper, R., &amp; Thron, A. (2004). Playing piano in the mind—an fMRI study on music imagery and performance in pianists. Cognitive Brain Research, 19(3), 219-228.&lt;/ref&gt;  For musically naïve people, music is mainly an external experience.  Naïve people are significantly worse than highly trained individuals on all auditory imagery tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Aleman, A., Nieuwenstein, M. R., Böcker, K. B. E., &amp; de Haan, E. H. F. (2000). Music training and mental imagery ability. Neuropsychologia, 38(12), 1664-1668.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference in vividness===

Even though subjects can’t confuse an auditory image as a perceived sound some people may experience very vivid auditory images.  The difference in vividness from person to person can be an important neuronal correlation of sensory processes and higher-order cognition.  The Bucknell Auditory Imagery Score assesses the vividness of a person’s auditory imagery and was shown to correlate directly with the neuronal activity of the superior temporal gyrus as well as the prefrontal cortex.  Musical training does not produce an improvement in the vividness of auditory images however data showing if vividness can be improved or a circuit dedicated to vividness has shown to be inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Herholz, S. C., Halpern, A. R., &amp; Zatorre, R. J. (2012). Neuronal correlates of perception, imagery, and memory for familiar tunes. Journal of cognitive neuroscience, 24(6), 1382-1397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreaming===

There have been a few studies conducted concerning auditory imagery generated in subjects during [[dream]]ing.  There are different kinds of auditory imagery people experience in their dreams when waking up from [[rapid eye movement sleep]].  Auditory imagery is generally fairly common in rapid eye movement sleep with the majority of it being verbal auditory imagery.  Studies found that the last auditory images in a dream are usually words spoken by the self-character in the dream.  Some findings concerning the dream auditory imagery in patients with brain lesions and children’s dreams have been done as well but are more speculative.&lt;ref name = Hubbard /&gt;

===Notational audiation===

There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that reading musical notation can cause musicians to sense an auditory image of the notes they are reading which is a phenomenon called [[notational audiation]].  Present studies show that only some musicians who can read musical notation can hear an inner voice emulating the melody while reading the notation which has served as an interesting mode of study to understand the way information is encoded in the brain.  Musicians have their sense of notational audiation significantly impaired during phonatory distractions due to the conflicting signals induced onto a single sensory modality.  Some musicians who are proficient at reading [[sheet music]] may experience an auditory image while reading over the excerpt for [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 40]] from [[Mozart]] below.&lt;ref&gt;Brodsky, W., Henik, A., Rubinstein, B. S., &amp; Zorman, M. (2003). Auditory imagery from musical notation in expert musicians. Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 65(4), 602-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mozart 40.png|Mozart 40]]

===Schizophrenia===

Schizophrenic patients have a weakened sense of reality and how to respond to reality.  Moreover, 60% of patients suffering from [[schizophrenia]] are hypothesized to have a much more vivid sense of auditory imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Oertel, V., Rotarska-Jagiela, A., van de Ven, V., Haenschel, C., Grube, M., Stangier, U., . . . Linden, D. E. J. (2009). Mental imagery vividness as a trait marker across the schizophrenia spectrum. Psychiatry Research, 167(1–2), 1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.12.008&lt;/ref&gt;  When normal subjects and schizophrenic subjects were both asked to generate an auditory image, schizophrenic patients were shown to have a much weaker activation of the posterior cerebral cortex, [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], [[Lentiform nucleus|bilateral lenticular nuclei]], right thalamus, middle and superior cortex, and left [[nucleus accumbens]].  These areas are important to inner speech and verbal self-monitoring which may explain why schizophrenia is more likely to induce [[auditory hallucinations]].  These auditory hallucinations differ from an internal monologue which is usually imagined in the first person.  The hallucinations on the other hand are imagined in the second and third person which is speculated to be caused by increased activity in the left premotor, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortex, and supplementary motor area during second or third person imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Shergill, S. S., Bullmore, E., Simmons, A., Murray, R., &amp; McGuire, P. (2000). Functional anatomy of auditory verbal imagery in schizophrenic patients with auditory hallucinations. American Journal of Psychiatry, 157(10), 1691-1693.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seal, M., Aleman, A., &amp; McGuire, P. (2004). Compelling imagery, unanticipated speech and deceptive memory: Neurocognitive models of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, 9(1-2), 43-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications and research directions==

Studies on auditory imagery can give insight to involuntary intrusive images called [[earworms]].  A relatable phenomenon in which the lay person has experienced an earworm is when a [[jingle]] gets stuck in a person’s head.  However, some people suffering from [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] may have stubborn earworms that stay for a much longer period of time on the order of years in which research in auditory imagery may be able to salvage them and get rid of their auditory image.&lt;ref&gt;Communications, A. U. (2012). Involuntary Musical Imagery (earworms) - research by Lassi Liikkanen, Aalto University. aaltouniversity, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc5my6Lfipo&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies are important for [[psychologist]]s who want to understand how human [[memory]] and musical [[cognition]] works.  For most modes of memory, people do not spontaneously remember facts or ideas throughout their day unless it is pressing to their current situation, however auditory imagery can spontaneously and constantly occur to people so evidence tells that this mode of memory differs from others.  For instance, the auditory images that are remembered are usually 10–20 seconds long, however remembering facts or scenes do not necessarily hold time stamps like auditory images do.  This insight would hold relevance on understanding the relationship of music and memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icmpc-escom2012.web.auth.gr/sites/default/files/papers/587_Proc.pdf Liikkanen, L. A. New Directions for Understanding Involuntary Musical Imagery.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428105724/http://icmpc-escom2012.web.auth.gr/sites/default/files/papers/587_Proc.pdf |date=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, [[musicians]] and music educators may be able to lessen the amount of practice they have to physically do by honing their auditory imagery due to the refinement of auditory discrimination and organization.  By improving a person's ability to manipulate their 'inner ear' and concept of auditory images they can learn and play music better on a shorter time scale with less effort.

'''Biopower''' (or ''biopouvoir'' in French) is a term coined by French [[scholar]], [[historian]], and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]]. It relates to the practice of modern [[nation states]] and their regulation of their subjects through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the [[control of populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the [[Collège de France]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977&amp;ndash;1978'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4; see notes on p.&amp;nbsp;24, notes&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Society Must Be Defended'' Lectures at the Collège de France 1975&amp;ndash;1976 p.&amp;nbsp;243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the term first appeared in print in ''The Will To Knowledge'', Foucault's first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, (1998) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal [[physical health]]. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, [[biopolitics]], which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/biopolitics-an-overview/|title=Biopolitics: An Overview|date=2013-01-21|work=The Anthropology of Biopolitics|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foucault's conception ==

For Foucault, biopower is a [[technology]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] for managing [[humans]] in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' and ''biopolitics of the population'' through societal ''[[Disciplinary institutions]]''. Initially imposed from outside whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes [[encoded]] into social practices as well as human behavior as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible—the emergence of the modern [[nation state]], [[capitalism]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v013/13.1.policante.html|title=Amedeo Policante. "War against Biopower: Timely Reflections on an Historicist Foucault", ''Theory &amp; Event'', 13. 1 March 2010|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled ''Security, Territory, Population'' delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

{{cquote|By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how, starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species. This is what I have called biopower.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, "an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature Vol 490'' p. 309, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It produces a generalized disciplinary society&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 377-378, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''regulatory controls'' through ''biopolitics of the population''".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.,&amp;nbsp;378 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population’’, see also note 71, p. 397 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Sexuality Vol 1'' p.&amp;nbsp;139 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture ''Society Must Be Defended'', Foucault examines ''biopolitical state racism'', and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopolitics&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;91 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and discipline:

{{cquote|Where discipline is the technology deployed to make individuals behave, to be efficient and productive workers, biopolitics is deployed to manage population; for example, to ensure a healthy workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.&amp;nbsp;239&amp;ndash;64 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that the previous [[Greco-Roman]], [[Medieval]] rule of the [[Roman emperor]], the [[Divine right of kings]], [[Absolute monarchy]] and the [[popes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;401 2007&lt;/ref&gt; model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor [[body politic]] which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called [[Estates of the realm]] and the Medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]] next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of [[high treason]] and if found guilty the sentence of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]] was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2)'' 1351 "When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell ''Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of [[political power]]. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; [[liberal democracy]] and [[Political parties]]; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe in 1929(most certainly as late as 1971 in Switzerland see [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland]]), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous [[Jim Crow laws]] in 1964 (see [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of ''[[Disciplinary institutions|Disciplinary institution]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;16 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of ''anatomo-politics of the human body,'' a biopolitics and bio-history of man.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio-history and Biopolitics ''Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‐130, October 2014'' Originally published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to [[Arthur Jensen]] overt racism and Foucault's great friend [[Jacques Ruffié]] response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie à la culture [From biology to culture]&lt;/ref&gt; A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a "scientific" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;163&amp;ndash;90 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was [[stochastic]] and "massifying" rather than "individualizing". By "massifying" Foucault means transforming into a population ("population state"),&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.55-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the [[state (polity)|State]] "governs less" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this ''anatomo-biopoltics'' of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the [[Mathematical sciences]] and the [[Biological sciences]]–coupled together with the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the 19th century was precisely that, I wouldn't say exactly that sovereignty's old right-to take life or let live-was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which penetrate it, permeate. To say that power took possession of life in the nineteenth century, or to say that power at least takes life under its care in the nineteenth century, is to say that it has, thanks to the play of technologies of discipline on the one hand and technologies of regulation on the other, succeeded in covering the whole surface that lies between the organic and the biological, between body and population. We are, then, in a power that has taken control of both the body and life or that has, if you like, taken control of life in general – with the body as one pole and the population as the other. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as a political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem I would like in fact like to trace the transformation not at the level of political theory, but rather at the level of the mechanisms, techniques, and technologies of power. We saw the emergence of techniques of power that were essentially centered on the body, on the individual body. They included all devices that were used to ensure the spatial distribution of individuals bodies (their separation, their alignment, their serialization, and their surveillance)and the organization, around those individuals, of a whole field of visibility. They were also techniques that could be used to take control over bodies. Attempts were made to increase their productive force through exercise, drill, and so on. They were also techniques for rationalizing and strictly economizing on a power that had to be used in the least costly way possible, thanks to whole system of surveillance, hierarchies, inspections, book-keeping, and reports-all the technology of labor. It was established at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the course of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.241-244 and p.252 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]] Challenges pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with [[Samuel P. Huntington]] at the [[National Academy of Sciences]]) (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than "behaviour control technologies", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

{{cquote|If [[genocide]] is indeed the dream of modern power, this is not because of the recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sexuality'' Volume 1 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Milieu intérieur'' ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project namely the [[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]] (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;296 p.&amp;nbsp;308 Note 14 2007&lt;/ref&gt; political economy and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;29-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (''arcana imperii,'' from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by [[Jean Bodin]]. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insist; in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'),the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'.In which Foucault mentions a group called ''The Ideologues'' where the term ''[[Ideology]]'' first appears and is taken from.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCaffery ''Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They?'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, pp.&amp;nbsp;83&amp;ndash;84, note&amp;nbsp;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is through 'regimes of truth' Foucault argues that [[raison d'état]] achieves its political and biological success.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;78, p.&amp;nbsp;283, notes&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio-and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions belonging to the early Middle Ages.

One major thinker which forms a parallel with Foucault’s own work is the Medieval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;ndash;29 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy'' 5 pp.&amp;nbsp;9&amp;ndash;18 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discipline and Punish'' p.&amp;nbsp;330 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Golczewski ''Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law'' Universitas 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the [[body politic]] (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term [[Corporation]] which would later become known to us as [[capitalism]], an economic category).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz ''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;273&amp;ndash;313 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz also refers to the [[Glossator]]'s belonging to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The [[Lords Appellant]] and the commentaries of jurist [[Edmund Plowden]]&lt;ref&gt;The commentaries, or Reports of [[Edmund Plowden]] 1561&lt;/ref&gt; and his Plowden Reports.&lt;ref&gt;Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kantorowicz analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the [[hereditary succession]] of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order ([[Politicians]]) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.&lt;ref&gt;''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;42&amp;ndash;78 and pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;107 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the democratisation of [[Sovereignty]], which is known in modern political terms as "[[Liberal democracy]]". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears(with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the [[Nobility]]—in an uneasy Medieval alliance and at times, it appeared fractious.&lt;ref&gt;According to Sidney Madge the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom, Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.''The Domesday Of Crown Lands'', pp. 20–21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of Madge's information comes from [[Charles Henry Pearson]] meticulous study of the [[domesday]] records.{{Cite book|title=History Of England During The Early Middles Ages Volume 1 1867|last=Charles Henry Pearson|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}. Madge places the barons majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%) by the time of the [[Norman conquest]] the monarch of the day—according to Madge analysis of Pearson's work the king wasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065 before the conquest and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful [[Roman Catholic]] church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy, and auditing system based on the basic premise: what was the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the whole kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case means the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King known as the [[Barons of the exchequer]], run, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp.&amp;nbsp;20&amp;ndash;21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see [[Barons war]].

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the prime minister, one could argue is it irony or fierce logic that dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the new founded urban population in the form of production and [[Political power]] that it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking over and ultimately giving the [[Nation state]] not only its rationale but its "governing less" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity giving the machine (Foucault uses the term [[Dispositif]]) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence.

Foucault makes special note on the biological "naturalness" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this "naturalness" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with [[Georges Canguilhem]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-27, see notes 37&amp;ndash;38, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics ([[Classical mechanics]]) via [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of "milieu Newtonian" physics used by [[Isaac Newton]] and the Newtonians.&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;20, pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and "natural" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and [[natural law]] (scientific [[Jurisprudence]]), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the ''[[Economist|économistes]]''&lt;ref&gt;officially known as the [[Physiocrats]], see ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;53, pp.&amp;nbsp;55-86, p.&amp;nbsp;52, note&amp;nbsp;17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Vincent de Gournay]], [[François Quesnay]], [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]], and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]])&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention of [[Vincent de Gournay]] in Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;51, note&amp;nbsp;15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;333&amp;ndash;61, pp.&amp;nbsp;348&amp;ndash;49, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who continued with the rationalization of this "naturalness". Foucault notices that this "naturalness" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement "population" and their (political population) association with raison d'état.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, p.&amp;nbsp;81, note&amp;nbsp;19, and pp.&amp;nbsp;285&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In raster scan equipment, an image is built up by scanning an electron beam from left to right across a [[cathode ray tube|screen]] to produce a visible trace of one scan line, reducing the brightness of the beam to zero (''horizontal blanking''), moving it back as fast as possible to the left of the screen at a slightly lower position (the next scan line), restoring the brightness, and continuing until all the lines have been displayed and the beam is at the bottom right of the screen. Its intensity is then reduced to zero again (vertical blanking), and it is rapidly moved to the top left to start again, creating the next Film frame.

In television, in particular, the vertical blanking interval is long to accommodate the slow equipment available at the time the standard was set. Fast modern electronics allows digital information to be encoded into the signal during the vertical blanking interval; it is not displayed on screen as the beam is blanked, but can be processed by appropriate circuitry.

Note that the intensity of this shock is greatly exaggerated.]] --&gt;

[[bow shock (aerodynamics)|Bow shocks]] form the boundary between a [[magnetosphere]] and an ambient (or at least surrounding) magnetized medium. This occurs when the magnetic field of an astrophysical object interacts with the nearby flowing ambient [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. For example, when the [[solar wind]], flowing with a relative speed of order 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, encounters the magnetic field of Earth, a bow shape boundary forms. For Earth and other magnetized planets, it is the boundary at which the speed of the stellar wind abruptly drops as a result of its approach to the [[magnetopause]]. For stars, this boundary is typically the edge of the [[astrosphere]], where the [[stellar wind]] meets the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Sparavigna|first1=A.C.|last2=Marazzato|first2=R.|title=Observing stellar bow shocks|date=10 May 2010|eprint=1005.1527|class=physics.space-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The defining criterion of a [[shock wave]] is that the bulk velocity of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] drops from "[[Supersonic speed|supersonic]]" to "subsonic", where [[plasma physics|the speed of sound]] c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by
&lt;math&gt;c_s^2 = \gamma p/ \rho &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]], &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]], and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the plasma.

A common complication in astrophysics is the presence of a magnetic field. For instance, the charged particles making up the [[solar wind]] follow spiral paths along magnetic field lines. The velocity of each particle as it gyrates around a field line can be treated similarly to a thermal velocity in an ordinary gas, and in an ordinary gas, the mean thermal velocity is roughly the speed of sound. At the bow shock, the bulk forward velocity of the wind (which is the component of the velocity parallel to the field lines about which the particles gyrate) drops below the speed at which the particles are gyrating.

==Around the Earth==

The best-studied example of a bow shock is that occurring where the Sun's wind encounters [[Earth]]'s magnetopause, although bow shocks occur around all planets, both unmagnetized, such as

==At comets==

Bow shocks form at [[Comet|comets]] as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere. Far away from the Sun, a comet is an icy boulder without an atmosphere. As it approaches the Sun, the heat of the sunlight causes gas to be released from the cometary nucleus, creating an atmosphere called a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]]. The coma is partially ionized by the sunlight, and when the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.

The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D. E.|last2=Smith|first2=E.

These observations were all made near [[Perihelion_and_aphelion|perihelion]] when the bow shocks already were fully developed.

The [[Rosetta_(spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft followed comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] from far out in the solar system, at a heliocentric distance of 3.6 [[Astronomical_unit|AU]], in toward perihelion at 1.24 AU, and back out again. This allowed Rosetta to observe the bow shock as it formed when the outgassing increased during the comet's journey toward the Sun. In this early state of development the shock was called the "infant bow shock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunell|first1=H.|last2=Goetz|first2=C.|last3=Simon Wedlund|first3=C.|last4=Lindkvist|first4=J.|last5=Hamrin|first5=M.|last6=Nilsson|first6=H.|last7=LLera|first7=K.|last8=Eriksson|first8=A.|last9=Holmström|first9=M.|title=The infant bow shock: a new frontier at a weak activity comet|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=619|pages=L2|date=2018|url=https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201834225|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201834225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant bow shock is asymmetric and, relative to the distance to the nucleus, wider than fully developed bow shocks.

==Around the Sun==
{{main article|Heliosphere#Bow shock}}

For several decades, the solar wind has been thought to form a bow shock at the edge of the [[heliosphere]], where it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium. Moving away from the Sun, the point where the solar wind flow becomes subsonic is the [[termination shock]], the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]], and the point where the flow of the interstellar medium becomes subsonic would be the bow shock. This solar bow shock was thought to lie at a distance around 230 AU&lt;ref&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020624.html&lt;/ref&gt; from the Sun – more than twice the distance of the termination shock as encountered by the Voyager spacecraft. However, data obtained in 2012 from NASA's [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX) indicates the lack of any solar bow shock.&lt;ref name=bow&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/news/nobowshock.html NASA - IBEX Reveals a Missing Boundary At the Edge Of the Solar System]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with corroborating results from the [[Voyager program|Voyager spacecraft]], these findings have motivated some theoretical refinements; current thinking is that formation of a bow shock is prevented, at least in the galactic region through which the Sun is passing, by a combination of the strength of the local interstellar magnetic-field and of the relative velocity of the heliosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McComas|first1=D. J.|last2=Alexashov|first2=D.|last3=Bzowski|first3=M.|last4=Fahr|first4=H.|last5=Heerikhuisen|first5=J.|last6=Izmodenov|first6=V.|last7=Lee|first7=M.

==Around other stars==

In 2006, a far infrared bow shock was detected near the [[asymptotic giant branch|AGB star]] [[R Hydrae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2006ApJ...648L..39U&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=45ba3a9f6d12619 Detection of a Far-Infrared Bow Shock Nebula around R Hya: The First MIRIAD Results]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Red Giant Plunging Through Space.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The bow shock around R Hydrae&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2183-sig06-029-Red-Giant-Plunging-Through-Space Spitzer Science Center Press Release: Red Giant Plunging Through Space]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bow shocks are also a common feature in [[Herbig Haro objects]], in which a much stronger [[collimated light|collimated]] outflow of gas and dust from the star interacts with the interstellar medium, producing bright bow shocks that are visible at optical wavelengths.

The following images show further evidence of bow shock existence from dense gases and plasma in the [[Orion Nebula]].

== Around massive stars ==
If a massive star is a [[Stellar kinematics#Runaway stars|runaway star]], it can form an [[infrared]] bow-shock that is detectable in 24 μm and sometimes in 8μm of the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] or the W3/W4-channels of [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]. In 2016 Kobulnicky et al. did create the largest spitzer/WISE bow-shock catalog to date with 709 bow-shock candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/ApJS/227/18/table1&amp;-out.max=50&amp;-out.form=HTML%20Table&amp;-out.add=_r&amp;-out.add=_RAJ,_DEJ&amp;-sort=_r&amp;-oc.form=sexa|title=VizieR|website=vizier.u-strasbg.fr|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get a larger bow-shock catalog the [[The Milky Way Project]] (a [[Citizen Science]] project) aims to map infrared bow-shocks in the galactic plane. This larger catalog will help to understand the stellar wind of massive stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/about/research|title=Zooniverse|website=www.zooniverse.org|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic draping effect==
A similar effect, known as the magnetic draping effect, occurs when a super-Alfvenic plasma flow impacts an unmagnetized object such as what happens when the solar wind reaches the ionosphere of Venus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyutikov|first1=M.|title=Magnetic draping of merging cores and radio bubbles in clusters of galaxies|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=2006|volume=373|pages=73–78|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10835.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0604178 |bibcode = 2006MNRAS.373...73L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the flow deflects around the object draping the [[magnetic field]] along the wake flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shore|first1=S. N.|last2=LaRosa|first2=T. N.|title=The Galactic Center Isolated Non-thermal Filaments as Analogs of Cometary Plasma Tails|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1999|volume=521|issue=2|pages=587–590|arxiv = astro-ph/9904048 |bibcode = 1999ApJ...521..587S |doi = 10.1086/307601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The condition for the flow to be super-Alfvenic means that the relative velocity between the flow and object, &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;, is larger than the local [[Alfven velocity]] &lt;math&gt;V_A&lt;/math&gt; which means a large Alfvenic Mach number: &lt;math&gt; M_A \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;. For unmagnetized and [[electrically conductive]] objects, the ambient field creates [[electric currents]] inside the object, and into the surrounding plasma, such that the flow is deflected and slowed down as the time scale of magnetic [[dissipation]] is much longer than the time scale of magnetic field [[advection]]. The induced currents in turn generate magnetic fields that deflect the flow creating a bow shock. For example, the [[ionosphere]]s of Mars and Venus provide the conductive environments for the interaction with the solar wind. Without an ionosphere, the flowing magnetized plasma is absorbed by the non-conductive body. The latter occurs, for example, when the solar wind interacts with [[Moon]] which has no ionosphere. In magnetic draping, the field lines are wrapped and draped around the leading side of the object creating a narrow sheath which is similar to the bow shocks in the planetary magnetospheres. The concentrated magnetic field increases until the [[ram pressure]] becomes comparable to the [[magnetic pressure]] in the sheath:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 v^2 = \frac{B_0^2}{2\mu_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the plasma, &lt;math&gt;B_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the draped magnetic field near the object, and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the relative speed between the plasma and the object. Magnetic draping has been detected around planets, moons, solar coronal mass ejections, and galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfrommer|first1=Christoph|last2=Dursi|first2=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">A '''Bruceton analysis''' is one way of analyzing sensitivity and sensitiveness tests of [[explosive]]s as described originally by Dixon and Mood in 1948. Also known as the "Up and Down Test" or "the staircase method", a Bruceton analysis relies upon two parameters: first stimulus and step size. A stimulus is provided to the sample, and the results noted. If a positive result is noted, then the stimulus is decremented by the step size. If a negative result occurs, the stimulus is increased. The test continues with each sample tested at a stimulus 1 step up or down from the previous stimulus if the previous result was negative or positive.

The results are tabulated and analyzed via Bruceton analysis, a simple computation of sums that can be performed by pencil and paper, to provide estimates of the mean and standard deviation. Confidence estimates are also produced.

Other analysis methods are the [[Neyer d-optimal test]] and Dror and Steinberg [2008] sequential procedure. Bruceton analysis has an advantage over the modern techniques being very simple to implement and analyze - as it was designed to be performed without a computer. The modern techniques offer a great improvement in efficiency, needing a much smaller sample size to obtain any desired significance level. Furthermore, these techniques enable the treatment of many other related experimental designs - such as when there is a need to learn the influence of more than one variable (say, testing the sensitivity of an explosive to both shock level and environment temperature), to models which are not only binary by nature (not only "detonate or not"), to experiments where you decide in advance (or "group") on more than one sample in each "run", and more. In fact, with the modern techniques the experimenter is not even constrained to specify a single model and can reflect uncertainty as to the form of the true model.

For mechanical threshold testing, typically on the mouse or rat paw, the up down method, originally proposed by Dixon, was used by SR Chaplan et al. in 1994. Their paper tabulated the coefficients required to process the data after testing. The mechanical thresholds generated have a discrete range of values (i.e. do not lie on an analog scale) and thus should be regarded as non-parametric for statistical purposes.

'''Carolingian art''' comes from the [[Frankish Empire]] in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900—during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important [[monasteries]] under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.

There was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and eventually [[Gothic art]] in the West.  The Carolingian era is part of the period in [[medieval art]] sometimes called the "[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]".  After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

==Overview==
[[File:Musée Picardie Médiéval 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Ivory plaque, probably from a book cover, [[Reims]] late 9th century, with two scenes from the life of [[Saint Remy]] and the Baptism of [[Clovis I|Clovis]]]]
Having established an Empire as large as the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the day, and rivaling in size the old [[Western Roman Empire]], the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or "sub-antique" as [[Ernst Kitzinger]] called it)&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 8&lt;/ref&gt; art still being produced in small quantities in [[Rome]] and a few other centres in Italy, which [[Charlemagne]] knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Rome in 800.

As symbolic representative of Rome he sought the ''renovatio'' (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic [[Migration period art]] could not.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] culture with his own.

But it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] controversy was dividing the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the [[Libri Carolini]] sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan [[idolatry]], Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art.

Reasonable numbers of Carolingian [[illuminated manuscript]]s and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of [[Insular art]] added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used [[interlace (visual arts)|interlacedecoration]], and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript.

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre-Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the [[Ottonian art]] of the next stable dynasty, in England with late [[Anglo-Saxon art]], after the threat from the [[Viking]]s was removed, and in Spain.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:DrogoSacramentaryFol71vAscension.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850: a [[historiated initial]] 'C' contains the [[Ascension of Christ]]. The text is in gold ink.]]
{{See also|Key works of Carolingian illumination}}
The most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are [[illuminated manuscripts]]. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly [[Gospel book]]s, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], often including [[evangelist portrait]]s, and lavish [[canon tables]], following the precedent of the [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the [[Old Testament]], especially [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; [[New Testament]] scenes are more often found on the ivory [[relief]]s on the covers.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 69. Dodwell, 49 discusses the reasons for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the [[historiated initial]] further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period—notably in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. Luxury manuscripts were given [[treasure binding]]s or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on [[purple parchment]]. The [[Bern Physiologus]] is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the [[Vatican Terence]]. The [[Utrecht Psalter]], stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript.

Other liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]], but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The [[Chronography of 354]] was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century.

===Centres of illumination===
Carolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a [[Rheims]]ian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there.

[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Mark]] from the [[Ebbo Gospels]]]]

The Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the '''Ada School''') produced the earliest manuscripts, including the [[Godescalc Evangelistary]] (781–783); the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch|Lorsch Gospels]] (778–820); the [[Ada Gospels]]; the [[Soissons Gospels]]; the [[Harley Golden Gospels]] (800-820);  and the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]]; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from [[Ravenna]], Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained [[Migration Period art]] (Merovingian and [[Insular art|Insular]]) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships.

In the early 9th-century Archbishop [[Ebo of Rheims]], at [[Hautvillers]] (near [[Rheims]]), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The [[Gospel book of Ebbo]] (816–835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the ''[[Bern Physiologus]]'', the earliest Latin edition of the Christian [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period.

Another style developed at the monastery of [[St Martin of Tours]], in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for [[Charles the Bald]], called the [[Vivian Bible]]. The [[Tours]] School was cut short by the invasion of the [[Normans]] in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire.

[[File:Utrecht 15v 2.jpg|right|thumb|From the [[Utrecht Psalter]], 9th-century Naturalistic and energetic figurine line drawings were entirely new, and were to become the most influential innovation of Carolinian art in later periods.]]

The [[diocese of Metz]] was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a [[sacramentary]] was made for Bishop [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] called the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. The illuminated "historiated" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes.

In the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a [[Franco-Saxon]] style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century.

Charles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]] (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts.

With the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The [[Abbey of St. Gall]] created the [[Folchard Psalter]] (872) and the [[Golden Psalter]] (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions.

==Sculpture and metalwork==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|Gem-encrusted cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], 870]]

Luxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have [[treasure binding]]s—ornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels—sometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from [[consular diptych]]s and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the [[Lorsch Gospels]], which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin.

Important Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]]; the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles the Bald|Charles II (the Bald)]], and often called his "Palace School". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] outside Paris is one leading possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 60–68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arnulf Ciborium]] (a miniature [[ciborium (architecture)|architectural ciborium]] rather than the [[Ciborium (container)|vessel for hosts]]), now in the [[Munich Residenz]], is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in [[repoussé]] gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] dish in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64-65, 66-67; [[:File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|picture of the dish]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.

Charlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at [[Aachen]] which cast the doors for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]], in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically [[gilding|gilded]], as with the Ottonian [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].

One of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824–859), a ''[[paliotto]]'', in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver [[repoussé]], framed by borders of [[filigree]], precious stones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].

The [[Lothair Crystal]], of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of [[rock crystal]] which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Suzanna]].

==Mosaics and frescos==
[[File:Germigny Des Pres 2007 01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], [[Germigny-des-Prés]], c. 806, but restored. The subject seems drawn from illuminated Jewish bibles, and relates to the [[Libri Carolini]], possibly written by Theodulf, where the Ark is cited as divine approval of sacred images.]]
Sources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of [[Titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] show that their subject matter was primarily religious.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mosaic]]s installed in [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's palatine chapel]] showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the [[Evangelist's symbol]]s and the twenty-four elders from the [[Apocalypse]]. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the [[apse]] of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] at [[Germigny-des-Prés]] (806) which shows the [[Ark of the Covenant]] adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster.

The villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]]. It was destroyed later in the century, but had [[fresco]]s of the [[Seven liberal arts]], the [[season|Four Seasons]], and the [[Mappa Mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 13–17&lt;/ref&gt; We know from written sources of other [[fresco]]s in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the [[Liberal Arts]], as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of [[Louis the Pious]] at [[Ingelheim]] contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained [[Typology (theology)|typological]] scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another.

Fragmentary paintings have survived at [[Auxerre]], [[Coblenz]], [[Lorsch]], [[Cologne]], [[Fulda]], [[Corvey]], [[Trier]], [[Müstair]], [[Mals]], [[Naturns]], [[Cividale]], [[Brescia]] and [[Milan]].

==Spolia==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. Charlemagne's Court School.]]
[[File:Lothair Crystal AD 855-869 (Carolingian Empire).jpg|thumb|The [[Lothair Crystal]], mid-9th century]]
''[[Spolia]]'' is the Latin term for "spoils" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period.

Perhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Lateran Palace]]. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] and thus held great accord—Charlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from [[Ravenna]], then believed to be that of [[Theodoric the Great]], to Aachen, to match the statue of "Constantine" in Rome.

Antique [[carved gems]] were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original [[iconography]].

'''The North Temperate Regional Station (NTRS)''': NTRS was established in 1963 at Garsa, [[Kullu]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] and is engaged ion research work on high quality germplasm of Gaddi Synthetic for improvement of sheep for fine wool production.

'''The Southern Regional Research Centre (SRRC)''': [[Sheep Research Center (Mannavanur)|SRRC]] was established in 1965 and is located at [[Mannavanur]], app 35&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kodaikanal]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is engaged in the research on fine [[wool]] sheep and broiler rabbits.

'''Arid Region Campus (ARC)''': ARC was established in 1974 at Bikaner in [[Rajasthan]] with a land area of 636 hectares and has rearing facilities for [[Magra]] and [[Marwari sheep|Marwari]] sheep.

== Mandate ==
The mandate of the Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute is to engage in basic and applied research on sheep and rabbit production, health, utilization, training and transfer of technologies to the beneficiaries.

The Institute has a set of objectives:
* To undertake basic and applied research on all aspects of [[sheep]] and [[rabbit]] production.
* To develop, update and standardize meat, fibre and pelt technologies.
* To impart trainings on sheep and rabbit production and utilization.
* To transfer improved technologies on sheep and rabbit production to farmers, rural artisans and development workers.
* To provide referral and consultancy services on production and products technology of sheep and rabbits.

==Infrastructure==
The Institute is equipped with research laboratories attending to Animal Genetics, Physiology, Reproduction, [[Biochemistry]], Animal Health, Animal Nutrition and Animal climatic chamber. It has a farm area measuring 1591 hectares, [[cenchrus]] pasture land of 175 hectares and forest and ravine land extending to 522 hectares. The other infrastructural facilities include administrative building, library building, residential complex, guest house, auditorium, conference hall, committee room, Human dispensary and Kendriya Vidyalaya project school. An '''Agriculture Knowledge Management Unit''' (AKMU) operates at the Institute.

The Institute rears about 3500 [[sheep]] of different breeds, 600 [[goat]] of Sirohi breeds and 600 [[rabbit]] breeds.

Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding was started in 1966 under the name ''Sheep Genetic Section'' with a mandate to conduct research on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding  Division carried out pioneer work in the field of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, apparel wool and pelt.  Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and mothering ability. Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress.  Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated.   Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya,  Dr. R Nagercenkar,  Dr. A L  Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh,  Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra,  Dr. B U Khan,  Dr. V K Singh  and  Dr. A L Arora  had  shaped the development  and progress of this division. At present Dr. Arun Kumar is head of the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cswri.res.in/divisions_animal_genetics_breeding.asp | title=Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding | publisher=ICAR - Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute | accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Animal Nutrition===
The division had its origin in 1965 under the name, the Sheep Nutrition Section and was upgraded to cover all aspects of animal nutrition including grass land and [[forage]] [[agronomy]]. The division is mandated to:
* Evaluate various types of feed resources- pasture (grasses, [[legumes]]), top feed resources, agro-industrial by-products and non-conventional feeds. 
* Determine nutritional requirements for various production functions in sheep and rabbits. 
* Develop feeding strategies for sheep, goat and rabbit production.
* Identify and reduce the adverse effect of various anti-nutritional factors in the feed.
* Improve low grade roughages.

===Division of Animal Health===
The Division of Animal Health was originally with Sheep Husbandry section but was upgraded as an independent division in 1987. The initial mandate of the division was to cover the health related aspects of the flocks under the institute. Later, the division was expanded by obtaining diagnostic laboratories and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8930.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Physiology and Biochemistry===
CSWRI started a Physiology section 1965 for research on [[ovine]] physiology and reproduction with special emphasis on environmental physiology and applied reproduction. In 2003, the section was merged with Biochemistry section and the division was formed. Major projects of the division centers around [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] semen preservation, artificial insemination and adjudging the physiological adaptability of different strains developed at the institute.

===Division of Textile Manufacture and Textile Chemistry===

===PC Cell, [[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (ICAR-NWPSI)===

[[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (NWPSI) was initiated on to undertake survey, evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under native environment. Different breeds of sheep are being improved through selection and inter-se mating for wool and mutton production. The mandate of NWPSI is genetic evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep by selection. Presently, there are six ongoing centres of NWPSI including four farm based units and two field based units located at difference parts of the country.
Coordination Cell:  Project Coordinator Cell, NWPSI, ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar

Cooperating Units:

A.  Farm based Cooperating units

1.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner - Marwari sheep for Carpet Wool

2.CIRG, Makhdoom - Muzaffarnagri sheep for Dual purpose

3.MPKV, Rahuri - Deccani sheep for Dual purpose

4.SVVU, Palamner - Nellore sheep for Mutton

B.  Field based Cooperating units

1.TANUVAS, Kattupakkam - Madras Red sheep for Mutton

2.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner- Magra Sheep for Carpet wool

The objectives of NWPSI is Genetic improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by selection. The technical programme aims at improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under farm conditions wherein the male lambs are first ranked using selection index. Index incorporates body weight and wool yield at six months of age. Each field-based unit has four centres including a ram-rearing centre, covering a sheep population of about 1500 sheep per centre. The superior male lambs are selected from the farmers’ flocks on the basis of GFY1 and 6-month body weigh in Magra sheep and on six-month body weight basis in Madras Red sheep. Male lambs are initially identified at 3 month of age and are finally selected after first shearing. Selected male lambs from improver flocks are supplied for breeding to base flocks.

Breeding rams of high breeding value are produced from farm based unit every year for germplasm distribution. During the XI plan period about 900 improved breeding rams/ram lambs from five Farm Based Units were sold to different farmers/ State Govt/ NGOs for breed improvement programme and about 700 breeding rams / ram lambs were distributed in three Field Based Units for improvement of farmers flock. The Sheep Improvement Programmes will continue and efforts will be made to bring overall improvement in sheep productivity through distribution of superior germplasm and adoption of improved scientific management practices.

In chemical genetics, the phenotype is disturbed not by introduction of mutations, but by exposure to small molecule tool compounds. [[Phenotypic screening]] of chemical libraries is used to identify drug targets ([[forward genetics]]) or to validate those targets in experimental models of disease ([[reverse genetics]]).&lt;ref name="isbn3-527-30987-X"&gt;{{cite book | editors = Folkers G, Kubinyi H, Müller G, Mannhold R | title = Chemogenomics in drug discovery: a medicinal chemistry perspective | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2004 | pages = 69–96 | isbn = 3-527-30987-X | chapter = The value of chemical genetics in drug discovery | authors = Russel K, Michne WF  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent applications of this topic have been implicated in signal transduction, which may play a role in discovering new cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlson SM, White FM | title = Expanding applications of chemical genetics in signal transduction | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 1903–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22544320 | doi = 10.4161/cc.19956 | pmc=3359120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical genetics can serve as a unifying study between chemistry and biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connor CJ, Laraia L, Spring DR | title = Chemical genetics | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 4332–45 | date = Aug 2011 | pmid = 21562678 | doi = 10.1039/C1CS15053G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Conquering Infinity with Chemical Genetics | first = Malorye | last = Branca | name-list-format = vanc | date = Feb 2003 | url = http://www.bio-itworld.com/archive/021003/infinity.htmln | work = Bio IT World }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Chemical genetic screens are performed using libraries of [[small molecule]]s that have known activities or simply diverse chemical structures. These screens can be done in a [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] mode, using 96 well-plates, where each well contains cells treated with a unique compound.  In addition to cells, ''[[Xenopus]]'' or [[zebrafish]] embryos can also be screened in 96 well format where compounds are dissolved in the media in which embryos grow. Embryos are let developed until the stage of interest and then the phenotype can be analyzed. Several concentrations can be tested in order to determine the toxic and the optimal concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomlinson ML, Rejzek M, Fidock M, Field RA, Wheeler GN | title = Chemical genomics identifies compounds affecting Xenopus laevis pigment cell development | language = en | journal = Molecular bioSystems | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 376–84 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 19396374 | doi = 10.1039/B818695B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kälin RE, Bänziger-Tobler NE, Detmar M, Brändli AW | title = An in vivo chemical library screen in Xenopus tadpoles reveals novel pathways involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis | journal = Blood | volume = 114 | issue = 5 | pages = 1110–22 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19478043 | pmc = 2721788 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2009-03-211771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Adding compounds to developing embryos allow comprehension of mechanism of action of drugs, their toxicity and developmental processes involving their targets. Chemical screens have been mostly performed on either wild type or transgenic ''[[Xenopus]]'' and [[zebrafish]] organisms as they produce a large amount of synchronized, fast-to-develop and transparent eggs easy to visually score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor KL, Grant NJ, Temperley ND, Patton EE | title = Small molecule screening in zebrafish: an in vivo approach to identifying new chemical tools and drug leads | journal = Cell Communication and Signaling | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 11 | date = 2010-06-12 | pmid = 20540792 | doi = 10.1186/1478-811x-8-11 | pmc=2912314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ny A, Autiero M, Carmeliet P | title = Zebrafish and Xenopus tadpoles: small animal models to study angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 312 | issue = 5 | pages = 684–93 | date = Mar 2006 | pmid = 16309670 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.018 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482705004854 | series = Special Issue on Angiogenesis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of chemicals in developmental biology offers two main advantages. Firstly, it is easy to perform high-throughput screen using wide spectrum or specific target compounds and reveal important genes or pathways involved in developmental processes. Secondly, it allows narrowing the time of action of a particular gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomlinson ML, Guan P, Morris RJ, Fidock MD, Rejzek M, Garcia-Morales C, Field RA, Wheeler GN | title = A chemical genomic approach identifies matrix metalloproteinases as playing an essential and specific role in Xenopus melanophore migration | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–104 | date = Jan 2009 | pmid = 19171309 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a tool in drug development to test toxicity in whole organism. Procedures such as FETAX  (Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay – Xenopus) are being developed to implement chemical screenings to test toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu L, Zhu J, Rotchell JM, Wu L, Gao J, Shi H | title = Use of the enhanced frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) to determine chemically-induced phenotypic effects | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 508 | pages = 258–65 | date = Mar 2015 | pmid = 25481254 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zebrafish and ''Xenopus'' embryos have also been used to identify new drugs targeting a particular gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molina G, Vogt A, Bakan A, Dai W, Queiroz de Oliveira P, Znosko W, Smithgall TE, Bahar I, Lazo JS, Day BW, Tsang M | title = Zebrafish chemical screening reveals an inhibitor of Dusp6 that expands cardiac cell lineages | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 680–7 | date = Sep 2009 | pmid = 19578332 | pmc = 2771339 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''chronology of the ancient Near East''' provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events in terms of a succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like "in the year X of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a [[relative dating|relative chronology]] is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative [[chronology]] can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan III]] refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BC. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure [[Absolute dating|absolute chronology]] established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.

For the third and second millennia, the correlation is not so fixed. A key document is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], preserving record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] tablets during the reign of the  Babylonian king [[Ammisaduqa]], known to be the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]] in the ''relative calendar''. In the series, the conjunction of the rise of Venus with the new moon provides a fixed point, or rather three fixed points, for the conjunction is a [[Periodic function|periodic]] occurrence. Astronomical calculation can therefore fix, for example, the first dates of the reign of Hammurabi in this manner either as 1848, 1792, or 1736 BC, depending on whether the "high" (or "long"), "[[Middle chronology|middle]]" or "low (or short) chronology" is followed.

For the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] millennia BC, the following periods can be distinguished:
#[[Early Bronze Age]]: A series of rulers and dynasties whose existence is based mostly on the [[Sumerian King List]] besides some that are attested [[Epigraphy|epigraphically]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g., [[En-me-barage-si]]). No absolute dates within a certainty better than a century can be assigned to this period.
#[[Middle Bronze Age|Middle]] to [[Late Bronze Age]]: Beginning with the [[Akkadian Empire]] around 2300 BC, the chronological evidence becomes internally more consistent. Essentially, for this period, a good picture can be drawn of who succeeded whom, and synchronisms between [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and the more robust [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]] can be established. The assignment of absolute dates is a matter of dispute; the conventional ''middle chronology'' fixes the [[sack of Babylon]] at 1595 BC while the ''short chronology'' fixes it at 1531 BC.
#The [[Bronze Age collapse]]: a "Dark Age" begins with the fall of Babylonian Dynasty III (Kassite) around 1200 BC, the invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the collapse of  the [[Hittite Empire]].
#[[Early Iron Age]]: around 900 BC, historical data, written records become more numerous once more, with the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], enabling the certain assignment of absolute dates. Classical sources such as the [[Canon of Ptolemy]], the works of [[Berossus]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]] provide chronological support and synchronisms. An eclipse in 763 BC anchors the [[Assyria]]n list of imperial officials.

==Variant Bronze Age chronologies==
[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|Middle chronology of the main dominations]]
Due to the sparsity of sources throughout the "Dark Age", the history of the Near Eastern [[Bronze Age]]  down to the end of the [[Third Babylonian Dynasty]] is a "floating chronology". In other words, it fits together internally as a "relative chronology" but not as an "absolute chronology".

The major schools of thought on the length of the Dark Age are separated by 56 or 64 years. This is because the key source for their dates is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and the visibility of Venus has a 56/64{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} year cycle. More recent work by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] has suggested that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric.&lt;ref name="ultra"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311035] Gurzadyan, V. G., ''On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology'', Akkadica, v 119–120 (2000), pp. 175–184.)&lt;/ref&gt; (see update in &lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, in Akkadica, v 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ultra2"&gt;Warburton, D.A., A Rejoinder in favour of an Ultra-Low Chronology, Akkadica, v 134, 17 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;) There are also some scholars who discount the validity of the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa entirely. There have been other attempts to anchor the chronology using records of eclipses and other methods, but they are not yet widely supported. The alternative major chronologies are defined by the date of the 8th year of the reign of [[Ammisaduqa]], king of Babylon. This choice then defines the reign of [[Hammurabi]].

The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature, and many current textbooks on the archaeology and history of the ancient Near East continue using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=A.|title=Ancient Near East c. 3000–330 BC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge|page=12|location=London|isbn=0-415-16763-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=D.

As is mentioned below, at present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East and a floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages. Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness of dendrochronology for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220–718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al.

The following table gives an overview of the competing proposals, listing some key dates and the deviation relative to the short chronology:

The chronologies of Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia depend significantly on the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. To the extent that there are problems  in the Egyptian chronology, these issues will be inherited in chronologies based on synchronisms with Ancient Egypt.

==Sources of chronological data==

===Inscriptional===
Thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in an area running from Anatolia to Egypt. While many are the ancient equivalent of modern grocery receipts, these tablets, along with inscriptions on buildings and public monuments, provide the major source of chronological information for the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History, Marc van de Mieroop, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-19532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying issues====
*State of materials
While there are some relatively pristine objects, such as you might see in the Louvre or the British Museum, the vast majority of recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2003/cdlj2003_001.html] Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenance
The site of an item's recovery is an important piece of information for archaeologists. Unfortunately, two factors impinge on this.  First, in ancient times old materials were often reused either as building material or fill, sometimes at a great distance from the original location. Secondly, looting has been a fact of life for archaeological sites, dating at least back to Roman times. The provenance of a looted object is difficult or impossible to determine.
*Multiple versions
Over time, key documents like the [[Sumerian King List]] were repeatedly copied across the generations. As a result, there are sometimes multiple versions of a chronological source that differ from each other. It can be very hard to determine which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm] Translation of Sumerian King List&lt;/ref&gt;
*Translation
The translation of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, especially given the damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, our knowledge of the underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.
*Slant
Many of our important source documents, such as the Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant in favor of the king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.

====King Lists====
Keeping historical lists of rulers was traditional in the ancient Near East.

*[[Sumerian King List]]
Covers rulers of Mesopotamia from a time "before the flood" up to the fall of the Isin Dynasty. For many early city-states it is the only source of chronological data. A major problem is that many early rulers are listed with fantastically long reigns. There has been some speculation that this stems from an error transcribing from the base 60 arithmetic of the Sumerians to the decimal-based system of the later Akkadians.&lt;ref&gt;"A Mathematical Approach to Certain Dynastic Spans in the Sumerian King List," Dwight W. Young, ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 123–129&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Babylonian King List]]
This list deals only with the rulers of Babylon. It has been found in two versions, Babylonian King List A and Babylonian King List B. The later dynasties in the list reflect the Kassite and Sealand periods of Babylon. There is also a Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period which covers the later part of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/babylonian_hellenistic.html] Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Assyrian King List]]
Found in multiple differing copies, this tablet lists all the kings of Assyria and their regnal lengths back into the mists of time, with the portions with reasonable data beginning at around the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/assyrian.html] Assyrian King List at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the various Assyrian chronicles, the Assyrian King List anchors the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*[[Waddell's chronology|Indus Valley King List]]
A list of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] kings was compiled by [[Laurence Waddell]], but it is not generally accepted or well regarded by mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="Macnaughton1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Macnaughton|title=A scheme of Egyptian chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLYrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1932|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronicles====
Many chronicles have been recovered in the ancient Near East. Most are partial or fragmentary, but when combined with other sources, they provide a rich source of chronological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html |work=Livius |title=Mesopotamian Chronicles |date=21 May 2017|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Synchronistic Chronicle
Found in the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh, it records the interaction of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, from the Assyrian point of view. While useful, the consensus is that this chronicle should not be considered reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc21/synchronistic1.html] Synchronistic Chronicle at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chronicle P]]
While quite incomplete, this tablet provides the same type of information as the Assyrian Synchronistic Chronicle, but from the Babylonian point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc22/p.html] Chronicle P at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Royal Chronicle of Lagash
The Sumerian King List omits any mention of [[Lagash]], even though it was clearly a major power during the period covered by the list. The Royal Chronicle of Lagash appears to be an attempt to remedy that omission, listing the kings of Lagash in the form of a chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/cm/lagash.html] Royal Chronicle of Lagash at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe the chronicle to be either a parody of the Sumerian King List or a complete fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamian Chronicles,Jean-Jacques Glassner,(2004) {{ISBN|1-58983-090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal inscriptions====

In general, political figures in the ancient Near East liked to take credit for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely to have some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.

====Year lists====

Unlike current calendars, most ancient calendars were based on how long the current ruler had been in power. A year might be "the 5th year in the reign of Hammurabi". As part of this, each royal year was given a title, like "the year Ur was defeated". Most often this reflected a deed of the ruler. The compilation of these years are called date lists.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/yn_index.html] Mesopotamian Year Names&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eponym (limmu) lists====

In Assyria, a royal official or [[limmu]] was selected every year of a king's reign. Many copies of these lists have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/li-ln/limmu/limmu_2.html] Assyrian Eponym List 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire 910–612 B.C., by Alan Millard. State Archives of Assyria Studies 11, Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1994. xvi + 153 pp., 20 plates&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, details are not always clear-cut. There are sometimes too many or few ''limmū'' for the length of a king's reign and sometimes the different versions of the eponym list disagree on a limmu. An example is the [[Mari Eponym Chronicle]]. There is now a Assyrian Revised Eponym List which attempts to resolve some of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gojko Barjamovic, Thomas Hertel and Mogens T. Larsen, Ups and Downs at Kanesh: Chronology, History and Society in the Old Assyrian Period (Leiden: Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade, diplomatic, and disbursement records====

As is often the case in archaeology, it is everyday records that give the best picture of a civilization. Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the way that we would discard unwanted receipts. Fortunately for us, tablets are durable and many are well-preserved even when used as material for wall filler in new construction.

*[[Amarna letters]]

The classic example. A number of cuneiform tablets were found at Amarna in Egypt, the city of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]. They were written mostly in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. Several named rulers in the region including the kings of Assyria and Babylon. Assuming that the correct kings have been identified, it locks the chronology of the ancient Near East to that of Egypt, at least from the middle of the 2nd millennium.

===Classical===
Some data sources are available to us from the classical period:
*[[Berossus]]
Berossus was a Babylonian astronomer living during the Hellenistic period. He wrote a history of Babylon which has not survived to modern times. Luckily, portions of this work were preserved by other classical writers.
*Canon of Ptolemy or [[Canon of Kings]]
This book provides a list of kings starting at around 750 BC in Babylon and forward through the Persian and Roman periods, in an astronomical context. It is used to help define the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*Hebrew Bible
Not having the benefit of being written into clay and buried, the records of the Hebrews have an additional layer of time to work through in being used as a source for chronology. On the other hand, the Hebrews did live pretty much in a territory directly in the crosshairs of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt and the Hittites, giving them a front row seat to actions in the area. Mainly of use in the 1st millennium and with the Assyrian New Kingdom.

===Astronomical===
*[[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]]

A record of the movements of Venus during the reign of a king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Using it, various scholars have proposed dates for the fall of Babylon based on the 56/64 year cycle of Venus.  The mentioned recent work suggesting that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric, led to the proposal of an "ultra-low" chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Gurzadyan, V. G., The Venus Tablet and Refraction, ''Akkadica'', v. 124 (2003), pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipses====

A number of lunar and solar eclipses have been suggested for use in dating the ancient Near East. Many suffer from the vagueness of the original tablets in showing that an actual eclipse occurred. At that point, it becomes a question of using computer models to show when a given eclipse would have been visible at a site, complicated by difficulties in modeling the slowing rotation of the earth, [[Delta T]]. One important event is the [[Assyrian eclipse|Nineveh eclipse]], found in an Assyrian limmu list q.e. "Bur-Sagale of Guzana, revolt in the city of Ashur. In the month Simanu an eclipse of the sun took place." This eclipse is considered to be solidly dated to 15 June 763 BC. Another important event is the [[Ur III]] Lunar/Solar Eclipse pair in the reign of [[Shulgi]]. Most calculations for dating using eclipses have assumed that the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa is a legitimate source.&lt;ref name="ultra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wayne A., "Ancient Astronomical Observations and Near Eastern Chronology", ''JACF'', v.3 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dendrochronology===

[[Dendrochronology]] attempts to use the variable growth pattern of trees, expressed in their rings, to build up a chronological timeline. At present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East. A floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages.  Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220–718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al.

Kuniholm, Maryanne W. Newton, Carol B. Griggs, &amp; Pamela J. Sullivan, Der Anschnitt, Anatolian Metal III, Beiheft 18, 2005, pp. 41–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://dendro.cornell.edu/projects/aegean.php|title=Aegean Dendrochronology Project |series=Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in tying the chronology to the modern day lies primarily in the Roman period, for which few good wood samples have been found, and many of those turn out to be imported from outside the Near East.&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"/&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===

As in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, radiocarbon dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It is not at all clear which group is right, if either.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Developments in Near Eastern Chronology and Radiocarbon Dating, Michael G. Hasel, Institute of Archaeology, Southern Adventist University, Origins Vol 56 2004, pp. 6–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures.&lt;ref&gt;New Uses for Old Laboratory techniques, Jason A. Rech, Near Eastern Archaeology, Dec. 2004; 67,4. pp. 212–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of [[Ebla]] have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BC), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BC), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiae, P. (2007). The Destruction of Old Syrian Ebla. In Matthiae, P., Pinnock, F., Nigro, L. and Peyronel, L. (eds.)

===Synchronisms===

====Egypt====
At least as far back as the reign of [[Thutmose I]], Egypt took a strong interest in the ancient Near East. At times they occupied portions of the region, a favor returned in later days by the Assyrians. Some key synchronisms:
*[[Battle of Kadesh]], involving [[Ramses II]] of Egypt (in his 5th year of reign) and [[Muwatalli II]] of the Hittite empire. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text%3Dhistory%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014163832/http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text=history%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Battle of Kadesh – Hittite Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;
*Peace treaty between Ramses II of Egypt (in his 21st year of reign) and [[Hattusili III]] of the Hittites. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramses-hattusili-treaty.htm] Treaty between Egypt and the Hittite Empire&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Amenhotep III]] (Amenophis III) marries the daughter of [[Shuttarna II]] of [[Mitanni]]. There is also a record of messages from the pharaoh to [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon in the Amarna Letter (EA1–5). Other Amarna letters link Amenhotep III to [[Burnaburiash II]] of Babylon (EA6) and [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni (EA17–29) as well.
*[[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) married the daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni (as did his father Amenhotep III), leaving a number of records on the matter. He also corresponded with [[Burna-Buriash II]] of Babylon (EA7–11, 15), and [[Ashuruballit I]] of Assyria (EA15–16)

There are problems with using Egyptian chronology. Besides some minor issues of regnal lengths and overlaps there are three long periods of poorly documented chaos in the history of ancient Egypt, the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]], and the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], whose lengths are not well understood. This means the Egyptian Chronology is actually made up of three floating chronologies.

====Indus Valley====

There is much evidence that the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the [[Indus Valley]] traded with the region. This is demonstrated by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, C. J. “Seals of Ancient Indian Style Found at Ur.” Proceedings of the British Academy 18 (1932): 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Seals and beads were also found at the site of [[Esnunna]]. &lt;ref&gt;Henri Frankfort, The Indus civilization and the Near East. Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology for 1932, Leyden, VI, pp. 1-12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the land of [[Meluhha]] does indeed refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.

====Thera and Eastern Mediterranean====

Goods from Greece made their way into the ancient Near East, directly in Anatolia and via the island of [[Cyprus]] in the rest of the region and Egypt. A Hittite king, Tudhaliya IV, even captured Cyprus as part of an attempt to enforce a blockade of the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanism on Late Bronze Age Cyprus: LC II in Retrospect, Ora Negbi, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, Feb 2005, Iss. 337; pp. 1–45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minoan eruption|eruption of the Thera volcano]] provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, it would have sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption has been the subject of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BC. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627&amp;nbsp;BC and 1600&amp;nbsp;BC with a 95% degree of probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Friedrich|first=Walter L|authorlink=|author2=Kromer, B |author3=Friedrich, M |author4=Heinemeier, J |author5=Pfeiffer, T |author6=Talamo, S |title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627–1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|id=|accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645088 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=Sturt W |author2=Ramsey, CB |author3=Kutschera, W |author4=Higham, T |author5=Kromer, B |author6=Steier, P |author7=Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700–1400 B.C. |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5773 |pages=565–569 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565 |doi=10.1126/science.1125682 |accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645092 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..565M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = SW | last = Manning | contribution=Clarifying the "high" v.

The City of [[Oakland, California]], adopted a [[Zero waste|Zero Waste Strategic Plan]] in 2006, detailing a road map for the City to follow toward the implementation of a Zero Waste System by 2020.  As stated in a City Resolution, introduced by then Mayor [[Jerry Brown]], Zero Waste principles:

:"[P] romote the highest and best use of materials to eliminate [[waste]] and [[pollution]], emphasizing a closed-loop system of production and consumption, moving in logical increments toward the goal of zero waste through the core principles of":
:# Improving [[reuse]]/[[recycling]] of [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life products]] and materials to ensure their highest and best use;
:# Pursuing design strategies to minimize product hazards and lifestyles that limit consumption; and
:# Using [[waste disposal]] operations to improve the [[economy]] and develop the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133100/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste systems can be traced back to chemist Paul Palmer who developed and coined the concept in the 1970s (in Oakland, CA) in order to find a way to reuse the vast amount of [[chemical]]s produced by the [[electronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=P|title=History of zero waste institute.|url=http://zerowasteinstitute.org/?page_id=202|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, cities like Oakland are adopting Zero Waste Systems to create a process that redirects all end-of-life products toward future applications in the marketplace, rather than to a [[landfill]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zero Waste Alliance|title=What is Waste?|url=http://www.zerowaste.org/case.htm#what_is|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan==

The city of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan set out in 2006 to reduce the annual tons of waste directed toward landfills from 400,000 tons to 40,000 annually by 2020. Chiefly, the city aimed to create comprehensive systems that transfer end-of-life products back into the economy. The City's Strategic Plan is based on five strategies that include recycling but also [[Product design|product]] and [[system design]] changes and policy revisions, as follows:
# Expand and Improve Local and Regional Recycling and Composting
#* Greater engagement with the general public and particularly the business community is necessary, requiring the development of additional recovery services and initiatives, for example, to support businesses that utilize the [[Port of Oakland]] and produce [[construction]] and [[demolition]] materials.
# Develop and Adopt New Rules and Incentives to Reduce Waste Disposal
#* Create stronger [[incentive]]s to “reward reuse, repair, and reduced consumption” to replace the present incentive to use landfills.
# Preserve Land for Sustainable Development and Green Industry Infrastructure
#* Expand industrial land for businesses that manufacture and make use of materials traditionally discarded. Create partnerships with StopWaste.Org, and East Bay Economic Alliance toward the development of policies that attract such businesses.
# Advocate for Manufacturer Responsibility for Product Waste, Ban Problem Materials
#* Adopt [[California]]’s [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] (EPR) created to require businesses to assume the responsibility for any environmental impacts resulting from their products (throughout the product’s life cycle).
# Educate, Promote and Advocate a Zero Waste Sustainability Agenda
#* Since only 15% of Oakland homes [[compost]], and 67% of waste continues to be produced by industries, stronger, though positive, messaging about Zero Waste and [[sustainability]] should be circulated and tailored for different audiences, situations and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/policy/oak025986.pdf|accessdate=March 6, 2011}} pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abiding by the system advocated by Zero Waste International Alliance, Oakland’s Zero Waste System follows “natural cycles, where all outputs are simply an input for another process.”  Moreover, Zero Waste systems place the “highest priority on conserving resources and retaining their form and function without burning, burying, or otherwise destroying their form and function. “  This calls for “eliminating discharges to land, water or air that harm natural systems,” as well as, “preventing rather than managing, waste and pollution, and recommitting to the priority ordering of the [[waste reduction]] hierarchy: first reduce consumption; next, reuse what is left; and finally, recycle anything that is no longer usable and landfill any residual.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's Zero Waste System also examines each management of goods in accordance with specific criteria, such as:
* “Customer Benefits,” such as opportunities for residents and businesses to reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es and access to recycling services.
* “Economic Development,” such as the creation of jobs and the development of a range of employment opportunities within organizations that process, manufacture or sell “discards-based” businesses.
* “Financial,” such as cost to city and ratepayers, as well as pricing that incentivizes waste reduction and promotes recycling.
* “Innovation,” such as methods that allow for system upgrades and evolution over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution adopting evaluative criteria for assessing [[solid waste management]] system designs responsive to the zero waste by 2020 goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In 2006, Oakland residents surpassed the state mandate of diverting 50% landfill waste from 580,000 to 400,000 tons, yet progress toward greater waste reduction was slowing down.  Meanwhile, consumption of materials and products continued to grow. Widespread evidence indicated that every stage of production, transportation, use and disposal of materials and products negatively impacted [[ecosystem]]s, the [[climate]], [[public health]] and [[biodiversity]]. The quantity of toxic materials in the disposal process was increasing and Oakland was struggling to maintain cost effective [[waste management]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's system of waste reduction in 2006 allowed businesses to determine how their products would be designed and packaged, without regulation. This practice left the [[consumer]]s and [[local government]]s to bear the burden of disposing of material goods. Zero Waste Systems, on the other hand, call for businesses to develop not only recyclable [[packaging]] and product designs, but designs that could have endless new uses and applications. The Zero Waste System, therefore, offered Oakland an ambitious strategy to address waste and inefficiencies endemic to the City's structure, economy and practices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Causes/sources of excess waste ==
We commonly think of waste as garbage, or refuse; anything that becomes useless or a byproduct. In other words, waste has countless physical sources. Zero Waste Alliance  (2011) describes waste in this way:

:"In our industrial society waste results from the inefficient use of any resource and includes activities and products that generate by-products with no clear use, no [[market value]], or hazardous properties and by-products that decrease their potential value.  Waste takes many different forms: from solid and hazardous waste to wastes in energy and material use; wastes in manufacturing and administrative activities and wastes of [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"/&gt;

When Oakland adopted its Zero Waste Strategic Plan in 2006, the actual 400,000 tons of waste consisted of the following:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Yard Trimmings || 9%
|-
|Food Waste || 12%
|-
|Clean Wood &amp; Other Organics || 9%
|-
|Metals || 6%
|-
|Glass || 1%
|-
|Plastic || 5%
|-
|Paper || 19%
|-
|Concrete, Asphalt, Roofing || 6%
|-
|Non-recyclables || 33%
|-
| || 100%
|}	

Oakland categorized the source of waste by the individual or group that submitted the waste to the City for disposal in landfills, (1) Non-residential or commercial sources and (2) Residential, including single family or multi-family sources.  At the time, 67% of waste was generated by non-residential sources, and residents produced 33%. Of this non-residential group, 30% was being hauled to landfills by entities over which the City had minimal control (those that haul their own garbage to the landfill), such as [[Cal Trans]], [[AC Transit]], [[BART]] and independent contractors. Of the 400,000 tons of material transferred to landfills, 67% could be recycled using city operations already established. Regional recovery and diversion options existed in 2006 for paper, glass, metals, plastics, yard trimmings, food, clean wood, [[concrete]], [[asphalt]], and [[Roofing material|roofing]]. The City recognized that it could minimize the transfer of these materials with additional focus on improving separation of materials, messaging to businesses regarding diversion and recycling options and stronger incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and historical underpinnings==

The need for [[incentive]]s touches upon the social and historical forces that have led to excessive waste production.  As scholars, historians, environmentalists, and even politicians have increasingly asserted, the American [[economic system]] has long prioritized [[economic growth]] over preserving the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gore|first=A.|title=Earth in the balance: Ecology and the human spirit|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|location=New York|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has often put nature at the bottom of our hierarchy of importance. As Porritt contends in Capitalism as if the World Matters, corporations focused on growth have not been held accountable for damages they cause to the environment; which has created very little incentive for industries to concern themselves with sustainability or [[environmental protection]]. With profit and growth as the ultimate goal, businesses have sought out the cheapest resources and environments lacking regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=J.|title=Capitalism as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately environmental concerns didn’t come to the forefront until the 1970s when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a series of pro-environment policy changes in response to a wave of environmental passion flaring across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|first=N.|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|year=2010|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, while policies have led to environmental progress in some areas, such as in [[air quality]], governments have had a harder time implementing programs that regulate [[groundwater]] [[contaminant]]s. Meanwhile, landfills continue to contaminate ground and [[drinking water]] around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, as late as 2006, the City of Oakland offered incentives for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and recycling options. Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 that a lack of [[service provider]]s for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City's environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for [[toy]]s, [[watch]]es, [[car]]s, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters/Foundation Press|location=New York|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the [[tax base]] toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of policy==

Oakland's Zero Waste Policy evolved out of a series of mandates originating with the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board|California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989]], which required every city and county in California to reduce their solid waste disposal amounts by 50% by year 2000. Soon after, in 1990, the Alameda County Waste Reduction and Recycling Initiative Charter Amendment (Measure D) mandated a 75% reduction in waste disposal countywide, allowing the Alameda County Source Reduction and Recycling Board to set a deadline for the goal. This board set 2010 as the deadline date. In 2002, the City of Oakland advocated for this goal by adopting a 75% reduction waste goal through Resolution 77500. This resolution called upon the Environmental Service Division of the City of Oakland's Public Works Agency to identify strategies to accomplish this goal. The City also amended the Oakland Municipal Code to establish requirements for construction and demolition [[debris]] waste reduction in 2002 through Ordinance #612253.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Marking another milestone in the evolution toward Zero Waste, [[San Francisco]] hosted the United Nations World Environment meeting of 2005, bringing together mayors across the country for a strategy session on waste disposal. Governor Jerry Brown's Sustainability Director at the time, Randy Hayes, played a pivotal role in Oakland's participation in the Accords and in creating momentum supporting Zero Waste systems within the Mayor's office. Brown signed the United Nations [[World Environment Day]] Urban Environmental Accords, pledging that Oakland would implement 21 action steps toward sustainability, which included a Zero Waste Goal. This accord meeting and related efforts spurred Oakland in 2006 to adopt a Zero Waste Strategic Plan, calling for 90% reduction in annual tons sent to landfills by 2020.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Policy tools==

What policies are aiding Oakland's in advancing toward Zero Waste? Oakland's Zero Waste Economy document, created in 2006, presents a multifaceted approach that incorporates prescriptive regulation, incentive-based or financial payments, penalties, and capacity policy tools directing the City toward a more “environmentally and economically sustainable system where resources are kept in the production cycle”, as described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy.|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive regulations or those that mandate actions allowed by law, also known as “[[command and control regulation]]”:
*	Ban toxic products from landfills or [[incinerator]]s.
*	Prohibit sale of “unnecessarily toxic or polluting products.”
Financial Penalties, or those tools designed to mitigate environmental harm by charging the offending party [[tax]]es or [[fee]]s:
*	Require that the manufacturer be held financially responsible for the product's end-cycle.
Incentive-based actions or financial payment encourage behavior by subsidizing certain actions or methods:
*	Build incentives for product designers to develop packaging with the use of non-toxic materials and opt for designs that promote reuse, recycle, or composting.
*	Create incentives for businesses to abide by environmental and [[Worker protection laws|worker protection]] standards, rather than choose the least expensive production methods and hiring workers outside the [[United States]].
*	Establish financial incentives for businesses and residents to recycle more and create less waste. (Federal tax subsidies at the time provided financial incentives to industries that make products from virgin materials).
*	Build incentives for consumers to voice their interest in non-toxic, reusable, and recyclable products by only purchasing items that meet these standards.
[[Persuasion]] techniques offer soft approaches urging behavior to change by distributing or publicizing information about the environmental issue.
*	Require [[distributor]]s and [[retailer]]s to become education centers to inform consumers about proper disposal and work with manufacturers to build reusable packaging and [[crate]]s and reduce any packaging where possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status in 2011==

Oakland is no longer measuring progress in terms of diversion rates, which allows credits for recycling, [[population]] and economic factors, but evaluates waste reduction more ambitiously, in terms of total disposal tonnage.  The 90% reduction rate it seeks by 2020 will require Oakland to double the waste reduction it had achieved over the past 15 years.  After 2002, when the City adopted the 75% reduction rate goal, Oakland's Public Works Agency realized that the systems that enabled Oakland to reach a 50% reduction rate would not be sufficient for Oakland to reach a 75% reduction rate. Hence, improving the systems has been a primary focus since 2006, which are outlined in Strategies #2 and #4 of the Strategic Plan. These strategies aim to build an end to incentives to continue disposing in landfills, instead calling for [[manufacturer]]s to take responsibility for the products and their materials through the entire duration of product [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	

One third of the materials that were winding up at city landfills in 2002 did not have recovery possibilities, leaving landfills as the only option. Much of this had to do with factors outside of the City's control, for reaching the 75% reduction rate would require changes at the state and/or federal level where manufacturing decisions are made. In fact, within the Zero Waste Strategic Plan, strategies 4 and 5 largely depend on behaviors and regulations outside municipal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
This realization led the City toward a stronger [[advocacy]] role, beginning when Jerry Brown was governor in 2002. Since that time, Oakland has been working with numerous regulatory and implementing agencies to advance legislation favoring system changes that allow for a Zero Waste goal to be achieved, including (to name a few):
*	The [[Association of Bay Area Governments]]
*	East Bay Development Alliance
*	[[Californians Against Waste]]
*	Berkeley Ecology Center
*	Product Policy Institute
*	National Recycling Coalition
*	[[Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice|Greenaction for Heath and Environmental Justice]]

Oakland also worked in a national group to  develop a [http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com/ Zero Waste Toolkit] designed to aid governments in implementing an Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (ECAP) for the reduction of greenhouse gases through materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gagliardi|first=M.|title=Materials Management Approaches for State and County Government|url=http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, while advocating for systemic changes at the state and regional level, the City recognized a need for assistance in implementing system changes at the local level. In 2009, Oakland's Public Works Agency entered into contract with R3 Consulting for support with [[system analysis]], planning and implementation of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan. R3 Consulting was chosen as the most highly experienced agency in [[system design]] for municipal governments, having formerly completed projects with the Cities of [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Los Angeles]], as well as with StopWaste.org. R3's work plan was split into two phases with an estimated project end date in 2011, including:

* Phase 1—Assessing and testing models and Zero Waste system designs to identify best options.
* Phase 2—Implement selected system design options by supporting City staff in building work plans for “collection, processing, transfer, and disposal of discarded products and materials.”

The City of Oakland's Public Works Agency is named as the primary administrator of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution adopting evaluative criteria for assessing solid waste management system designs responsive to the zero waste by 2020 goal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Oakland's Public Works Agency Web site (April, 2011), Oakland has steadily advanced its progress toward Zero Waste in recent years. Residents have reduced their landfill disposal by 27% since 2000, down to approximately 100,000 tons, bringing the City markedly closer to its goal of minimizing waste to 40,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Oakland recycles|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/GAR/index.htm|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland residents have played an important role in moving the City toward Zero Waste. Indeed, the “empowered consumer” is critical in the Zero Waste Economy. In our society, all systems circle back to money and sales (Gore, 2006).  Using their buying-power, consumers can tell industries that products must be non-toxic, reusable, recyclable or compostable or they will stay on the shelf. Following this directive, manufacturers and products designers will ultimately have no choice but to create or distribute sustainable products that drive the economy toward a [[paradigm]] that views production cycles as they do in nature, where “waste” is repurposed in the cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7283">'''Computational RAM''' or '''C-RAM''' is [[random-access memory]] with [[Central processing unit|processing elements]] integrated on the same chip.  This enables C-RAM to be used as a [[SIMD]] computer. It also can be used to more efficiently use memory bandwidth within a memory chip.

==Overview==
The most influential implementations of computational RAM came from [[The Berkeley IRAM Project]]. Vector IRAM (V-IRAM) combines [[DRAM]] with a [[vector processor]] integrated on the same chip.&lt;ref name="kozyrakis"&gt;

says
"Vector IRAM ...
can operate as a parallel built-in self-test engine for
the memory array, significantly reducing the DRAM
testing time and the associated cost."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconfigurable Architecture DRAM (RADram) is [[DRAM]] with [[reconfigurable computing]] [[FPGA]] logic elements integrated on the same chip.&lt;ref name="oskin"&gt;
Mark Oskin, Frederic T. Chong, and Timothy Sherwood.
[http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chong/papers/AP-isca98.pdf "Active Pages: A Computation Model for Intelligent Memory"].
1998.
&lt;/ref&gt;
SimpleScalar simulations show that RADram (in a system with a conventional processor) can give orders of magnitude better performance on some problems than traditional DRAM (in a system with the same processor).

Some [[embarrassingly parallel]] computational problems are already limited by the [[von Neumann bottleneck]] between the CPU and the DRAM.
Some researchers expect that, for the same total cost, a machine built from computational RAM will run orders of magnitude faster than a traditional general-purpose computer on these kinds of problems.&lt;ref&gt;

"programming a computational RAM"
&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the "DRAM process" (few layers; optimized for high capacitance) and the "CPU process" (optimized for high frequency; typically twice as many [[BEOL]] layers as DRAM; since each additional layer reduces yield and increases manufacturing cost, such chips are relatively expensive per square millimeter compared to DRAM) is distinct enough that there are three approaches to computational RAM:

* starting with a CPU-optimized process and a device that uses lots of embedded SRAM, add an additional process step (making it even more expensive per square millimeter) to allow replacing the embedded SRAM with embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]), giving ~3x area savings on the SRAM areas (and so lowering net cost per chip).
* starting with a system with a separate CPU chip and DRAM chip(s), add small amounts of "coprocessor" computational ability to the DRAM, working within the limits of the DRAM process and adding only small amounts of area to the DRAM, to do things that would otherwise be slowed down by the narrow bottleneck between CPU and DRAM: zero-fill selected areas of memory, copy large blocks of data from one location to another, find where (if anywhere) a given byte occurs in some block of data, etc. The resulting system—the unchanged CPU chip, and "smart DRAM" chip(s)—is at least as fast as the original system, and potentially slightly lower in cost. The cost of the small amount of extra area is expected to be more than paid back in savings in expensive test time, since there is now enough computational capability on a "smart DRAM" for a wafer full of DRAM to do most testing internally in parallel, rather than the traditional approach of fully testing one DRAM chip at a time with an expensive external [[automatic test equipment]].&lt;ref name="kozyrakis" /&gt;
* starting with a DRAM-optimized process, tweak the process to make it slightly more like the "CPU process", and build a (relatively low-frequency, but low-power and very high bandwidth) general-purpose CPU within the limits of that process.

Some CPUs designed to be built on a DRAM process technology (rather than a "CPU" or "logic" process technology specifically optimized for CPUs) include

and the [[AT&amp;T DSP1]].

Because a memory bus to off-chip memory has many times the capacitance of an on-chip memory bus, a system with separate DRAM and CPU chips can have several times the [[low-power electronics|energy consumption]] of an IRAM system with the same [[computer performance]].
&lt;ref name="kozyrakis" /&gt;

Because computational DRAM is expected to run hotter than traditional DRAM,
and increased chip temperatures result in faster charge leakage from the DRAM storage cells,
computational DRAM is expected to require more frequent [[memory refresh|DRAM refresh]].

== Processor-in-/near-memory ==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2012}}
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2012}}

A '''processor-in-/near-memory (PINM)''' refers to a [[CPU|computer processor]] (CPU) tightly coupled to [[computer memory|memory]], generally on the same [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]].

The chief goal of merging the processing and memory components in this way is to reduce [[memory latency]] and increase [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Alternatively reducing the distance that data needs to be moved reduces the power requirements of a system. Much of the complexity (and hence [[power consumption]]) in current processors stems from strategies to deal with avoiding memory stalls.

==Examples==
In the 1980s, a tiny CPU that executed [[FORTH]] was fabricated into a [[DRAM]] chip to improve PUSH and POP.  [[FORTH]] is a [[stack-oriented programming language]] and this improved its efficiency.

The [[transputer]] also had large on chip memory given that it was made in the early 1980s making it essentially a processor-in-memory.

Notable PIM projects include the [[Berkeley IRAM project]] (IRAM) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/ IRAM]&lt;/ref&gt; project and the [[University of Notre Dame]] PIM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.nd.edu/~pim PIM]&lt;/ref&gt; effort.

'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] is an infinitely long period of [[time]]. In [[classical philosophy]], however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time while sempiternity is the concept that corresponds to the colloquial definition of eternity. 

Eternity is an  important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Philosophy of space and time}}
[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&amp;pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the image of a snake swallowing its own tail, known as the [[Ouroboros]] (or Uroboros). The circle is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. {{cn|date=March 2015}}   Symbolically, it suggests that Eternity has no beginning or end.

The concept of the three great '''evolutionary faunas''' of marine animals from the [[Cambrian]] to the present (that is, the entire [[Phanerozoic]]) was introduced by [[Jack Sepkoski]] in 1981 using [[factor analysis]] of the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. J. Sepkosi|title=A factor analysis description of the Phanerozoic marine fossil record|journal=Paleobiology|volume=7|year=1981|pages=3–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary fauna typically displays an increase in [[biodiversity]] following a [[Logistic function|logistic curve]] followed by extinctions (although the Modern Fauna has not yet exhibited the diminishing part of the curve).

==Cambrian fauna==
Fauna I, known as "Cambrian", described as a "[[Trilobite]]-rich assemblage", encompasses the bulk of the fossils which first appeared in the [[Cambrian explosion]], and largely became extinct in the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]]. This fauna comprises trilobites, [[small shelly fossil]]s (grouped by Sepkoski into "Polychaeta", but including [[cribricyathid]]s, [[coleolid]]s, and [[volborthellid]]s), [[Monoplacophora]], [[Inarticulata|inarticulate brachiopods]] and hyoliths.&lt;ref&gt;Sepkoski, J. J. (1981). A Factor Analytic Description of the Phanerozoic Marine Fossil Record. Paleobiology, 7(1), 36–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleozoic fauna==
Fauna II, known as "Paleozoic", described as a "[[Brachiopod]]-rich assemblage", accounts for most of the fossils appearing in the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]], and largely became extinct in the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. This fauna is marked by fossils of the following classes: [[Articulata (Brachiopoda)|Articulata]], [[Crinoidea]], [[Ostracoda]], [[Cephalopoda]], [[Anthozoa]], [[Stenolaemata]], [[Stelleroidea]].

==Modern fauna==
Fauna III, known as "Modern", described as a [[Mollusc]]-rich assemblage", arose largely in the [[Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiation]], still in progress.The following classes are included: [[Gastropoda]], [[Bivalvia]], [[Osteichthyes]], [[Malacostraca]], [[Echinoidea]], [[Gymnolaemata]], [[Demospongiae]], [[Chondrichthyes]].

==Kindred concepts==
In the mid-19th century, John Phillips suggested three great systems: Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Caenozoic. Writing after Sepkoski, Brenchley and Harper suggested that there were two early evolutionary faunas before the three of Sepkoski: Ediacaran and Tomottian. They also point out similarities with four "evolutionary terrestrial plant floras": Early Vascular, Pteridophytes, Gymnospores, Angiospores; and three "evolutionary terrestrial tetrapod faunas": "Megadynasty I (Carboniferous-early Permian)" "primitive amphibians and reptiles, most notably ... ''Dimetrodon''", "Megadynasty II (early Permian-mid-Triassic)" "mammal-like therapsids", and "Megadynasty III (late Triassic-Cretaceous)" "included the age of the dinosaurs".

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This article is in US English--&gt;
[[Image:Modern HE lenses.png|left|frame|Modern high explosive lenses. The colored areas are the fast explosive, while the white areas are the slow explosives.]]
[[Image:Implosion nuclear weapon design - explosive lenses.svg|right|thumb|250px|In an implosion-type nuclear weapon, polygonal lenses are arranged around the spherical core of the bomb. Thirty-two "points" are shown. Other designs use as many as 96 or as few as two such points.]]

An '''explosive lens'''—as used, for example, in [[nuclear weapon]]s—is a highly specialized  [[shaped charge]]. In general, it is a device composed of several [[explosive charge]]s. These charges are arranged and formed with the intent to control the shape of the detonation wave passing through them. The explosive lens is conceptually similar to an [[optical lens]], which focuses light waves.  The charges that make up the explosive lens are chosen to have different rates of detonation. In order to convert a spherically expanding [[wavefront]] into a spherically converging one using only a single boundary between the constituent explosives, the boundary shape must be a [[paraboloid]]; similarly, to convert a spherically diverging front into a flat one, the boundary shape must be a [[hyperboloid]], and so on. Several boundaries can be used to reduce aberrations (deviations from intended shape) of the final wavefront.

==Invention==
As mentioned by [[Hans Bethe]], the invention of the explosive lens device was contributed and designed by [[John von Neumann]] &lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;{{cite video |title=John Von Neumann Documentary |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |year=1966 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47VBYF9Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in nuclear weapons==
In a nuclear weapon, an array of explosive lenses is used to change the several approximately-spherical diverging detonation waves into a single spherical converging one. The converging wave is then used to collapse the various shells (tamper, reflector, pusher, etc.) and finally compresses the core ([[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]]) of [[fissile material|fissionable material]] to a [[prompt critical]] state. They are usually machined from a [[plastic bonded explosive]] and an inert insert, called a wave-shaper, which is often a dense [[foam]] or [[plastic]], though many other materials can be used. Other, mainly older explosive lenses do not include a wave shaper, but employ two explosive types that have significantly different [[explosive velocity|velocities of detonation]] (VoD), which are in the range from 5 to 9&amp;nbsp;km/s. The use of the low- and high-speed explosives again results in a spherical converging detonation wave to compress the physics package. The original [[The gadget|Gadget]] device used in the [[Trinity test]] and [[Fat Man]] dropped on [[Nagasaki]] used [[Baratol (explosive)|Baratol]] as the low-VoD explosive and [[Composition B]] as the fast, but other combinations can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coster-Mullen |first=John |date=2012 |title=Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |asin=B0006S2AJ0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gadget-schematic-crosssection.png|thumb|left|Cross-section of the [[Trinity test|"Trinity" gadget]]. The alternating high and slow explosives (in purple) are the explosive lens which forces the spherical [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] to compress into [[prompt critical]]ity.]]

The illustration to the left represents a cross section through a segment of a polygonal wedge. The wedges are fitted together to form a [[sphere|spherical]] device. The [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]] at the far left triggers a semi-spherical [[shock wave|detonation wave]] through the high-speed outer explosive. (It is semi-spherical because the exploding-bridgewire acts as a point-detonator.)  As the wave is transferred to the precisely shaped inner explosive, a new spherical wave—centered on the object—is formed. The successful functioning of this device hinges on the simultaneous initiation of the wave in each segment, uniformity and precision in the speed of the wave, and correctness and accuracy in the shape of the interface between the two explosives.

A series of experiments was performed in 1944 and 1945 during the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the lenses for a satisfactory implosion. One of the most important tests was the series of [[RaLa Experiment]]s.

Initially, a 32 "point" assembly was used (each of which had a pair of exploding-bridgewire detonators).

Later, a 96 "point" assembly was tried, with the objective of obtaining a smaller assembly with improved performance.

Finally, with the success of the [[Swan (nuclear primary)|Swan]] device, a two "point" assembly became feasible. Swan used an "air lens" system in addition to shaped charges and became the basis of all [[United States|U.S.]] successor designs, nuclear and thermonuclear alike, and featured small size, light weight, and exceptional reliability and safety, as well as using the least amount of [[strategic material]]s of any design.

==Other uses==
Lenses using alternate design techniques and producing flat "plane wave" outputs are used for high transient pressure physics and materials science experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Pimbley |author2=Mader |author3=Bowen |title=Plane Wave Generator Calculations |number=LA-9119 |institution=Los Alamos National Labs |date=October 1982 |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fat necrosis''' is a form of [[necrosis]] characterized by the action upon [[fat]] by digestive [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="urlCell Injury"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/CINJHTML/CINJ026.html |title=Cell Injury |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fermenting.jpg|thumb|Fermentation in progress: Bubbles of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] form a froth on top of the fermentation mixture.]]

'''Fermentation''' is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process that produces chemical changes in organic [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] through the action of [[enzymes]]. In [[biochemistry]], it is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] in the absence of oxygen. [[Fermentation in food processing|In the context of food production]], it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of [[microorganisms]] brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage.&lt;ref name="Hui 2004 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Hui | first=Y. H. | title=Handbook of vegetable preservation and processing | publisher=M. Dekker | publication-place=New York | year=2004 | isbn=0-8247-4301-6 | oclc=52942889 | page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of fermentation is known as [[zymology]].

In microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by the degradation of organic nutrients [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobically]].&lt;ref name="Prescott Microbiology"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072556781/information_center_view0/|title=Microbiology|author1=Klein, Donald W.|author2=Lansing M.|author3=Harley, John|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-255678-0|edition=6th|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the [[Neolithic age]]. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces [[lactic acid]] found in such sour [[food]]s as [[pickled cucumber]]s, [[kimchi]], and [[yogurt]], as well as for [[fermentation in winemaking|producing alcoholic beverages such as wine]] and [[beer]]. Fermentation occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Bowen|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/largegut/ferment.html|title=Microbial Fermentation|website=Hypertexts for biological sciences|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Below are some definitions of fermentation. They range from informal, general usages to more scientific definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard J.|last2=Funke|first2=Berdell R.|last3=Case|first3=Christine L.|title=Microbiology An Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Pearson  Cummings|location=San Francisco, CA 94111, USA|isbn=978-0-321-58202-7|page=135|edition=10|ref=31|chapter=5}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# Preservation methods for food via microorganisms (general use).
# Any process that produces alcoholic beverages or acidic dairy products (general use).
# Any large-scale microbial process occurring with or without air (common definition used in industry).
# Any energy-releasing metabolic process that takes place only under anaerobic conditions (becoming more scientific).
# Any metabolic process that releases energy from a sugar or other organic molecule, does not require oxygen or an electron transport system, and uses an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor (most scientific).

==Biological role==
Along with [[photosynthesis]] and [[aerobic respiration]], fermentation is a way of extracting energy from molecules, but it is the only one common to all bacteria and [[eukaryote]]s. It is therefore considered the oldest [[metabolic pathway]], suitable for an environment that does not yet have oxygen.&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;{{rp|389}} Yeast, a form of [[fungus]], occurs in almost any environment capable of supporting microbes, from the skins of fruits to the guts of insects and mammals and the deep ocean, and they harvest sugar-rich materials to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martini|first1=A.|title=Biodiversity and conservation of yeasts|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|date=1992|volume=1|issue=4|pages=324–333|doi=10.1007/BF00693768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=D.|last2=Howe|first2=A.|last3=Brown|first3=N.|last4=Barton|first4=H.|last5=Demidova|first5=M.|last6=Michelle|first6=H.|last7=Li|first7=L.|last8=Sanders|first8=H.|last9=Watkinson|first9=S.

The basic mechanism for fermentation remains present in all cells of higher organisms. [[Mammal]]ian [[muscle]] carries out the fermentation that occurs during periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in the creation of [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Donald|last2=Voet|first2=Judith G.|title=Biochemistry|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Global Education|isbn=9781118139936|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} In [[invertebrates]], fermentation also produces [[succinate]] and [[alanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broda|first1=E|title=The Evolution of the Bioenergetic Processes|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781483136134}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}

Fermentative bacteria play an essential role in the production of methane in habitats ranging from the [[rumen]]s of cattle to sewage digesters and freshwater sediments. They produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, [[formate]] and [[acetate]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s; and then consortia of microbes convert the carbon dioxide and acetate to methane. Acetogenic bacteria oxidize the acids, obtaining more acetate and either hydrogen or formate. Finally, [[methanogenesis|methanogens]] (which are in the domain ''[[Archea]]'') convert acetate to methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferry|first1=J G|title=Methane from acetate.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=September 1992|volume=174|issue=17|pages=5489–5495|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5489-5495.1992|pmc=206491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial]] outer membrane is omitted.]]Fermentation reacts [[NADH]] with an [[Endogeny|endogenous]], [[organic compound|organic]] [[electron acceptor]].&lt;ref name="Prescott Microbiology"/&gt; Usually this is [[pyruvate]] formed from sugar through [[glycolysis]]. The reaction produces [[NAD+]] and an organic product, typical examples being [[ethanol]], [[lactic acid]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]. However, more exotic compounds can be produced by fermentation, such as [[butyric acid]] and [[acetone]]. Fermentation products contain chemical energy (they are not fully oxidized), but are considered waste products, since they cannot be metabolized further without the use of oxygen.

Fermentation normally occurs in an [[anaerobic environment]]. In the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NADH, and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]]. This is called [[oxidative phosphorylation]], and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that reason, fermentation is rarely utilized when oxygen is available. However, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, some strains of [[yeast]] such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' prefer fermentation to [[aerobic respiration]] as long as there is an adequate supply of [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugars]] (a phenomenon known as the [[Crabtree effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piškur|first1=Jure|last2=Compagno|first2=Concetta|title=Molecular mechanisms in yeast carbon metabolism|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642550133|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fermentation processes involve [[obligate anaerobe]]s, which cannot tolerate oxygen.

Although [[yeast]] carries out the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in the production of [[ethanol]] in [[beer]]s, [[wine]]s, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent: [[bacteria]] carry out the fermentation in the production of [[xanthan gum]].

The figure illustrates the process. Before fermentation, a glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate molecules. The energy from this [[exothermic reaction]] is used to bind inorganic [[phosphate]]s to ATP and convert NAD+ to NADH. The pyruvates break down into two [[acetaldehyde]] molecules and give off two [[carbon dioxide]] molecules as a waste product. The acetaldehyde is reduced into ethanol using the energy and hydrogen from NADH, and the NADH is oxidized into NAD+ so that the cycle may repeat. The reaction is catalysed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/&gt;

===Lactic acid===
{{Main|Lactic acid fermentation}}

''Homolactic fermentation'' (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis&lt;ref name="Introductory Botany 2007. p. 86"&gt;Introductory Botany: plants, people, and the Environment. Berg, Linda R. Cengage Learning, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-534-46669-5}}.  p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; undergoes a simple [[redox]] reaction, forming [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61"&gt;AP Biology. Anestis, Mark. 2nd Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-07-147630-0}}. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volume 3. Thorpe 1922. p.159"&gt;A dictionary of applied chemistry, Volume 3. Thorpe, Sir Thomas Edward. Longmans, Green and Co., 1922. p.159&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique because it is one of the only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHOHCOOH
It occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the [[blood]] can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of [[bacterium|bacteria]] (such as [[lactobacilli]]) and some [[fungi]]. It is the type of bacteria that converts [[lactose]] into lactic acid in [[yogurt]], giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either [[homolactic fermentation]], where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or ''Heterolactic fermentation'', where some lactate is further metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide&lt;ref name="AP Biology. Anestis 2006. P. 61"/&gt; (via the [[phosphoketolase]] pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHOHCOOH + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
If lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula):
:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
Heterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between [[lactic acid fermentation]] and other types, e.g. [[alcoholic fermentation]] (see [[Fermentation#Hydrogen gas production in fermentation|below]]). The reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:
*The acidity of lactic acid impedes biological processes. This can be beneficial to the fermenting organism as it drives out competitors that are unadapted to the acidity. As a result, the food will have a longer shelf life (part of the reason foods are purposely fermented in the first place); however, beyond a certain point, the acidity starts affecting the organism that produces it.
*The high concentration of lactic acid (the final product of fermentation) drives the equilibrium backwards ([[Le Chatelier's principle]]), decreasing the rate at which fermentation can occur and slowing down growth.
*Ethanol, into which lactic acid can be easily converted, is volatile and will readily escape, allowing the reaction to proceed easily. [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is also produced, but it is only weakly acidic and even more volatile than ethanol.
*Acetic acid (another conversion product) is acidic and not as volatile as ethanol; however, in the presence of limited oxygen, its creation from lactic acid releases additional energy. It is a lighter molecule than lactic acid, that forms fewer hydrogen bonds with its surroundings (due to having fewer groups that can form such bonds), thus is more volatile and will also allow the reaction to move forward more quickly.
*If [[propionic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and longer monocarboxylic acids are produced (see [[mixed acid fermentation]]), the amount of acidity produced per glucose consumed will decrease, as with ethanol, allowing faster growth.

===Hydrogen gas===
{{Main|Fermentative hydrogen production}}
[[Hydrogen]] gas is produced in many types of fermentation ([[mixed acid fermentation]], [[butyric acid]] fermentation, [[caproate]] fermentation, [[butanol]] fermentation, [[glyoxylate]] fermentation) as a way to regenerate NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from NADH. [[Electron]]s are transferred to [[ferredoxin]], which in turn is oxidized by [[hydrogenase]], producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Life 2004. pp. 139-140"/&gt; Hydrogen gas is a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[methanogen]]s and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reducer]]s, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the production of such an energy-rich compound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As an example of mixed acid fermentation, bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'' ferment glucose producing [[butyric acid|butyrate]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and hydrogen gas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Glucose could theoretically be converted into just CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the global reaction releases little energy.

==Modes of operation==
Most industrial fermentation uses batch or fed-batch procedures, although continuous fermentation can be more economical if various challenges, particularly the difficulty of maintaining sterility, can be met.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Teng|last2=Chen|first2=Xiang-bin|last3=Chen|first3=Jin-chun|last4=Wu|first4=Qiong|last5=Chen|first5=Guo-Qiang|title=Open and continuous fermentation: Products, conditions and bioprocess economy|journal=Biotechnology Journal|date=December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1503–1511|doi=10.1002/biot.201400084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batch===
In a batch process, all the ingredients are combined and the reactions proceed without any further input. Batch fermentation has been used for millennia to make bread and alcoholic beverages, and it is still a common method, especially when the process is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Cinar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cinar|first1=Ali|last2=Parulekar|first2=Satish J.|last3=Undey|first3=Cenk|last4=Birol|first4=Gulnur|title=Batch fermentation modeling, monitoring, and control.|date=2003|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=9780203911358}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} However, it can be expensive because the fermentor must be sterilized using high pressure steam between batches.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; Strictly speaking, there is often addition of small quantities of chemicals to control the pH or suppress foaming.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|25}}

Batch fermentation goes through a series of phases. There is a lag phase in which cells adjust to their environment; then a phase in which exponential growth occurs. Once many of the nutrients have been consumed, the growth slows and becomes non-exponential, but production of ''secondary metabolites'' (including commercially important antibiotics and enzymes) accelerates. This continues through a stationary phase after most of the nutrients have been consumed, and then the cells die.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|25}}

===Fed-batch===
{{See also|Fed-batch culture}}
Fed-batch fermentation is a variation of batch fermentation where some of the ingredients are added during the fermentation. This allows greater control over the stages of the process. In particular, production of secondary metabolites can be increased by adding a limited quantity of nutrients during the non-exponential growth phase. Fed-batch operations are often sandwiched between batch operations.&lt;ref name=Cinar/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmid|first1=Rolf D.|last2=Schmidt-Dannert|first2=Claudia|title=Biotechnology : an illustrated primer|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527335152|edition=Second|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open===
The high cost of sterilizing the fermentor between batches can be avoided using various open fermentation approaches that are able to resist contamination. One is to use a naturally evolved mixed culture. This is particularly favored in wastewater treatment, since mixed populations can adapt to a wide variety of wastes. [[Thermophile|Thermophilic]] bacteria can produce lactic acid at temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius, sufficient to discourage microbial contamination; and ethanol has been produced at a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°C. This is just below its boiling point (78&amp;nbsp;°C), making it easy to extract. [[Halophile|Halophilic]] bacteria can produce bioplastics in hypersaline conditions. Solid-state fermentation adds a small amount of water to a solid substrate; it is widely used in the food industry to produce flavors, enzymes and organic acids.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt;

===Continuous===
In continuous fermentation, substrates are added and final products removed continuously.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; There are three varieties: [[chemostat]]s, which hold nutrient levels constant; [[turbidostat]]s, which keep cell mass constant; and [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactors]] in which the culture medium flows steadily through a tube while the cells are recycled from the outlet to the inlet.&lt;ref name=Schmid/&gt; If the process works well, there is a steady flow of feed and effluent and the costs of repeatedly setting up a batch are avoided. Also, it can prolong the exponential growth phase and avoid byproducts that inhibit the reactions by continuously removing them. However, it is difficult to maintain a steady state and avoid contamination, and the design tends to be complex.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt; Typically the fermentor must run for over 500 hours to be more economical than batch processors.&lt;ref name=Schmid/&gt;

==History of human use==
The use of [[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]], particularly for [[alcoholic beverage|beverages]], has existed since the [[Neolithic]] and has been documented dating from 7000–6600 BCE in [[Jiahu]], [[Neolithic China|China]],&lt;ref name="mcgovern"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGovern | first1 = P.

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Friedrich Traugott Kützing]] independently published papers concluding, as a result of microscopic investigations, that yeast is a living organism that reproduces by [[budding]].&lt;ref name=Shurtleff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurtleff|first1=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|title=A Brief History of Fermentation, East and West|url=http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/fermentation.php|website=Soyinfo Center|publisher=Soyfoods Center, Lafayette, California|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lengeler&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lengeler|editor-first1=Joseph W.|editor-last2=Drews|editor-first2=Gerhart|editor-last3=Schlegel|editor-first3=Hans Günter|title=Biology of the prokaryotes|date=1999|publisher=Thieme [u.a.]|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783131084118}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Schwann boiled grape juice to kill the yeast and found that no fermentation would occur until new yeast was added. However, a lot of chemists , including [[Antoine Lavoisier]], continued to view fermentation as a simple chemical reaction and rejected the notion that living organisms could be involved. This was seen as a reversion to [[vitalism]] and was lampooned in an anonymous publication by [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[Friedrich Wöhler]].&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tobin|first1=Allan|last2=Dusheck|first2=Jennie|title=Asking about life|date=2005|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Pacific Grove, Calif.|isbn=9780534406530|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108–109}}

The turning point came when [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895), during the 1850s and 1860s, repeated Schwann's experiments and showed that fermentation is initiated by living organisms in a series of investigations.&lt;ref name="Volume 3.

Retrieved on 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, he demonstrated that bacteria cause [[souring]] in milk, a process formerly thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in identifying the role of microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of [[pasteurization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/chemists/louis-pasteur-info.htm HowStuffWorks "Louis Pasteur"]. Science.howstuffworks.com (2009-07-01). Retrieved on 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, working to improve the French [[brewing industry]], Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, "''Etudes sur la Bière''", which was translated into English in 1879 as "Studies on fermentation".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Pasteur (1879) Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them.

Translated by F. Faulkner, D.C. Robb.&lt;/ref&gt; but correctly showed that specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-products.

Although showing fermentation to be the result of the action of living microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of the fermentation process, or prove that it is caused by the microorganisms that appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation [[enzyme]] from [[yeast]].&lt;ref name="Modern History Sourcebook 1895"/&gt; Success came in 1897 when the German chemist [[Eduard Buechner]] ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this "dead" liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFrBP8S7my4C&amp;pg=PA25 New beer in an old bottle]: Eduard Buchner and the Growth of Biochemical Knowledge.

The "unorganized ferments" behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cP1IrqiBPCwC&amp;pg=PA7 The enigma of ferment: from the philosopher's stone to the first biochemical Nobel prize].

==Etymology==
The word "ferment" is derived from the Latin verb ''fervere'', which means to boil. It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in [[alchemy]], but only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until around 1600.

In [[rocket]]ry, the '''Goddard problem''' is to optimize the [[altitude]] of a rocket, ascending vertically, and taking into account [[atmospheric drag]] and the [[gravitational field]].  This was first posed by [[Robert H. Goddard]] in his 1919 publication, "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~cliff/aoe5244_99/week_13_a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0409855&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hand Arm Vibration Study.webm|thumb|A video describing research done on hand–arm vibration]]
In [[occupational safety and health]], '''hand arm vibrations''' ('''HAVs''') are a specific type of occupational hazard which can lead to [[Vibration white finger|hand arm vibration syndrome]].

== Description ==
Exposure to hand arm vibrations is a respectively newer [[Occupational hazard#vibration|occupational hazard]] in the work place.  While hand arm vibrations have been occurring ever since the first usage of the power tool, concern over damage due to HAVS has lagged behind its fellow hazards such as [[Noise]] and [[Occupational hazard#Common workplace hazard groups|chemical hazards]].  While safety engineers worldwide are collaboratively working on instilling both an Exposure Action Value and an Exposure Limit Value similar to the occupational noise standards, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], the only regulatory public safety administration in the United States, has yet to offer either official values in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispesl.it/informazione/eventi/atti/2007/ws-armstrong.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331132344/http://www.ispesl.it/informazione/eventi/atti/2007/ws-armstrong.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggested guidelines ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ACGIH TLV.JPG|frame|right|Threshold Limit Values, Provided by the American Conference of Industrial Hygienists]] --&gt;
While OSHA has yet to supply these values, other countries agencies have.  The [[Health and Safety Executive]] of the [[British Government]] suggests to use an Exposure Action Value of 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an Exposure Limit Value of 5.0&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg175.pdf |title=Control the risks from hand-arm vibration |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[CCOHS|Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]] promotes the ACGIH Threshold Limit Values shown by the adjacent table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/vibration/vibration_measure.html |title=Vibration - Measurement, Control and Standards : OSH Answers |publisher=Ccohs.ca |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the time-weighted acceleration data exceeds these numbers for the duration, damage from HAVS begins.

== Damage prevention ==
There are only a few ways to lower the severity and risk of damage from HAVS without complete engineering redesign on the operation of the tools.  A few examples could be increasing the dampening through thicker gloves and increasing the trigger size of the tool to decrease the stress concentration of the vibrations on the contact area, but the best course of action would be to buy safer tools that vibrate less.  These Exposure Action Values and Exposure Limit Values seem rather low, when compared to lab tested data, shown by the [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] [[NIOSH Power Tools Database|Power Tools Database]].  Just an example out of the database, the reciprocating saws look to have extremely violent vibrations with one of the saws vibrations reaching 50&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in one hand and over 35&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/default.aspx |title=CDC - Powertools Database - NIOSH |publisher=.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various occupational standards of vibration measurement for HAV in use in the United States. They are ANSI S3.34, ACGIH-HAV standard, and NIOSH #89-106. Internationally, 
European Union Directive 2002/44/EC and ISO5349 are the vibration measurement standards for HAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galsonlabs.com/resourcecenter/bulletin.php?c=25 Occupational Vibration: Who is at risk?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactive monitoring ==
While there are different tools used to monitor HAV, a simple system can be used in organizations highlighting excess use of grinding disks when using a hand held angle grinder. This is re-active monitoring and it was introduced by Carl West at a fabrication workshop in Rotherham, England in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/vibration/hav/casestudies/mhav-carlwest.htm |title=Monitoring exposure to Hand-Arm Vibration |publisher=Hse.gov.uk |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">In the field of [[recursion theory]], '''index sets''' describe classes of [[partial recursive function]]s, specifically they give all indices of functions in that class according to a fixed enumeration of partial recursive functions (a [[Gödel number]]ing).

==Definition==
Fix an enumeration of all partial recursive functions, or equivalently of [[recursively enumerable]] sets whereby the ''e''th such set is &lt;math&gt;W_{e}&lt;/math&gt; and the ''e''th such function (whose domain is &lt;math&gt;W_{e}&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\phi_{e}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of partial recursive functions.  If &lt;math&gt;A = \{x : \phi_{x} \in \mathcal{A} \}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the '''index set''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  In general &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an index set if for every &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi_x \simeq \phi_y&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. they index the same function), we have &lt;math&gt;x \in A \leftrightarrow y \in A&lt;/math&gt;.  Intuitively, these are the sets of natural numbers that we describe only with reference to the functions they index.

==Index sets and [[Rice's theorem]]==
Most index sets are incomputable (non-recursive) aside from two trivial exceptions.  This is stated in '''Rice's theorem''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of partial recursive functions with index set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is recursive if and only if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is empty, or &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is all of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[natural numbers]], including [[zero]].

Rice's theorem says "any nontrivial property of partial recursive functions is undecidable"&lt;ref name=odifreddi&gt;{{cite book | title=Classical Recursion Theory, Volume 1| author=Odifreddi, P. G. }}; page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Intangible Asset Finance''' is the branch of [[finance]] that deals with [[intangible assets]] such as [[patents]] (legal intangible) and [[reputation]] (competitive intangible). Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[risk]], and [[time]].

== Basic principles ==

In 2003, one estimate put the [[economic equilibrium]] of intangible assets in the U.S. [[economy]] at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic [[corporations]] in the first quarter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RmFLUk7NydQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intangible+Assets:+Values,+Measures+and+Risks,&amp;sig=W2d87NPMzvfWlTDrmUNijOziu-8#PPA28,M1 "A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment," Leonard Nakamura in '''Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks''' at 28, Hand &amp; Lev, Oxford University Press (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the "hidden value" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset [[management]].

Intangible assets include [[business processes]], Intellectual Property (IP) such as [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[reputation]]s for [[ethics]] and [[integrity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], [[sustainability]], [[security]], and [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. Today, these intangibles drive [[cash flow]] and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, [[management]], [[risk forecasting]] and [[risk transfer]] are growing services as the [[economic base]] divests itself of physical [[assets]]. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold; ''Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens''; Springer Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.

*'''Patent Licensing &amp; Enforcement Companies ("P-LECs")''': These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is [[NTP, Inc.]], which has successfully asserted patents related to email [[push technology]]. Another name for a P-LEC is "[[patent troll]]," although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, [[hedge funds]] have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation.   One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in [[New York City]].
*'''Royalty stream securitizers''': These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeal.com/newsweekly/features/a-seller's-market.php#bottom "A seller's market," The Deal, September 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first [[pharmaceutical]] patent-backed securitization to be rated by [[Standard and Poors]], which involved a patent on the [[HIV]] drug [[Zerit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rESRFPqSKzQC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=zerit+patent+securitization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sN9S5ZWcrM&amp;sig=LhlE-nYfxXddjCKeoGql6ap5KxM&amp;hl=en#PPA487,M1 "Avoiding Transaction Peril," Heller et al., in '''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property''' at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were [[Yale]] (the owner of the patent) and [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].
*'''Reinsurers''': These are firms that use the techniques of [[reinsurance]] to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue [[Catastrophe bond|cat bonds]] to mitigate the risks associated with [[extreme weather]], [[earthquake]]s, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue "intangible asset risk-linked securities" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in [[Pittsburgh]], is a [[thought leader]] regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelcityre.com/accelerating_innovation.shtml Steel City Re]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market makers''': Firms that are working to provide more [[liquidity]] to the market for intellectual property. Early [[market maker]]s offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceantomo.com/press/Europe_Auction_Catalogue_Release_4.22.08.pdf Ocean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world’s first [[stock exchange]] with an intellectual property focus.
*'''Investment Research Firms''': Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues.   Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Significant transactions ==

*'''1997''':  [[David Bowie]] securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing [[Bowie Bonds]].
*'''2000''': BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering [[Stavudine]], which is a [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting [[scandal]] at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature [[amortization]] of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] as it involved a single patent and a single [[licensee]].
*'''2005''': UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG [[Max Azria]]'s royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first "whole company securitization" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by [[NexCen Brands, Inc.]] in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/idUS107689+13-May-2010+BW20100513 NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2005''': Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property.
*'''2006''':  [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s film rights securitization in conjunction with [[Ambac Financial Group]] to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a [[credit facility]] for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and [[intellectual property]] related to some of Marvel’s most popular [[comic book]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambac.com/pdfs%5CDeals%5Cmarvel.pdf Ambac's press release, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits ==

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States National Academies]] hosted a one-day conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth."

[[The Intangible Asset Finance Society]] provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.

The Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to
public education and research on the emerging global [[information economy]]. On April 16, 2008 it published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenaalliance.org/pdf/IntangibleAssetMonetization.pdf "Intangible Asset Monetization: The Promise and the Reality"]&lt;/ref&gt; a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

'''Land banking''' is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or [[land development|development]].

While in many countries ''land banking'' may refer to various private [[real-estate]] [[investment]] schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental]] [[County (United States)|county]] or [[Municipality|municipal]] authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land.

==Municipal land banks in the United States==
===Definition===
[[File:Urban Blight in Philadelphia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Blighted land in Philadelphia]]
Land banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of [[Urban decay|underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property]]. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank "model" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank S. Alexander |url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |title=Land Banks and Land Banking |agency=Center for Community Progress |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606080059/http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/ccp_land_banks.pdf |archivedate=June  6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The period of [[deindustrialization]] in the United States coupled with increased [[suburbanization]] in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of [[Urban decay|vacant &amp; blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property]]. Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in [[St. Louis]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Frank S. Alexander"/&gt; While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn’t until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County Land Bank]]. In 2009 the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse and the ensuing foreclosure crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sage Computing, Inc.|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/landbanks.pdf |title=Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: Office of Policy Development and Research |date=August 2009 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment land banking by country==

===United Kingdom===
Land banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or [[real estate developer]]s. Many reputable listed commercial [[building companies]] engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Services Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in the period 2002 – Jul 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Levene |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/nov/07/landbanking-investment-scheme |title=Land Banking – The Plot Thickens |publisher=Guardian |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landbanking scheme that is a [[Collective investment scheme]] is a "regulated activity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21#guide-mark-6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621075802/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/guides/public-guide-21 |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and, according to section 19(1), may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt. Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered. After recent FSA enforcement of this regulation many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non UK residents who are not protected by FSA regulations.

====Companies offering land banking plots in the UK====
Since the changes in the land registration act, a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed. Typically this land is greenbelt, nature conservation, flood plain,  agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development. There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes.

There have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes. A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the FSA or other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-pontoon-cib-winds-up-21-companies-in-a-day-373438 |title=9 Land Banking Companies Wound Up |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/trends-events/investigations/12677184-1.html |title=Three companies are ordered into liquidation following a government investigation |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/pressrelease/insolvency-service-national-high-court-orders-five-land-banking-companies-into-liquidation-391681 |title=5 Land Banking Companies Liquidated |publisher=Mynewsdesk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation. Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities, or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment. In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a warning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/publications/quick_tips/Consumer_Portal_Land_Banking.html |title=Land Banking – Look before you leap |publisher=Moneysense.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada.

====Sales methods====
A company representative may contact an individual by telephone, in temporary shopping center booths, or at [http://www.kampcrystalresidency.com property] shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK. Very often UK government or industry statistics, the proximity of the land to built up areas, or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment. Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as [[building land]]. When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak. Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site. These plans are often referred to as "pre-approved", "concept" or "predevelopment". The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price.

No reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land, or the issues involved with the long term maintenance, and collectively selling tiny plots of land. The sales price is typically uplifted 10–100 times over the current value of the land. Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process. No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person. The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected, or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations. There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe.

The investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped. Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme, the re-sale value of the individual plots collapses. This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely, or relocating to another legal jurisdiction.

For customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations, or other [[High-yield investment program|high yield investment programmes]]. Customers may also be added to [[sucker list|suckers lists]] which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor.

====Controversies====
A ''[[You and Yours]]'' documentary, first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbott |first=Melanie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6177017.stm |title=CPRE wants 'land banking' regulation |publisher=BBC News |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom, suggesting that they were scamming their customers. A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots, with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment.

A key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots, and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnmoney.co.uk/advice/advice-87.html |title=Land Banking Companies – Why the majority of them are (legal) scams |publisher=Learnmoney.co.uk |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot.

Many land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom, particularly Canada, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Malaysia. Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as [[green belt]] zoning.

In 2008, the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Philip Scott, This is Money4 June 2008, 12:00am |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=442527&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=FSA shuts down UKLI 'land banking' firm: UK Land Investments |publisher=This is Money |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to insolvency, despite having taken £69 million from 4,500 people for land plots.

The [[HM Land Registry|UK Land Registry]] issued a press release&lt;ref name="landreg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |title=Land Registry : Press notice |publisher=Landreg.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101145935/http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about_us/pressoffice/notices/default.asp?article_id=19829 |archivedate=November  1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 15, 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes. Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being "misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission", with well-known banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project, and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not.

===United States===
====Government====
[[File:Syr-Land-Bank-sign.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse Land Bank sign, Syracuse, New York]]
In 2011 [[New York State]] passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated, sold or demolished in an orderly fashion. Many counties upstate including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[Schenectady County]] and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs. Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title. [http://esd.ny.gov/BusinessPrograms/Data/NYSLBP/LandBankAct_Article16NPCL.pdf] 

The recent [[robo-signing]] settlement gave Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany. [http://wamc.org/post/schneiderman-announces-land-bank-funding]

The state of [[Michigan]] also has a land bank program [http://www.michigan.gov/landbank]. [[Ohio]] passed land bank legislation in 2009.

====Commercial====
Land banking as an investment is nothing new to America. Several self-made billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen. People such as [[Bob Hope]] and [[Donald Trump]] have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold. There have however, also been many land scams in the US, such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate.

Florida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush. Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today. Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams. Polk County, being the land that lies between the city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando, in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development. North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp. The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp "land of critical state concern". During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development. The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices. These prices ranged from $2,000 to as high as $15,000 per acre. The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States. Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the U.S. borders through contracts for deed arrangements.

===Australia===
In December 2008, at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate. Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to $300,000. Under new laws active since February 2009, this monetary limit has been removed.

In March 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |title=Australia's Stevens Monitors Foreign Home Buyers as Prices Jump |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329144746/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-25/australia-s-stevens-monitors-foreign-home-buyers-as-prices-jump.html |archivedate=March 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2010, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier. Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value, temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country, and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board, effectively eliminating this land banking loophole. However, foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff.

It is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2010/074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |title=Press Release – Government Tightens Foreign Investment Rules for Residential Housing [24/04/2010&amp;#93; |publisher=Assistant.treasurer.gov.au |date=April 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122544/http://assistant.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F2010%2F074.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=njsa&amp;Year=&amp;DocType= |archivedate=July  6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 20, 2010, the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and '''Affordability''' [http://www.adhikariawasyojana2.com/]Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine ‘underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/Communique_20_April_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009063639/http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2010-04-19/docs/communique_20_April_2010.pdf |archivedate=October  9, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural land banking==
[[Image:ParaguayChaco_Clearings_for_cattle_grazing.jpg|thumb|Advancing agriculture in the [[Gran Chaco|Paraguay Chaco]].]]
While most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas, in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land. The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate, topography and soil properties, where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out, would be agricultural land banking.

Such lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor, therefore prices being low. The investor anticipates that, because of the area's natural productive potential, an agricultural infrastructure (sufficient roads, specialised contractors, grain storages) will develop, with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying.

Agricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist, where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings (free hold) by domestic and foreign investors.
Typical countries for such investments during recent years have been [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]],
[[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Though the perception that the world's fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new, it received renewed public and media attention with the [[global food crisis]], when phrases like ''[[peak wheat]]'' or ''peak soil''&lt;ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}

A '''litter''' is the live birth of multiple [[offspring]] at one time in [[animal]]s from the same mother and usually from one set of [[parent]]s, particularly from three to eight offspring. The word is most often used for the offspring of [[mammal]]s, but can be used for any animal that gives birth to multiple young.  In comparison, a group of [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and the offspring that hatch from them are frequently called a [[clutch (animal)|clutch]], while young birds are often called a [[offspring|brood]]. Animals from the same litter are referred to as litter-mates.

Animals frequently display grouping behavior in [[herd]]s, [[swarm]]s, [[Flock (birds)|flocks]], or [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], and these multiple births derive similar advantages.  A litter offers some protection from [[predation]], not particularly to the individual young but to the parents' investment in breeding.  With multiple young, predators could eat several and others could still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season.  The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group.  Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or [[runt]]s, to die through lack of care.

In the wild, only a small percentage, if any, of the litter may survive to maturity, whereas for domesticated animals and those in captivity with human care the whole litter almost always survives. [[Kittens]] and [[puppies]] are in this group. [[Carnivore]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[pig]]s usually have litters, while primates and larger herbivores usually have singletons.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}

In neuroscience, the '''mass action principle''' suggests that the proportion of the brain that is injured is directly proportional to the decreased ability of memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutherford|first1=Raymond E. Fancher, Alexandra|title=Pioneers of psychology : a history|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393935301|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, memory cannot be localized to a single cortical area, but is instead distributed throughout the cortex. This theory is contrasted by [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]]. This is one of two principles that [[Karl Lashley]] published in 1950, alongside the [[equipotentiality]] principle.

==Early theories==

In the 19th century, animal researchers and scientists were divided into two main groups in terms of how they believe the brain compensated for induced brain damage. The redundancy theorists hypothesized that any lesioned section of cerebral mass had an almost duplicate section, usually on the opposing hemisphere. This "back-up" area was considered to be what takes over the functions of the lesioned area. On the other hand, vicariation theorists believed that different areas of the brain with different functions could assume responsibility for the affected area. Both ideas were highly debated and led to increased research on [[neuroplasticity]] and lesion research, eventually affecting the lesion research of [[Jean Pierre Flourens|Flourens]] and Lashley.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Contributors==

Localization theories can be dated as far back as Aristotle, but the man credited with the beginning concepts of field theory was [[Jean Pierre Flourens]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Field theory is the concept that the brain acts as a single functional unit.  He devised the first principle of mass action, stating,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As long as not too much of the lobes is removed, they may in due time regain the exercise of their functions. Passing certain limits, however, the animal regains them only imperfectly, and passing these new limits it does not regain them at all. Finally, if one sensation comes back, all come back. If one faculty reappears, they all reappear.... This shows that each of these organs is only a single organ."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also developed the theory of [[equipotentiality]], stating, "All sensations, all perceptions, and all volition occupy concurrently the same seat in these organs. The faculty of sensation, perception, and volition is then essentially one faculty."&lt;ref name=tizard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TIZARD|first1=B|title=Theories of brain localization from Flourens to Lashley.|journal=Medical History|date=April 1959|volume=3|issue=2|pages=132–45|pmid=13643147|doi=10.1017/s0025727300024418|pmc=1034464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Lashley]]'s most famous research was an attempt to find the parts of the brain that were responsible for learning and memory traces, a hypothetical structure he called the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]]. He trained rats to perform specific tasks (seeking a food reward), then lesioned varying portions of the rats' cortexes, either before or after the animals received the training depending upon the experiment. The amount of cortical tissue removed had specific effects on acquisition and retention of knowledge, but the location of the removed cortex had no effect on the rats' performance in the maze. This led Lashley to conclude that memories are not localized but widely distributed across the cortex.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Mass action principle versus functional specialization==
There is evidence supporting both the mass action principle and functional specialization within the brain. Functional specialization is the idea that functions are localized within the brain and can only be carried out by particular area(s) of the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some tasks appear to work on the mass action principle, with lesions causing less drastic effects than would be expected if the tasks were localized within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This was shown in Lashley's rat maze experiments, in which the amount of tissue removed was more important to the rat's performance than where the tissue was removed from within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There are, however, examples of highly specialized areas of the brain in which even small amounts of damage can cause dramatic effects on people's abilities to perform certain tasks. Two such areas effect the comprehension of speech and the ability to produce coherent speech, Wernicke's area and Broca's area, respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Criticisms==
It is now believed that Flourens may have removed more than just the parts of the hemispheres that he claimed because his experiments can be replicated without his same drastic results.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} At the time, extraction methods were very crude and little was understood about the stages of recovery. These things contributed to the increased likelihood of symptoms occurring right after extraction to be attributed directly to the site of the lesion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Flourens' doctrine was widely accepted even though there were anatomists and physiologists disproving his ideas:

* [[Thomas Willis]] showed that there are nerves that connect the heart, lungs, and stomach to the cerebellum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[François Pourfour du Petit]] demonstrated that localization of motor movements on one side of the body was contained in the hemisphere on the opposite side. In the 1860s, [[Hughlings Jackson]] also came to these conclusions after connecting convulsions on one side of the body to the disease of the opposite side of the brain{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Alexander Bain]] explained the nervous system as a sort of interconnected system with the brain that transmits impulses{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* New experiments on [[electrical excitability]] in 1870 from [[Gustav Theodor Fritsch]], [[Eduard Hitzig]], and [[David Ferrier]] contributed to new findings regarding localization of function. And although their methods were still producing results that are considered off the mark today, they were important in building a foundation of support for a localization theory{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Then Lashley came along with his publication of ''Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence'' in 1929. His findings were under the umbrella of field theory, but he didn't completely agree with Flourens. He determined that only the more elementary functions are localized, with the more complex ones not being bound to certain structures. [[Shepherd Ivory Franz]] contributed to this field greatly by using better methods to study live animals. Lashley used these methods in combination with a large sample of animals to get results that can be statistically analyzed, and therefore came up with his equipotentiality and mass action theories. However, many others came up with different conclusions based on his results that again cast doubt upon Lashley's determinations of what was observed.&lt;ref name=tizard/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Currently mass action principle is accepted as a mechanism for some functions within the brain. However, there have been some functions that are believed to be contained within specific areas of the brain (many related to speech, which was impossible to determine when the mass action principle was theorized, as experiments historically only used animals). It does not appear that this difference is determined by difficulty of the function, as some highly specialized tasks are localized.

'''Ocarina Networks''' was a technology company selling a [[computer hardware|hardware]]/[[software]] solution designed to reduce data footprints with file-aware storage optimization. A subsidiary of [[Dell]], their flagship product, the Ocarina Appliance/Reader, released in April 2008, uses patented [[data compression]] techniques incorporating such methods as [[record linkage]] and context-based [[lossless data compression]].  The product includes the hardware-appliance-based compressor, the Ocarina Optimizer, and a real-time decompressor, the software-based Ocarina Reader.

== History ==
Ocarina was founded by Murli Thirumale, formerly a vice-president and general manager at [[Citrix Systems]]; Carter George, formerly a vice-president and co-founder of PolyServe (acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]); and Goutham Rao, formerly Chief Technical Officer and Chief Architect for Advanced Solutions Group of Citrix Systems.

Its solution works by identifying redundancy at a global file system level, and applying specific algorithms for different data formats, such as algorithms specific to images, text, executables, seismic data, and so forth. Ocarina's Optimizers work with existing storage systems through standard network protocols such as NFS, or are directly integrated with partner vendors storage systems.

On July 19, 2010, Dell announced it plans to acquire Ocarina Networks. The transaction was completed on July 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/secure/2010-7-19-ocarina-networks-aquisition.aspx Dell Signs Agreement to Acquire Ocarina Networks and its Storage Optimization Technology] Dell Website 2010-07-19 Retrieved 2010-07-29&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, the original Ocarina Optimizer product family was removed from the market, enabling the Ocarina team to focus on the integration of dedupe and compression into Dell storage products. The most notable examples were the DR-family of deduplication appliances, launched in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/news/2240113673/Dell-launches-DR4000-its-first-backup-deduplication-appliance|title=Dell launches DR4000, its first backup deduplication appliance|newspaper=SearchDataBackup|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and integration of dedupe into Dell's Fluid File System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.storagebytesnow.com/2013/12/11/dell-rolls-out-flash-storage-array-enhanced-equallogic-software/|title=Dell rolls out flash storage array, enhanced EqualLogic software « Storage Bytes Now|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The company's ECOsystem (Extract, Correlate, Optimize) provided data reduction technology, providing both [[Data deduplication|deduplication]] and content-aware [[data compression]] in a reliable, scalable, policy-based package. ECOsystem consists of 3 primary components, an optimizer, a reader, and a management and reporting framework. These components were delivered in software or appliance form depending on customer, application, and underlying storage solution.

The standard ECOsystem workflow was a post-process. Files were first stored to disk in native form. Policies are used to specify which files were to be optimized (based on age, location, or file type), and what compression settings to use. Policies were commonly used to avoid optimization of files that are actively being modified. ECOsystem could also be configured to migrate optimized data to a secondary tier of lower-cost storage for disk-based archival applications.

=== Compression and deduplication algorithms ===
ECOsystem was content aware, with selection of compression solution based on the type of data being processed. This went beyond file-extension filtering. ECOsystem recursively decomposed compound files, until elemental text, media, or binary components are identified. At the heart of the optimizer software is a context-weighted neural net that will apply the most effective compression solution based on the nature of the elemental file component identified, and will efficiently remember optimal settings based on similar files processed.

ECOsystem in most cases is highly effective at achieving results on novel or proprietary file-types, as well as pre-compressed media such as JPEG images and MPEG4 video. Ocarina successfully processed data in over 600 file formats to-date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== ECOmax and NFO workflows ===
Two forms of Ocarina's post-processing workflow were available; ECOmax and Native Format Optimization or NFO. ECOmax utilized all available compression methods to shrink data, including on-disk structures that maximized utilization of physical blocks. The ECOmax workflow required the use of the ECOreader, which is run-anywhere software that efficiently decodes data for transparent read-back. ECOmax could be applied to any file or data types including specialized files used by various vertical industries.

The NFO workflow is designed specifically for web-based media companies. In NFO, media files (for example JPEGs) were stored in their native state, which eliminates the need for decoding, and allows customers to capture data-reduction benefits throughout the workflow, including web distribution (bandwidth savings and better end-user experience), and movement into archival systems.  NFO provided "visually identical" compression that tailors image parameters to the sensitivities of the [[Human Visual System Model]], and the intended use of the image, without creating any perceivable quality degradation.

Note that many of the features and capabilities of the Ocarina ECOsystem were not included in later Dell products.

== Funding ==
* In 2007, Ocarina Networks secured $12M in series 'A' funding from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and  [[Highland Capital Partners]],
* In 2009, Ocarina [http://www.ocarinanetworks.com/news-events/press-releases/63-press-b-funding secured an additional $20M] from the same investors and JAFCO Ventures.

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= |page=145 |doi=10.2307/845880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where  nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Holly |year=1997 |title=Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia:" Ancient Feudal Restraints" and Revolutionary Reform |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=307–346 |jstor=2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004), p 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble titles==
===Spain===
In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.
}}

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raking light''', the illumination of objects from a [[Light_source#Light_sources|light source]] at an [[Angle#Types_of_angles|oblique angle]] or almost [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the surface, provides information on the [[Topography|surface topography]] and relief of the artefact thus lit. It is widely used in the examination of works of art.

==Examination of paintings==
Using raking light, the effects of [[impasto]] and the surface texture of a [[painting]] are accentuated by the increased illumination of surfaces facing the light source and the exaggeration of [[shadows]] on surfaces facing away from the light source.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/raking-light |title=Glossary - raking light |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances raking light may help reveal [[pentimenti]] (changes in an artist's intention).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief |title=Raking light and relief |publisher=[[Tate]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[murals|wall paintings]], raking light helps show preparatory techniques such as [[Fresco|incisions]] in the plaster support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf |title=The Conservation of Wall Paintings |page=25 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">'''Reference intakes''' (RIs) are a means of communicating maximum recommended nutrient intake to the public. Reference Intakes replaced the term [[Guideline Daily Amount]] (GDA), although the principles behind both are the same. The major difference is that GDAs existed for men, women and children; there is only one set of RIs for an average adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference Intakes|url=http://www.foodlabel.org.uk/label/reference-intakes.aspx|publisher=Food and Drink Federation|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The values for the nutrients are all maximums, not targets. The information is for guidance only and should not be considered individual advice.

The change from GDA to RI on labels on pre-packaged food and drinks sold in the UK is due to [[Regulation (EU) 1169/2011]].&lt;ref&gt;EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New EU law on food information to consumers|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325234056/http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the EU Regulation is to harmonise across Europe the content, expression and presentation of the nutrition information given to consumers.

Since RIs are for an average adult, concerns have been raised by major retailers and manufacturers that they may face criticism for misrepresenting the contribution to the diet of products targeted at children, particularly given concerns around children’s diet and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|obesity levels]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adoption of Children’s Reference Intakes for food labelling purposes|url=http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|website=Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition|accessdate=7 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150423/http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIs can be combined with [[Traffic light rating system|traffic light labeling]] to make the information easily and rapidly understood. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Light Labelling|url=http://www.sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk/recipes-inspiration/healthier-eating/health-advice/health-labelling/multi-colour-traffic-light-labelling/|website=Traffic Light Labelling|publisher=J Sainsbury plc|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">A '''Requirement Diagram''' is a [[diagram]] specially used in [[SysML]] in which [[requirement]]s and the relations between them and their relationship to other model elements are shown as discussed in the following paragraphs.

== Derive Requirement Relationship ==

If a requirement is derived from an other requirement, their relation is named "Derive Requirement Relationship".

== Namespace Containment ==

If a requirement is contained in another requirement, their relation is named "Namespace Containment".

== Satisfy Relationship ==

If a requirement is satisfied by a design element, their relation is named "Satisfy Relationship".

== Copy Relationship ==

If a requirement is a copy of another requirement, their relation is named "Copy Relationship".

== Verify Relationship ==

If there exists a relation between a requirement and a test case verifying this requirement, their relation is named "Verify Relationship".

== Test Case ==

A Test Case is defined by a flow checking whether the system under consideration satisfies a requirement.

== Refine Relationship ==

If a requirement is refined by other requirements / model elements, the relation is named "Refine Relationship".

== Trace Relationship ==

If there exists a relation between a requirement and an arbitrary model element traced by this requirement, their relation is named "Trace Relationship".

:''See [[Rogation days]] for usage pertaining to the Christian calendar of the Western Church.''

In [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutional law]], '''''rogatio''''' is the term (from [[Latin]]  ''rogo'', "ask, place a question before") for a [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bill]] placed before an [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|Assembly of the People]] in ancient Rome. The ''rogatio'' procedure underscores the fact that the [[Roman senate]] could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or [[parliament]]arian body. Only [[SPQR|the People]] could pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157–158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVBNzYQy5vYC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22it+was+only+by+the+people+that+legislation+could+be+passed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20was%20only%20by%20the%20people%20that%20legislation%20could%20be%20passed%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (''rogatio legis''); the proposed laws themselves were ''leges rogatae''. A bill's proposer was its ''lator''; a supporter was an ''auctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''The Crowd in Rome'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (''promulgare rogationem'', that is, ''[[promulgation|promulgatio]]'') three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (''contiones''). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislator who introduced the bill asked ''Velitis iubeatis, Quirites?'' ("Citizens, are you going to approve and order?"&lt;ref&gt;Or, "Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?"&lt;/ref&gt;) and the people responded [[yea or nay]] without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the ''rogatio'' but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a [[tribune]] threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6–7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rogatio+OR+rogation+inauthor:Lintott&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio%20OR%20rogation%20inauthor%3ALintott&amp;f=false online.] Lintott believes [[Cicero]] exaggerates the extent to which the ''plebs'' could influence withdrawal.&lt;/ref&gt; If a bill was passed (''rogatio lata est''), it became a law (''[[Roman law|lex]]'') after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (''renuntiatio'') of the assembly's decision.

In the Early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the ''[[Conflict of the Orders#The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367-287 BC)|Lex Publilia Philonis]]'' in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two ''[[Roman censor|censores]]'' be a plebeian, this approval (''patrum [[auctoritas]]'') was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial [[populares|popularist]] measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. 
If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the [[Centuriate Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (''[[aerarium]] populi romani'') under the supervision of the [[quaestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, [[Cicero]] managed to [[Obstructionism|obstruct]] a ''rogatio Servilia'' by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune [[Servilius Rullus]], more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the ''[[comitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54–55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8iQQ7Xe2y-wC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.] Further discussion of the ''rogatio Servilia'' by [[Erich S. Gruen]], "The ''Plebs'' and the Army," in ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California Press, 1974, reprinted 1995), pp. 386–398, limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=axY9jQzzW9UC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:sediment basin EPA.jpg|thumb|right|'''Sediment basin''' installed on a construction site.]]

A '''sediment basin''' is a temporary pond built on a [[construction]] site to capture [[erosion|eroded]] or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the [[water quality]] of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay.  The [[sediment]]-laden soil settles in the pond before the runoff is discharged.  Sediment basins are typically used on construction sites of {{convert|5|acre|m2}} or more, where there is sufficient room.  They are often used in conjunction with [[erosion control]]s and other [[sediment control]] practices.  On smaller construction sites, where a basin is not practical, sediment traps may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/nonpoint/ero_man.htm "Florida Erosion and Sediment Control Inspector's Manual: Temporary Sediment Basin."] Section 4.26. Published 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essential sediment abundance is prevalent in the construction industry which gives insight to future endeavors.

On some construction projects, the sediment basin is cleaned out after the soil disturbance (earth-moving) phase of the project, and modified to function as a permanent [[stormwater]] management system for the completed site, either as a [[detention basin]] or a [[retention basin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.

== Sediment trap ==
[[Image: Sediment trap EPA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Sediment trap''' installed on a construction site.]]

A '''sediment trap''' is a temporary [[settling basin]] installed on a [[construction]] site to capture [[erosion|eroded]] or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the [[water quality]] of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay.  The trap is basically an [[Dike (construction)|embankment]] built along a waterway or low-lying area on the site.  They are typically installed at the perimeter of a site and above [[storm drain]] inlets, to keep [[sediment]] from entering the drainage system.  Sediment traps are commonly used on small construction sites, where a sediment basin is not practical. Sediment basins are typically used on construction sites of {{convert|5|acre|m2}} or more, where there is sufficient room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA. [http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-3.pdf "California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Sediment Trap."] Fact Sheet No. SE-3. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediment traps are installed before land disturbance (earth moving, [[land grading|grading]]) begins on a construction site.  The traps are often used in conjunction with [[erosion control]]s and other [[sediment control]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/nonpoint/ero_man.htm "Florida Erosion and Sediment Control Inspector's Manual: Temporary Sediment Trap."] Section 4.25. Published 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Seriality}}
'''Seriality''' or '''serial collectivity''' is a term that [[feminist]] scholar [[Iris Marion Young]] used to describe a reconceptualization of the category of [[woman]] in her 1994 essay ''Gender as Seriality''. [[Iris Marion Young|Young]] borrows the concept of [[seriality]] from [[Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', where he originally developed the idea to describe the relationship of individuals to social classes and the capitalist system of production and consumption. Understanding women as a ''series'', rather than a ''group'', entails the recognition that the category ''woman'' is not defined by any common biological or psychological characteristics; rather, individuals are positioned as ''woman'' by a set of material and immaterial social constructs that are the product of previous human actions.

==Group vs series==

A group, in [[Sartre]]'s definition, is a collection of people who self-consciously recognize themselves to be in a unified relationship with each other in the undertaking of a common project. A mutual acknowledgment of actively shared goals is the chief feature of a group. Guilds, reading groups, addiction support groups and animal cruelty prevention groups are all examples of groups.

Seriality, in contrast to the active effort of group being, describes a level of social existence that is habitually constrained and directed by existing circumstances and material conditions.
In a series, a collection of people are unified ''passively'' by objects, routines practices and habits around which their actions are oriented. For instance, people waiting in line for a bus, radio listeners, prison inmates and [[street theatre]] spectators are all examples of series. In each example, individuals are oriented toward the same goals by their response to existing conditions and structures in the environment, which are the collective legacy of human actions and decisions in the past. To illustrate concretely, the actions of people who stop and watch a street theatre performance may be shaped by existing conditions which constrain and permit their actions, such as the social acceptability of staging a performance on the street, the attractive costumes of the performers, high unemployment rates among actors, the existence of a public square, social expectations of their roles as spectators. Members of a series are anonymous and isolated, although not alone, often individuals in a series take into account the expected behavior of other members when pursuing their own actions – for instance, a bus rider may choose to avoid rush hour traffic. Members of a series are also interchangeable, although not identical, in relation to the objects that effect their serialized condition: from the point of view of a radio program broadcaster, one listener is interchangeable with another.

Groups and series are related in that groups arise out of a backdrop of seriality, and disperse to fall back into serialized conditions. In other words, groups are the product of individuals' response to shared conditions; Young gives the example of commuters at a bus stop who, when the bus fails to appear, organize themselves into a group to hail taxis, complain to the bus company, etc.

==Seriality as a solution to a conceptual dilemma in feminism==

Young's reconceptualization of ''women'' as a ''series'' is an attempt to provide a solution to the problems in [[feminist]] discourse surrounding the grouping of all [[women]] in a single category. This problem exists as a dilemma between two conflicting positions: &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Iris Marion|date=1994-04-01|title=Gender as Seriality: Thinking about Women as a Social Collective|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/494918|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=713–738|doi=10.1086/494918|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i) On one hand, it is important to be able to speak of [[women]] as a group for practical political reasons. Feminist politics is organized around this category of ''woman''; its existence as a movement fundamentally depends on this conceptualization. Additionally, the category of ''women'' is necessary in order to understand [[oppression]] and disadvantage as something that is systematically inflicted upon women (or any societal group) in a structured, [[institution]]alized process, as opposed to being a natural or unique condition. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ii) On the other hand, the category of ''woman'' is fraught with problems of essentialization, [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and exclusion. As [[Elizabeth Spelman]] points out, social categories are [[social construct|constructs]] that carry latent expressions of privilege and subordination; in this manner, feminist theories have often assumed the experience of white, [[middle-class]] [[heterosexual]] women as representative for all women, excluding less privileged points of view. [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] suggests that the category of ''woman'' creates the false impression of a coherent, homogeneous group, which leads to the mistake of assuming that all women are equally powerless and oppressed, rather than generating specific questions about oppression that can be empirically investigated. [[Judith Butler]] goes as far as to argue that the very act of defining such a gender category is what produces the [[normalization (sociology)|normalizations]] that privilege some viewpoints and exclude others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thinking of ''woman'' as a series solves these conceptual problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely [[essentialism|essentializing]] women as a group. An [[essentialist]] approach attempts to define ''woman'' by common biological characteristics – evidently false when one considers, for instance, [[transgender]], [[bigender]] or [[intersex]] people, for instance – or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.
A serial conception of ''woman'' also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely the fact that it does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.

==Other potential applications of seriality==

[[Iris Marion Young|Young]] has suggested that the concept of seriality might also be usefully applied to relationships of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[nationality]] as linkages which also result from historical conditions – such as the institution of [[slavery]] and projects of [[nation-building]] – which also function to limit and enable individuals' actions on the level of everyday life and habit.

{{Psychology sidebar|basic}}
'''Social psychology''' is the [[Science|scientific]] study of how people's [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[behavior]]s are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allport|first=G. W|year=1985|title=The historical background of social psychology|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Lindzey|editor2-first=E|editor2-last=Aronson|encyclopedia=The Handbook of Social Psychology|location=New York|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]}}p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, ''scientific'' refers to the [[empirical]] investigation using the [[scientific method]]. The terms ''thoughts'', ''feelings'', and ''behavior'' refer to [[psychology|psychological]] variables that can be measured in humans. The statement that others' presence may be ''imagined'' or ''implied'' suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television or following internalized [[norm (sociology)|cultural norms]]. Social psychologists typically explain [[human behavior]] as a result of the interaction of [[mind|mental states]] and social [[situationism (psychology)|situations]].

Social psychologists examine factors that cause behaviors to unfold in a given way in the presence of others. They study conditions under which certain behavior, actions, and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and goals are cognitively constructed and how these mental representations, in turn, influence our interactions with others.

Social psychology traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following [[World War II]] there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=W. H|year=1989|title=Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=15|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.15.080189.000245|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on "macro variables" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent than psychologists.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nevertheless, [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological approaches]] to psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area.

In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and [[Europe]]an social psychologists. As a generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see [[group dynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moscovici|first1=S|last2=Markova|first2=I|year=2006|title=The Making of Modern Social Psychology|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Although there were some older writings about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius),&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amber Haque|year=2004|title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=43|issue=4|pages=357–377|jstor=27512819|doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discipline of social psychology, as its modern-day definition, began in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. By that time, though, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation. Following the 18th century, those in the emerging field of social psychology were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} They attempted to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them. In order to do so, they believed that the [[scientific method]], an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gergen| first1= K. J. |year=1973| title= Social Psychology as History |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=26| issue= 2 | pages= 309–320| doi=10.1037/h0034436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study in this area was an experiment in 1898 by [[Norman Triplett]], on the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplett|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Triplett|year=1898|title=The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition|journal=[[American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=507–533|doi=10.2307/1412188|issue=4|jstor=1412188}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, many [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists, most notably [[Kurt Lewin]], fled to the United States from Nazi Germany. They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] schools that were dominant during that time, and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in [[perception]] and [[cognition]]. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] and [[communication in small groups|small group]] phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War II, social psychologists studied [[persuasion]] and [[propaganda]] for the U.S. military&lt;!-- Should a link to [[psychological warfare]] be in here? --&gt;. After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including [[gender]] issues and [[racial prejudice]].  Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments]] on [[obedience to authority]]. In the sixties, there was growing interest in new topics, such as [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Bystander effect|bystander intervention]], and [[aggression]]. By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis. There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gergen|first=Kenneth J|authorlink=Kenneth Gergen|year=1973|title=Social psychology as history|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=26|pages=309–320|doi=10.1037/h0034436|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the time when a radical [[situationism (psychology)|situationist]] approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/|title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s social psychology reached a more mature level. Two of the areas social psychology matured in were theories and methods.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"/&gt; Careful [[Research ethics|ethical standards]] now regulate research. [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralistic]] and [[multicultural]] perspectives have emerged. Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena, but [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[social cognition]], and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health, education, law, and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H.R. (2017). ''Social psychology'' (10th edition). Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrapersonal phenomena==

===Attitudes===
{{Main|Attitude (psychology)}}
In social psychology, attitudes are defined as learned, global evaluations of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.&lt;ref name=Sison&gt;{{cite book|last=Sison|first=Erick Louie. A|year=2008|title=The dynamics of persuasion|location=New York|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2012}} Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bem|first=D|year=1970|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and human affairs|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.

Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.

In recent times, research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitude measures and "implicit" or unconscious attitudes. For example, experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Allen|date=September 2001|title=Relations among the Implicit Association Test, Discriminatory Behavior, and Explicit Measures of Racial Attitudes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103100914707|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=435–442|via=|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Implicit Association Test]] have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses reveal equal mindedness. One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions, whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=J. D|last2=Skowronski|first2=J. J|year=2007|title=Improving the Predictive Validity of the Implicit Association Test|journal=[[North American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=53–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first advanced by [[Abraham Tesser]] in 1983, is that strong likes and dislikes are ingrained in our [[genetic make-up]]. Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn physical, sensory, and [[cognitive skill]]s, temperament, and [[personality traits]]. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; the attitude that our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;ref name=Kassin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, NY|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|edition=7|first2=Steven|last2=Fein|first3=Hazel Rose|last3=Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[interpersonal attraction]], social perception, and [[prejudice]].

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on "appeals" rather than strong pressure or [[coercion]]. Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process; these are normally presented in five major categories: ''who'' said ''what'' to ''whom'' and ''how''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology, Tenth Edition|last=Myers|first=David|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8|location=New York|pages=234–253|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[Orator|Communicator]], including [[credibility]], [[expert]]ise, [[trustworthiness]], and [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].
# The [[Message]], including varying degrees of [[reason]], [[emotion]] (such as fear), one-sided or two sided arguments, and other types of informational content.
# The [[Audience]], including a variety of [[demographics]], [[personality trait]]s, and [[preference]]s.
# The Channel or [[Media (communication)|Medium]], including the printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactions.
# The Context, including the environment, group dynamics, and preamble to the message.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Are you saying that these act as a preamble to the message, or that anything said prior to the message is a part of the context?}}

[[dual process theory|Dual-process theories]] of persuasion (such as the [[elaboration likelihood model]]) maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not last as long as persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.

===Social cognition===
{{Main|Social cognition}}
Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Much research rests on the assertion that people think about (other) people differently from non-social targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B|title=Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others|year=2005|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2|series=Texts in Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;dq=%22Social+Cognition%22+Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobbs|first1=Davis|title=The Gregarious Brain| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 July 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/magazine/08sociability-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Person perception]] is the study of how people form impressions of others. The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as [[interpersonal perception]].

A major research topic in social cognition is attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisenzein|first1=Rainer|last2=Rudolph|first2=Udo|title=50 Years of Attribution Research|journal= [[Social Psychology (journal)|Social Psychology]] |volume=39|issue=3|year=2008|pages=123–124|issn=1864-9335|doi=10.1027/1864-9335.39.3.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of others. One element of attribution ascribes the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors. An ''internal'', or dispositional, attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality, disposition, character or ability. An ''external'', or situational, attribution involves situational elements, such as the weather.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1&gt;
{{cite book

|publisher= [[Prentice Hall]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}  A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors (whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Finally, we also attribute causes of behavior to either controllable or uncontrollable factors: how much control one has over the situation at hand.

Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the [[fundamental attribution error]] is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;
{{cite book
|author=David G. Myers
|title=Psychology
|edition=8
|publisher=Worth
|year=2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|724}} The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|107}} The [[self-serving bias]] is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|109}} Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by [[just-world phenomenon|believing in a just world]], blaming victims for their suffering, and making [[defensive attribution hypothesis|defensive attributions]], which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|111}} Researchers have found that mildly [[Clinical depression|depressed]] individuals often lack this bias and actually have [[depressive realism|more realistic perceptions of reality]] (as measured by the opinions of others).&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Andrews2001.pdf |pmid=11182572|year=2001|last1=Andrews|first1=P. W.|title=The psychology of social chess and the evolution of attribution mechanisms: Explaining the fundamental attribution error|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=22|issue=1|pages=11–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heuristics in judgment and decision making|Heuristic]]s are cognitive short cuts. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The [[availability heuristic]] occurs when people estimate the [[probability]] of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias.{{Contradict-inline|article=Availability heuristic|date=March 2012}} The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|63}} Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The [[hindsight bias]] is a [[Confabulation|false memory]] of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The [[confirmation bias]] is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. [[schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate [[automaticity|automatically]] and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Correll|first1=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|title=The police officer's dilemma: Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=83|issue=6|year=2002|pages=1,314–1,329|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.7243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of schema is actually a [[stereotype]], a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an [[ultimate attribution error]]). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior ([[discrimination]]). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as ''scripts''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Self-concept===
{{Main|Self-concept}}
Self-concept is a term referring to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called [[self-schema]]s&amp;nbsp;– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one "self," who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the "self" who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These "selves" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper "self" to process and react on it. If a "self" is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a "self" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered ''schematics'' with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events&amp;nbsp;– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach&amp;nbsp;– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are ''a-schematic'' on that attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Hazel|title=Self-Schemata and Processing Information|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1977|volume=35|issue=2|pages=63–78|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.2.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our [[attention]]. Whether one is mentally focused on a [[memory]], a [[conversation]], a foul smell, the song that is stuck in one's head, or this sentence, [[consciousness]] is like a spotlight. This [[:wikt:spotlight|spotlight]] can shine on only one object at a time, but it can switch rapidly from one object to another and process the information out of [[awareness]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Process which information? And consciousness implies awareness...}} In this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The self's ABCs are affect, behavior, and cognition. An affective (or emotional) question: How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity? A behavioral question: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? A [[cognitive]] question: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Affective forecasting]] is the process of [[prediction|predicting]] how one would feel in response to future [[emotional]] events. Studies done by [[Timothy Wilson]] and [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] in 2003 have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D|authorlink1=Timothy Wilson|first2=Daniel T|last2=Gilbert|title=Affective Forecasting|journal= Advances in Experimental Psychology |year=2003|issue=35|pages=345–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bem|first=Daryl J|title=Self Perception Theory|year=1972|volume=6|pages=1–62|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60024-6|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=978-0-12-015206-3|chapter=Self-Perception Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]]'s 1954 [[social comparison theory]] is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|authorlink=Leon Festinger|title=A theory of social comparison process|journal= [[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]] |year=1954|volume=7|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[facial feedback hypothesis]]: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The fields of social psychology and [[Personality psychology|personality]] have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the [[self-concept]], which is a person's understanding of their self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the ''self-schema'', and an evaluative component, the ''self-esteem''. The need to maintain a healthy [[self-esteem]] is recognized as a central human [[motivation]] in the field of social psychology.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Self-efficacy]] beliefs are associated with the self-schema. These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful. Social psychologists also study such self-related processes as [[self-control]] and [[impression management|self-presentation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

People develop their self-concepts by varied means, including [[introspection]], feedback from others, [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]], and social comparison. By comparing themselves to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem. Social comparisons can be either "upward" or "downward," that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology|last=Baron|first=Robert A.|last2=Branscombe|first2=Nyla R.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-20558-5|location=United States of America|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as [[overjustification]]. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L|last2=Koestner|first2=R|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M|year=2001|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=71|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important exception to [[reinforcement]] theory.

==Interpersonal phenomena==

===Social influence===
{{Main|Social influence}}
Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: [[conformity]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.

The first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.&lt;ref name="Aaronson2"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2&gt;

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|left|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was (objectively) wrong.]]

The second major area of social influence research is compliance. [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. The [[foot-in-the-door technique]] is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the [[bait and switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B|year=2000|title=Influence: Science and Practice|publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third major form of social influence is [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the [[Milgram study]], wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

An unusual kind of social influence is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the [[stock market]], if it is widely believed that a [[stock market crash|crash]] is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Group dynamics===
{{Main|Group dynamics}}
A [[Social group|group]] can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by [[interpersonal relationship|social relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.R|year=2006|title=Group dynamics|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Thomson-Wadworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from [[wikt:aggregate|aggregates]]:
* [[Norm (sociology)|Norms]]: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g. saying thank you, shaking hands.
* [[Role]]s: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g. the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
* [[Interpersonal relationship|Relations]]: Patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status, e.g., leaders, popular people.
Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups. People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their [[social identity]]. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tajfel|first1=H|last2=Turner|first2=J.C|year=1986|title=The social identity theory of intergroup behavior|editor1-first=S|editor1-last=Worchel|editor2-first=W.G|editor2-last=Austin|encyclopedia=Psychology of Intergroup Relations|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=Nelson-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society.&lt;ref name=Haidt2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haidt | first = Jonathan  | last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Evan | last3 = Hom | first3 = Holly | year = 2003 | title = Differentiating Diversities: Moral Diversity Is Not Like Other Kinds | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue =1 | pages = 1–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb02071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and [[group polarization]] encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.

Groups often moderate and improve [[decision making]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. A number of group biases, however, can interfere with effective decision making. For example, group polarization, formerly known as the "risky shift," occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussion. More problematic is the phenomenon of [[groupthink]]. This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members. Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader. Janis offered the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] as a historical case of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janis|first=I.L|year=1972|title=Victims of Groupthink|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups also affect performance and [[productivity]]. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the ''[[dominant response]]''{{'}}s likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In contrast, [[social loafing]] is the tendency of individuals to [[slacker|slack off]] when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/05/social-loafing-when-groups-are-bad-for-productivity.php PsyBlog], "Social Loafing: when groups are bad for productivity," 19 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}

Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of [[crowd]]s. An important concept in this area is [[deindividuation]], a reduced state of [[self-awareness]] that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron, R.S., &amp; Kerr, N. L.|title=Group Process, Group Decision, Group Action|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In the online domain, e.g., see Rosen, L. D., Cheever, N. A., &amp; Carrier, L. M. (2015) The Wiley Handbook of Psychology, Technology and Society. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soc-psy diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Social psychologists study interactions within [[social group|groups]], and between both groups and individuals.]]

===Interpersonal attraction===
{{Main|Interpersonal attraction}}
A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction. This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in [[love]]. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists, but many still continue to experiment and do research to find out more.  One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are.  The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more probable an attraction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, D. (1961). ''[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''. ''62''. pp. 713–715. "Thus Interpersonal attraction and attitude similarity have a direct correlation.  More so than those with dissimilar attitudes and views, who tend to not be as successful in the attraction department."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of [[limerence|passion]]. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from ''passionate'' to ''companionate''. [[Robert Sternberg]] has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|year=1986|title=A Triangular Theory of Love|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.

According to [[social exchange theory]], relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. If one partner's costs begin to outweigh their benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the [[minimax principle]] proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not [[zero-sum game]]s). With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Research==

===Methods===
Social psychology is an [[empirical]] science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field. Careful attention to sampling, research design, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''. Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

[[Experiment|Experimental methods]] involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variable. An example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent videogames, and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during free-play period. A valid experiment is controlled and uses [[random assignment]].

[[Correlation|Correlational methods]] examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variables. For example, one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school. Note that this study would ''not'' prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.

[[Observation|Observational methods]] are purely descriptive and include [[naturalistic observation]], "contrived" observation, participant observation, and archival analysis. These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon. An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed.

Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation. Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] in order to examine the effect on a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in [[internal validity]], meaning that they are free from the influence of [[confounding]] or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in [[external validity]], or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control ([[internal validity]]) and being able to generalize to the population ([[external validity]]).

Because it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of persons from the wider [[population]]. Social psychologists frequently use [[Statistical survey|survey]] research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]] to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like [[structural equation modeling]] are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some psychologists, including Dr. [[David O. Sears]], have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sears|first=David|year=1986|title=College Sophomores in the Laboratory: Influences of a Narrow Data Base on Social Psychology's View of Human Nature|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–530|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which method has been chosen to be used, the results are of high importance. Results need to be used to evaluate the hypothesis of the research that is done. These results should either confirm or reject the original hypothesis that was predicted.There are two different types of testing social psychologists use in order to test their results. Statistics and probability testing define a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding that can be as low as 5% or less, likely to be due to chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/ | title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproducibility|Replications]] are important, to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance, or some feature of a particular sample. [[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are a hazard in the field.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Simmons| first1 = Joseph|first2 = Leif|last2=Nelson|first3=Uri|last3=Simonsohn| title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = [[Psychological Science]]| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate =29 January 2012| pmid=22006061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize [[deception]] to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What about concealment of the existence or purpose of observation?}}

The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., [[role-playing]]) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the [[Milgram experiment]] and [[Stanford prison experiment]]), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an [[ethics|ethical]] review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or [[Institutional Review Board]]. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.

Furthermore, a process of [[informed consent]] is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=How, if there will be portions of the experiment that involve deception?}} and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A [[debriefing]] is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=And what would the response be if they weren't? I would assume offering of psychological counseling...}} Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/undergrad/ptacc/irb-college-guide.pdf|title=THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB): A COLLEGE PLANNING GUIDE|last=COMMITTEE ON ASSOCIATE AND BACCALAUREATE EDUCATION|date=2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication crisis===
{{main|replication crisis}}
Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a "[[replication crisis]]" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate.  Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of science.  However, several factors have combined to put social psychology at the center of the current controversy.

Firstly, [[questionable research practices]] (QRP) have been identified as common in the field.  Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"/&gt;  Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|title=Questionable Research Practices Surprisingly Common|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the [[Daryl Bem#.22Feeling the Future.22 controversy|feeling the future controversy]] has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.

Secondly, social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research.  Most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology: Even legitimate researchers cut corners, some admit|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Christopher|last=Shea|date=13 November 2011|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allegations against others.  However, most scholars acknowledge that fraud is, perhaps, the lesser contribution to replication crises.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Third, several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example, the scientific journal ''[[Society for Judgment and Decision Making#Publications and journal|Judgment and Decision Making]]'' has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the [[unconscious thought theory]]. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.

These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by [[Daniel Kahneman]]. Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate. A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.is/20140530230728/http://www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=3f8268e0307f4036906c158b1667c57a&amp;pi=0 | title=Social Psychology - Volume 45, Number 3 / 2014 - Hogrefe Publishing| date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 special edition of the journal ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6.toc|title=Table of Contents: Volume 7, Issue 6, November 2012|work=Perspectives on Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientific.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/28/psychology-replication-drive-methods-bullying|title=Psychology's replication drive: it's not about you|journal=The Guardian|first=Pete|last=Etchells|date=28 May 2014|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/|title=Power of Suggestion|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Tom|last=Bartlett|date=30 January 2013|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous experiments===
[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Milgram experiment]]: The experimenter (E) persuades the participant (T) to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant (L), who is actually an actor. Many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor.]]

The [[Asch conformity experiments]] demonstrated the power of conformity in small groups with a line length estimation task that was designed to be extremely easy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.E|year=1955|title=Opinions and social pressure|journal=[[Scientific American]]|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, who had been instructed to provide incorrect answers, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong. Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.  Additional manipulations to the experiment showed participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform, but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of incorrect individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grew.  Participants with three incorrect opponents made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect opponents made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Muzafer Sherif]]'s  [[Robbers' Cave Experiment]] divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emerge. Sherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory, because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition over resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherif|first=Muzafer|authorlink=Muzafer Sherif|year=1954|title=Experiments in group conflict|journal=Scientific American|volume=195|issue=5|pages=54–58|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1156-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inducing cooperation and [[superordinate goals]] later reversed this effect.

In [[Leon Festinger]]'s cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|title=Cognitive Dissonance Theory - Simply Psychology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=J.M|year=1959|title= Cognitive consequences of forced compliance|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|volume=58|pages=203–211|doi=10.1037/h0041593|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.497.2779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the [[Milgram experiment]], which studied how far people would go to obey an [[authority]] figure. Following the events of [[The Holocaust]] in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley|last=Milgram|year=1975|title=Obedience to authority|publisher=Harper and Bros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]]'s [[Bobo doll experiment]] demonstrated how aggression is learned by [[imitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Ross|first2=D|last3=Ross|first3=S.A|year=1961|title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of studies fueled debates regarding [[media violence]] which continue to be waged among scholars.

In the [[Stanford prison study]], by [[Philip Zimbardo]], a simulated exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In just a few days, the "guards" became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney|first1=C|last2=Banks|first2=W.C|last3=Zimbardo|first3=Philip G|year=1973|title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study.

'''Steatosis''', also called '''fatty change''', is the process describing the abnormal retention of [[lipid]]s within a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and elimination of [[triglyceride]] fat. Excess lipid accumulates in [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s that displace the [[cytoplasm]]. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the condition is known as macrovesicular steatosis; otherwise, the condition is known as microvesicular steatosis. While not particularly detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst.

The risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and include [[diabetes mellitus]],&lt;ref name="araya"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Araya Q AV, etal | title=Glucose tolerance alterations and frequency of metabolic syndrome among patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease| journal=Rev Med Chil.| year=2006| volume=134| issue=9| pages=1092–1098 | pmid=17167710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali ES, Hua J, Wilson CH, Tallis GA, Zhou FH, Rychkov GY, Barritt GJ |title=The glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue exendin-4 reverses impaired intracellular Ca2+ signalling in steatotic hepatocytes |journal=BBA − Molecular Cell Research |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.05.006 |pmid=27178543 |volume=1863 |year=2016 |pages=2135–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; protein malnutrition,&lt;ref name="conde"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Conde Martel A, etal | title=Liver changes in protein malnutrition.

== Pathogenesis ==
No single mechanism leading to steatosis exists; rather, a varied multitude of pathologies disrupt normal lipid movement through the cell and cause accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson CH, Ali ES, Scrimgeour N, Martin AM, Hua J, Tallis GA, Rychkov GY, Barritt GJ |title=Steatosis inhibits liver cell store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry and reduces ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=466 |issue=2 |pages=379–90 |year=2015 |pmid=25422863 |doi=10.1042/BJ20140881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms can be separated on whether they ultimately cause an oversupply of lipid which can not be removed quickly enough (i.e., too much in), or whether they cause a failure in lipid breakdown (i.e., not enough used).

Failure of lipid metabolism can also lead to the mechanisms which would normally utilise or remove lipids becoming impaired, resulting in the accumulation of unused lipids in the cell. Certain toxins, such as alcohols, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[aspirin]], and [[diphtheria toxin]], interfere with cellular machinery involved in lipid metabolism. In those with [[Gaucher's disease]], the [[lysosome]]s fail to degrade lipids and steatosis arises from the accumulation of [[glycolipid]]s. Protein malnutrition, such as that seen in [[kwashiorkor]], results in a lack of precursor [[Apolipoprotein|apoproteins]] within the cell, therefore unused lipids which would normally participate in [[lipoprotein]] synthesis begin to accumulate.

=== Macrovesicular steatosis ===
Macrovesicular steatosis is the more common form of fatty degeneration and may be caused by oversupply of lipids due to obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2938852 | pmid=20857857 | volume=33 | title=Metabolic disease in sleep disordered breathing: puberty! puberty! | year=2010 | journal=Sleep | pages=1133–4 |vauthors=Bhattacharjee R, Gozal D }}&lt;/ref&gt; insulin resistance, or [[alcoholism]]. Nutrient malnutrition may also cause the mobilisation of fat from [[adipocyte]]s and create a local oversupply in the liver where lipid metabolism occurs. Excess alcohol over a long period of time can induce steatosis. The breakdown of large amounts of [[ethanol]] in alcoholic drinks produces large amounts of chemical energy [[NADH]], signalling to the cell to inhibit the breakdown of [[fatty acid]]s (which also produces energy) and simultaneously increase the synthesis of [[fatty acid]]s. This "false sense of energy" results in more lipid being created than is needed.

=== Microvesicular steatosis ===
Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by small intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles (liposomes) which accumulate in the cell. Common causes are [[tetracyclines]], acute fatty liver of pregnancy, [[Reye's syndrome]], and [[hepatitis C]].

== Histology ==
[[histology|Histologically]], steatosis is physically apparent as lipid within membrane bound [[liposome]]s of [[parenchyma]]l cells.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt; When this tissue is [[Staining|fixed and stained]] to be better viewed under a microscope, the lipid is usually dissolved by the solvents used to prepare the sample. As such, samples prepared this way will appear to have empty holes (or vacuoles) within the cells where the lipid has been cleared. Special lipid stains, such as [[Sudan stain]]s and [[Staining#Osmium tetroxide|osmium tetroxide]] are able to retain and show up lipid droplets, hence more conclusively indicating the presence of lipids. Other intracellular accumulations, such as water or [[glycogen]], can also appear as clear vacuoles, therefore it becomes necessary to use stains to better decide what is accumulating.

Grossly, steatosis causes organ enlargement and lightening in colour.&lt;ref name="robspath"/&gt; This is due to the high lipid content increasing the organ's volume and becoming visible to the unaided eye. In severe cases, the organ may become vastly enlarged, greasy, and yellow in appearance.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Radiography ==
[[File:Liversteatosis.png|thumb|Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on CT]]
On [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT), the increased fat component will decrease the density of the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically the density of the spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, there is a difference between the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker.&lt;ref name="Helms 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Helms, Clyde A. |author2=Brant, William E. |title=Fundamentals of diagnostic radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Phila |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On ultrasound, fat is more [[echogenicity|echogenic]] (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign.
[[File:MRI Liversteatosis.jpg|thumb|Upright=4.0|Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on MRI. Multiecho MR sequence in a healthy liver (top row) and a liver with severe steatosis (bottom row) are shown. In the healthy liver, the signal does not vary much in the different echoes. In 
the steatotic liver, the signal varies greatly between in and out phase echoes. Algebraic combination of these images can be used to accurately quantify liver steatosis.]]
On [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]], multiecho gradient echo images can be used to determine the percent fat fraction of the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21928307|title=Quantitative assessment of liver fat with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy|year=2011 | doi=10.1002/jmri.22580|volume=34|author=Reeder SB, Cruite I, Hamilton G, Sirlin CB|journal=J Magn Reson Imaging|pages=729–49|pmc=3177109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different resonance frequencies between water and fat make this technique very sensitive and accurate. Acquisition of echoes in "in phase" and "out phase" conditions (pertaining to the relative phases of the fat and water proton contingents) enables to obtain a signal proportional to the water and fat contingent, or a signal proportional to the water minus the fat contingent. These signal intensities are then algebraically combined into a percent fat. More recent techniques take into account experimental noise, signal decay and spectroscopic properties of fat. Numerous validation studies have demonstrated excellent correlations between the steatosis level quantified at MRI and the steatosis levels semi-quantitavely and quantitatively determined on liver biopsies (reference methods). Several MRI vendors offer automated calculation of percent fat with acquisition sequences no longer than a single breath hold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7231">The '''strong programme''' or '''strong sociology''' is a variety of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] (SSK) particularly associated with [[David Bloor]],&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor,  "The strengths of the strong programme." ''Scientific rationality: The sociological turn'' (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKenzie, "Notes on the science and social relations debate." ''Capital &amp; Class'' 5.2 (1981): 47-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Henry (historian)|John Henry]]. The strong programme's influence on [[Science and Technology Studies]] is credited as being unparalleled ([[Bruno Latour|Latour]] 1999). The largely [[Edinburgh]]-based school of thought has illustrated how the existence of a [[scientific community]], bound together by allegiance to a shared [[paradigm]], is a prerequisite for normal scientific activity.

The strong programme is a reaction against "weak" sociologies of science, which restricted the application of sociology to "failed" or "false" theories, such as [[phrenology]]. Failed theories would be explained by citing the researchers' biases, such as covert political or economic interests. Sociology would be only marginally relevant to successful theories, which succeeded because they had revealed a true fact of nature. The strong programme proposed that both "true" and "false" scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest. All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.

==Characteristics==
As formulated by David Bloor,&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, ''Knowledge and Social Imagery'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; the strong programme has four indispensable components:
#''Causality'':  it examines the conditions (psychological, social, and cultural) that bring about claims to a certain kind of knowledge.
#''Impartiality'':  it examines successful as well as unsuccessful knowledge claims.
#''Symmetry'': the same types of explanations are used for successful and unsuccessful knowledge claims alike.
#''Reflexivity'': it must be applicable to sociology itself.

==History==
Because the strong programme originated at the 'Science Studies Unit,' [[University of Edinburgh]], it is sometimes termed the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Edinburgh School]]. However, there is also a Bath School associated with [[Harry Collins]] that makes similar proposals. In contrast to the Edinburgh School, which emphasizes historical approaches, the Bath School emphasizes microsocial studies of laboratories and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." ''Social studies of science'' (1981): 3-10. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/284733 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bath school, however, does depart from the strong programme on some fundamental issues. In the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT) approach developed by Collins' student [[Trevor Pinch]], as well as by the Dutch sociologist [[Wiebe Bijker]], the strong programme was extended to technology. There are SSK-influenced scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] programs throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. ''The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology'' (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In order to study scientific knowledge from a sociological point of view, the strong programme has adhered to a form of radical [[relativism]]. In other words, it argues that – in the social study of institutionalised beliefs about "truth" – it would be unwise to use "truth" as an explanatory resource. That would be to include the answer as part of the question (Barnes 1992), not to mention a thoroughly "[[Whig history|whiggish]]" approach towards the study of history – that is an approach seeing human history as an inevitable march towards truth and enlightenment.  [[Alan Sokal]] has criticised radical relativism as part of the [[science wars]], on the basis that such an understanding will lead inevitably towards [[solipsism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Markus Seidel attacks the main arguments – [[underdetermination]] and norm-circularity – provided by Strong Programme proponents for their relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Seidel ''Epistemic Relativism. A Constructive Critique'', 2014, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Strong programme scholars insist that their approach has been misunderstood by such a criticism and that its adherence to radical relativism is strictly methodological.

'''Water cooling''' is a method of [[heat]] removal from components and industrial equipment. [[Water]] may be a more efficient heat transfer fluid where [[air cooling]] is ineffective. In most occupied climates water offers the [[thermal conductivity]] advantages of a liquid with unusually high [[specific heat capacity]] and the option of evaporative cooling. Low cost often allows rejection as waste after a single use, but recycling coolant loops may be pressurized to eliminate evaporative loss and offer greater portability and improved cleanliness. Unpressurized recycling coolant loops using evaporative cooling require a blowdown waste stream to remove impurities concentrated by evaporation. Disadvantages of water cooling systems include accelerated [[corrosion]] and maintenance requirements to prevent heat transfer reductions from [[biofouling]] or [[Limescale|scale]] formation. Chemical additives to reduce these disadvantages may introduce toxicity to wastewater. Water cooling is commonly used for cooling [[automobile]] [[internal combustion engine]]s and large industrial facilities such as [[nuclear power plant|nuclear]] and [[steam electric power plant]]s, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[electrical generator|generators]], [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]] and [[chemical plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

The main mechanism for water cooling is [[convective heat transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.che.ufl.edu/unit-ops-lab/experiments/CT/2+CT-Theory.pdf|title=Chemical Engineering at the University of Florida|author=|date=|website=www.che.ufl.edu|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Water is inexpensive, [[non-toxic]], and available over most of the earth's surface. Liquid cooling offers higher thermal conductivity than air cooling. Water has unusually high specific heat capacity among commonly available liquids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure allowing efficient heat transfer over distance with low rates of mass transfer. Cooling water may be recycled through a ''recirculating'' system or used in a single pass ''once-through cooling'' (OTC) system. Water's high [[enthalpy of vaporization]] allows the option of efficient evaporative cooling to remove waste heat in [[cooling tower]]s or [[cooling pond]]s.{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=1-1, 1-2}} Recirculating systems may be ''open'' if they rely upon evaporative cooling or ''closed'' if heat removal is accomplished in [[heat exchanger]]s with negligible evaporative loss. A heat exchanger or [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] may separate ''non-contact cooling water'' from a [[fluid]] being cooled,{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-1, 38-4, 38-7 &amp; 38-8 }} or ''contact cooling water'' may directly impinge on items like [[saw]] blades where [[phase (matter)|phase]] difference allows easy separation.  Environmental regulations emphasize the reduced concentrations of waste products in non-contact cooling water.{{sfnp|King|1995|pages=143, 439}}

=== Ships and boats ===
Water is an ideal cooling medium for vessels as they are constantly surrounded by water that generally remains at a low temperature throughout the year. Systems operating with sea water need to be manufactured from [[cupronickel]], [[bronze]], [[titanium]] or similarly corrosion-resistant materials. Water containing sediment may require velocity restrictions through piping to avoid erosion at high velocity or blockage by settling at low velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Thermex [http://thermex.co.uk/news/blog/160-what-is-a-heat-exchanger "Heat Exchanger FAQ Page"] 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Water accelerates corrosion of metal parts and is a favorable medium for biological growth. Dissolved minerals in natural water supplies are concentrated by evaporation to leave deposits called scale. Cooling water often requires addition of chemicals to minimize corrosion and insulating deposits of scale and biofouling.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}}

=== Biofouling ===
Water is a favorable environment for many life forms. Flow characteristics of recirculating cooling water systems encourage colonization by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms to use the circulating supply of food, [[oxygen]] and nutrients.{{sfnp|Reid|1961|pages=267–268}} Temperatures may become high enough to support [[thermophilic]] populations. Biofouling of heat exchange surfaces can reduce heat transfer rates of the cooling system; and biofouling of cooling towers can alter flow distribution to reduce evaporative cooling rates.  Biofouling may also create differential oxygen concentrations increasing corrosion rates.  OTC and open recirculating systems are most susceptible to biofouling.  Biofouling may be inhibited by temporary habitat modifications.  Temperature differences may discourage establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities; and intentional short term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations.  [[Biocide]]s have been commonly used to control biofouling where sustained facility operation is required.{{sfn|Betz|page=202}}

=== Chemistry ===
Water contains varying amounts of impurities from contact with the atmosphere, soil, and containers. Manufactured metals tend to revert to ores via electrochemical reactions of corrosion.  Water can accelerate corrosion as both an electrical conductor and solvent for metal ions and oxygen.  Corrosion reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}} Preservation of machinery in the presence of hot water has been improved by addition of [[corrosion inhibitor]]s including [[zinc]], [[chromates]] and [[phosphates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmasian-Ettefagh|first=Ali|date=2010|title=Corrosion Inhibition of Carbon Steel in Cooling Water|url=|journal=MATERIALS PERFORMANCE|volume=49|pages=60-65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahgoub|first=F.M.|last2=Abdel-Nabey|first2=B.A.|last3=El-Samadisy|first3=Y.A.|date=March 2010|title=Adopting a multipurpose inhibitor to control corrosion of ferrous alloys in cooling water systems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.10.028|journal=Materials Chemistry and Physics|volume=120|issue=1|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.10.028|issn=0254-0584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two have toxicity concerns;{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-20, 38-21}} and the last has been associated with [[eutrophication]].{{sfnp|Goldman|Horne|1983|pages=153, 160}} Residual concentrations of biocides and corrosion inhibitors are of potential concern for OTC and blowdown from open recirculating systems.{{sfn|Betz|page=215}} With the exception of machines with short design life, closed recirculating systems require periodic cooling water treatment or replacement raising similar concern about ultimate disposal of cooling water containing chemicals used with environmental safety assumptions of a closed system.

==== Solids ====
[[Total dissolved solids]] or TDS (sometimes called filtrable residue) is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] water is [[evaporate]]d.{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 89-98 }} [[Salinity]] measures water [[density]] or [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] changes caused by dissolved materials.{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 99-100 }}  Probability of scale formation increases with increasing total dissolved solids.  Solids commonly associated with scale formation are [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] [[carbonate]] and [[sulfate]].  Corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity, but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}}

==== Hydrogen ====
Water ionizes into [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[cation]]s and [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) [[anion]]s.  The concentration of ionized [[hydrogen]] (as protonated water) is expressed as [[pH]].{{sfnp|Franson|1975|pp= 406-407 }} Low pH values increase rate of corrosion while high pH values encourage scale formation.  [[Amphoterism]] is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but [[aluminum]] corrosion rates increase with pH values above 9.  [[Galvanic corrosion]] may be severe in water systems with [[copper]] and aluminum components.  [[Acid]] may be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the pH decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.{{sfn|Betz|pages=191–194}}

==== Phosphorus and chromium ====
Concentrations of [[polyphosphate]]s or [[phosphonate]]s with zinc and chromates or similar compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so a film of [[Iron(III) oxide#Gamma phase|gamma iron oxide]] and [[zinc phosphate]] may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points.{{sfn|Betz|pages=198–199}} These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and [[phosphorus]] compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water.  Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors.{{sfnp|Kemmer|1979|pages=38-20, 38-21}}  Blowdown may also contain [[chromium]] leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with [[chromated copper arsenate]].

==== Oxygen ====
Some groundwater contains very little oxygen when pumped from wells, but most natural water supplies include dissolved oxygen.  Corrosion increases with increasing oxygen concentrations.{{sfn|Betz|pages=183–184}} Dissolved oxygen approaches saturation levels in cooling towers.  Dissolved oxygen is desirable in blowdown or OTC water being returned to natural aquatic environments.

==== Biocides ====
[[Chlorine]] may be added in the form of [[hypochlorite]] to decrease biofouling, but is later reduced to [[chloride]] to minimize toxicity of blowdown or OTC water returned to natural aquatic environments.  Hypochlorite is increasingly destructive to wooden cooling towers as pH increases.  Chlorinated phenols have been used as biocides or leached from preserved wood in cooling towers.  Both hypochlorite and [[pentachlorophenol]] have reduced effectiveness at pH values greater than 8.{{sfn|Betz|pages=203–209}}  Non-oxidizing biocides may be more difficult to detoxify prior to release of blowdown or OTC water to natural aquatic environments.

== Steam power stations ==
[[File:Indian Point.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian Point Energy Center]]. Over a billion fish eggs and larvae are killed in its cooling system each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:KKP Einlauf.jpg|thumb|Cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant]]
Few other cooling applications approach the large volumes of water required to condense low pressure steam at [[power station]]s. Many facilities, particularly electric power plants, use millions of gallons of water per day for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2010).
[http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/partial-list-of-facilities-subject-to-cwa-316b_2010.pdf "Partial List of Facilities Subject to Clean Water Act 316(b)."]&lt;/ref&gt; Water cooling on this scale may alter natural water environments and create new environments. [[Thermal pollution]] of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is a consideration when siting such plants. Water returned to aquatic environments at temperatures higher than the ambient receiving water modify aquatic habitat by increasing biochemical reaction rates and decreasing oxygen saturation capacity of the habitat. Temperature increases initially favor a population shift from species requiring the high-oxygen concentration of cold water to those enjoying advantages of increased metabolic rates in warm water.{{sfnp|Reid|1961|pages=267–268}}

OTC systems may be used on very large rivers or at [[coastal]] and [[estuarine]] sites. These power stations put the [[waste heat]] into the river or coastal water. These OTC systems thus rely upon a good supply of river water or seawater for their cooling needs. Such facilities are built with intake structures designed to pump in large volumes of water at a high rate of flow. These structures tend to also pull in large numbers of fish and other aquatic organisms, which are killed or injured on the [[fish screen|intake screens]].&lt;ref name="EPA-intakes" &gt;EPA (2014). [http://www2.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes "Cooling Water Intakes."]&lt;/ref&gt; Large flow rates may immobilize slow-swimming organisms including [[fish]] and [[shrimp]] on [[fish screen|screens]] protecting the small bore tubes of the heat exchangers from blockage.  High temperatures or pump turbulence and shear may kill or disable smaller organisms passing the screens entrained with the cooling water.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2004).

=== Cooling towers ===
[[File:A Marley industrial cooling tower.jpg|thumb|right|A Marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower]]
{{see also|Cooling tower}}
As an alternative to OTC, industrial cooling towers may use river water, coastal water ([[seawater]]), or well water as their source of fresh cooling water. The large mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft cooling towers in industrial plants continuously circulate cooling water through heat exchangers and other equipment where the water absorbs heat. That heat is then rejected &lt;!-- engineering term, although ejected makes more sense in regular English--&gt;to the atmosphere by the partial evaporation of the water in cooling towers where upflowing air is contacted with the circulating downflow of water. The loss of evaporated water into the air exhausted to the atmosphere is replaced by "make-up" fresh river water or fresh cooling water; but volumes of water lost during evaporative cooling may decrease natural habitat for aquatic organisms. Since the evaporation of pure water is replaced by make-up water containing carbonates and other dissolved salts, a portion of the circulating water is also continuously discarded as "blowdown" water to prevent the excessive build-up of salts in the circulating water; and these blowdown wastes may change the receiving water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Internal combustion engines ==
{{details|Internal combustion engine cooling}}
The [[water jacket]] around an engine is very effective at deadening mechanical noises, which makes the engine quieter.

=== Open method ===
[[File:Moore-single-cylinder-gasoline-engine.jpg|thumb|An antique gasoline engine with an evaporative cooler and mesh screen to improve evaporation. Water is pumped up to the top and flows down the screen to the tank.]]
{{Details|Hopper cooling}}
An open water cooling system makes use of [[evaporative cooling]], lowering the temperature of the remaining (unevaporated) water. This method was common in early internal combustion engines, until scale buildup was observed from dissolved salts and minerals in the water.  Modern open cooling systems continuously waste a fraction of recirculating water as blowdown to remove dissolved solids at concentrations low enough to prevent scale formation.  Some open systems use inexpensive [[tap water]], but this requires higher blowdown rates than [[purified water|deionized]] or [[distilled water]].  Purified water systems still require blowdown to remove accumulation of byproducts of chemical treatment to prevent corrosion and biofouling.{{sfn|Betz|page=192}}

=== Pressurization ===
Water cooling also has a [[boiling point]] temperature of around 100 degrees C at atmospheric pressure. Engines operating at higher temperatures may require a pressurized recycle loop to prevent overheating.&lt;ref name="Sturgess"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sturgess |first=Steve |url= http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/maintenance/article/story/2009/08/column-keep-your-cool.aspx |title= Column: Keep Your Cool |publisher= Heavy Duty Trucking|date= August 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Modern automotive cooling systems often operate at {{Convert|15|psi|kPa|0|abbr=on}} to raise the boiling-point of the recycling water coolant and reduce evaporative losses.&lt;ref name=HowStuffWorks&gt;{{cite web
  |last=Nice|first=Karim|title=How Car Cooling Systems Work|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/cooling-system.htm|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=20 August 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antifreeze ===
The use of water cooling carries the risk of damage from freezing. Automotive and many other engine cooling applications require the use of a water and [[antifreeze]] mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced.  Antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point, allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures.&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks"/&gt; Its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water-only cooling system. The heated coolant mixture can also be used to warm the air inside the car by means of the [[heater core]].

=== Other additives ===
Other less common chemical additives are products to reduce surface tension. These additives are meant to increase the efficiency of automotive cooling systems. Such products are used to enhance the cooling of underperforming or undersized cooling systems or in racing where the weight of a larger cooling system could be a disadvantage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Power electronics and transmitters ==
Since approximately 1930 it is common to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters. As these devices uses high operation voltages ( around 10 kV), the use of deionized water is required and it has to be carefully controlled.
Modern solid-state transmitters can be built so that even high power transmitters do not require water cooling. Water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of HVDC valves, for which also the use of deionized water is required.{{Citation needed

=== Liquid cooling maintenance ===
[[File:© CoolIT Rack DCLC AHx Liquid Cooling Solution.jpg|thumb|CoolIT Rack DCLC AHx Liquid Cooling Solution]]
Liquid cooling techniques are increasingly being used for the thermal management of electronic components. This type of cooling is a solution to ensure the optimisation of energy efficiency while simultaneously minimising noise and space requirements. Especially useful in supercomputers or Data Centers as maintenance of the racks is quick and easy.  After disassembly of the rack, advanced technology quick release couplings eliminate spillage for the safety of operators and protects the integrity of fluids (no impurities in the circuits).  These couplings are also capable of being locked (Panel mounted?) to allow blind connection in difficult to access areas.{{Citation needed
|reason=this section has no reference citations
|date=September 2018}}
It is important in electronics technology to analyse the connection systems to ensure:
* Non-spill sealing (clean break, flush face couplings)
* Compact and lightweight (materials in special aluminum alloys)
* Operator safety (disconnection without spillage)
* Quick-release couplings sized for optimized flow
* Connection guiding system and compensation of misalignment during connection on rack systems
* Excellent resistance to vibration and corrosion
* Designed to withstand a large number of connections even on refrigerant circuits under residual pressure

Water cooling often adds complexity and cost in comparison to air cooling design by requiring a pump, tubing or piping to transport the water, and a radiator, often with fans, to reject the heat to the atmosphere. Depending on the application, water cooling may create an additional element of risk where leakage from the water coolant recycle loop may corrode or short-circuit sensitive electronic components.

The primary advantage of water cooling for cooling [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cores in computing equipment is transporting heat away from the source to a secondary cooling surface to allow for large, more optimally designed [[radiator]]s rather than small, relatively inefficient fins&lt;!--these are FINS as in, a metal lattice which gives a high surface area, not fans!!!--&gt; mounted directly on the heat source. Cooling hot computer components with various fluids has been in use since at least as far back as the development of [[Cray-2]] in 1982, using [[Fluorinert]].  Through the 1990s, water cooling for home PCs slowly gained recognition amongst enthusiasts, but it started to become noticeably more prevalent after the introduction of [[AMD]]'s hot-running [[Athlon]] processor in mid-2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As of 2011, there are several manufacturers of water cooling components and kits, and some custom computer retailers include various setups of water cooling for their high-performance systems.

Water cooling can be used to cool many computer components, but especially the [[CPU cooling|CPU]]. Water cooling usually uses a CPU [[water block]], a [[pump|water pump]], and a water-to-air heat exchanger.  By transferring device heat to a separate heat exchanger which can variously be made large and use larger, lower-speed fans, water cooling can allow quieter operation, improved processor speeds ([[overclocking]]), or a balance of both. Less commonly, [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]], [[Northbridge (computing)|Northbridges]], [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridges]], [[Hard disk|hard disk drives]], [[Random access memory|memory]], [[voltage regulator module]]s (VRMs), and even [[Power supply|power supplies]] can be water-cooled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koolance.com/1300-1700w-liquid-cooled-power-supply |title=Koolance 1300/1700W Liquid-Cooled Power Supply |publisher=Koolance.com |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiator size may vary: from 40mm dual fan (80mm) to 140 quad fan (560mm) and thickness from 30mm to 80mm

Water coolers for desktop computers were, until the end of the 1990s, homemade. They were made from car [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiators]] (or more commonly, a car's [[heater core]]), [[aquarium]] pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a [[T-Line]]. More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case. This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling.

Dedicated overclockers occasionally use [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] or [[Peltier-Seebeck effect|thermoelectric coolers]] in place of more common standard heat exchangers. Water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature (impossible with a standard heat exchanger) and, as a result, generally provide superior cooling of the computer's heat-generating components. The downside of phase-change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity, and [[Antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] must be added due to the low temperature. Additionally, insulation, usually in the form of lagging around water pipes and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled, must be used in order to prevent damage caused by [[condensation]] of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces. Common places from which to borrow the required [[phase transition]] systems are a household [[dehumidifier]] or [[air conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/showthread.php?t=354585 |title=Dehumidifier &amp; Air Conditioner  |publisher=extremeoverclocking.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative cooling system, which enables components to be cooled below the ambient temperature, but which obviates the requirement for antifreeze and lagged pipes, is to place a [[Thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric device]] (commonly referred to as a 'Peltier junction' or 'pelt' after [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Jean Peltier]], who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block.  Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area. The disadvantage of such a system is a higher power dissipation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

To avoid damage from condensation around the Peltier junction, a proper installation requires it to be "potted" with silicone epoxy. The epoxy is applied around the edges of the device, preventing air from entering or leaving the interior.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Apple's [[Power Mac G5]] was the first mainstream desktop computer to have water cooling as standard (although only on its fastest models). [[Dell]] followed suit by shipping their XPS computers with liquid cooling{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, using [[thermoelectric cooling]] to help cool the liquid. Currently, Dell's only computers to offer liquid cooling are their [[Alienware]] desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
Plant [[transpiration]] and animal [[perspiration]] use evaporative cooling to prevent high temperatures from causing unsustainable [[metabolism|metabolic rates]]. 

[[Machinegun]]s used in fixed defensive positions sometimes use water cooling to extend barrel life through periods of rapid fire, but the weight of the water and pumping system significantly reduces the portability of water-cooled firearms.

A [[hospital]] in [[Sweden]] relies on snow-cooling from [[Meltwater|melt-water]] from to cool its data centers, medical equipment, and maintain a comfortable ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvn.se/v1/In-english1/In-english/Environment-and-energy/Energy-Factor-2/Snow-cooling-in-Sundsvall/|title=Snow cooling in Sundsvall|website=www.lvn.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nuclear reactors use [[heavy water]] as cooling. Heavy water is employed in [[nuclear reactor]]s because it is a weaker [[neutron absorber]]. This allows for the use of less enriched fuel. For the main cooling system, normal water is preferably employed through the use of a heat exchanger, as heavy water is much more expensive. Reactors that use other materials for moderation (graphite) [[RBMK|may also use normal water for cooling]].

High-grade industrial water (produced by [[reverse osmosis]] or [[distillation]]) and potable water are sometimes used in industrial plants requiring high-purity cooling water. Production of these high purity waters creates waste byproduct [[brine]]s containing the concentrated impurities from the source water.

In 2018, researchers from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] and [[University of Wyoming]] invented a radiative cooling [[metamaterial]] known as "RadiCold", being developed since 2017. This metamaterial aids in cooling of water and increasing the efficiency of power generation, in which it would cool the underneath objects, by reflecting the sun's rays while at the same time allowing the surface to discharge its heat as an infrared thermal radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dongliang Zhao |author2=Ablimit Aili|author3=Yao Zhai |author4=Jiatao Lu |author5=Dillon Kidd |author6=Gang Tan |author7=Xiaobo Yin |author8=Ronggui Yang |title=Subambient Cooling of Water: Toward Real-World Applications of Daytime Radiative Cooling |publisher=ScienceDirect |date=26 October 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2018.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoosemiotics''' is the [[semiotic]] study of the use of signs among animals, more precisely the study of [[semiosis]] among animals, i.e. the study of how something comes to function as a sign to some animal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timo Maran|Maran, Timo]]; [[Dario Martinelli|Martinelli, Dario]]; [[Aleksei Turovski|Turovski, Aleksei]] (eds.), 2011. ''Readings in Zoosemiotics.'' ([[Semiotics, Communication and Cognition]] 8.). Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of animal forms of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2014. Zoosemiotics is the study of animal forms of knowing. ''Semiotica'' 198: 47–60.[https://www.academia.edu/6116777/Zoosemiotics_is_the_study_of_animal_forms_of_knowing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered part of [[biosemiotics]], zoosemiotics is related to the fields of [[ethology]] and [[animal communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, Guenther. 2014. Biocommunication of Animals. Dortrecht, Springer. &lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by semiotician [[Thomas Sebeok]] based on the theories of German-Estonian biologist [[Jakob von Uexküll]].&lt;ref&gt;"Zoosemiotics". [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]. American Speech , Vol. 43, No. 2 (May, 1968), pp. 142-144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoosemiotics: Juncture of Semiotics and the Biological Study of Behavior. Science 29 January 1965:  Vol. 147 no. 3657 pp. 492-493&lt;/ref&gt; The field is defined by having as its subject matter all of those semiotic processes that are shared by both animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Eugen. 1987. Thomas A. Sebeok's Doctrine of Signs, in Krampen, et al. (eds.) "Classics of Semiotics" Plenum Press. p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The field also differs from the field of animal communication in that it also interprets signs that are not communicative in the traditional sense, such as camouflage, [[mimicry]], courtship behavior etc. The field also studies cross-species communication, for example between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semioticon.com/seo/Z/zoosemiotics.html Martinelli, Dario.
