'''''A Satire of the Three Estates''''' ([[Middle Scots]]: ''Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis''), is a [[satirical]] [[morality play]] in [[Middle Scots]], written by [[makar]] [[David Lyndsay|Sir David Lyndsay]]. The complete play was first performed outside in the playing field at [[Cupar]], [[Fife]] in June 1552 during the Midsummer holiday, where the action took place under Castle Hill. It was subsequently performed in [[Edinburgh]], also outdoors, in 1554. The full text was first printed in 1602 and extracts were copied into the ''[[Bannatyne Manuscript]]''. The ''Satire'' is an attack on the [[Three Estates#The Three Estates|Three Estates]] represented in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] – the clergy, lords and burgh representatives, symbolised by the characters ''Spiritualitie'', ''Temporalitie'' and ''Merchant''. The clergy come in for the strongest criticism. The work portrays the social tensions present at this pivotal moment in [[Scottish history]].

==Synopsis==
A complete version of the play was printed by Robert Charteris as, ''Ane (Pleasant) Satyre of the Thrie Estaits, in Commendation of Vertew and Vituperation of Vyce'', Edinburgh (1602).&lt;ref&gt;"Pleasant" appears in the title on the first page of the play, not on the title-page of Charteris's (1602) edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part there are 27 different characters. In the second part seven more are added. The key characters are; King Humanity, Divine Correction, Sensuality, Spirituality, Temporality, Gude Counsel and Chastity.

The play opens with Diligence delivering a sermon on good kingship. The main character, young King Humanity, then appears and is at first led astray by Sensuality and the Vices. His false counsellors introduce him to a mistress, Sensuality, which is the starting point of his disconnection from the moral way of life. He is then fooled by three disguised liars. Gude Counsel is sent to prison by the liars who already have taken control of King Humanitie's mind. With the beginning of his lecherous new life the king forgets about the moral virtues and can no longer judge properly. He consigns Charity and Verity to the stocks. In the course of the following scenes the audience sees how the three so called Vices (Discretion, Devotion and Sapience) try to get rid of everything and everyone who could be dangerous to them. For instance Lady Chastitie, who is homeless since the church in Scotland is not as it was meant to be, begs for shelter from Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and finally the People but is rejected in each case. In the end when Lady Chastitie is sent to prison by the Vices, Divine Correction enters the stage. This is the moment when the vices know that their time has come to an end and they flee and take away the king’s treasure box. Correction frees Gude Counsel, Chastitie and Vertie. He advises the young king to call a parliament and gives him advice regarding a successful reign.

The second part starts with an interruption. A member of the King's realm, known only as The Poor Man, emerges from the audience, establishes an alliance with John Commonweal to demand reform, and Diligence reappears to announce that the King will seek to improve his realm. Afterwards the Pardoner enters the scene and tries to sell pardoners. Poor Man hears that and buys pardoners worth ‘ane groat’. But Poor Man is not satisfied and gets angry and so they start to argue. In the following scene Diligence opens parliament and King Humanitie, Correction, the king’s courtiers and the virtues enter. The three estates greet the king and parliament is opened. John Commonweal stands up and talks to the King and Correction. He reveals all the failures of the estates. In the course of the following hearing Temporalitie gets punished but as this estate wants to cooperate this is just a short episode. Spiritualitie does not agree on what is said about their estate and fights back. But there are too many accusations against this estate and therefore they also have to give in. The three Vices are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Flatterie tried to get away by betraying his fellows Falsehood and Deceit but this did not work. In the end of the second part the three vices Deceit, Falsehood and Flatterie are allowed to say something before they are hanged. After the execution of the vices  and a rousing speech by Folie, Diligence closes the play and advises the audience to go their ways and enjoy their time.&lt;ref&gt;Edington, Carol, ''Court &amp; Culture in Renaissance Scotland'', pp.221-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixteenth century performances==

===Interlude at Linlithgow, 1540===
[[File:Linlithgowpalace 180609 - 03.jpg|thumb| The 1540 interlude was performed in the hall of [[Linlithgow Palace]]]]
The 1931 edition of Lindsay's works by Douglas Hamer hypothesized different forms of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount'', vol.2, Scottish Text Society (1931-4), pp.1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The critic John MacQueen proposed the play might have composed by Lindsay as early as 1532 for the court of the young [[James V of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, ''Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', ''SSL''(1965-6), 129-43.&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of the play is recorded in the [[Treasurer of Scotland|royal treasurer's accounts]] and an English agent's report to [[Thomas Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.7 (1907), pp.276-7, purchase of costumes in Jan. 1540&lt;/ref&gt; This short play or 'interlude' performed in January 1540 used characters who later appeared in the ''Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', and had the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Spencer Kantrowitz, ''Dramatic Allegory:Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', University of Nebraska Press, 1975.  Greg Walker,'Sir David Lindsay's Ane Satire of the Thrie Estaitis,' ''Scottish Literary Journal'', 16.2 (Nov. 1989); Roderick Lyall, ''Ane Satyre of The Thrie Estaitis'', edited with an introduction and commentary, Canongate Classics 18, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by the Englishman [[William Eure, 1st Baron Eure|William Eure]] to [[Thomas Cromwell]] on 26 January 1540 gives a description of the interlude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=76159 ''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol.15 (1894), no.114], link to British History Online, does not include synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; Eure, a Border Warden and Privy Councillor, had spoken to [[Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule|Sir Thomas Bellenden]] at [[Coldstream]], who described the performance at [[Linlithgow Palace]] before James, his wife [[Mary of Guise]] and his bishops and council on the feast of the Epiphany. As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, Eure obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact who saw the play at Linlithgow, and enclosed in his letter the synopsis written by his spy .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2zYIAQAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846)], pp.279-285&lt;/ref&gt; This description corresponds with the expanded later text of Lindsay's play. A king was shown with his courtiers, Placebo, Picthanke, and Flatterye. A Poor Man made his complaint, and was answered by a Burgess, a Man at Arms and a Bishop, who represented the three estates of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. The Poor Man mentioned the real events of James V executing both [[Johnnie Armstrong|John Armstrong]] (of Staplegordon; in ballads the Laird o'[[Gilnockie Tower|Gilnockie]]), hanged in July 1530, and 'Sym the Laird,' who was hanged in February 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Jamie, ''James V'', (1998), pp.77-83&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the poor man was described in the spy's synopsis;&lt;blockquote&gt;"After them come a poor Man, who did go up and down the scaffald, making a heavy complaint that he was harried (chased) through the Courtier's place, where through he hade strayled (lost) his house, his wife and children beggyng thair bread, and so of many thousand in Scotland, whiche would make the Kyng's Grace lose of men if his Grace stod neide (required), saying there was no remedy to be gotten, for though he would suite to the King's Grace, he was neither acquainted with Controller nor Treasurer, and without them might no man get no goodness of the King. And after, he spered (asked) for the King, and when he was shewed the Man that was King in the play, he answered and said he was no King, for there was but one King, which made all and governethe all, who is eternal, to whom he and all earthly Kings are but officers, of the which they must make reckoning. And so forth much more to that effect. And then he looked to the King, and said he was not the King of Scotland, for there was another King in Scotland that hanged John Armestrang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other more, which had pacified the country, and stanched theft, but he had left one thing undone, which pertained as well to his charge as th'other. And when he was asked what that was, he made a long narration of the oppression of the poor, by the taking of the 'corse presaunte beists' (animals due as [[tithes]] at funerals), and of the harrying of poor men by [[Consistory court|Consistory law]], and of many other abussions of the spiritualitie and Churche, with many long stories and authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846), 283-5 (here modernized)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eure said he had talked with Bellenden, a member of the council of [[James V of Scotland]] about the possibility of a [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation of the 'spirituality' in Scotland]]. The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dI_AAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Pinkerton, John, ''The History Of Scotland From The Accession Of The House Of Stuart To That Of Mary'', vol.2, (1791), pp.494-497]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cupar Banns, 1552===
The performance at Cupar on 7 June 1552 was heralded by a short piece called the ''Cupar Banns'' announcing the play, presumably also written by Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=86UlAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s David Lyndsay's ''Cupar Banns'' in, John Pinkerton, ''Scottish Poems Reprinted From Scarce Editions'', vol.2 (1792)]&lt;/ref&gt; This has three sections of comic drama as a foretaste of the ''Satire''; the Cotter and his wife, Bessy and the Auld Man, and Fynlaw of the Foot Band, introduced by the 'Nuncius' and linked by the Fool. The characters of the three parts are supposed to be members of the ''Satire's'' audience. The ''Banns'' with some stage directions are found only in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript."&lt;ref&gt;Newlyn, Evelyn S., 'Traditions of Myth in The Cupar Banns', in, ''The European Sun'', Tuckwell (1993), pp.355-367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh, 1554, and the Charteris synopsis===
Some preparations for the Edinburgh performance on Sunday 14 August 1554 were made by the Burgh Council. [[William MacDowall]] with six carpenters built a stage of boards, a seat for [[Mary of Guise]] and the French ambassador [[Henri Cleutin]], and a 'Convoy House', at the [[Calton Hill|Greenside playfield]], with the [[gallows|gallows, 'jebbettis,']] used in the final scene.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, ''The Renaissance in Scotland'', Brill (1994), p.206&lt;/ref&gt; The town council paid the wages of 12 minstrels, and after the play treated the actors to dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/edinburghrecord01edingoog#page/n150/mode/2up Adam, Robert, ed., ''Edinburgh Records: The Burgh Accounts'', vol.1 (1899), p.110]: ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer'', vol.10 (1913), p.232:[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58529 Marwick, ed., ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1528-1557'', (1871), entries from 1554] via British History Online, (The other play event mentioned on 15 June 1554 was the entry of Guise as Regent)&lt;/ref&gt;

The printer Henry Charteris mentioned the Edinburgh performance in his introduction to Lindsay's ''Warkis'' (1568), saying how the clergy were surprised by the play and considered taking revenge. Charteris gave this summary of the ''Satire'';&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in the presence of the Quene Regent, and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane exceeding greit nowmber of pepill. lestand fra 9 houris afoir none till 6 houris at evin, quhair, amangis mony baith grave materis and merie trickis, he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Persone (Parson), ane Freir, and ane Nun, deckit up in their papisticall ornamentis and maner of raiment. And theirefter broicht in King Correction, quha reformand sindie deformities in his realme, passit to the tryall of the Clergie. And findand thame to be altogether Idiotis, unworthie of ony functioun ecclesiasticall, dicernit thame to be degradit of their dignateis, and spulzeit (deprived) of their offices, quhilk beand executit, thay war fund bot verray fulis, hypocrites, flatteris &amp; nouchtie persones."&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of David Lindsay'', vol.1, STS (1931), p.398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' contains only selected "merry interludes" from the 1554 Greenside performance, the copyist George Bannatyne omitted the "grave matter" because the church had been reformed in reality in the 1560 [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]], and he noted, "the samyne abuse is weill reformit in Scotland." Stage directions in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' mention the settings of "houses", the "King's seat" and "palyeoun" tent, and props for the scene of the Poor Man and the [[Indulgence|Pardoner]], "Heir thay feight togeddir and the puir man sall cast doun the burd and cast the [[relic|rillickis]] in the watter."&lt;ref&gt;Tod Ritchie, W. ed., ''Banntyne Manuscript'', 4 vols., STS: ''Facsimile Bannatyne Manuscript'', NLS / Scolar Press (1980), f.182: Pinkerton, ed., ''Scottish Poems: the Bannatyne Interludes'', (1792), pp.23, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
The play's first complete modern production occurred on August 24, 1948, at the Edinburgh Festival with a modernised text by [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]] and directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], featuring [[Stanley Baxter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=9621 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1948 production]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Callow]] and [[Fulton Mackay]] acted in a 1973 Edinburgh Festival production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=16770 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1973 production]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thrie Estaitis banner 1982.JPG|thumb|300p|New College, Edinburgh was the venue for the 1982 production]]

Mary McCluskey directed a performance by young people in July 1996 as part of Scottish Youth Theatre's Summer Festival. The script was translated into modern Scots by Fiona McGarry, and the play was performed in the round in The Cottier Theatre, Glasgow, with an original score.

[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] adapted the play as a contemporary morality ''A Satire of the Four Estaites'', which was presented by [[Wildcat Theatre Company]] at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], also in 1996.&lt;ref name=mcgrath&gt;From the programme to the production.&lt;/ref&gt; This production opened on 16 August 1996 and starred [[Sylvester McCoy]].&lt;ref name=mcgrath/&gt;

The play was quoted at the opening of the new [[Scottish Parliament]], a mark illustrating its importance to modern Scots.

A new performance at Linlithgow Palace and [[Stirling Castle]] based on the story of the 1540 interlude took place in 2013 using a cast drawn from stage and screen.  In Linlithgow an open-air stage was erected on the Peel looking out across the loch for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/performing-arts/play-that-shook-king-returns-to-linlithgow-palace-1-2783441 ''Scotsman Newspaper'': Plans for 40-player presentation of the ''Satire'' at Linlithgow Peel, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The ''Satire'' is notable for being one of the earliest recorded instances of ''[[fuck]],'' predating any English language forms but preceded in the [[Scots language]] by the [[makar]] [[William Dunbar]] (Oxford English Dictionary entry.)

==Excerpt from the 1602 text==
A complete version of the play was printed in 1602, see external links for an edition of the text. In this extract Diligence meets the Pauper, who begins his complaint, including the practice of the parish priest claiming livestock at funerals which was mentioned in the 1540 interlude, (Lines 1954-2028);&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Fitzedward, ed., ''Ane Satire'', EETS, pp.459-252&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Watkins''' (27 January 1855 – 15 April 1935) was an English author, self-taught amateur [[archaeologist]], [[antiquarian]] and businessman who, while standing on a hillside in Herefordshire, England, in 1921 experienced a revelation and noticed on the British [[landscape]] the apparent arrangement of straight lines positioned along ancient features, and subsequently coined the term "ley", now usually referred to as [[ley line]], because the line passed through places whose names contained the [[syllable]] "ley".&lt;ref&gt;Clive L. N. Ruggles, ''Ancient Astronomy: An Encyclopaedia Of Cosmologies and Myth'', page 224 (ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2005). {{ISBN|1-85109-477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Watkins was born in [[Hereford]] to an affluent family which had moved to the town in 1820 to establish several businesses including a flour-mill, a hotel and brewery. Watkins travelled across [[Herefordshire]] as an 'out-rider' representing the family businesses and so got to know the area intimately.

[[File:WatkinsMeter.jpg|thumb|Watkins Exposure Meter with timing chain, manufactured by R Fields &amp; Co, Birmingham. Note: this is not the later, pocket-watch shaped, Watkins Bee Meter. ''Photo: Tony French'']]
Watkins was also a respected photographer. He made some cameras himself and manufactured an [[Light meter|exposure meter]] called the 'Watkins Bee Meter' due to its small size and efficiency. An example is in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110609084400/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/leisure/museums_galleries/2872.asp Museum Resource &amp; Learning Centre, Hereford], and one accompanied [[Robert Falcon Scott]] to the South Pole. He was an active member of the [[Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom]] and served as its President when the Convention was held in Hereford in 1907. In 1910 he was awarded the [[Progress Medal (RPS)|Progress Medal]] of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] (RPS).&lt;ref name="RPS_2011_Progress_Medal_1910"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Royal Photographic Society |title=Progress medal |url=http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Progress-medal |quote=Instituted in 1878, this medal is awarded in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense. This award also carries with it an Honorary Fellowship of The Society. […] 1910 Alfred Watkins […] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822030453/http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Progress-Medal |archivedate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3,000 photographs, taken from Alfred's original glass negative plates are held by Hereford Library and can be viewed on request.

On 30 June 1921, Watkins visited [[Blackwardine]] in Herefordshire when he had the idea that there was a system of straight lines crossing the landscape dating from [[Neolithic]] times. He presented his ideas at a meeting of the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]] of Hereford in September 1921, and published his first books ''Early British Trackways'' in 1922 and ''[[The Old Straight Track]]'' in 1925. Thereafter he spent a major part of his life developing his theory. He published a further book on leys and participated in the [[Old Straight Track Club]] from 1927 to 1935 (the papers from this organisation are also in the Hereford City Museum).

Watkins was a member of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], an authority on [[beekeeping]] and a fellow of the [[Royal Photographic Society]]. He was also involved in the preservation of [[Pembridge, Herefordshire]] Market Hall.

[[Archaeologist]]s in general do not accept Watkins' ideas on leys. At first they regarded the [[ancient Britons]] as too primitive to have devised such an arrangement, but this is no longer the argument used against the existence of leys. More crucially, there are so many ancient features that finding some in approximate alignment is highly likely. Watkins was sensitive to such arguments and argued for caution. He also drew up a list according to which landscape features could be given values between ¼ and 1 point, five points or more being required as evidence of a ley.

Watkins' work resurfaced in popularised form from the 1960s following the publication of [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]'s book ''The View over Atlantis'' in 1969. Michell merged Watkins' ideas with mystical concepts not present in Watkins' own work.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, John Bruno Hare of the [[Internet Sacred Texts Archive]] (ISTA) wrote:

{{quote|Watkins never attributed any supernatural significance to leys; he believed that they were simply pathways that had been used for trade or ceremonial purposes, very ancient in origin, possibly dating back to the Neolithic, certainly pre-Roman. .. He was an intensely rational person with an active intellect, and I think he would be a bit disappointed with some of the fringe aspects of ley lines today.|John Bruno Hare|17 June 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/ebt/index.htm |title=Early British Trackways Index |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date=17 June 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Watkins had a beer named after him, "Watkins' Triumph", brewed by [[Wye Valley Brewery]] Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/wye-valley-watkins-triumph/31313/|title="Wye Valley Watkins Triumph"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5488">The '''Arad Museum Complex''' ({{lang-ro|'Complexul Muzeal Arad'}}) is primarily a history and archaeology [[museum]] in the city of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Romania]].

The museum presents archaeological items from the [[Iron Age]], the [[Dacians|Dacian]] Period, the [[Migration Period]] and the [[Early Medieval Period]]. It also showcases historical items relating to the Revolution of 1848 in [[Transylvania]] and the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918, ethnographical items, natural science exhibits relating to the Arad area, minerals, flora and fauna specimens, classical and contemporary [[Romanian art]], European paintings from the 17th - 20th centuries, decorative art items and exhibits relating to the history of theater: programmes, posters, photographs, scores (the Iosif Sârbuț collection).&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;[http://www.cimec.ro/ScripTs/muZEE/iden.asp?k=71 Arad Museum Complex at cIMeC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620061749/http://www.cimec.ro/ScripTs/muZEE/iden.asp?k=71 |date=June 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum building is the Culture Palace, a monument of architecture from 1913, by the architect Ludovic Szantay. The museum owns items listed in the Romanian National Cultural Heritage Treasure.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

==History==
The Arad Museum Complex was opened in 1893, as an exhibition of Relics of the Revolution from 1848, in the lobby from the 2nd floor of the local State Theatre. Two decades later, in 1913, the museum has been moved into the new built Culture Palace, along with the philharmonic and town library. Besides the old relics exhibition, archeological and medieval history collections were put on display and a European art gallery has been opened as well. In the inter-war period these have been completed with an ethnography exhibition and two memorial rooms dedicated to the local politicians Vasile Goldis and Stefan Cicio-Pop (1934).&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;[http://www.museumarad.ro/eng/pages/m_istoric.htm Arad Museum Complex - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the communist overtake, the collections and the exhibitions have been reorganized in the spirit of the new ideology, the section of ancient history, the "Museum of the Revolution from 1848" and the art gallery being re-opened in 1954–55 and the ethnography exhibition in 1956.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

In the period 1958–1988 several sections of the museum have been opened in the county: Lipova (Town Museum – 1958), Siria (I. Slavici and E. Montia Memorial Museum – 1960), Savârsin (Art and Ethnography Museum – 1988) and Minis (Vineyard and Vine Museum – 1988).
After a radical reorganisation, which took more than two years, the archaeology and history exhibitions have been reopened in 1979, within the Cultural Palace. The Art Gallery has been moved into its current premises in 1984.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

As a consequence of the political changes from December 1989, the basic exhibitions have been liberated of ideological ballast and in 1992 the a section of natural sciences has been opened, a year later the one of inter-war history as well. The Art Gallery, entirely reorganized, re-opened in 1998. The exhibition "Arad – December 1989", came into public circuit in December 2004.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

Since 1967, the museum issues its own scientific publication called ''Ziridava'', named after the [[Ziridava|nearby Dacian settlement]] mentioned by Ptolemy and archaeologically identified at [[Pecica]]. New scientific reviews are being edited since 1992: Studies and Communications of Art and Architecture, Natural Harmonies (1995) – researches from the field of natural sciences – and Zarandul (1999), containing ethnographic studies.
The multimedia workshop Kinema Ikon, part of the museum since 1990, issues the interdisciplinary review Intermedia since 1994, being one of Romania’s leading hypermedia art instances, a base on which the workshop represented the country at the 50th Biennial of Contemporary Art in Venice (2003).&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

Today, the museum manages a collection of over 125.000 pieces, being an active actor on the Arad cultural scene, assuming a reformative role.

'''Christopher Fry''' (18 December 1907 – 30 June 2005) was an English [[poet]] and [[playwright]]. He is best known for his verse dramas, notably ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'', which made him a major force in theatre in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fry was born as '''Arthur Hammond Harris''' in [[Bristol]], the son of Charles John Harris, a master builder who retired early to work full-time as a licensed [[Lay Reader]] in the [[Church of England]], and his wife Emma Marguerite Fry Hammond Harris.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/theater/05fry.html |title=Christopher Fry, British Playwright in Verse, Dies at 97 |last=Nightingale |first=Benedict |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2005 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still young, he took his mother’s maiden name because, on very tenuous grounds, he believed her to be related to the 19th-century [[Quaker]] prison reformer [[Elizabeth Fry]].&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article540139.ece The Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted Elizabeth Fry's faith, and became a Quaker.

After attending [[Bedford Modern School]], where he wrote amateur plays,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; he became a schoolteacher, working at the Bedford [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]] Kindergarten and [[Hazelwood School]] in [[Limpsfield]], [[Surrey]].

In the 1920s he met the writer [[Robert Gittings]], who became a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, G., ''Gittings, Robert William Victor (1911–1992)'' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|ODNB]]'' [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51049 online] (subscription required), accessed 10 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Fry gave up his school career in 1932 to found the [[Tunbridge Wells]] Repertory Players, which he ran for three years, directing and starring in the English premiere of [[George Bernard Shaw]]’s ''[[A Village Wooing]]'' in 1934. As a curtain raiser, he put on a revised version of a show he wrote when he was a schoolboy called ''The Peregrines''. He also wrote the music for [[She Shall Have Music]] in 1935.

His play about Dr. [[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of children’s homes, toured in a fund-raising amateur production in 1935 and 1936, including [[Deborah Kerr]] in its cast.

His professional career began to take off when he was commissioned by the vicar of [[Steyning]], [[West Sussex]], to write a play celebrating the local saint, [[Cuthman of Steyning]], which became ''The Boy With A Cart'' in 1938. It would be put on professionally in 1950 with the young [[Richard Burton]] in his first starring role.

[[Tewkesbury Abbey]] commissioned his next play, ''The Tower'', written in 1939, which was seen by the poet [[T. S. Eliot]], who became a friend and is often cited as an influence.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In 1939 Fry also became artistic director of [[Oxford Playhouse]].

A [[pacifist]], he was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War II]], and served in the [[Non-Combatant Corps]]; for part of the time he cleaned London's sewers.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

After the War he wrote a comedy, ''A Phoenix Too Frequent'', which was produced at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]], London, in 1946, starring [[Paul Scofield]]. The show is a comedy that is based upon [[Petronius]]'s tale of the [[Ephesus|Ephesian]] widow, the false heroics of [[Dynamene]]'s mourning of her husband in his tomb, and her reawakening to the joy of life by a handsome officer who enters the tomb to rest on a course of duty.

''The Firstborn'' was produced at the Oxford Playhouse in 1948. The plot is that of Egypt in the throes of a threatening conflict between master and slave, with [[Moses]] denouncing his privileges as an Egyptian-reared soldier and finding new responsibility as a leader of his people.  The play was produced by actress [[Katharine Cornell]] and featured two songs specially written for the play by [[Leonard Bernstein]].

In 1948 he wrote a commission for the [[Canterbury]] Festival, ''Thor, With Angels''.

===Major works===
Fry was then commissioned to write a play by [[Alec Clunes]], manager of the [[Arts Theatre]] in London. The result, ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'', was first performed there in 1948, directed by the actor [[Jack Hawkins]]. Due to its success, it transferred to the West End for a nine-month run, starring [[John Gielgud]] and featuring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Claire Bloom]] among the cast. It was presented on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1950, again with Burton. The play marked a revival in popularity for poetic drama, most notably espoused by T. S. Eliot. It is the most performed of all his plays and inspired British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] to declaim, "You turn if you want to — the lady’s not for turning," at the Conservative Party conference in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs Thatcher quotation in The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations, edited by JM and MJ Cohen, (Viking, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Fry adapted a translation of [[Jean Anouilh]]’s ''[[Invitation to the Castle]]'' as ''[[Ring Round the Moon]]'' for director [[Peter Brook]]. He also wrote ''Venus Observed'', which was produced at the [[St James's Theatre]] by [[Laurence Olivier]]. ''A Sleep Of Prisoners'' followed in 1951, first performed at St Thomas' church in [[Regent Street]], London, in 1951 and later touring with [[Denholm Elliott]] and [[Stanley Baker]].

''[[The Dark is Light Enough (play)|The Dark is Light Enough]]'', a winter play starring [[Katharine Cornell]] and  [[Edith Evans]] in 1954, was third in a quartet of "seasonal" plays, featured incidental music written by [[Leonard Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Mosel, ''Leading Lady:  The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell''&lt;/ref&gt;  The production also featured [[Tyrone Power]], [[Lorne Greene]] and [[Marian Winters]].  [[Christopher Plummer]] had an understudy role that he wrote about in his memoir.  This play followed the springtime of ''The Lady’s Not For Burning'' and the autumnal ''Venus Observed''. The quartet was completed in 1970 with ''A Yard Of Sun'', representing summer.

His next plays were translations from French dramatists: ''The Lark'', an adaptation of [[Jean Anouilh]]’s'' [[L'Alouette (The Lark)]]'', in 1955; ''[[The Trojan War Will Not Take Place|Tiger At The Gates]]'', based on [[Jean Giraudoux]]’s ''[[La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu]]'', also in 1955; ''[[Duel of Angels]]'', adapted from Giraudoux's ''Pour Lucrèce'', in 1960; and ''[[Judith (Giraudoux)|Judith]]'', also by Giraudoux, in 1962.

Although Fry lived until 2005, his poetic style of drama began to fall out of fashion with the advent of the [[Angry Young Men]] of British theatre in the 1950s. Despite working mainly for the cinema in the 1960s, he continued to write plays, including ''Curtmantle'' for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962, and ''A Yard of Sun'' – the fourth in his seasonal quartet – at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] in 1970.

''Curtmantle'''s (1962) plot deals with [[Henry II of England]] and his conflict with [[Thomas Becket]]. ''A Yard of Sun'' (1970) is set just after World War II at the time of the famous annual horse race [[Palio di Siena]] in the streets of [[Siena]].

After the success of his post-war plays Fry bought Trebinshwn, a fine [[Regency architecture|Regency]] house in [[Breconshire]]. When living there he used to walk over the hill behind the house, the Allt, to [[Llansantffraed]] church, where the 17th century poet [[Henry Vaughan]] is buried,&lt;ref&gt;C. Fry, Death is a Kind of Love&lt;/ref&gt; and Vaughan's poetry was a strong influence on him.

During the next ten years he concentrated on further translations, including [[Henrik Ibsen]]’s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[Edmond Rostand]]’s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which were produced at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roguesandvagabonds.co.uk/cgi-bin/newslist.pl?bid=10157&amp;num=6&amp;coinc=0 Article on theatre history website Rogues and Vagabonds]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he wrote ''One Thing More'', a play about the 7th century Northumbrian monk [[Cædmon]] who was suddenly given the gift of composing song; it was first performed in [[Chelmsford Cathedral]] and then broadcast on the [[BBC]], with further productions in [[London]] and [[Oxford]].

His last play, ''A Ringing Of Bells'', was commissioned by his old school, [[Bedford Modern School]], and performed there in 2000. The following year, a new production was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].

In later life Fry lived in the village of [[East Dean, West Sussex|East Dean]] in [[West Sussex]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.rochester.edu/camelot/intrvws/fry.htm Interview with Christopher Fry]&lt;/ref&gt; and died, from natural causes, in [[Chichester]] in 2005. His wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1936, died in 1987. He was survived by their son, Tam.

===Revivals===
Revivals of his plays include a staged reading of ''The Lady's Not For Burning'' at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 2001 as one of the 100 best plays of the 20th century, with actors [[Alex Jennings]], [[Prunella Scales]] and [[Samuel West]]. West went on to produce ''The Lady’s Not For Burning'' at [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]'s [[Minerva Theatre, Chichester|Minerva Theatre]] in 2002 with Nancy Carroll and Benjamin Whitrow. In 2007, it was performed in a new production at the [[Finborough Theatre]], London.

''Ring Round The Moon'' was revived at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 1967-68. starring [[John Standing]] and [[Angela Thorne]]. In 2008 it was revived again, directed by [[Sean Mathias]], once again starring [[Angela Thorne]], graduating from the role of young Diana to the wheelchair-using Madame Desmortes. Other cast members included [[JJ Feild]], [[Joanna David]], [[Belinda Lang]], [[John Ramm]] and [[Leigh Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stage review of the [[Playhouse Theatre]] 2008 revival of ''Ring Round the Moon''  [http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/19894/ring-round-the-moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In commemoration of his achievements, [[Bedford Modern School]] named the new Junior School hall after him.

===Film and TV writing===
Beginning in the 1950s, many of Fry's plays were adapted for the screen, mainly television. One of the most recent was ''The Lady’s Not For Burning'' for Yorkshire TV, starring [[Kenneth Branagh]], in 1987.

In 1954, he collaborated with John Cannan on a screenplay for a film version of [[John Gay]]’s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for director [[Peter Brook]], starring [[Laurence Olivier]]. He was also one of the writers of the classic 1959 film, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', directed by [[William Wyler]]. But he was uncredited for his efforts on the epic, as was [[Gore Vidal]]. The sole writing credit and [[Academy Award]] nomination instead went to [[Karl Tunberg]]. He collaborated on other screenplays including ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'', which starred [[Anthony Quinn]] in 1961, and ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning]]'', directed by [[John Huston]], in 1966. Other screenplays include the documentary ''The Queen Is Crowned'' (1953).

His television movie scripts are ''The Canary'' (1950), ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1968), ''The Brontës of Haworth'' (1973), ''The Best of Enemies'' (1976), ''Sister Dora'' (1977), and ''Star Over Bethlehem'' (1981).

The '''conservation and restoration of painting frames''' is the process through which [[picture frame]]s are preserved. Frame [[conservation and restoration]] includes general cleaning of the frame, as well as in depth processes such as replacing damaged ornamentation, gilding, and toning.

The purpose of painting frames is two-fold. Frames function to protect and support the artwork as well as to visually enhance the item.&lt;ref name="AICCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/frames|title=Frames|date=27 June 2015|website=Aiccm.org.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painting frames help us to appreciate and understand its role as it relates to the history of the painting.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/our-work/conservation/frames|title=Frames and workshop - Tate|website=Tate.org.uk|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original frames are often considered museum objects in their own right.&lt;ref name="Conservation Physics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationphysics.org/mm/hackney/hackney.pdf|format=PDF|author=Stephen Hackney|title=The evolution of a conservation framing policy at Tate|website=Conservationphysics.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, frames are subject to wear and tear in their functional roles as a protective component of the art.&lt;ref name="Cool Conservation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/wag/2006/glover_06.pdf|title=Wooden Artifacts|website=Cool.conservation-us.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular activities that require the handling of artwork and their frames, such as exhibition, storage, travel, leave the frame susceptible to damage.&lt;ref name="Cool Conservation" /&gt;

== Authenticity of frames ==
[[File:'Portrait of a Young Woman Playing a Lyre' by Marie Vigée-Lebrun, Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Picture Frame.|An example of a gilded frame with heavy ornamentation''.]]
Determining a frame’s authenticity is important to understanding its relationship with the painting.&lt;ref name ="Tate" /&gt; A frame can be considered original or authentic to a painting if it meets one of several possible requirements. Those requirements are: 
*If the frame was created, designed, or selected by the artist
*If the frame was selected by the first owner or dealer 
*If the frame is a stylistically appropriate and of the same age as the painting
*If the frame is a “livery” or “gallery” frame
*If the frame is a replica 
&lt;br /&gt; An authentic frame conveys the spirit of the time in which it was made. For the safety of the art, authentic frames can be modified to include glazing and backboards.&lt;ref name ="Tate" /&gt;

==Causes of deterioration==
[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 3.JPG|thumb|alt=Close up of Frame Ornamentation.|A close up of the damage inflicted upon a frame''.]]
Frequent handling, redecoration, modification, [[atmospheric pollution]], and deterioration are some of the many issues that have given cause for conservators to specialize in the preservation of frames. Although wood is the most common material used in the creation of painting frames, other materials such as [[gesso]], [[glass]], [[plastic]], and [[metal]] are also used.&lt;ref name ="AICCM" /&gt; Each material is susceptible to deterioration and damage.

===Inherent vice===
Vices inherent to the material the frame is composed of poses potential risks. The most commonly used material used in the production of frames is [[wood]]. Wood is highly susceptible to environmental conditions,&lt;ref name="Cool Conservation" /&gt; as well as infestation from pests and general deterioration. Likewise, metals are susceptible to rust, plastics are susceptible to deformity, and glass is susceptible to breakage. Each of these inherent vices can cause damage to the frame that must be addressed based on the frame's composition.

===Humidity and temperature=== 
Changes in humidity and temperature cause major structural damage to frames, such as warping and splitting. This damage makes the frame susceptible to loss of ornamentation from mishandling. In addition, the damage to the frame can endanger the art.&lt;ref name ="AICCM" /&gt;

===Adhesive=== 
[[File:Animal glue liquid.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Animal Glue.|Animal Glue''.]]  Deterioration of adhesives cause a frame’s joins to split. Animal glues, which were typically used to join a frame together, are susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity, which may cause the adhesives to give due to the warping of the frame. It is also possible that the adhesives themselves might simply deteriorate over time.

===Delamination=== 
[[Delamination]] can occur on the surface of a painted or gilded frame. When moisture travels through a crack in the gilded or painted surface, the support is subsequently weakened and the gilded or painted layers begin to lift.&lt;ref name="SFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sflac.net/tag/delamination/|title=Delamination Archives - South Florida Art Conservation|website=South Florida Art Conservation|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution===
The industrialization of the 16th to the 18th century has led to increased air pollution in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Conservation Physics" /&gt; Despite being indoors, paintings and their frames were susceptible to the damage from external air pollution.
Other pollution risks include factors such as light, sneezing, and spillage.&lt;ref name="Conservation Physics" /&gt;

===Pests=== 
Pests thrive off of organic materials such as wood and dust particles.&lt;ref name ="AICCM" /&gt; General housekeeping will prevent the accumulation of dirt, dust, and other material that might attract pests. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a non-toxic approach that creates an inhospitable environment for pests.&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/10.html?page=5|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research  :  Conservation|first=Philadelphia Museum of|last=Art|website=Philamuseum.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatment==
In order to best restore a frame to its intended appearance, conservators must blend traditional techniques with modern materials and approaches.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/conservation/frames.html|title=Frames|website=Nga.gov|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following treatments are common steps in the restoration of a frame:

===Preventative treatment=== 
The simplest step in treating a frame is dry dusting. Vacuums, sponges, erasers, brushes,&lt;ref name="Conservation Physics" /&gt; and solvent wipes &lt;ref name="Cool Conservation" /&gt;
are all tools and methods that should be used regularly to prevent dust build up.

===Conservation and restoration===  
Taking an initial assessment of the frame will determine the extent of treatment needed. Below are some of the following steps that may be necessary in the following processes:

====Disassembly====
In some cases, the frame may require disassembly. Disassembly can reveal the frame’s construction methods and give the conservator insight to the structural integrity of the frame. Disassembling the frame will also allow the conservator to assess damaged ornamentation and easily replicate necessary elements.

====Cleaning====
Testing small portions of the frame may be necessary to determine which method is best used to clean the frame. Possible materials used for cleaning include tri-ammonium citrate, Plextol B500, ethyl acrylate, EA, methyl methacrylate, and MMA.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-46/the-conservation-of-three-gilded-frames-for-the-new-paintings-galleries-at-the-victoria-and-albert-museum/|title=The Conservation of Three Gilded Frames for the New Paintings Galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum|website=Vam.ac.uk|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Picture frame carving.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture Frame Carving.|A carver reproduces the missing ornamentation on a frame''.]]

====Replacement of ornamentation====
Lost or damaged ornamentation may need to be replaced. It is not uncommon to see ornamentation that has been clumsily re-adhered by past restorations that include unoriginal elements. Depending on the type of ornamentation and the extent of the damage, elements may need to be recarved by a master carver, recast in plaster, or infilled with a reversible gesso &lt;ref name="Denver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denverartmuseum.org/article/staff-blogs/canaletto-frame-conservation|title=Canaletto - Frame Conservation|website=Denverartmuseum.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common material used in the recreation of ornamentation is composition, a mixture of animal glue, resin, linseed oil, and venetian turpentine.&lt;ref name="Soane"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOK7vMeYn6U|title=Frame Conservation at the Soane Museum|first=|last=SoaneMuseum|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=16 August 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once major ornamentation elements have been repaired, it is necessary in a gilded frame to reapply and stabilize the flaking gesso layer with hot rabbit skin glue.&lt;ref name="Art Care"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-care.com/articles/the-ancient-art-of-gilding.html|title=The Ancient Art of Gilding - Art-Care.com|website=Art-care.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gilding====
 [[File:Goldleaf.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Application of gold leaf.|Gold leaf is applied to a frame''.]] Once major structural treatments have been performed and the gesso layer stabilized, it is necessary to assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the gilding &lt;ref name="Cool Conservation" /&gt; Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the gilding has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.
It is essential to determine which gilding process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common gilding processes are water gilding and oil gilding. The difference in the two processes is in adhesive coating base. Water gilding is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a mineral spirit or denatured alcohol. Oil gilding can be cleaned with a mild water based soap solution.&lt;ref name="Art Care" /&gt;

====Toning====
Once the gold leaf has been applied, additional toning will be required to match the original gold. Toning is usually done by creating layers of color made out of animal glue and watercolor paint.&lt;ref name="Soane" /&gt;

In [[archeology]], a '''denticulate tool''' is a [[stone tool]] containing one or more edges that are worked into multiple notched shapes (or teeth), much like the toothed edge of a saw.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mousterian-industry Mousterian industry]". Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, such tools have been used as saws, more likely for meat processing than for wood. It is possible, however, that some or all of these notches were used for smoothing wooden shafts or for similar purposes.

These tools are included in the [[Mousterian]] tool industry by [[Neanderthal]] culture, proceeded by small hand axes and [[Scraper (archaeology)|side scrapers]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310003857 Application of a new typological approach to classifying denticulate and notched tools: the study of two Mousterian lithic assemblages]".

'''El Tepozteco''' is an archaeological site in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Morelos]]. It consists of a small temple to [[Tepoztecatl]], the [[Aztec]] god of the alcoholic beverage ''[[pulque]]''.&lt;ref name="CA98"&gt;Canto Aguilar 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]], various terraces and a small pyramid were built on one of the peaks of the [[Sierra de Tepoztlan]], overlooking the pre-Columbian town of [[Tepoztlan]]. The temple became important enough to attract pilgrims from as far away as [[Guatemala]], although the cult of Tepoztecatl was local to this site.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The temple itself stands at the western side of the site. It consists of a 6.4-meter-high platform supporting a 3.3-meter-high temple base. Upon this stand the remains of the temple building, the remains of which now stand 2.7 meters high.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt; The temple was formed of two rooms. The first room opened onto the temple stairs, with two pillars flanking the entrance. In the centre of this room a small hollow was found, containing traces of charcoal and [[copal]].&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="INAH"&gt;[http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01407.html El Tepozteco at INAH] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry to the small inner sanctum was also flanked by two pillars. The sculpture of Tepoztecatl was probably kept in this room.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="INAH"/&gt;

The temple was modified several times during its history. The first consisted of a narrowing of the entrance to the inner sanctum by building flanking walls against the formerly free-standing inner pillars.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="INAH"/&gt; The second, and most important, modification was the addition of stone benches and a small projecting cornice. On the cornice are bas-reliefs of the glyphs of the 20 days of the sacred [[tonalpohualli]] calendar.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;

Dwellings were built on the terraces on the eastern side of the site in order to house the resident priests and their helpers.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:El Tepozteco 2.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpted glyphs on the stone bench inside the temple shrine]]
In the ruins of the temple were found two fallen stones with glyphs, one stone bears the name of the eighth Aztec emperor [[Ahuizotl]], the other with the [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendrical date]] "10 rabbit". This date represents the year 1502 A.D., the year that this emperor died. From this, some archeologists have concluded that this was the year in which the temple was built, others suggest that these stones were added later to commemorate the death of the Aztec emperor.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt; Some glyphs include a turquoise crown and a shield with arrows, which have led investigators to conclude that the benches were built by the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] some time after 1452 A.D., the year when the Alliance conquered Tepoztlan.&lt;ref name="CA98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.450.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement''''' is a book by [[Michael Strangelove]] first published in 2005. It explores how [[digital piracy]] and [[cultural appropriation]] within [[Appropriation (art)|art]] and [[popular culture]] by Internet users influences [[cultural reproduction]] within [[capitalism]]. It was a Canadian [[Governor General's Award|Governor-General’s Award]] finalist in the category of non-fiction in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggla/2006/ig128053119096301686.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to Strangelove, the economic system known as capitalism promotes unequal [[social class|class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[gender]] relations. Thus capitalism invariably produces resistance. This resistance takes the form of a contest over the meaning of things and events. Structural changes in the architecture of communication lead to new forms and strategies of resistance. ''The Empire of Mind'' identifies characteristics of these structural changes and outlines their implications for resistance to capitalism’s definitional control over meaning.

''The Empire of Mind'' describes a theory of cultural transmission that takes into account a new structure of communication that is not found in the corporate (commercial) media systems of the pre-Internet era. Within this theory of cultural transmission the notion of an empire of mind is used to describe how capitalism operates as 'a violent and controlling system' (p.&amp;nbsp;10) that "tends toward totalization, embracing all before it within its homogenizing logic of social organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;12). While Strangelove describes capitalism as having a tendency towards totalization he also argues that such forces as consumer resistance and competition between corporations has ensured that capitalism has never achieved total control over individuals.

''The Empire of Mind'' includes an analysis of [[culture jamming]] which provides an example of how Internet-based cultural production subverts dominant symbolic economies and ideologies and paves the way for the emergence of new symbolic economies (belief systems). Culture jamming is presented as one example of the Internet audience's tendency to subvert privately owned meanings. Strangelove makes no claims about the overall potency or potential of culture jamming. Neither does he claim that the Internet heralds the envitable destruction of capitalism. While Strangelove does argue that the Internet is part of a new symbolic economy he makes no predictions as to the future state (dystopic or utopic) of capitalism's belief system.

Strangelove provides a scholarly definition of the term empire of mind and applies it within an analysis of new and old media. Given the premise that capitalism operates as a meaning-production system that exercises substantial control over our cultures and minds—an empire of mind --- the Internet is seen as subverting the dominant flow of meaning within capitalism's symbolic empire.

== Related uses of the term "Empire of (the) Mind" == &lt;!-- this section needs to be expanded --&gt;
The notion of an "empire of mind" (usually seen expressed as an "empire of ''the'' mind") has been found in literature since [[Alexis De Tocqueville]] first used it in the following oft quoted passage: &lt;blockquote&gt;
I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst the rest of the nation, enjoying more leisure and less harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind. The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis De Tocqueville, ''[[Democracy In America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase an "empire of ''the'' mind" usually denotes imperialism or a specific empire and has been applied to the United States, Britain, India, Iran and ancient Greece. Strangelove's use of the phrase was inspired by [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]'s statement, "The empires of the future are the empires of the mind."&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, Speech at Harvard University, September 6, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary on the thesis of ''The Empire of Mind''==
Howard A. Doughty writes that Strangelove "seems to have achieved a position of sensible moderation, an attitude toward the driving force of postmodern culture that allows it to be redeemed, rather than replaced. He embraces the liberal virtues of humanistic reformism. While supporting an attack on authoritarianism, sexism and fast food through new communications techniques, he avoids the logocentrism and the allegedly false promises of nineteenth and twentieth-century revolutionary thinkers."&lt;ref&gt;Howard A. Doughty, [http://www.senecac.on.ca/quarterly/2007-vol10-num02-spring/reviews/doughty5.html "Review of ''The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement''"], ''College Quarterly'', Spring 2007, vol. '''10''', issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christopher Moore, Strangelove "believes the fundamental empire today is capitalism’s. It operates, he argues, not just through state systems and the marketplace, but by propagating an empire of the mind that takes capitalism for granted. Capitalism is a meaning-production system, he declares ... The goal of capitalism’s empire is the commodification of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Moore, The Creators' Copyright Coalition, [http://www.creatorscopyright.ca/op-ed/2006-11-04/book-review-strangeloves-empire "Book Review: Strangelove’s Empire"], 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary of academic reviews ==
A review of this book by Darren Wershler-Henry in the ''Canadian Journal of Communication'' states, "There is also an inconsistency between Strangelove’s criteria for a useful model of the Internet and that for his model of capitalism. "Within critical theory," writes Strangelove, "philosophical and economic enquiry tends to recreate the Internet in the image of the twentieth century" (p.&amp;nbsp;98). Fair enough, but why does Strangelove rely on a model of capitalism that is every bit as dated?"&lt;ref&gt;Darren Wershler-Henry, [http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1935 "Review of ''The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement''"], ''Canadian Journal of Communication'', 2008, volume '''33''', issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of this book by [[Tarleton Gillespie]] in ''New Media and Society'' notes that "Strangelove is working very much from within a Marxist, critical theory of communication and society" and questions Strangelove's claim that "the file-trading of commercial music and film, which he sees as a widespread disregard for the principle of property, is not an aberration, but is in fact the resting state of the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;Tarleton Gillespie, ''New Media and Society'', volume '''9''', issue 3, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''Canadian Literature: A Quarterly of Criticism and Review'', by Michael Truscello, notes that Strangelove "is quick to point out, repeatedly, that he is not projecting utopian ends for Internet communication; rather, his "concern" is with what he calls "embryonic dynamics," emergent possibilities that may not realize a transformation of the social order for some time. In essence, "by simply allowing all voices a forum, the Internet subverts the [[hegemony|hegemonic]] construction of reality." Hegemonic appeals are unsustainable in an environment of "unconstrained communicative action," he suggests, and this is "the heart of the Internet's most probable long-term social effect."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Truscello, [http://www.canlit.ca/reviews-review.php?id=13054 "Review of ''The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement''"], ''Canadian Literature: A Quarterly of Criticism and Review'', Winter 2007, volume '''195'''.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005183419/http://www.canlit.ca/reviews-review.php?id=13054 |date=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''The Communication Review'' by Scott Uzelman notes that the "empire of mind" as defined by Strangelove "standardizes beliefs and wants that are "engineered" or "programmed" by capitalism and "constructed through the corporate media which acts as a propaganda tool for the elite."" Yet the reviewer contends that "'capitalism is not reducible to a belief system".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Uzelman, "Book Review: Exploring Possibilities for Mediated Resistance", ''The Communication Review'', 2006, volume '''9''', pp. 155-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''Politics and Culture'', by Alex Kashnabish, describes ''The Empire of Mind'' as a book that "challenges the prevailing assumptions surrounding the Internet and its possibilities". Kashnabish writes that this book "is at its strongest and most convincing when taking up the analysis of the Internet and its relationship to capitalism’s symbolic economy as well as in regards to the significant – if not insurmountable – challenges involved in enclosing the Internet and turning it into fully corporatized space. In both these respects, Strangelove’s argument is nuanced and persuasive."&lt;ref&gt;Alex Kashnabish, [http://aspen.conncoll.edu/politicsandculture/page.cfm?key=629 "Symbolic Subversion: Review of Michael Strangelove, ''The Empire of the Mind; Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement''"], ''Politics and Culture,'' (2008) Issue #2.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer suggests that Strangelove overstates the potential of culture jamming.

There are '''grooves''' ({{lang-sv|sliprännor}}, {{lang|sv|slipskåror}}. Sw-En translation: ''sharpening grooves'') carved into rock in many places in Europe, and some of them appear on the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Gotland]]. They are common in France, where they were used to polish [[stone axe]]s.

In Sweden, there are also grooves in north-western [[Scania]] and [[Halland]]. In [[Gantofta]] located {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Helsingborg]] a face of sandstone rock is engraved with thousands of grooves. Local tradition says they were made as [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1930talet/1936_129.pdf|first=Torsten|last=Mårtensson|title=Sliprännornas praktiska bruk|journal=[[Fornvännen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooves in France date from the [[Neolithic]] and are called ''polissoirs''. Those in  [[Aube|l’Aube]] date from c. 2500 to 2000 BCE. People who built [[dolmen]]s, erected [[menhir]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and made grooves supported an [[archaeological culture]] known as [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture|Seine-Oise-Marne]]. The l’Aube district had more than 130 monuments from this period including 49 grooves before 1927. Today there are only 34 including 16 grooves. Many stones were cut into roadstones or building blocks for homes.

Grooves have also been found in [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] in Finland and in Luxembourg, as well as at [[Fyfield Down]] in England.

3,600 grooves have been discovered on [[Gotland]],&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gannholm|first=Sören|trans-title=The Gotlandic grinding grooves – Stone age calendars?|url=http://stavar.stavgard.com/gotlslipsk/slipskaror.html|title=Gotlands slipskåror|publisher=Sören Gannholm|date=1993|isbn=91-630-1845-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 700 are in [[limestone]] outcrops, while the remainder are on c. 800 boulders and slabs. The grooves are {{convert|50|–|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, c. {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep and c. {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}wide.&lt;ref name="HenrikssonAstro"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Fornvännen]]|author=Henriksson, Göran |title=Astronomisk tolkning av slipskåror på Gotland|year=1983|url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf|publisher=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves began to attract scholarly attention in the 1850s. At first they were called "sharpening stones", but later they received the name "sword sharpening stones". After some time, newspapers and scholarly publications began to dispute this, since the shape of the grooves makes them unfit for sharpening swords. Another reason was that by 1933, more than 500 sites with grooves had been identified on Gotland. They were evenly distributed across the island. It was also noted that they ran in different directions and often crossed each other.

The dates and function of the grooves on Gotland have seen debate in recent decades between archaeologists who argue for a [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval date]] and some industrial function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanström|first=Lennart|date=1995|title=Slipskåror och järnhantering på Gotland|journal=Gotländskt arkiv|issue=67|location=Visby|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindström|first=Jonathan|date=1997|chapter=Fornlämningarnas orientering på Gotland: en kritisk granskning av den arkeoastronomiska tolkningen av slipskåror samt en studie av riktningsfördelningen hos öns forntida gravar, hus och medeltida kyrkor|title=Till Gunborg: arkeologiska samtal|publisher=Dept of Archaeology, [[Stockholm University]]|pages=497–508|editor1-first=Gunborg O.|editor1-last=Janzon|editor2-first=Agneta|editor2-last=Åkerlund|location=Stockholm|series=SAR : Stockholm archaeological reports, 1101-3087 ; 33|isbn=91-630-6053-1|id={{LIBRIS|7452427}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of an alternative theory who argue for a [[Neolithic]] date and a ritual calendar function. The latter support their view mainly with the idea that the direction of each groove might be given an astronomical interpretation, where each groove would mark a sightline towards a certain celestial phenomenon that may be reconstructed for a certain year during the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref name="HenrikssonAstro" /&gt; The grooves under overhangs in Scania cannot have been used as sightlines in this suggested manner.

Certain late 1st-millennium [[picture stone]]s on Gotland carry grooves that have been made after the relief of the stones was carved, which show the grooves to be late. Likewise with the level above current sea surface of the lowest grooved outcrops on the island, that shows them to be no older than AD&amp;nbsp;1000 judging from post-glacial shoreline displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munthe|first=Henr|chapter=Om Gotlands s.k.

''' Hazar Merd''' is a group of [[Paleolithic]] [[cave]] sites excavated by [[Dorothy Garrod]] in 1928. The caves are located south-southwest of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate]] in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amin|first1=OSM|title=The dark cave of Hazar Merd Group of Caves|url=http://www.ancient.eu/image/2770/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 March 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrod's soundings in two caves in the Hazar Merd group provided evidence of Middle and Epi-Paleolithic occupation.The Dark cave or ''Ashkawty Tarik'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] has a commanding view of the local valley and is close to a small spring and a village with the same name.

Dark Cave has a single lofty chamber 11 by 12 m wide. The [[Mousterian]] layer, level C, is over 3 m thick, containing many hearths and burnt flints and bones. The stone tool assemblage, of flint and chert, is dominated by side scrapers and Mousterian points, with no evidence of the [[Levallois technique]]. In the lowest reaches of level C, but still within Mousterian layers, two hand-axes were found. Side-scrapers slightly decrease in popularity towards the top of level C.

The faunal assemblage, although fragmentary, again shows a completely modem aspect, with bones from wild goat, red deer, gazelle, field mouse, mole rat, hare, bat and several birds of woodland and scrub habitat. This evidence, and that from the presence of snails of the species ''[[Helix salomonica]]'', indicates a mixed environment of woodland, grassland and scrub, much as exists today. A smaIl sounding in the adjacent Water Cave also revealed evidence of Mousterian occupation.

Garrod did not keep all the excavated material and she only kept those pieces that were topologically informative. Remaining pieces were thrown away at the site.

Hazar Merd and [[Shanidar Cave]] are the only excavated Middle Palaeolithic sites in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

[[File:Dedicated home theater.jpg|thumb|A dedicated home theater room with [[acoustic treatment]], professional wiring, equipment and speaker placing]]

'''Home cinema''', also called a '''home theater''', a '''home theatre''', and a '''theater room''', are home entertainment audio-visual systems that seek to reproduce a [[movie theater]] experience and mood using [[consumer electronics]]-grade video and [[home audio|audio]] equipment that is set up in a room or backyard of a private home. In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a  [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen [[cathode ray tube]] TV set. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and [[video projector]]s have changed the equipment used in home theatre set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive [[Blu-ray]] players in 2016 can also [[streaming video|"stream"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]] using subscription services such as [[Netflix]]). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a [[video rental store]] as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content).

Today, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a [[video projector]] or a large flat-screen high-resolution [[HDTV]] system, a [[movie]] or other video content on a [[DVD]] or high-resolution [[Blu-ray]] disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for [[stereo sound]]) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more [[surround sound]] speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency [[subwoofer]] speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.

==Introduction==
In the 1950s, playing [[home movies]] became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s created a new paradigm for [[home video]], as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a [[LaserDisc]] or [[VHS]] player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large [[rear-projection television]] set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the [[DVD-Video]] format (higher resolution than VHS), [http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital.html Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio] ("[[surround sound]]") speaker systems, and [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy [[Cathode Ray Tube]] HDTVs and flat screen TVs.  In the 2010s, affordable large [[HDTV]] flatscreen TVs, high resolution [[video projector]]s (e.g., [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]]), [[3D television]] technology and the high resolution [[Blu-ray Disc]] (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.

===Recent developments===
In the 2000s, the term "home cinema" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a [[DVD player]], a [[standard definition]] (SD)  [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]] with at least a 27-inch (69&amp;nbsp;cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive "[[home theater in a box]]" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) computer or [[digital media receiver]] streaming devices with a [[10-foot user interface]], a [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[video projector]] and [[projection screen]] with over {{convert|100|in|ft m|adj=on}} diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). [[3D television|3D-TV]]-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and [[Blu-ray 3D]] players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.

Home theater designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality [[video projector]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (no new models sold in U.S.), [[LCD]], [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[plasma display]], [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED), [[Silicon X-tal Reflective Display]] (SXRD), [[Laser TV]], rear-projection TV, [[video projector]], Standard-definition television (SDTV),  HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69&amp;nbsp;cm) measured diagonally, an [[AV receiver]] or [[pre-amplifier]] (surround processor) and amplifier combination  capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI [[VCR]], LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, [[Cable television|cable]] or [[Satellite television|satellite]] receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterbasicsfaq/f/htbasicfaq8.htm|title=How Much Cash Do I Need For A Home Theater Setup?|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most-expensive home-theater set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 (US), and which are in the homes of executives, [[celebrity|celebrities]] and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital [[Video projector|projector]]s and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and [[audiophile]]-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial theater performance.

==Design==
[[File:Basic Home Theatre Design Flow Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|This chart shows some of the design flow options for home theatre in the 2000s.]]
In the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the "[[movie theatre]] experience". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home theater includes the following components:
#'''Movie or other viewing content''': As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using "Smart" Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a "Smart" player, a user may be able to [[streaming video|"stream"]] movies, TV shows and other content over the [[Internet]]. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view [[digital photo]]s and other content on the big screen.
#'''Video and audio input devices''': One or more video/audio sources. High resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a [[Home theater PC|HTPC (Home Theater PC)]] with a [[Home theater PC|media center]] software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a [[10-foot user interface]] and [[remote control]]. In 2016, some of the more-expensive [[Blu-ray]] players can [[streaming video|"stream"]] movies and TV shows over the [[Internet]].
#'''Audio and video processing devices''': Input signals are processed by either a standalone [[AV receiver]] or a [[preamplifier]] and Sound Processor for complex [[surround sound]] formats such as [[Dolby Pro-Logic]]/and or [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro-logic II]], X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, [[Dolby Digital EX]], [[DTS-ES]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]]. The user selects the input (e.g., DVD, Blu-ray player, streaming video, etc.) at this point before it is forwarded to the output stage. Some AV receivers enable the viewer to use a remote control to select which input device or source to use.
#'''Audio output''': Systems consist of [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s (both of which may be integrated into a single [[AV receiver]]) and two or more [[loudspeaker]]s mounted in [[speaker enclosure]]s. The audio system requires at least a stereo [[power amplifier]] and two speakers, for [[stereo sound]]; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers (a [[5.1 surround sound]] system has left and right front speakers, a centre speaker, left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer [[speaker enclosure]]). Some users have 7.1 Surround Sound. It is possible to have up to 11 speakers with additional subwoofers.
#'''Video output''': A large-screen display, typically an [[HDTV]]. Some users may have a [[3D TV]].  As of 2015, flatscreen HDTV is the norm. Options include [[Liquid crystal display television]] (LCD), [[plasma TV]], [[OLED]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feldstein|first1=Justin|title=Next Generation Televisions: Beyond Conventional LED and LCD Technologies|url=http://audioden.com/blog/item/next-generation-televisions-beyond-conventional-led-and-lcd-technologies|website=Audio Den|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Home cinema users may also use a [[video projector]] and a [[movie screen]]. If a projector is used, a portable, temporary screen may be used or a screen may be permanently mounted on a wall.
#'''Seating and atmosphere''': Comfortable seating is often provided to improve the cinema feel. Higher-end home theaters commonly also have sound insulation to prevent noise from escaping the room and specialized wall treatment to balance the sound within the room. Some luxury home cinemas have [[movie theatre]]-style padded chairs for guests.

==Component systems vs. theater-in-a-box==
[[File:Home cinema 01.jpg|thumb|left|A mid-level home theater system consisting of large-screen [[LCD television]], a [[Digibox|Sky+ HD]] satellite TV box, and a [[DVD player]] (and a Blu-ray Disc-capable [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]]). The equipment is on a TV stand.]]

Home cinemas can either be set up by purchasing individual components one by one (e.g., buying a multichannel amp from one manufacturer, a Blu-ray player from another manufacturer, speakers from another company, etc.) or a by purchasing a [[HTIB]] (Home Theater in a Box) package which includes all of components from a single manufacturer, with the exception of a TV or projector. HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote. The benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room, or the consumer's needs.

However, to buy individual components, a consumer must have knowledge of sound system and video system design and electronics and she or he must do research on the specifications of each component.  For instance, some speakers perform better in smaller rooms while others perform better in larger rooms and seating location must be considered. One of the challenges with buying all the components separately is that the purchaser must understand speaker impedance, power handling, and HDMI compatibility and cabling. Given these challenges, HTIB systems are a simpler and more cost-effective solution for many families and consumers; they are also better suited to smaller living spaces in semi-detached homes or apartments/condos where noise could be an issue. As well, buying an HTIB package is often less expensive than buying separate components.

[[File:Apartment smart home theatre.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a [[HTIB]] arrangement in an apartment/condo setting consisting of a wall mounted [[LED]] [[Smart TV]], 3D [[Blu-ray]] home theatre system which features internet connected smart features such as [[Netflix]] and [[YouTube]], [[Xbox 360]] S, [[Xbox One]] S, and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game consoles, and [[Bell Aliant]] FibreOP [[IPTV]] [[High-definition video|HD]] [[Personal video recorder|PVR]] box.]]

==Dedicated rooms==
[[File:Projection-screen-home2.jpg|thumb|A large [[projection screen]] in a media room.]]
[[File:Home-theater-tysto2.jpg|thumb|This example is of home theater screening room with [[video projector]] mounted in a box on the ceiling. Built-in shelves provide a place for movie decor, DVDs, and equipment. Note the component stack on the right, where the audio receiver, DVD player, secondary monitor, and video game system are located.]]

Some home cinema enthusiasts build a dedicated room in their home for the theater. These more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements, including "room-in-a-room" construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen, often using a high definition projector. These installations are often designated as "screening rooms" to differentiate them from simpler, less-expensive installations. In some movie enthusiast's home cinemas, this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema, with a projector enclosed in its own [[projection booth]], specialized furniture, curtains in front of the [[projection screen]], movie posters, or a [[popcorn]] or [[vending machine]] with [[snack food]] and candy. More commonly, real dedicated home theaters pursue this to a lesser degree.

As of 2016, the days of the $100,000 and over home theater system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies, which has spurred a rapid drop in prices, making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before. This in turn has brought the true digital home theater experience to the doorsteps of the [[do-it-yourself]]ers, often for much less than the price of a low-budget economy car. As of 2016, consumer grade A/V equipment can meet some of the standards of a small modern commercial theater (e.g., [[THX]] sound).

===Seating===
Home theater seating consists of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies in a home theater. Some home theater seats have a [[cup holder]] built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has movie-theater-style chairs like those seen in a movie cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, [[tactile transducer]]s for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home theater seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.org/create-your-own-home-theater/ "Create Your Own Home Theater"], by Stargate Sonem, Articles Organization Free Directory.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backyard theater==
In homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home theater in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and [[swimming pool|pool]] parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with [[inflatable movie screen]]s and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile [[drive-in theater]]s that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other [[car audio|car radios]].

==History==

===1950s-1970s===
In the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] [[8 mm film]] ([[Pathé]] 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable [[movie projector]] onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show [[home movies]] of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or even private [[pornography|stag film]]s. Dedicated home cinemas were called ''screening rooms'' at the time and were outfitted with 16&amp;nbsp;mm or even 35&amp;nbsp;mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.

Portable home cinemas improved over time with color film, Kodak [[Super 8 mm film]] cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of [[home video]] in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.

===1980s===
The development of multi-channel audio systems and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified [[Sony Trinitron]] televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would "look and sound" like.

Over the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first "home-like" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.

===1990s===
In the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of [[DVD-Video]], Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.

===2000s===
[[File:2000s home theater, "California Casual".jpg|thumb|A home cinema from the late 2000s, using a [[rear projection television]].]]
In the 2000s, developments such as [[high-definition video]], [[Blu-ray]] disc (as well as the now-obsolete [[HD DVD]] format, which lost the [[format war]] to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a  more-affordable price.  Newer [[lossless audio]] from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, [[Digital Theater System|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, [[10.2 surround sound|10.2]], and [[22.2 surround sound|22.2]]) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.

===2010s===

By the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some [[4K resolution|4K]] content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first [[4K Blu-ray]] discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless [[surround sound]] encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.

As a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/projectors-vs-tvs/2/|title=Is there any reason to own a projector when big TVs are so cheap?

Consumer-grade [[OLED]] TVs measuring 55&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and above began to emerge in the second half of the decade. These had even better black levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-lcd-2924602|title=OLED vs LED LCD: Which is the best display technology? {{!}} Trusted Reviews|date=2017-09-12|work=Trusted Reviews|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2018, video projectors remained the only viable option when screen sizes much over 80&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; are needed.

==Entertainment equipment standards==
Noise Criteria (NC) are noise-level guidelines applicable to cinema and home cinema. For this application, it is a measure of a room's [[ambient noise level]] at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be [[THX]] certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the [[dynamic range]] of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewscon. [https://reviewscon.com/best-home-theater-system-under-500/ "Design the Ultimate Home Theater—On a Budget."] ''Home Theater.''&lt;/ref&gt; Some NC levels are:

*NC 40: Significant but not a dooming level of ambient noise; the highest "acceptable" ambient noise level. 40 decibels is the lower [[sound pressure level]] of normal talking; 60 being the highest.
*NC 30: A good NC level; necessary for THX certification in cinemas.
*NC 20: An excellent NC level; difficult to attain in large rooms and sought after for dedicated home cinema systems. For example, for a home cinema to be THX certified, it has to have a rating of NC 22.&lt;ref&gt;DeBoer, Clint (2007).[http://www.audioholics.com/news/trade-show-coverage/2004-cedia-expo/thx-certified-home-theater-program "THX Certified Home Theater Program."] ''Audioholics Online A/V Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*NC 10: Virtually impossible noise criteria to attain; 10 decibels is associated with the sound level of calm breathing.

Projectors used for home cinemas have a set of recommended criteria:

*Brightness, usually at least 1800 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s.
*Resolution (the number of [[pixel]]s making up the image), usually at least 1920×1080, one of the [[HDTV]] standards.
*Contrast (how well white, black and greyscales are displayed), usually a minimum of 5000:1.{{Elucidate|date=February 2016}}
*[[HDMI]] connection sockets (Although some people use older [[Component video]],connections with three-cord sockets for the different individual colours)
*Good quality manufacturers, although this is a subjective element which depends upon user tastes and budget. For one user with a modest budget, "good quality" may mean a mainstream [[consumer electronics]] brand; for a well-to-do user, a [[Christie (company)|Christie]] projector may be their interpretation of "good quality" (Christie units are widely used in professional, commercial theatres)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Ice Wars''' was an annual elite [[figure skating]] team competition. The first Ice Wars took place in 1994. The competition format was "Team World" vs. "Team USA" or "Team North America". The 2005 competition was one exception, with the format changed to a "Battle of the Sexes" format, Men vs. Ladies.  It was an unsanctioned made-for-TV professional event, meaning that skaters who participated would lose their [[amateur sports#Figure skating|eligibility]] to compete in the [[Winter Olympics]] and other events recognized by the [[International Skating Union]].

Men, ladies, [[pair skating|pair skaters]], and [[ice dancing|ice dancers]] have all taken part in Ice Wars, though in 2005 only single skaters competed. 

The event took  place in November, changing locations each year. 

The 2001 competition was renamed "World Ice Challenge" after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Impression, soleil levant]]'' (''Impression, Sunrise''), 1872, oil on canvas, [[Musée Marmottan Monet]], [[Paris]]. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]
'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.

The development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].

==Overview==
[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]

Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short "broken" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.

[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Musée d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].

==Beginnings==
In the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war—the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. "Impressionism: Art and Modernity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

In the early 1860s, four young painters—[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Frédéric Bazille]]—met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2D_ehhO_14QC&amp;pg=PA116 Canvases and Careers: Institutional Change in the French Painting World]''. University of Chicago Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|0226894878}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Café Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[Édouard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Taube G. "Armand Guillaumin", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]], ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.&lt;ref&gt;Seiberling, Grace, "Impressionism", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' ("Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers") to exhibit their artworks independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1994, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eugène Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[Édouard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].

[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890–1891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,
:''Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the "purest" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that "the Salon is the real field of battle" where a reputation could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1976), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-François Raffaëlli]], [[Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of "opening doors to first-come daubers".&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq= ''Impressionism; a Centenary Exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974–February 10, 1975'']. [New York]: [Metropolitan Museum of Art]. p. 190. {{ISBN|0870990977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 475–476.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impressionist techniques==
[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]
French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eugène Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Théodore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Turner]]—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].
* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. 
* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]], and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"/&gt; The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as [[cerulean blue]],&lt;ref name="The Met"/&gt; which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pdFOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= ''Historical painting techniques, materials, and studio practice: preprints of a symposium, University of Leiden, Netherlands, 26-29 June, 1995'']. [Marina Del Rey, Calif.]: Getty Conservation Institute. p. 159. {{ISBN|0892363223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

London: Routledge. p. 177]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"/&gt; By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq= ''The conservation of easel paintings''. London: Routledge. p. 178]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and composition==
[[File:Hay Harvest at Éragny, 1901, Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Hay Harvest at Éragny,'' 1901, [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]]]
Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painters]] as [[Jan Steen]], had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (1989), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photography]] was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.&lt;ref&gt;Varnedoe, J. Kirk T. ''The Artifice of Candor: Impressionism and Photography Reconsidered'', Art in America 68, January 1980, pp. 66-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert L. ''Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society'', Yale University Press, 1988, pp. 311, 319 {{ISBN|0300050836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berthe Morisot Reading.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berthe Morisot]], ''Reading,'' 1873, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt;

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt; The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt; Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".&lt;ref name="impressionism757"&gt;Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Jardin à Sainte-Adresse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Garden at Sainte-Adresse|Jardin à Sainte-Adresse]],'' 1867, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437133?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=Claude+Monet&amp;pos=1 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; a work showing the influence of Japanese prints]]
Another major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's ''Jardin à Sainte-Adresse'', 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=Terrasse+%C3%A0+Sainte-Adresse+japanese+prints&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dwnPUtm_GKnNsQTV-4KIDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrasse%20%C3%A0%20Sainte-Adresse%20japanese%20prints&amp;f=false Gary Tinterow, Origins of Impressionism, Metropolitan Museum of Art,1994, page 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Degas]] was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann; Karabelnik, et al. (1994), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Dance Class'' ''(La classe de danse)'' of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the ''[[Little Dancer of Fourteen Years]]''.

==Associates and influenced artists==
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'', 1874, [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include [[Jean-Louis Forain]] (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/decouvrir/expositions/impressionnisme/theme_imprart.htm|title=Joconde : catalogue collectif des collections des musées de France|website=www.culture.gouv.fr|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Zandomeneghi]] was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean Béraud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p.476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

==Beyond France==
[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]
[[File:Hipp hipp hurra! Konstnärsfest på Skagen - Peder Severin Krøyer.jpg|thumb|[[Peder Severin Krøyer]]'s 1888 work ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'', held at the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]], shows members of the [[Skagen Painters]].]]

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:
* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell|Edmund Charles Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[Catherine Wiley]] and [[J. Alden Weir]].
* The [[Australian Impressionism|Australian Impressionists]], including [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (who were prominent members of the [[Heidelberg School]]), and [[John Russell (Australian artist)|John Russell]], a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.
* The [[Amsterdam Impressionism|Amsterdam Impressionists]] in the [[Netherlands]], including [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Willem Witsen]] and [[Jan Toorop]].
* [[Anna Boch]], Vincent van Gogh's friend [[Eugène Boch]], [[Georges Lemmen]] and [[Théo van Rysselberghe]], Impressionist painters from [[Belgium]].
* [[Ivan Grohar]], [[Rihard Jakopič]], [[Matija Jama]], and [[Matej Sternen]], Impressionists from Slovenia. Their beginning was in the school of [[Anton Ažbe]] in Munich and they were influenced by [[Jurij Šubic]] and [[Ivana Kobilca]], Slovenian painters working in Paris
* [[Wynford Dewhurst]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] were well known Impressionist painters from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Pierre Adolphe Valette]], who was born in France but who worked in Manchester, was the tutor of [[L. S. Lowry]].
* The [[German Impressionism|German Impressionists]], including [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Ernst Oppler]], [[Max Slevogt]] and [[August von Brandis]].
* [[László Mednyánszky]] in Hungary
* [[Theodor von Ehrmanns]] and [[Hugo Charlemont]] who were rare Impressionists among the more dominant [[Vienna Secessionist]] painters in Austria
* [[William John Leech]], [[Roderic O'Conor]], and [[Walter Osborne]] in Ireland
* [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Valentin Serov]] in Russia
* [[Francisco Oller|Francisco Oller y Cestero]], a native of [[Puerto Rico]] and a friend of Pissarro and Cézanne
* [[James Nairn]] in [[New Zealand]].
* [[William McTaggart]] in [[Scotland]].
* [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist
* [[Władysław Podkowiński]], a [[Poland|Polish]] Impressionist and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]
* [[Nicolae Grigorescu]] in [[Romania]]
* [[Nazmi Ziya Güran]], who brought Impressionism to [[Turkey]]
* [[Chafik Charobim]] in [[Egypt]]
* [[Eliseu Visconti]] in [[Brazil]]
* [[Joaquín Sorolla]] in Spain
* Faustino Brughetti, [[Fernando Fader]], [[Candido Lopez]], [[Martín Malharro]], Walter de Navazio, [[Ramón Silva]] in Argentina
* [[Skagen Painters]] a group of Scandinavian artists who painted in a small Danish fishing village
* [[Nadežda Petrović]] in [[Serbia]]
* [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]] in [[Iceland]]
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] in [[Japan]]
* [[Frits Thaulow]] in [[Norway]] and later France.

==Sculpture, photography and film==
The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S., and Helen Gardner (2014). ''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.

[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L’Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

==Music and literature==
{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}
[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]
Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.

[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]

==Post-Impressionism==
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul Cézanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.

'''John Ricardo I.''' "'''Juan'''" '''Cole''' (born October 23, 1952) is an American academic and commentator on the modern [[history of the Middle East|Middle East]] and [[history of South Asia|South Asia]].&lt;ref name=siva/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://events.umn.edu/event?occurrence=398490;event=114965 Dead link at University of Minnesota Events web page.&lt;/ref&gt; He is Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the [[University of Michigan]]. Since 2002, he has written a [[weblog]], ''Informed Comment'' (''juancole.com'') which is also syndicated on [[Truthdig]].com.

== Background and education ==
Cole was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. His father served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Army Signal Corps]]. When Cole was age two, his family left New Mexico for France. His father completed two tours with the U.S. military in France (a total of seven years) and one 18-month stay at [[Kagnew Station]] in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]] (then [[Ethiopia]]). (Cole reports that he first became interested in Islam in Eritrea, which has a population roughly half Christian and half Muslim.) Cole was schooled at a variety of locations, twelve schools in twelve years, at a series of dependent schools on military bases but also sometimes in civilian schools. Some schooling occurred in the United States, particularly in [[North Carolina]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name="interview1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people5/Cole/cole-con1.html | year =2005 | title = Juan Cole Interview: Conversations with History; Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley | first = | last = | accessdate = 2007-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole obtained his undergraduate degree at [[Northwestern University]] in 1975, having majored in History and Literature of Religions. For two quarters in his senior year he conducted a research project in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] and returned to the city as a graduate student in the fall of 1975, but the civil war prevented Cole from continuing his studies there. Therefore, he pursued a master's degree at the [[American University in Cairo]] in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, graduating in 1978. Cole then returned to Beirut for another year and worked as a translator for a newspaper.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; In 1979 Cole enrolled at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] as a doctoral student in the field of Islamic Studies, graduating in 1984. After graduation, Cole was appointed Assistant Professor of History at the [[University of Michigan]] where he became a full professor in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/jcpers.htm |title=Resume of Juan Cole |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole was from a mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage but was brought up a non-denominational Protestant on army bases. In the late 1960s and the 1970s he became interested in Eastern religions, including Buddhism. Cole became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in 1972 as an undergraduate at Northwestern, and the religion later became a focus of his academic research. He resigned from the faith in 1996 after disputes with Bahá'í leadership concerning the [[Bahá'í administration|Bahá'í system of administration]], particularly the requirement to [[Bahá'í review|review]] works by Bahá'í authors when writing about the religion. He later became uninterested in organized religion as a personal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juancole.com/about/toward-authorized-biography |title=Biography of Juan Cole |publisher=juancole.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole married Shahin Malik in [[Lahore]] in 1982. The couple has a son, Arman, born in 1987.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web | title = Juan R. I. Cole Publications | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/jcpers.htm | work = Curriculum Vitae | publisher = Juan Cole's academic website| accessdate = 2006-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointments and awards ==

Cole was awarded [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright-Hays fellowships]] to India (1982) and to Egypt (1985–1986). In 1991 he held a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grant for the study of [[Shia Islam]] in [[Iran]]. From 1999 until 2004, Juan Cole was the editor of ''[[The International Journal of Middle East Studies]]''. He has served in professional offices for the [[American Institute of Iranian Studies]] and on the editorial board of the journal ''Iranian Studies''.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; He is a member of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]],&lt;ref name = "Cole MESA"&gt;{{Cite web | title = MESA Members » Juan Cole | url = https://mesana.org/mymesa/directory_mem.php?page=/mymesa/directory.php?ltype=lname%7c%7camp;lvalue=C&amp;mem=72ac1e2184cebd3cb67837527412903a | website = mesana.org | accessdate = 8 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the organization's president for 2006.&lt;ref name = "Pres letter 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cole | first = Juan | title = The Importance of Being Heard | url = http://mesana.org/publications/imes/presidents-letters.html#Cole | journal = MESA Newsletter | volume = 28 | issue = February 2006 | accessdate = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he received the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism administered by [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/history/facstaff/facnews.asp ''Faculty News and Awards''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519192548/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/history/facstaff/facnews.asp |date=2011-05-19 }}, Department of History: [[University of Michigan]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic interests ==

Cole became interested in Islam and Arabic while a teenager living in Eritrea when his father was stationed there. He studied Arabic at Northwestern University, in Beirut, at the American University in Cairo, and at the University of California, Los Angeles; his study included classical historical, theological and philosophical texts and classical and modern literature. He speaks [[Arabic]] ([[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] as well as [[Levantine Arabic|Lebanese]] and [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] dialects), [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu]], and can read [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. He also knows French, German and Spanish.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;

===Modern Egypt===
Among Cole's major academic specializations has been the history of modern [[Egypt]], including [[Sunni Islam]]. His second monograph was on the nineteenth-century [['Urabi Revolt]], and his fifth was on the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French invasion and occupation of the country]] under [[Napoleon]]. Egypt was one focus of his ''Engaging the Muslim World'' (Palgrave, 2009). He has authored nearly a dozen major journal articles and book chapters on Egypt.

===Shia Islam: Iran, Iraq and India===
Modern [[Shia Islam]] has been a major preoccupation in Cole's scholarship. The [[Shia Crescent]] runs from [[Saudi Arabia]] to India, and Cole has written on various countries in this arc as well as on Islam in general, the secular history and politics of the region, and comparative studies. His first monograph was on the modern history of Shi'a Islam in [[North India]]. His fourth book was a treatment of modern Shi'i movements throughout [[South Asia|South]] and [[Western Asia]]. He has published over two dozen journal articles and book chapters on modern Shia Islam.

===Current affairs history===
After September 11, 2001, Cole turned increasingly to writing on radical Muslim movements, the Iraq War, United States foreign policy, and the Iran crisis. His scholarship was influenced by his blog, "Informed Comment", founded in 2002. He has pioneered in the field of what he calls not "contemporary history" but "current affairs history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/content/46/3/658.abstract?rss=1 |title="Blogging Current Affairs History", Journal of Contemporary History July 2011 vol. 46 no. 3 658-670 |publisher=Contemporary History |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also "The Case for Current Affairs History"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/01/11/case-current-affairs-history |title=The Case for Current Affairs History |publisher=Inside Higher Education |date=2012-01-11 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khalil Gibran translations===
[[Kahlil Gibran]] is a well-known Lebanese-American poet, essayist, and artist who wrote in Arabic as well as English. Cole has translated three volumes of his Arabic-language literary writings. One of these, ''Broken Wings'' (''al-Ajnihah al-Mutakassira'', 1912), is alleged to have been the first Arabic-language novel, and has early feminist themes, protesting against arranged marriage and religious corruption.

===Global Americana Institute===
After September 11, Cole founded the Global Americana Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaminst.com// |title=Global Americana Institute |publisher=Global Americana Institute |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to translate works concerning the United States into Arabic. The first volume was selected works of [[Thomas Jefferson]], translated for the first time into Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juancole.com/2011/04/thomas-jefferson-in-arabic.html |title=Thomas Jefferson in Arabic |publisher=Dar al-Saqi |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second is a translation of a biography of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] along with selected speeches and writings (scheduled for fall 2012). The Institute is partnering with Dar al-Saqi books in this series. Cole has successfully solicited contributions through his website to support the translations and publications.

===Bahá'í studies===
Cole converted to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in 1972, but later resigned in 1996 after conflicts with members of the [[Bahá'í administration]] who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bahá'í version of [[Covenant-breaker|excommunication]]. Cole went on to critically attack the Bahá'í Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2000, describing a prominent Bahá'í as "inquisitor" and "bigot", and describing Bahá'í institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Momen | first = Moojan | title =Marginality and Apostasy in the Baha'i Community | journal = Religion | volume =37 | pages =187–209 | year =2007 | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_marginality_apostasy | doi=10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called '''H-Bahai''', which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/ |title=H-Bahai Website |publisher=H-net.org |date =  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Report on the H-Bahai Digital Library| author=Cole, Juan R. I. | journal=[[Iranian Studies (journal)|Iranian Studies]] | date=Winter–Summer 2002 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=191–196 | jstor=4311442 | doi=10.1080/00210860208702016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt;

Before resigning, Cole had several works published through Bahá'í publishers and co-edited an online journal (''Occasional Papers in the Shaykhi, Babi, and Baha'i Religions,'' associated with H-Bahai). Some of these were translations, including several "unofficial" scriptural translations, and two volumes by/about early Bahá'í theologian [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]].&lt;ref&gt;They are: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fumT1mWfzDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Letters and Essays 1886-1913 (Rasa'il va Raqa'im) of Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani]'' [tr. from Arabic and Persian] (Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1985); and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8QUke08g-OgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Miracles and Metaphors (Ad-Durar al-bahiyyah) of Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani]'' [tr. from the Arabic and annotated](Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; He has maintained much of this material, as well as other documents and links, online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/bahaixb.htm |title=Baha'i Studies: Papers, Translations, Documents |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalism and media appearances ==

Cole has written a great deal of journalism, although much more in the form of commentary than direct news gathering. From 2004 to 2009, Cole had a regular column at ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. Since 2009, he has written semi-regularly for [[Truthdig]] and [[Tom Engelhardt]]'s Tomdispatch.com.

He has published op-eds on the Mideast at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', ''The [[Boston Review]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', the ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'', ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun magazine]]''

Cole has been a regular guest on ''[[The NewsHour]]'' at the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], and has appeared widely on television shows such as ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[ABC Evening News]], the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'', ''[[Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer]]'', [[Al Jazeera]] and [[CNN Headline News]]. ''[[Charlie Rose (TV show)|Charlie Rose]]'', ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'', ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, "Resume", http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/jcpers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to radio, he has also been a frequent guest on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] and has been interviewed by [[Ian Masters (journalist)|Ian Masters]] (KPFK), and has been interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] ("Fresh Air") and [[Diane Rehm]], among many others.

Cole was occasionally cited in the press as a Middle East expert in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Melinda Beck, et al., "The Case Against War", ''Newsweek'' (29 October 1990) p. 24; "The Gulf War", ''Los Angeles Times'' (13 February 1991) p. 8; Scott Shane, "Muslim world suffers by actions of terrorists", ''The Baltimore Sun'' (23 August 1998) p. 1A; and Bill Schiller, "Locals tied to Al Jihad terror network" ''Toronto Star'' (21 October 2001) p. A10.&lt;/ref&gt; He became much more prominent after 2002, when he began publishing his weblog.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Guyette, "The Blog of War", ''Metrotimes'' (25 August 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 onwards, Cole became a widely recognized public intellectual. ''Foreign Policy'' commented in 2004, "Cole's transformation into a public intellectual embodies many of the dynamics that have heightened the impact of the blogosphere. He wanted to publicize his expertise, and he did so by attracting attention from elite members of the blogosphere. As Cole made waves within the virtual world, others in the real world began to take notice".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Drezner and Henry Farrell, "[https://foreignpolicy.com/users/login.php?story_id=2707&amp;URL=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2707&amp;page=1 Web of Influence]", ''Foreign Policy'' (November/December 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

His focus has primarily been Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt and the Arab Spring. He has also occasionally written or given interviews about Israel and the Palestinians.

==''Informed Comment'' blog==

Since 2002, Cole has published the blog ''Informed Comment'', covering "History, Middle East, South Asia, Religious Studies, and the [[War on Terror]]". Blog entries include comments on widely reported articles in Western media, summaries of important articles from Arabic and Israeli news sources, and letters and discussions with both critics and supporters.

The blog has won various awards; as of April 2006 the most prominent is the 2005 James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism from [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.juancole.com/2006/03/cole-receives-aronson-award-from.html Cole Receives Aronson Award from Hunter College]", ''Informed Comment'', March 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also received two 2004 [[Koufax Awards]]: the "Best Expert Blog" and the "Best Blog Post".&lt;ref&gt;Drum, Kevin. [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005713.php Koufax Awards], ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' blog, February 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since dropped off the list, but ''Informed Comment'' has been ranked as the 99th most popular blog on the Internet by [[Technorati]] on October 21, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/ |title=Technorati blog ranking page |publisher=Technorati.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429210506/http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/ |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole was a strong critic of the [[George W. Bush administration]] and is one of the most respected foreign policy commentators amongst [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;The Hotline: National Journal's Daily Briefing on Politics, [http://blogdirectory.nationaljournal.com/2006/10/informed_comment.html Blogometer Profiles: Informed Comment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123183054/http://blogdirectory.nationaljournal.com/2006/10/informed_comment.html |date=2006-11-23 }}, [[National Journal]], October 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 28, 2006 issue of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' featured a story on Cole's blog and its role in his career. Following essays by several academic bloggers, Cole was given a chance to respond to the question of whether academics should risk career advancement by blogging. His reply, in part, was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question is whether Web-log commentary helps or damages an academic's career. It is a shameful question. Intellectuals should not be worrying about "careers", the tenured among us least of all. Despite the First Amendment, which only really protects one from the government, most Americans who speak out can face sanctions from other institutions in society. Journalists are fired all the time for taking the wrong political stance. That is why most bloggers employed in the private sector are anonymous or started out trying to be so.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i47/47b00601.htm Can Blogging Derail Your Career]? 7 Bloggers Discuss the Case of Juan Cole". ''Chronicle of Higher Education: The Chronicle Review'' 52:47 (28 July 2006) p. B6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In that same article, he was referred to as a [[intellectual|public intellectual]] by associate professor of culture and communication at [[New York University]] [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]].&lt;ref name=siva&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/cgi2-bin/printable.cgi?article=http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i47/47b00602.htm |first=Siva |last=Vaidhyanathan |date=2006-06-28 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |title=Can Blogging Damage Your Career? The Lessons of Juan Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activities ==
In 2004, the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] requested Cole's testimony at hearings to better understand the situation in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2004/ColeTestimony040420.pdf Juan Cole's Senate Testimony Brief]'', [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], April 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole is an avid [[science fiction]] fan and has a strong personal interest in [[human rights]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/index/indexd.htm Juan R. I. Cole: Personal Interests], "Juan R. I. Cole Home Page", [[University of Michigan]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

Generally speaking, Cole approaches the Middle East and Western Asia from the point of view of [[anti-imperialism]]. Viewing the USA as a colonialist power, he sees it as defending the post-World War I "[[Sykes–Picot Agreement|Sykes–Picot]]/[[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] architecture" (described as "a colossal failure") against [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] or pan-Islamic challengers. These foundered for various reasons, especially "particularism". The U.S., like previous empires, seeks to take advantage of such internal rivalries in order to "divide and rule".&lt;ref name="juancole2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2002/09/architecture-of-middle-east-it-has-been.html|title=The Architecture of the Middle East |publisher=Juancole.com |date=September 7, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorism]], he explains (after comparing several countries in the region), is the result of foreign occupation in combination with weak states.&lt;ref name="juancole2002"/&gt;

Given his background in the 1960s and 1970s religious counter-culture, he views Islam (along with other religions) as essentially good, but distorted by certain of its political appropriators (and critics).&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Juan, [http://www.juancole.com/2006/03/peace-and-love-in-quran-list-of.html "Peace And Love In Quran List Of"], ''Informed Comment'', 03/12/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===

Cole mastered Persian in the 1970s and 1980s and has written academically on Iran's early modern and modern history, including the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period and the Islamic Republic from 1979.

Cole supported the reformist president [[Mohammad Khatami]] and rued his succession by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. He reports that in 2003, Iran (addressing the Bush administration through the Swiss embassy) proposed a comprehensive peace agreement, which Bush refused even to discuss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2006/05/iran-offered-recognition-of-israel.html |title=Iran Offered Recognition Of Israel |publisher=Juancole.com |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole viewed the 2009 presidential election as having been&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2009/06/chatham-house-study-definitively-shows.html |title=Chatham House Study Definitively Shows |publisher=Juancole.com |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; stolen by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Cole wrote numerous posts warning that the Bush administration was attempting to create a war with Iran. He suggested that sabre-rattling offered a way for two unpopular regimes to attract nationalistic support.&lt;ref name="juancole3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2006/04/iran-can-now-make-glowing-mickey-mouse.html |title=Iran Can Now Make glowing Mickey Mouse Watches |publisher=Juancole.com |date=April 12, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-26}} [http://www.juancole.com/2006/04/page/10 Alternative website address. Retrieved 2011-11-28.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also speculated that the Bush administration's objective in Iran was to control future supplies of oil and natural gas, while denying them to energy-hungry China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2006/08/one-ring-to-rule-them-wholesale.html |title=One Ring To Rule Them Wholesale |publisher=Juancole.com |date=August 6, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the nuclear issue, Cole wrote in 2007 that "Iran is a good ten years away from having a bomb," and points out that [[Ali Khamenei]] and other leaders have condemned nuclear weapons as un-Islamic.&lt;ref name="juancole3"/&gt; Cole also dismissed the Bush administration's allegation that Iran has supported terrorism in Iraq or Afghanistan, arguing rather that the United States had lent support to anti-Iranian terrorist groups such as the [[Kurdistan Free Life Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2007/10/us-sanctions-on-iran.html |title=Informed Comment: US Sanctions on Iran |publisher=Juancole.com |date=October 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole chastised several U.S. presidential candidates, including [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], and [[Mitt Romney]], for making bellicose statements about Iran in order to present themselves in a tougher or more conservative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/10/17/iran/ |title=The Iran hawks |publisher=Salon.com |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole is also a vocal critic of [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Ahmadinejad]]. He has written that "I profoundly disagree with his characterization of Israel, which is a legitimate United Nations member state". He also considers [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad#Allegations of Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism|Ahmadinejad's holocaust denial]] to be "monstrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2007/06/ahmadinejad-i-am-not-anti-semitic.html |title=Ahmadinejad: "I am not anti-Semitic" |publisher=Juancole.com |date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have traded barbs regarding the translation and meaning of a passage referring to Israel in a speech by Iran President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. Fathi Nazila of ''[[The New York Times]]'''s [[Tehran]] bureau translated the passage as "Our dear Imam [Khomeini] said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map."&lt;ref name="r26"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/weekinreview/30iran.html?ex=1161230400&amp;en=26f07fc5b7543417&amp;ei=5070 | title = Text of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Speech | accessdate = 2006-10-17 | last = Fathi | first = Nazila | date = October 30, 2005| newspaper = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published at the [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] website, Hitchens accused Cole of attempting to minimize and distort the meaning of the speech, which Hitchens understood to be a repetition of "the standard line" that "the state of Israel is illegitimate and must be obliterated." Hitchens also denigrated Cole's competence in both Persian and "plain English" and described him as a Muslim apologist.&lt;ref name="Hitchens"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | title = The Cole Report: When it comes to Iran, he distorts, you decide | first = Christopher | last = Hitchens | date = May 2, 2006 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2140947 | accessdate = 2007-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole responded that while he personally despised "everything Ahmadinejad stands for, not to mention the odious Khomeini",&lt;ref name="ICHitchens"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.juancole.com/2006/05/hitchens-hacker-and-hitchens.html | date = May 3, 2006 | title = Hitchens the Hacker; And, Hitchens the Orientalist And, "We don't Want Your Stinking War! | first = Juan | last = Cole | accessdate = 2006-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he nonetheless objected to the ''New York Times'' translation.&lt;ref name="ICHitchens" /&gt; Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel ("that he wants to play Hitler to Israel's Poland"). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be "the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time," a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one.&lt;ref name="ICHitchens"/&gt; He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name="ICHitchens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News Hits staff, [http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9200 ''Juan up''], [[Metro Times]], 5/10/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Mowbray, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20060521-102935-2861r.htm ''Hatchet man or scholar?''], [[The Washington Times]], May 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

Cole was asked to address the pros and cons of the building war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, "The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran." Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, "A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government." He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's "weapons of mass destruction" or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States.&lt;ref name="juancole2003-1"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.juancole.com/2003/01/journal-of-international-institute.html |title= The Risks of Peace and The Costs of War ...|journal=Journal of the International Institute, University of Michigan |&lt;!--date=Winter 2003 --&gt;|volume= 10 |issue= 2 |page= 3 |date= January 28, 2003 |accessdate= 2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole admitted that he had had "mixed feelings" on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality.&lt;ref name="juancole2003-2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2003/03/british-are-asserting-that-there-has.html |title=British Are Asserting That There Has ...|publisher=Juancole.com |date=March 26, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration).&lt;ref name="juancole2003-3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2003/01/chirac-warns-bush-not-to-launch-a-unilateral-attack-on-iraq.html |title=Chirac Warns Bush not to Launch a Unilateral Attack on Iraq ...|publisher=Juancole.com |date=2003-01-18 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become "cynical" about the Bush administration motives for the war.&lt;ref name="juancole2003-4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2003/01/cynical-about-bush-administration-motives-for-attacking-iraq.html |title=Cynical about Bush Administration Motives for Attacking Iraq ...|publisher=Juancole.com |date=2003-01-30 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that "for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides."&lt;ref name="juancole2003-5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2003/03/my-mind-and-heart-are-like-those-of-so.html |title=My Mind And Heart Are Like Those Of So ...|publisher=Juancole.com |date=March 19, 2003 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: "The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act."&lt;ref name="juancole2006-6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2005/06/cole-on-iraq-2002-2003-by-way-it-has.html |title=Cole On Iraq 2002 2003 By Way It Has ... |publisher=Juancole.com |date=June 12, 2006|accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole blamed the [[George W. Bush administration]] for creating what he calls a "failed state" in Iraq. He particularly cites its decision to disband the [[Iraqi Army]], its treatment of prisoners, its alienation of neighboring countries, its corrupt economic policies, and long delays in organizing elections and forming a (weak) government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = Critique of US Policy in Iraq | url = http://www.juancole.com/2006/05/critique-of-us-policy-in-iraq-bush.html | publisher = Informed Comment | date = 24 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's decision to invade Iraq, Cole wrote in 2005, resulted from a "coalition of disparate forces" within the Bush administration, "each with its own rationale" for going to war. He identifies: Bush's own "obsession with restoring family honor" slighted by Saddam Hussein's remaining in power after the Gulf War; [[Dick Cheney]]'s interest in benefits to the oil industry (he cites "billions in no-bid contracts for [Halliburton]"—of which Cheney was CEO in the 1990s—and which "saved [[Halliburton]] from bankruptcy"); Cheney's "[[Manichaean]], Cold War-inspired worldview—in which the U.S. battled an evil enemy"; Evangelical Christians who "wanted to missionize Iraq"; [[Karl Rove]]'s wanting to "turn Bush into a war president" to ensure re-election; and [[neo-conservative]]s who hoped to transform the Middle East and remove what they perceived as a danger to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = All the vice president's men | url = http://fairuse.1accesshost.com/news2/salon65.html | publisher = Salon | date = 28 October 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205185136/http://fairuse.1accesshost.com/news2/salon65.html | archivedate = 5 December 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration's focus on purported weapons of mass destruction, he added, was an attempt to find a rationale acceptable to the public.

Cole rejects the Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi cooperation with [[Al-Qaeda]], noting that [[Saddam Hussein]] had "persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Sullivan | title = Iraq No Friend of al-Qaida, Experts Say | newspaper = Cleveland Plain Dealer | date = 26 September 2002 | page = A11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as claims to the effect that Iraq was developing [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Blanford | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0909/p06s01-wome.html | title = Syria Worries U.S. Won't Stop at Iraq | newspaper = Christian Science Monitor | date = 9 September 2002 | pages = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.

Cole, who began to call the Iraqi conflict a "civil war" as early as 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2004/12/shiite-sunni-shiite-shiite-no-civil.html |title=Informed Comment |publisher=Juancole.com |date=December 2, 2004 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 stated that it consists of three distinct wars: "for control of [[Basra]] among Shiite militiamen; for control of [[Baghdad]] and its hinterlands between Sunnis and Shiites; and for control of [[Kirkuk]] among Kurds, Arabs and [[Iraqi Turkmens|Turkmen]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juancole.com/2007/11/us-drawdown-begins.html "US Drawdown Begins Sadrists call for New Parliamentary Elections"], ''Informed Comment'', November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

Cole is a strong [[Criticism of the Israeli government|critic of Israel's foreign and military policy]] and its treatment of Palestinians. He criticizes the nature of America's support for Israel and the activities of the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel Lobby]],&lt;ref name="IsraelLobbyComment"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/18/taboo/ | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = Breaking the silence | publisher = Salon.com | date = 19 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that some senior US officials such as [[Douglas J. Feith]] have dual loyalties to America and the [[Likud]] party of Israel.&lt;ref name="DualLoyal"&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | url = http://www.juancole.com/2004/09/dual-loyalties-many-readers-have.html | title = Dual Loyalties | publisher = Informed Comment | date = 9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole opposes [[academic boycott of Israel|boycotts of Israeli academics]] because he believes that the academic community in Israel is mostly opposed to the policies of the Likud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | url = http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i46/46b01301.htm | title = Why We Should Not Boycott Israeli Academics | publisher = The Chronicle of Higher Education | date = 26 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Qaeda===

Cole distinguishes "traditional" [[al-Qaeda]] from various 4-6 man cells scattered around the world who may identify with its goal, and use the name, but are not otherwise in contact with it. The former group consists of perhaps 5,000 members ("probably no more than a few hundred of them actually dangerous to the United States") whose activities "should be combatted by good police and counter-terrorism work". According to Cole, the Bush administration's view of "al-Qaeda" conflates various unrelated Muslim groups into a "bogeyman".&lt;ref name="bush-turns-to-fear-mongering-creation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.juancole.com/2006/09/bush-turns-to-fear-mongering-creation.html | title= Bush Turns to Fear-Mongering Creation of "Islamic" Bogeyman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006 there were "less than 1000" foreign (i.e., genuine) al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq,&lt;ref name="bush-turns-to-fear-mongering-creation"/&gt; although the Bush administration's actions have caused increasing numbers of Iraqi Sunnis to sympathize or identify with that organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2005/09/911-77-and-830-on-fourth-year.html

Retrieved 2011-11-28.]&lt;/ref&gt; Such native sympathizers are referred to on his blog as "Salafi jihadis". Cole dismissed as "implausible" the prospect of such groups taking over Iraq.&lt;ref name="bush-turns-to-fear-mongering-creation"/&gt;

===Afghanistan===

Cole calls the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan "the right war at the right time", and credits it with breaking up a network of al-Qaeda training camps which posed a danger to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=
http://www.juancole.com/2004/07/arguing-with-bush-yet-again-president.html |title=Arguing With Bush Yet Again President |publisher=Juancole.com |date=July 14, 2004 |accessdate=2008-10-26}} [http://www.juancole.com/2004/07/page/10 Alternative website address. Retrieved 2011-11-28.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cole later criticized Bush for leaving the job half finished in Afghanistan to go off and fight in Iraq.&lt;ref name="bush-turns-to-fear-mongering-creation"/&gt;

Cole complains that Iraq has displaced Afghanistan from the public consciousness. "As for money, Iraq has hogged the lion's share," he writes. "What has been spent on reconstruction in Afghanistan is piddling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2006/05/kabul-under-curfew-after-anti-us-anti.html |title=Kabul under Curfew after Anti-US, anti-Karzai Riots|publisher=Juancole.com |date=May 30, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talk of furthering democracy and women's rights, or eliminating [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]] cultivation there, has all but evaporated.

===Lebanon===

Cole lived in Beirut for several years, and was present for part of the 1975–1976 civil war. His overview of 20th century Lebanese history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juancole.com/2005/03/lebanon-realignment-and-syria-it-is.html |title=Lebanon Realignment And Syria It Is|publisher=Juancole.com |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; blames the CIA for rigging elections there in 1957, in order to allow president [[Camille Chamoun]] a second term. (Chamoun had apparently persuaded [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] that the [[Druze]] leaned towards [[Communism]].) This had the effect of forcing pro-[[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] Arab nationalists outside the political process. Cole additionally blames the influx of 100,000 Palestinian refugees in 1948—and the various later military actions against them by Syria and Israel—for the condition of Lebanese politics today.

Cole often points out the incongruity of the U.S. allying itself with offshoots of the [[Islamic Dawa Party]] in Iraq but vehemently opposing [[Hezbollah]] in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepc.org/forums_chcs/41.asp |title=scroll down to the questions section |publisher=Mepc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410164023/http://www.mepc.org/forums_chcs/41.asp |archivedate=April 10, 2009 }} at [[Middle East Policy Council]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Cole accused both sides of committing "war crimes" against civilians. Cole stated that "[Israel has] every right to defend itself against [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and his mad bombers" while voicing disapproval for the "wholesale indiscriminate destruction and slaughter in which the Israelis have been engaged against the Lebanese in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = Israel Widens Airstrikes; 140 Civilians Dead since Weds; Nasrallah Threatens Haifa with Worse Attacks | url = http://www.juancole.com/2006/07/israel-widens-airstrikes-140-civilians.html | publisher = Informed Comment | date = 17 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole also accused Israel of having planned the operation as much as a year in advance, rather than simply responding to provocation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Pakistan===

Cole opposed the [[Pervez Musharraf]] regime, which he blames for cracking down on democracy activists, while simultaneously allowing [[Islamism|Islamists]] based in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) to consolidate and expand their political power. He points out that Musharraf is actually a "hawk" with respect to India (in contrast to the government of [[Nawaz Sharif]], which had made overtures to it before the coup), and cancelled a special-forces operation aimed at killing [[Osama bin Laden]]. (The operation had been urged by President [[Bill Clinton]], and if successful, might have prevented the [[September 11 attacks]].)

Cole also censures the [[George W. Bush]] administration for not pushing for democratization in Pakistan. Such a development would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, [[Taliban]]-like movements have not received much support from voters. On the contrary, the danger is that U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/11/06/musharraf/ |title=Bush and Musharraf's grand illusion &amp;#124; Salon |publisher=Salon.com |author=Juan Cole |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole is also on the Editorial Board of ''[[Pakistaniaat]]''.

Cole's wife Shahin received her legal education in Lahore, Pakistan, and has also written against Musharraf's crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juancole.com/2007/11/choice-in-pakistan-is-democracy-or.html "The Choice in Pakistan is Democracy or Talibanization: Guest Op-ed by Shahin M. Cole"], ''Informed Comment'', November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libya===

Cole supported what he described as "the UNSC-authorized intervention" in Libya in 2011 by NATO, and criticized those on the Left who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cole | first = Juan | date = March 27, 2011 | title = An Open Letter to the Left on Libya | url = http://www.juancole.com/2011/03/an-open-letter-to-the-left-on-libya.html | website = Informed Comment | accessdate = 8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cole was asked in 2015 how he felt about the results of the intervention, he said, "It wasn't an intervention, it was a revolution. Revolutions are messy. It turned out better than Syria, where there wasn't a significant intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cole | first = Juan | date = 16 February 2015 | title = Avenging its Christians, Egypt Bombs Libya in first formal Campaign since 1991 | url = http://www.juancole.com/2015/02/avenging-christians-campaign.html | website = Informed Comment | accessdate = 17 February 2015 }} See comment and reply [http://www.juancole.com/2015/02/avenging-christians-campaign.html#comment-310570 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIA harassment allegations==
In 2011, James Risen reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that, "Glenn L. Carle, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] officer who was a top counterterrorism official during the administration of President [[George W. Bush]], said the White House at least twice asked intelligence officials to gather sensitive information" on Cole "in order to discredit him".&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[[James Risen|Risen, James]] (2011-06-15) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/us/politics/16cole.html Ex-Spy Alleges Bush White House Sought to Discredit Critic], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; "In an interview, Mr. Carle said his supervisor at the [[National Intelligence Council]] told him in 2005 that White House officials wanted 'to get' Professor Cole, and made clear that he wanted Mr. Carle to collect information about him, an effort Mr. Carle rebuffed. Months later, Mr. Carle said, he confronted a C.I.A. official after learning of another attempt to collect information about Professor Cole. Mr. Carle said he contended at the time that such actions would have been unlawful."&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

In 2006 Cole was nominated to teach at [[Yale University]] and was approved by both Yale's sociology and history departments. However, the senior appointments committee overruled the departments, and Cole was not appointed.

According to "several Yale faculty members", the decision to overrule Cole's approval was "highly unusual".&lt;ref&gt;Leibovitz, Liel. [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12578 "Middle East Wars Flare Up At Yale"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615194357/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12578 |date=2006-06-15 }}, [[The Jewish Week]], 2006-06-02. Retrieved on 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Yale Deputy Provost Charles Long stated that "Tenure appointments at Yale are very complicated and they go through several stages, and [the candidates] can fail to pass at any of the stages. Every year, at least one and often more fail at one of these levels, and that happened in this case."&lt;ref name="tenure"&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldberg | first = Ross | newspaper = [[Yale Daily News]] | url = http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=32950 | title = Univ. denies Cole tenure | date = June 10, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060820112025/http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=32950 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history department vote was 13 in favor, seven opposed, and three abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Leibovitz | first = Liel | url = http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12578 | title = Middle East Wars Flare Up At Yale | newspaper = [[The Jewish Week]] | date = 2 June 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615194357/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=12578 | archivedate = 15 June 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors interviewed by the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' said "the faculty appeared sharply divided."&lt;ref name="tenure" /&gt;

Yale historian [[Paula Hyman]] commented that the deep divisions in the appointment committee were the primary reasons that Cole was rejected: "There was also concern, aside from the process, about the nature of his blog and what it would be like to have a very divisive colleague."&lt;ref name="tenure" /&gt; Yale political science professor [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]] commented, "It would be very comforting for Cole's supporters to think that this got steamrolled because of his controversial blog opinions. The blog opened people's eyes as to what was going on."&lt;ref&gt;David White, [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2668 "Juan Cole and Yale: The Inside Story"], [[Campus Watch]], August 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Yale historian, [[John M. Merriman]], said of Cole's rejection: "In this case, academic integrity clearly has been trumped by politics."&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;[[Philip Weiss]], [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060703/weiss "Burning Cole"], ''[[The Nation]]'', July 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Cole noted that he had not applied for the Yale job: "Some people at Yale asked if they could look at me for a senior appointment. I said, 'Look all you want.' So that's up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You're being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn't result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously." He described the so-called "scandal" surrounding his nomination as "a tempest in a teapot" that had been exaggerated by "neo-con journalists": "Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/04/1418253 "Hundreds of Thousands Rally in Iraq Against the War in Lebanon: Middle East Analyst Juan Cole on War in the Middle East - from Baghdad to Beirut"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130014756/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F08%2F04%2F1418253 |date=2006-11-30 }}, [[Democracy Now]], August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversies ===

[[Alexander H. Joffe]] in the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' has written that "Cole suggests that many [[American Jews|Jewish American]] officials hold [[Dual loyalty|dual loyalties]], a frequent anti-Semitic theme."&lt;ref name="DeclineOfMES"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.meforum.org/article/789 | title = Juan Cole and the Decline of Middle Eastern Studies | first = Alexander H | last = Joffe | publisher = Middle East Quarterly | date = Winter 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole argues that his critics have "perverted the word 'antisemitic{{' "}}, and also points out that "in the Middle East Studies establishment in the United States, I have stood with Israeli colleagues and against any attempt to marginalize them or boycott them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | url = http://www.juancole.com/2004/12/character-assassination-yes-im-aware.html | title = Character Assassination | publisher = Informed Comment | date = December 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Efraim Karsh]], Cole has done "hardly any independent research on the twentieth-century Middle East", and characterized Cole's analysis of this era as "derivative". He has also responded to Cole's criticism of Israeli policies and the influence of the "[[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]]", comparing them to accusations that have been made in anti-semitic writings.&lt;ref name="Karsh"&gt;{{cite web | title = Juan Cole's Bad blog | url = http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/1945 | first = Efraim | last = Karsh | publisher = The New Republic (archived at [[Campus Watch]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole replied directly to Karsh in his blog, dismissing one of Karsh's charges, that Cole's criticisms echo themes in the antisemitic tract ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].'' Cole also defended his knowledge of modern Middle Eastern history, comparing his experience "on the ground" in the modern [[Arab world]] favorably with that of [[Bernard Lewis]], a historian he said is "lionized" by Karsh.&lt;ref name="WP-Karsh"&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan | last = Cole | publisher = Informed Comment | url = http://www.juancole.com/2006/10/wikipedia-karsh-and-cole-encyclopedia.html | title = Wikipedia, Karsh and Cole | date = October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy Sapienza of ''[[Antiwar.com]]'' has criticized Cole for what he deems as partisan bias on issues of war and peace, noting his support for wars supported by the Democratic party such as in the Balkans and Libya while opposing Republican wars such as Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Sapienza, Jeremy, [http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2011/08/23/juan-coles-conveniently-partisan-intervention-issues/ "Juan Cole's Conveniently Partisan Intervention Issues"],

Retrieved 2011-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt; have described Cole as being an advisor to the CIA and Walsh referred to Cole as a "humanitarian hawk".&lt;ref name=CP01&gt;Walsh, John V., [http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/08/30/meet-professor-juan-cole-consultant-to-the-cia/ "'Democracy Now?': Meet Professor Juan Cole, Consultant to the CIA"], ''CounterPunch'', August 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Walsh's charges, Cole said that he was never a consultant to the CIA, but did give talks at events sponsored by think tanks at which a range of US government officials were present, including CIA analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cole | first = Juan | date = 3 September 2011 | title = Qaddafi was a CIA Asset | url = http://www.juancole.com/2011/09/qaddafi-was-a-cia-asset.html | website = Informed Comment | accessdate = 8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David North (Socialist)|David North]] has strongly criticized Cole's defense of the US/NATO Libyan intervention, claiming an inconsistency between Cole's 2006 opposition to the "wholesale destruction of all of Lebanon by Israel and the US Pentagon" as part of a broader strategy to acquire control of the major sources of oil and natural gas, and Cole's 2011 statement that "I haven't seen the war-for-oil argument made for Libya in a manner that makes any sense at all."&lt;ref&gt;[[David North (Socialist)|North, David]], [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/apr2011/pers-a01.shtml "Libya, imperialism and the prostration of the 'left' intellectuals: The case of Professor Juan Cole"], [[World Socialist Web Site]], 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megalithic Observatory Kokino.jpg|thumb|220px|The summit of Tatićev Kamen]]
'''Kokino''' ({{lang-mk|Кокино}}) is a [[Bronze Age Balkans|Bronze Age]] archaeological site in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km from the town of [[Kumanovo]], and about 6&amp;nbsp;km from the Serbian border, in the [[Staro Nagoričane]] municipality. It is situated between about 1010 and 1030 m above sea level on the Tatićev Kamen (Татиќев камен) summit and covers an area of about 90 by 50 meters, overlooking the eponymous hamlet of [[Kokino (Staro Nagoričane)|Kokino]].

It was discovered by archeologist Jovica Stankovski, director of the national museum in [[Kumanovo]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the Macedonian Archaeological Association [http://mand.org.mk/mk/clen.php?id=153 МАНД], Jovica Stankovski (Јовица Станковски), born 13 January 1948 in Kumanovo, diploma in mechanical engineering in 1975, diploma in art history and archaeology in 1986, from 1999 to 2003 director of the national museum in Kumanovo.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. In 2002, Stankovski together with Gorje Cenev (who is the head of a planetarium at a [http://mkc.mk/ Youth Cultural Center] in Skopje) published the claim that the site contains a "[[megalithic]] [[Astronomical complex|observatory]] and [[Prehistoric religion#Bronze Age Europe|sacred site]]" (мегалитска опсерваторија и светилиште).

The wider Kokino archaeological site covers about 30 hectares. The oldest archaeological finds date from about the 19th century BC, corresponding to the early European Bronze Age. It shows signs of occupation for the period from the 19th to the 7th centuries BC. Finds from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 16th to 14th centuries BC) are the most numerous (mainly ceramic vessels, stone-mills, a few molds, and a pendant). An agglomeration from the [[Iron Age Balkans|Iron Age]] was discovered in 2009.&lt;ref name="BalkanTravellers"&gt;[http://www.balkantravellers.com/en/read/article/1240 Macedonia: Iron Period Layers Revealed by Latest Archaeology Excavations at Kokino] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606125955/http://www.balkantravellers.com/en/read/article/1240 |date=2009-06-06 }}, BalkanTravellers.com, 29 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of vessels filled with offerings were found deposited in cracks in the rocks, which gave rise to the interpretation of the site as a "holy mountain".

The Kokino "megalithic observatory" should be distinguished from the wider Kokino archaeological site. The claimed archaeoastronomical site has a combined area of about 5000 square meters and consists of two platforms with an elevation difference of 19 meters. The claim of the site representing an astronomical observatory was made by Stankovski and by Gjore Cenev in 2002. According to this interpretation, the site includes special stone markers used to track the movement of the Sun and Moon on the eastern horizon. The observatory used the method of stationary observation, marking positions of the Sun at the winter and summer [[solstice]], as well as the [[equinox]]. Four stone seats or "thrones" are placed in a row on the lower platform. According to Cenev, a stone block with a marking on the upper platform marks the direction of sunrise on summer solstice when viewed from one of the seats. Kokino was briefly mentioned in a poster made by [[NASA]]'s "Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum" in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2005/images/ao_poster.pdf Ancient Observatories - Timeless Knowledge]; Kokino is listed among fifteen "Ancient Observatory Sites" on this poster. This was reported in terms of "[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2005/05/11/feature-02 Macedonia's Megalithic Kokino Observatory Places 4th on NASA List]" by , Marija Lazarova for [[Southeast European Times]] in Skopje (11 May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; although in a recent survey of ancient "observatories", the Kokino site was described as "a particularly problematic case".&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Belmonte | first = Juan Antonio | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L.

The Cultural Heritage Protection Office of Macedonia's Ministry of Culture declared the site a "property under temporary protection" on  13 November 2008 (Decision nr. 08-1935/6). In 2009, Minister of Culture Elizabeta Kancheska-Milevska declared Kokino "one of the priorities of the Ministry of Culture’s 2009 programme".&lt;ref name="BalkanTravellers"/&gt; In 2009, the Republic of Macedonia also suggested the site be inscribed on the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site list]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5413 Archaeo-astronomical Site Kokino],  World Heritage Centre "Tentative List", Ref. 5413.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3041">A '''language/culture-based charter school''' is a [[charter school]] whose curriculum is based on the language and culture of a specific ethnic nation or group of nations, although the schools are open to students of all ethnic backgrounds.

A review by the Washington advocacy group, National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, found that among the more than 4,600 charters nationwide, 113 have mission statements specifying such ethnic cultural themes. These include the [[Amber Charter School]] in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the [[Eugenio Maria de Hostos Charter School]] in [[Rochester, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;HEBREW BROUHAHA; NYC'S NEXT NEW-SCHOOL WAR, By THOMAS W. CARROLL, New York Post, May 29, 2008 [http://www.nypost.com/seven/05292008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/hebrew_brouhaha_112964.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which feature instruction in Spanish and in Hispanic cultures, the [[Ben Gamla Charter School]], the country’s first Hebrew language charter school,  which opened in [[Hollywood, Florida]], in 2007, the [[Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy]], the [[Pioneer Valley Chinese Immersion Charter School]], where by grade six all subjects except English language arts will be taught in Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;State poised to OK school for Chinese immersion, By Jenna Russell, [[Boston Globe]], February 27, 2007 [http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2007/02/27/state_poised_to_ok_school_for_chinese_immersion/]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Hellenic Classical Charter School]] in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;January 12, 2009 State Weighs Approval of School Dedicated to Hebrew, By ELISSA GOOTMAN, New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/nyregion/12hebrew.html?ref=education&lt;/ref&gt; 

A language/culture-based charter school is similar in many respects to a religious charter school. [[Lawrence D. Weinberg]], in his book Religious Charter Schools: Legalities and Practicalities, argues that a charter school can be religious in many ways and that charter schools may accommodate religious beliefs, but not endorse religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Religious Charter Schools: Legalities and Practicalities, https://www.amazon.com/Religious-Charter-Schools-Legalities-Practicalities/dp/1593117590/&lt;/ref&gt; Religious charter schools would include [[Catholic schools]] that converted to charters as happened in [[Washington, D.C.]] and some Hebrew or Arabic language schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8111">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Langue'' and ''parole''}}
'''''Langue''''' ([[French language|French]], meaning "[[language]]") and '''''parole''''' (meaning "[[speaking]]") are [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms distinguished by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]''. ''Langue'' encompasses the abstract, systematic rules and conventions of a [[signifying system]]; it is independent of, and pre-exists, individual users. ''Langue'' involves the principles of language, without which no meaningful utterance, "parole", would be possible.  ''Parole'' refers to the concrete instances of the use of ''langue''.  This is the individual, personal phenomenon of language as a series of [[speech acts]] made by a linguistic subject.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). Course in general linguistics (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure did not concern himself overly with ''parole''; however, the structure of ''langue'' is revealed through the study of ''parole''. The distinction is similar to that made about language by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], between ''energeia'' (active doing) and ''ergon'' (the product of that doing)&lt;ref&gt;"Language as a finished product, a set of tools forged for future use, is in fact a precipitate of the ongoing activity. It is created in speech, and is in fact being continuously recreated, extended, altered, reshaped. This Humboltdian notion is the basis for another famous contribution of Saussure, his distinction between ''langue'' and ''parole''." Charles Taylor, ''The Importance of Herder'', "Philosophical Arguments" (Harvard University Press, 1997), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the distinction between ''language'' and ''speech'' made by [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin de Courtenay (1876–7), ''A detailed programme of lectures for the academic year 1876-77'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure drew an analogy to chess to explain the concept of ''langue'' and ''parole''. He compared ''langue'' to the [[rules of chess]]—the norms for playing the game—and compared the moves that an individual chooses to make—the individual's preferences in playing the game—to the ''parole''.

==Langue==
When translated from the [[French language|French]] term ''langue'' can mean language. However, it is known Saussure intended the term to mean internal, arrangement and relationship of rules understood by a social group, however, rarely thought of in everyday life. ''Langue'' is believed to be a universal structure and, while it may have variations as seen in foreign languages, with principal linguistic patterns.

==Parole==
''Parole'' typically when it is translated means speech. Saussure, on the other hand, intended for it to mean both the written and spoken language as experienced in everyday life. It is the precise utterances and use of ''langue''. Therefore, ''parole'', unlike ''langue'', is as diverse and varied as the number of people who share a language and the number of utterances and attempts to use that language. Furthermore, ''parole'' is known to have been changed and manipulated by a number of causes for example time, social groups, and age of users.

==As a function==
The underlying basis to ''langue'' is the interpretation that it is made up of signs and not sentences. Signs are thought to have a two part aspect in that each sign relates a notion with a sound pattern (or a written symbol). A sign cannot exist as a single part for if there is a sound pattern without a notion the sound becomes only noise. Similarly, a notion cannot be communicated without a sound pattern.
The sound pattern for each notion can be extremely diverse and vice versa. For example, the notion of oneself may use the sound patterns of 'I' or 'me' while the sound pattern of 'rose' may have the notion of a flower or the past of 'rise'. The notion or sound pattern remains unchanged even if the other changes. It is by understanding the relationship of the two parts of a sign through ''langue'' that the gist of communication or ''parole'' may be understood. Without the understanding of ''langue'', ''parole'' would be meaningless sounds or symbols grouped together haphazardly.
Saussure used the example of chess to explain how ''langue'' and ''parole'' work together. ''Langue'' is the normative rules in a chess game while parole represents the individual's choice of moves. If one were to study the parole of a chess game an understanding could be derived but it would not be a universal understanding of chess. However, by studying the langue of a chess game the derived understanding may be applicable to further chess games.
Thus Saussure argued when studying language, especially a foreign language, it is more important to understand the ''langue'' than to gain a large vocabulary of ''parole'' so that sense may be made equal to that of native speaker.

==Course in general linguistics==
Saussure did not publish his notes in relation to linguistics and ''langue'' and ''parole''. Unfortunately Cours de linguistique générale was published after his death in 1916 (later translated into English in 1959 as ''Course in General Linguistics'') and was made up of remaining lecture notes by Saussure, course notes provided to students and notes taken by former students of his lectures he performed between 1907-1911 in Geneva. This was then published by two of his former colleagues Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was after this publication that the importance and revolutionary nature of his work truly was understood by linguists and philosophers of his time.
Reviews, commentaries and critics of both the ''Course in General Linguistics'' and original notes made by Saussure have revealed much controversy over time. One controversy is that many ideas and notions often accredited to Saussure may have been borrowed from other linguists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Saussure's idea of language as a sign system had been proposed by other philosophers, however, he will always be known to have provided a strong, theoretical basis for a scientific approach to understanding language as a whole.

==Influence==
Saussure's ''langue'' and ''parole'' form one of the theoretical foundations of structuralism. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have allowed structuralists to separately examine the broad structures and formations of literature as well as the individual words. Structuralists achieved this by making a distinction within literary works between the words on a page (''parole'') and the context behind these words (''langue''). Although the reader may appear to simply be reading the words in a book their ability to understand (or possibly misunderstand) the text is a result of a person's knowledge of the ''langue'' or rules of a certain language. Similarly, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been highly influential in the study of the signs, termed semiotics. Saussure's most notable influence on semiotics was his belief that the rules and codes of a language (''langue'') are vital in interpreting and gaining an understanding of that language system, while individual utterances (''parole'') are of little significance. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have also impacted the way language is taught. Since Saussure's terms have become well known, language teaching often emphasizes teaching the langue and how these rules are applied, rather than simply teaching the words of a certain language. Additionally, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been applied to other fields of study. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used Structuralism and ''langue'' and ''parole'' to understand myths and tales within a broader context. In this case parole is a single tale or myth, while langue is considered the broader range of tales and myths from within a series or group. These may be myths from the same community, time period or geographical location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25890">{{Lutheranism|expanded=theology}}
In [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]], the relationship between '''Law and Gospel'''&amp;mdash;[[Divine Law|God's Law]] and the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]]&amp;mdash;is a major topic in [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] theology. In these religious [[tradition]]s, the distinction between the doctrines of Law, which demands obedience to God's [[ethic]]al will, and Gospel, which promises the [[forgiveness]] of [[sin]]s in light of the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]], is critical. Ministers use it as a [[hermeneutical]] principle of biblical interpretation and as a guiding principle in [[homiletics]] (sermon composition) and [[pastoral care]]. It involves the [[supersessionism|supersession]] of the [[Old Covenant]] (including traditional Jewish law, or [[halakha]]) by the [[New Covenant]] and [[Christian theology]].

Other Christian groups have a view on the issue as well, or more generally [[Christian views on the old covenant|views of the Old Covenant]], though the matter has not usually been as hotly debated or rigorously defined as in the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] traditions.

Sometimes the issue is discussed under the headings of "[[Biblical law in Christianity|Law]] and [[Divine grace|Grace]]", "[[Sin]] and Grace", "[[Letter and spirit of the law|Spirit and Letter]]", and "ministry ({{lang|grc|διακονíα}}, ''diakonia'') of death/condemnation" and "ministry of the Spirit/[[righteousness]]".&lt;ref name="Bible1"&gt;
[[s:Bible, King James, 2 Corinthians#Chapter 3|2 Cor. 3:6-9]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran view==

===Martin Luther and Lutheran theologians===
A specific formulation of the distinction of Law and Gospel was first brought to the attention of the Christian Church by [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), and laid down as the foundation of evangelical [[Lutheran]] biblical exegesis and exposition in Article 4 of the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'' (1531): "All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the [[Old Testament]]] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the [[New Testament]]], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.".&lt;ref name="BOC1"&gt;F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau, ed. and trans. &lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), Apology IV (II).5, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Formula of Concord]] likewise affirmed this distinction in Article V, where it states: "We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence..."&lt;ref name="BOC2"&gt;''Triglot Concordia'', FC Epitome V, (II).1, p. 503ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] wrote: "Hence, whoever knows well this art of distinguishing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him a doctor of Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name="doctor"&gt;Martin Luther, ''Dr. Martin Luthers Sämmtliche Schriften'', St. Louis ed. (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, N.D.), vol. 9, col. 802.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|Lutheran Age of Orthodoxy]] (1580–1713) this hermeneutical discipline was considered foundational and important by Lutheran theologians.

This distinction was the first article in ''Patrick`s Places'' (1528) by [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;''Patrick`s Places'' (1528)&lt;/cite&gt;[http://www.thereformation.info/patricks%20places.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.W. Walther|Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther]] (1811–1887), who was the first (and third) president of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], renewed interest in and attention to this theological skill in his evening lectures at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis 1884-85.&lt;ref name="dau"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel: 39 Evening Lectures&lt;/cite&gt;, W.H.T. Dau tr., 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book of Concord===
The [[Formula of Concord]] distinguished three uses, or purposes, in the Law in Article VI. It states: "[T]he Law was given to men for three reasons ..."

#that "thereby outward discipline might be maintained against wild, disobedient men [and that wild and intractable men might be restrained, as though by certain bars]"
#that "men thereby may be led to the knowledge of their sins"
#that "after they are regenerate ... they might ... have a fixed rule according to which they are to regulate and direct their whole life"&lt;ref name="BOC3"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia&lt;/cite&gt;, ''Formula of Concord'', Epitome VI.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary concern was to maintain that the Law should continue to be used by Christians after they had been [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerated]] by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to counter the doctrine of [[Johannes Agricola]], who taught that the [[Antinomianism#First Antinomian controversy|Law was no longer needed]] by regenerate Christians."&lt;ref name="BOC3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ''Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', chapter XVII: The Antinomistic Controversy, (St. Louis, MO: CPH, 1921), 161-172, cf. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional Lutheranism]] teaches that the Law cannot be used to deny the Gospel, neither can the Gospel be used to deny God's Law.&lt;ref name=WLS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BuchholzJustification.pdf |title=Jesus canceled your debt! |last1=Bichholz |first1=Jon D. |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |quote=We embrace a parallel principle in our division of God’s word into law and gospel.

The three ''uses'' of the Law are:

#''Curb'' -  Through fear of punishment, the Law keeps the sinful nature of both Christians and non-Christians under check. This does not stop sin, since the sin is already committed when the heart desires to do what is wrong, yet it does stop the open outbreak of sin that will do even further damage.
#''Mirror'' - The Law serves as a perfect reflection of what God created the human heart and life to be. It shows anyone who compares his/her life to God's requirement for perfection that he/she is sinful.
#''Guide'' - This use of the law that applies only to Christians. The law becomes the believer's helper. Empowered by the gospel truth of forgiveness and righteousness in Christ, the believer's new self eagerly desires to live to please the Triune God.&lt;ref name=WELS-USES&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080401021937/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 1 April 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Uses Of The Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELS-3RD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102114247/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Third use of the Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformed view==
[[File:Cranach Gesetz und Gnade Gotha.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a Lutheran. The left side of the tree illustrates law, while the right side illustrates grace.]]

The distinction between law and gospel is a standard formulation in [[Reformed]] theology, though in recent years some have characterized it as distinctively Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Michael|title=The Distinction between Law and Gospel in Reformed Faith and Practice|volume=19|issue=5|pages=12–14|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&amp;var1=ArtRead&amp;var2=1164&amp;var3=main|work=Modern Reformation|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zacharias Ursinus]] sharply distinguished the law and gospel as "the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures" in his commentary on the [[Heidelberg Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ursinus|first=Zacharias|title=The commentary of Dr. Zacharias Ursinus on the Heidelberg catechism|year=1888|publisher=Elm Street Printing Co|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=pa2|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Berkhof]] called the law and the gospel "the two parts of the Word of God as a [[means of grace]]." Law and Gospel are found in both testaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkhof|first=Louis|title=Systematic Theology|year=1979|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', the Reformer [[John Calvin]] distinguished three uses in the Law. Calvin wrote the following: "[T]o make the whole matter clearer, let us survey briefly the function and use of what is called the 'moral law.' Now, so far as I understand it, it consists of three parts."

# "[W]hile it shows God's righteousness . . . , it warns, informs, convicts, and lastly condemns, every man of his own unrighteousness" (2.7.6).
# It functions "by fear of punishment to restrain certain men who are untouched by any care for what is just and right unless compelled by hearing the dire threats in the law" (2.7.10).
# "It admonishes believers and urges them on in well-doing" (2.7.12-13).

This scheme is the same as the [[Formula of Concord]], with the exception that the first and second uses are switched.

In later [[Reformed scholasticism]] the order is the same as for Lutherans. The three uses are called:

# The ''usus politicus sive civilis'', the political or civil use, is a restraint on sin and stands apart from the work of salvation. It is part of God's [[general revelation]] or [[common grace]] for unbelievers as well as believers.
# The ''usus elenchticus sive paedagogicus'', the elenctical or pedagogical use which confronts sin and points us to Christ.
# The ''usus didacticus sive normativus'', the didactic use, which is solely for believers, teaching the way of righteousness.&lt;ref name=muller&gt;{{cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|title=Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology|year=2006|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0801020643|pages=320–321|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], in explaining the third use of the Law, teaches that the moral law as contained in the [[Ten Commandments]] is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"/&gt; John Calvin deemed this third use of the Law as its primary use.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opc.org/qa.html?question_id=165|title=God's Law in Old and New Covenants|year=2018|publisher=[[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]|language=English|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran and Reformed differences==
[[Lutheran scholasticism|Scholastic Lutheran]] and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use of the law functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (''tertius usus legis'') because the redeemed are expected to bear [[good works]]. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.&lt;ref name=muller /&gt;

Additionally, some have suggested that the third use of the law is not found at all in Luther but comes from [[Philip Melanchthon]]. Although some Lutherans have rejected that view,&lt;ref name=ThirdUse&gt;[http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-3.htm "The Third Use of Law"] by [[John Warwick Montgomery]] in ''Present Truth'', vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt; it has caused others to dispute the validity of the "third use" of the Law entirely. [[Paul Althaus]], for instance, writes in his treatise on Law and Gospel: "This [ethical] guidance by the Holy Spirit implies that God's concrete commanding cannot be read off from a written document, an inherited scheme of law. I must learn afresh every day what God wants of me. For God's commanding has a special character for each individual: it is always contemporary, always new. God commands me (and each person) in a particular way, in a different way than He commands others.... The living and spiritual character of the knowledge of what God requires of men in the present moment must not be destroyed by rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="althaus"&gt;Paul Althaus, &lt;cite&gt;The Divine Command&lt;/cite&gt;, pp. 43, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Such theologians believe the third use leads to or encourages a form of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] and is possibly an implicit denial of [[sola fide]]. Conversely, Reformed Christians have sometimes seen this two-use scheme of some modern Lutherans as leading to a form of [[antinomianism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Some believe that "for Luther the pedagogic use of the Law was primary, while for Calvin this third or didactic use was the principal one; yet [historically] both the Lutheran and the Reformed traditions maintain the threefold conceptualization."&lt;ref name=ThirdUse /&gt;

==Methodist view==
[[John Wesley]] admonished [[Methodist]] preachers to emphasize both the Law and the Gospel:&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wesley on Preaching Law and Gospel |url=https://www.seedbed.com/law-gospel-wesley/ |publisher=Seedbed |date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Undoubtedly both should be preached in their turn; yea, both at once, or both in one. All the conditional promises are instances of this. They are law and gospel mixed together. According to this model, I should advise every preacher continually to preach the law — the law grafted upon, tempered by, and animated with the spirit of the gospel. I advise him to declare explain, and enforce every command of God. But meantime to declare in every sermon (and the more explicitly the better) that the flint and great command to a Christian is, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ’: that Christ is all in all, our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; that all life, love, strength are from Him alone, and all freely given to us through faith. And it will ever be found that the law thus preached both enlightens and strengthens the soul; that it both nourishes and teaches; that it is the guide, ‘ food, medicine, and stay’ of the believing soul.&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"/&gt;}}
Methodism makes a distinction between the ceremonial law and the moral law that is the [[Ten Commandments]] given to Moses.&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; In Methodist Christianity, the moral law is the "fundamental ontological principle of the universe" and "is grounded in eternity", being "engraved on human hearts by the finger of God."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dayton |first1=Donald W. |title=Law and Gospel in the Wesleyan Tradition |journal=Grace Theological Journal |date=1991 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=233-243 |url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/gtj/12-2_233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to the teaching of the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches bring the Law and the Gospel together in a profound sense: "the law is grace and through it we discover the good news of the way life is intended to be lived."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition taught:&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;
{{quotation|... there is no contrariety at all between the law and the gospel; ... there is no need for the law to pass away in order to the establishing of the gospel. Indeed neither of them supersedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very same words, considered in different respects, are parts both of the law and the gospel. If they are considered as commandments, they are parts of the law: if as promises, of the gospel. Thus, 'Thou shalt love the Lord the God with all thy heart,' when considered as a commandment, is a branch of the law; when regarded as a promise, is an essential part of the gospel-the gospel being no other than the commands of the law proposed by way of promises. Accordingly poverty of spirit, purity of heart, and whatever else is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a gospel light, than so many great and precious promises. There is therefore the closest connection that can be conceived between the law and the gospel. On the one hand the law continually makes way for and points us to the gospel; on the other the gospel continually leads us to a more exact fulfilling of the law .... We may yet further observe that every command in Holy Writ is only a covered promise. (Sermon 25, "Sermon on the Mount, V," II, 2, 3)&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;}}

[[Daniel Defoe]] discusses three pairs of these predicates in his second and final sequel to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Serious Reflections'' (1720): "forbear and live", "do and live", "believe and live". According to Defoe, the first was established with Adam in paradise, the second as the Law with the children of Israel, and the third as the Gospel of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4KFumK2PkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1OWLpiDB7F9R7x3bPnxlThfi89ZA&amp;ci=66%2C873%2C762%2C407&amp;edge=0 ''Serious reflections during the life and surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe: with his Vision of the angelic world''].

However Luther viewed all imperative commands as law, even the command to believe the Gospel. In [[On the Bondage of the Will|The Bondage of the Will]] he writes,

"[T]he commands exist to show, not our moral ability, but our inability. This includes God's command of all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel, an impossible act of will apart from a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit uniting us to Christ .." p.&amp;nbsp;149

[[File:MagnusOlsen-OB.F06297b.jpg|thumb|Magnus Olsen]] '''Magnus Bernhard Olsen''' ([[Arendal]], 28 November 1878{{spaced ndash}}[[Oslo]], 16 January 1963)&lt;ref name=NBL&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Magnus_Olsen/utdypning Magnus Olsen] by Magnus Rindal in ''[[Norsk Biografisk Leksikon]]'' online at ''[[Store Norske Leksikon]]'' .&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] linguist and a professor in [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[philology]] at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1908 to 1948. His writings on [[Norse paganism]] and interpretations of the names of Norwegian farms and other placenames were influential, and his contribution to runology, particularly Norwegian runology, was considerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Magnus_Olsen ''Magnus Olsen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After [[Examen artium|finishing school]] in 1896, Olsen studied at the University of Oslo and received his [[Candidatus philologiæ]] degree in 1903. From 1899 onwards, he worked as an assistant at the [[University Library of Oslo|University Library]]; from 1902 he was assistant to the almost blind [[Sophus Bugge]].&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; After 1904 he received a stipend. In 1908, at the age of 30, he was chosen to succeed Bugge as Professor of Old Norse and Icelandic Language and Literature; in 1921 the department was renamed Norse Philology.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Sophus_Bugge ''Sophus Bugge'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Olsen was one of the most prominent and best known scholars in his field.&lt;ref&gt;"the foremost Norwegian philologist of his time," ''Norsk Biografisk Leksikon''.&lt;/ref&gt; His publications included 7 volumes of [[Poetic Edda|Eddic]] and [[skald]]ic poetry with commentary, and also several volumes on [[Rune|runic]] inscriptions: after assisting Sophus Bugge in completing publication of the inscriptions in the [[Elder Futhark]], he published the first 5 volumes on the inscriptions in the [[Younger Futhark]]. Although he took magical interpretations of runic inscriptions further than do later scholars, they were always on a reasoned basis.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; He assisted as joint editor and editor of 3 volumes in the completion of [[Oluf Rygh]]'s ''[[Norske Gaardnavne]]''. He is best known for the framework he established for dating placenames and relating them to religion and society in the pre-Christian era,&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; which he presented in two books, ''Hedenske Kulturminder i Norske Stedsnavne'' ("Heathen Cultural Remnants in Norwegian Placenames" - 1915) and ''Ættegård og Helligdom, Norske Stednavn Sosialt og Religionshistorisk Belyst'' (1926, translated into English as ''Farms and Fanes of Ancient Norway: The Place-Names of a Country Discussed in Their Bearings on Social and Religious History'', 1928). ''Hva våre stedsnavn lærer oss'' ("What Our Placenames Teach Us" - 1934) is a succinct introduction to the subject.

Olsen founded the journal ''Maal og Minne'' in 1909, and edited it for 40 years. His article in the first issue, "Fra gammelnorsk myte og kultus," was in itself an important contribution to the study of Germanic religion, interpreting "[[Skírnismál]]" in terms of the ''[[hieros gamos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Harris, "Cursing with the Thistle: ''Skírnismál'' 31, 68 and OE Metrical Charm 9, 16-17," [https://books.google.com/books?id=j4bufbA_UpQC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Magnus+Olsen+Maal+og+Minne+%22Fra+gammelnorsk+myte+og+kultus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1utW9equje&amp;sig=-nSYNz89y9LjNRdQtKc3hvoBSL8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uU2rS_qMDcTflgeyqOCMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Magnus%20Olsen%20Maal%20og%20Minne%20%22Fra%20gammelnorsk%20myte%20og%20kultus%22&amp;f=false p. 91, note 7] in ''The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology'', ed.

In 1952 he was honoured with a state pension.

==Personal life==
He became a Commander of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1945. He was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1904, a member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]], and a Knight in the Icelandic [[Order of the Falcon]] and the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]].

In 1912 he married Gjertrud Mathilde Kjær, daughter of [[Albert Kjær]], librarian at the [[Oslo Public Library]] and head librarian at the University Library.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; [[Ludvig Holm-Olsen]], professor of Old Norse philology at the [[University of Bergen]], was his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Ludvig Holm-Olsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Eyvind Fjeld|last=Halvorsen|authorlink=Eyvind Fjeld Halvorsen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ludvig_Holm-Olsen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martha's Vineyard Sign Language''' ('''MVSL''') was a [[village sign language|village sign-language]] that was once widely used on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] from the early 18th century to 1952. It was used by both [[deaf]] and [[Hearing (person)|hearing]] people in the community; consequently, deafness did not become a barrier to participation in public life. Deaf people who spoke Martha's Vineyard Sign Language were extremely independent. They participated in society as typical citizens, although there were incidents of discrimination, and [[language barrier]]s.

The language was able to thrive because of the unusually high percentage of deaf islanders and because deafness was a [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[hereditary trait|trait]], which meant that almost anyone might have both deaf and hearing siblings. In 1854, when the island's deaf population peaked, the United States national average was one deaf person in about 5,730, while on Martha's Vineyard it was one in 155. In the town of [[Chilmark, Massachusetts|Chilmark]], which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.chilmarklibrary.org/pdf/|title=Chilmark Deaf Community Digital Historical Archive|website=catalog.chilmarklibrary.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sign language]] on the island declined when the population migrated to the mainland. There are no fluent signers of MVSL today. Katie West, the last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, died in 1952,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/marthas-vineyard-sign-language-asl/407191/|title=The Life and Death of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|last=Romm|first=Cari|date=2015-09-25|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there were a few elderly residents still able to recall MVSL when researchers started examining the language in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=library/&gt; Linguists are working to save the language, but their task is difficult because they cannot experience MVSL firsthand.

== Origins ==
Hereditary deafness had appeared on Martha's Vineyard by 1714. The ancestry of most of the deaf population of Martha's Vineyard can be traced to a forested area in the south of England known as [[Weald|the Weald]]—specifically the part of the Weald in the county of [[Kent]].&lt;ref name="library" /&gt; Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) may be descended from a hypothesized sign language of that area in the 16th century, now referred to as [[Old Kent Sign Language]]. Families from a [[Puritan]] community in the Kentish Weald emigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in [[British America]] in the early 17th century, and many of their descendants later settled on Martha's Vineyard. The first deaf person known to have settled there was Jonathan Lambert, a carpenter and farmer, who moved there with his wife—who was not deaf—in 1694. By 1710, the migration had virtually ceased, and the [[endogamous]] community that was created contained a high incidence of hereditary deafness that persisted for over 200 years.

In the town of [[Chilmark, Massachusetts|Chilmark]], which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.&lt;ref name="library" /&gt; By the 18th century there was a distinct [[Chilmark Sign Language]]. In the 19th century, this was influenced by [[French Sign Language]], and evolved into MVSL in the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 18th to the early 20th century, virtually everybody on Martha's Vineyard possessed some degree of fluency in the language.

In the early 19th century, a new educational philosophy began to emerge on the mainland, and the country's first school for the deaf opened in 1817 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now called the [[American School for the Deaf]]). Many of the deaf children of Martha's Vineyard enrolled there, taking their sign language with them. The language of the teachers was [[French Sign Language]], and many of the other deaf students used their own [[home sign|home-sign]] systems. This school became known as the birthplace of the [[deaf community]] in the United States, and the different sign systems used there, including MVSL, merged to become [[American Sign Language]] or ASL—now one of the largest community languages in the country.

As more deaf people remained on the mainland, and others who returned brought with them deaf spouses they met there (whose hearing loss may not have been due to the same hereditary cause), the line of hereditary deafness began to diminish. At the outset of the 20th century, the previously isolated community of fishers and farmers began to see an influx of tourists that would become a mainstay in the island's economy. Jobs in tourism were not as deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been, and as intermarriage and migration joined the people of Martha's Vineyard to the mainland, the island community grew to resemble the wider community there more and more.

The last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began. Indeed, when [[Oliver Sacks]] subsequently visited the island after reading a book on the subject,&lt;ref name="Groce1985"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5nbuza--nYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=everyone+here+sign#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard|last=Groce|first=Nora Ellen|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-674-27041-X|location=Cambridge, MA|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he noted that a group of elderly islanders talking together dropped briefly into sign language then back into speech.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOjavKkVRNoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22seeing+voices%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Seeing Voices: a Journey into the World of the Deaf|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1989|isbn=0-520-06083-0|pages=35–36|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|place=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life as a deaf person on Martha's Vineyard ==

Although the people who were dependent on MVSL were different, they still did the same activities as the normal Martha's Vineyard resident would. The deaf would work both complex and simple jobs, attend island events, and participate within the community. In contrast to some other deaf communities around the world, they were treated as normal people. The deaf living in rural Mexico have a similar community, but few hearing people live there permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dehn |first=Georgia |year=2015 |title=Signs of Life |url= |journal=Daily Telegraph |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other deaf communities are often isolated from the hearing population; the Martha's Vineyard deaf community of that period is exceptional in its integration into the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language |last=Groce |first=Nora |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf MVSL users were not excluded by the rest of society at Martha's Vineyard, but they certainly faced challenges due to their deafness. Marriage between a deaf person and a hearing person was extremely difficult to maintain, even though both could use MVSL. For this reason, the deaf usually married the deaf, raising the degree of inbreeding even beyond that of the general population of Martha's Vineyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Perlmutter |first=David |year=1986 |title=No Nearer to the Soul |jstor= 4047641 |journal= Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 	 |volume=4|pages=515–23  |doi=10.1007/bf00134471}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deaf-deaf marriages are what really increased the deaf population within this community.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kusters |first=A. |date=2010-01-01 |title=Deaf Utopias?

They entertained at community events, teaching hearing youngsters more MVSL. The sign language was spoken and taught to hearing children as early as their first years, in order to communicate with the many deaf people they would encounter in school.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kageleiry|first=Jamie|year= |title=The Island that Spoke by Hand |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1597979/island-that-spoke-by-hand |journal= Yankee |volume=63 |pages=48 |via=Ebsco Host}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lip movement, hand gestures, mannerisms, and facial expressions were all studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comstock |first=Nancy|year=2016 |title=Deaf Culture |url= |journal= Salem Press Encyclopedia |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were even separate schools specifically for learning MVSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |jstor= 44065463|title=The Marthas Vineyard Summer School |last= |first= |date= |work=Journal of Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing people sometimes signed even when there were no deaf people present. For example, children signed behind a schoolteacher's back, adults signed to one another during church sermons, farmers signed to their children across a wide field, and fishermen signed to each other from their boats across the water where the spoken word would not carry.&lt;ref name="Groce1985" /&gt;

Outside of Martha's Vineyard, though, deaf people were discriminated against. This drove them to try hard to be accepted by locals, which also explains why at first the cochlear implants were not utilized.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

== Decline ==
Martha's Vineyard Sign Language declined after the opening of the [[American School for the Deaf]]. Although students from Martha's Vineyard influenced the creation of [[American Sign Language]] with contributions from MVSL, when they returned home, they brought ASL usage back with them, and MVSL faded. Additionally, as transportation became easier in the 19th century, the influx of hearing people meant that more genetic diversity was introduced, and hereditary deafness was no longer commonplace. The last person in the line of hereditary deafness of Martha's Vineyard was Katie West, who died in 1952. Following her death, Oliver Sacks noted in the 1980s that some elderly hearing residents of the island could remember a few signs, but the language truly died out after this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Seeing Voices|Seeing Voices: A Journey Into the World of the Deaf]]|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|date=1989|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0520060830|location=Berkeley|oclc=19455916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Mary Hamilton Swindler ''' (January 2, 1884 &amp;ndash; January 16, 1967) was an American [[archaeologist]], classical art scholar, author, and professor of classical [[archaeology]], most notably at [[Bryn Mawr College]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[University of Michigan]]. Swindler also founded the Ella Riegel Memorial Museum at Bryn Mawr College. She participated in various archaeological excavations in [[Greece]], [[Egypt]], and [[Turkey]]. The recipient of several awards and honors for her research, Swindler's seminal work was ''Ancient Painting, from the Earliest Times to the Period of Christian Art'' (1929).

== Early life and education ==
Mary Hamilton Swindler, nicknamed "Mayme", was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], on January 2, 1884.&lt;ref name=Am_Jour_1950&gt;{{cite journal |last=D.B.T. |first= |last2= |first2= |year=1950 |title=Mary Hamilton Swindler |url= |journal= American Journal of Archaeology |publisher= Archaeological Institute of America  |volume=54 |issue= 4|pages=290–293 (b.

Upon graduation from high school, Swindler attended [[Indiana University]] in Bloomington, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1905 and a master's degree in 1906.{{sfn|Medwid|2000|p=285-6}} She specialized in Greek, Latin, and archaeology studies.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Mellink |first= Machteld J.|year=1967 |title= Mary Hamilton Swindler |journal= Expedition Magazine  |publisher== University of Pennsylvania, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |pages=8–16|volume=9|issue=3 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swindler continued her education at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. The college awarded Swindler a Greek fellowship in 1906-07.{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}} She was also the recipient of the [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett European Fellowship]] in 1909-10, which allowed her to pursue graduate studies at the University of Berlin and the American School of Classical Studies at [[Athens, Greece]], before returning to Bryn Mawr. Swindler earned a doctoral degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1912 and joined the Bryn Mawr faculty.{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}}

==Career==
Swindler began her teaching career as an instructor of Latin and archaeology at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1912. From 1931 until her retirement in 1949, she was a professor of classical archaeology at Bryn Mawr.&lt;ref name=BMC-Atrium&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Who's Who on the Atrium Wall: Bryn Mawr faculty from the departments of History of Art and Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology | work = | publisher =Rhys Carpenter Library, Bryn Mawr College  | date = | url =http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/carpenterbios.html| accessdate =October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Swindler founded the Ella Riegel Memorial Museum for Archaeology, also known as the Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology Collection, in 1940 and the Ella Riegel Study Collection at Bryn Mawr College.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Dorothy Burr Thompson]], a renowned student of Bryn Mawr, was influenced by Swindler.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt; Swindler worked with Thompson on studies of ancient vases at the Bryn Mawr College Museum's Mediterranean Section.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt; Swindler also organized Bryn Mawr's participation in archaeological expeditions to [[Cilicia]] in [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus, Turkey]] (1934–38).&lt;ref name=NYTimes_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt;{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}}

From 1932 to 1936, Swindler was the first female editor-in-chief of the '' [[American Journal of Archaeology]] '' (its first issue was published in 1885).&lt;ref name=NYTimes_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt;{{sfn|Dyson|1998|p=47}} She also served as a consulting editor for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt;

Swindler wrote several books on early ancient art.{{sfn|Medwid|2000|p=285-6}} Her seminal work, ''Ancient Painting, from the Earliest Times to the Period of Christian Art'' (1929), offered a comprehensive review the subject for scholars as well as students.&lt;ref name=BMC-Atrium/&gt;

==Later years==
In her later years, Swindler was appointed a research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and taught archaeology at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], as well as Bryn Mawr College.{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}} After her retirement from Bryn Mawr College in 1949, Swindler continued to be involved with different archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_obit/&gt; During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Swindler went on excavations to Greece, Egypt, and Turkey. She worked at the [[Gordium|Gordium archaeology site]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt;

Swindler was often called upon for consultation by the American Council of Learned Societies, Archaeological Institute of America, American School of Classical Studies, and the American Association of University Women.&lt;ref name=vol9_issue3/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Swindler died on January 16, 1967, in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]], of bronchopneumonia.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_obit/&gt;{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}}

Swindler, who joined the faculty at Bryn Mawr College in 1912, was a noted professor of classical archaeology at the college and a scholar of ancient painting. She also founded the Ella Riegel Memorial Museum at Bryn Mawr. In addition, Swindler was the first woman editor of the'' [[American Journal of Archaeology]] '' (1932&amp;ndash;46).{{sfn|Sicherman|1980|p=668}}  In 1941, when she was awarded an honorary degree from Indiana University, Swindler became the first woman to deliver a commencement address at IU.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
Swindler was regarded as an authority on ancient Greek paintings and received numerous honors and awards,&lt;ref name=NYTimes_obit/&gt;{{sfn|Read|Witlieb|1992|p=432}} including the following:

A '''memorial''' is an object which serves as a focus for memory of something, usually a person (who has died) or an event. Popular forms of memorials include landmark objects or [[art objects]] such as [[sculpture]]s, [[statue]]s or [[fountain]]s and [[park]]s.

==Types==
The most common type of memorial is the [[Headstone|gravestone]] or the [[memorial plaque]]. Also common are [[war memorial]]s commemorating those who have died in [[war]]s. Memorials in the form of a [[cross]] are called [[intending cross]]es.

[[Online memorial]]s and tributes are becoming increasingly popular especially with the increase in [[natural burial]] where the laying of gravestones, or memorial plaques, is often not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What memorials are there? |url=http://www.nativewoodland.eu/index.php?page=natural-burial-faqs}} By native woodlands.eu.&lt;/ref&gt;

When somebody has died, the family may request that a memorial gift (usually [[money]]) be given to a designated [[Charitable organization|charity]], or that a tree be planted in memory of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-woodland/w-woodland-resources/w-woodland-guidance-commemorative_trees.htm |title=Commemorative trees |publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] |date=1 September 1997|accessdate=4 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210160645/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-woodland/w-woodland-resources/w-woodland-guidance-commemorative_trees.htm |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those temporary or makeshift memorials are also called grassroots memorials.&lt;ref&gt;''Grassroots Memorials: The Politics of Memorializing Traumatic Death'', eds Peter Jan Margry and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero (New York: Berghahn, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, when a high school student has died, the memorials are placed in the form of a [[scholarship]], to be awarded to high-achieving students in future years.

The '''Mount Vernon Ladies' Association''' is a non-profit organization that preserves and maintains the [[Mount Vernon]] estate originally owned by [[George Washington]] and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/mount-vernon.html |title="Saving Mount Vernon: The Birthplace of Preservation of America", '&amp;#39;National Building Museum'&amp;#39;, February 15, 2003 – September 21, 2003 |publisher=Nbm.org |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded in 1853 by [[Ann Pamela Cunningham]] of Rosemont Plantation, South Carolina.

==History==
After the deaths of George Washington (in 1799) and his widow [[Martha Washington|Martha]] (in 1802), Mount Vernon remained in the family for three generations. John Augustine Washington III, a great-great-nephew of George Washington, eventually inherited the property, but he could not afford to maintain it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/john-augustine-washington-iii/|title=John Augustine Washington III|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1850s the home was beginning to crumble. However, John Washington would not sell to commercial developers and insisted that the new owner preserve Mount Vernon as an historic site.

He offered to sell the estate to either the Federal government or the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], but the legislatures declined, saying it would not be proper to spend taxpayers' money to acquire private property.

In 1853, [[South Carolina]] planter and socialite Louise Dalton Bird Cunningham was riding a ferry down the Potomac River one night. She awoke when the ferry captain signaled the horn as they passed Mount Vernon. She saw that Washington's home was in poor condition. She wrote her daughter, [[Ann Pamela Cunningham]], saying, "If the men of America have seen fit to allow the home of its most respected hero to go to ruin, why can't the women of America band together to save it?"

Inspired by her mother's words, the younger Cunningham decided to initiate a project to raise money to save the plantation. She wrote an open letter to the editor of the South Carolina newspaper, ''Charleston Mercury'', titled "To the Ladies of the South." It appealed to American women to donate funds to rescue Mount Vernon. 

She also founded the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association and invited influential women from each state (there were 30 at that time) to serve as its original Vice-Regents. It was the first nationwide women's organization in America and the first private preservation organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Grabitske|first1=David M.|title=First Lady of Preservation: Sarah Sibley and the Mount Vernon Ladies Association|work=[[Minnesota History magazine|Minnesota History]]|date=Winter 2003-2004|url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/58/v58i08p407-416.pdf|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as its first Regent, Cunningham began a nationwide fundraising effort through the Association to save the home of the first president. Initially they planned to raise the money and transfer it to Virginia to buy the property. It would delegate care to the Association. That arrangement proved unworkable. In March 1858, [[Virginia's House of Delegates]] defeated a bill to buy Mount Vernon.

John Washington agreed to sell directly to the Association. The contract was signed in Richmond on April 6, 1858; the gold pen used by Cunningham is held by the Association. He agreed to sell the Mansion, outbuildings, and 200 surrounding acres to the Association for $200,000. He took an immediate down payment of $18,000 and the balance was to be paid in four installments, payable on February 22 (Washington's birthday) each of the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?npoId=419203&amp;partner=justgive |title=GuideStar nonprofit reports and Forms 990 for donors, grantmakers and businesses |publisher=[[GuideStar]] |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://external.oneonta.edu/cooper/articles/suny/1999suny-norwood.html |title=Domesticating Revolutionary Sentiment in Susan Fenimore Cooper's Mount Vernon: A Letter to the Children of America |publisher=[[James Fenimore Cooper]] Society |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Edward Everett]] and [[William Lowndes Yancey]] were among supporters who conducted speaking tours about Washington/Mount Vernon to raise money to complete the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/early-history-of-the-mount-vernon-ladies-association/|title=Early History of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association|website=George Washington Digital Encyclopedia|publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association raised the capital in about eighteen months, announcing it had met its goal in mid-December 1859. The Association took formal possession on Washington's birthday, and John A. Washington and his family moved out of the Mansion on February 22, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Dorothy Troth. '''Presence of a Lady: Mount Vernon 1861–1868''' (Mt. Vernon Publishing: Washington DC: 1946) pp. 90&lt;/ref&gt; 

To demonstrate their nationwide appeal at a time of high sectional tensions, the Association renamed the group as  ''The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association of the Union''. Ann Pamela Cunningham's vision became the Association's mission statement: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ladies, the home of Washington is in your charge – see to it that you keep it the home of Washington. Let no irreverent hand change it; no vandal hands desecrate it with the fingers of progress. Those who go to the home in which he lived and died wish to see in what he lived and died. Let one spot in this grand country of ours be saved from change. Upon you rests this duty.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Association maintains a headquarters on the Mount Vernon property. It has a Regent, or chairman, and 30 trustees, or Vice Regents, who represent their home states. The non-profit Association is fully private, relying on admission fees, revenues from food and gift sales, and donations from foundations, businesses, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=5487 |title=Charity Navigator Rating - Mount Vernon Ladies' Association |publisher=Charitynavigator.org |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Civil War ended in 1865, Vice Regents agreed to take responsibility for the preservation and restoration of individual rooms. Detailed inventories taken in 1799 following George Washington's death were used in determining what furnishings were original to Mount Vernon. Decades of research as well as gifts, loans, and purchases were conducted to get the original furnishings returned to Mt. Vernon.

Congresswoman [[Frances P. Bolton]], who served as Vice Regent from Ohio from 1938 to 1977, launched an effort in the 1940s to preserve the view across the [[Potomac River]]. The Association purchased {{convert|750|acre|km2}} along the (opposite) Maryland shore, which became the nucleus of the {{convert|4000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Piscataway Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/mountvernonlad_reza.htm |title=Ann Pamela Cunningham And The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association |publisher=Essortment.com |date=May 16, 1986 |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has helped preserve the landscape as the Washingtons would have seen it.

On June 22, 2012, the Association purchased Washington's personal copy of the [[United States Constitution]] at auction for $9.8 million. The bound volume was specially printed for Washington in 1789, his first year in office as president, and contains his handwritten notes and markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47924858/ns/us_news-life/ |title=Washington's Constitution get record $9.8 million |publisher=msnbc.msn.com |date=Jun 22, 2012 |accessdate=Jun 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Washington books and manuscripts purchased by the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association are safeguarded in [[Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington|The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington]].

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

The '''''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] of [[philosophy]] published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] on behalf of the School of Philosophy ([[University of Southern California]]) and is edited by the faculty there. The journal covers all major areas of philosophy in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], sometimes as special issues aimed at a particular topic.

==History==
The journal was established in 1920 as '''''The Personalist''''' by [[Ralph Tyler Flewelling]] and focused on the philosophy of [[personalism]]. It obtained its current name in 1980&lt;ref&gt;''One Hundred Twentieth-Century Philosophers'', edited by Stuart C. Brown, Diané Collinson, and Robert Wilkinson, (Routledge, 1998) p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and "devoted itself exclusively to analytical and logical philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siu.edu/~tpf/ "An Editorial Statement on the Transition Between Journals"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160903/http://www.siu.edu/%7Etpf/ |date=2008-05-15 }}, Randall E.

'''Pennsylvania Dutch English''' is a dialect of [[English language|English]] that has been influenced by the [[Pennsylvania German language]]. It is largely spoken in [[South Central Pennsylvania]], both by people who are monolingual (in English) and bilingual (in Pennsylvania German and English). The dialect has been dying out, as non-Amish younger [[Pennsylvania Germans]] tend to speak modern [[General American English]]. Very few non-Amish members of these people can speak the Pennsylvania German language, although most know some words and phrases. The World War II Generation was the last generation in which Pennsylvania Dutch was widely spoken outside the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities.

==Features of Pennsylvania German influence==
Pennsylvania Dutch English differs from standard [[American English]] in various ways. Some of its hallmark features include the following:

*Widespread [[voice (phonetics)|devoicing]] of [[obstruent]]s.{{Explain|date=May 2017}}
*The use of certain vowel variants in specific [[phonology|phonological]] contexts.{{Explain|date=May 2017}}
*The use of Pennsylvania German [[verb]] and [[noun]] stems in word construction.{{Examples|date=May 2017}}
*Specific intonation patterns for questions.{{Examples|date=May 2017}}
*Special placement of [[prepositional phrase]]s in sentences (so that "Throw some hay over the fence for the horse" might be rendered "Throw the horse over the fence some hay").
*The use of "ain't" and "not" or "say" as  question tags.
*The use of "still" as a [[habitual aspect|habitual]] verbal marker.{{Explain|date=May 2017}}
*Use of the word "yet" to mean "still," such as "do you work at the store yet?" to mean "do you still work at the store?"
*Use of terms such as "doncha know" and "so I do" or "so he does" at the end of declaratory sentences.
*Use of the word "awhile" at the end of sentences proposing simultaneous actions (e.g. "Go get the tea out of the pantry; I'll start boiling the water awhile.").
*Omitting "to be" from the passive construction in an infinitive following "needs" or "wants"( e.g. "the car needs cleaned" instead of "the car needs to be cleaned").

'''Photorealism''' is a genre of art that encompasses [[painting]], [[drawing]] and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a [[photograph]] and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another [[Medium (arts)|medium]]. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"&gt;Lindey (1980), pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], "The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II", ''Art In America.'' 61 (November–December 1973), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a counter to [[Abstract Expressionism]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt; as well as [[Minimal art|Minimalist art movements]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"&gt;Battock, Gregory. Preface to [[Louis K. Meisel|Meisel, Louis K.]] (1980), ''Photorealism''. New York:[[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"/&gt;  Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a [[camera]] and photographs is an acceptance of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt; However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"&gt;Scharf, Aaron (1969), ''Art and Photography'' Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations;&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"/&gt; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;  Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as [[Edward Hopper]], they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"&gt;Chase, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"&gt;Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), ''American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present''. New York:Rizzoli. {{ISBN|0847800490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"/&gt;

The association of Photorealism to ''[[Trompe L'oeil]]'' is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition. New York: [[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. p. 709. {{ISBN|0810939134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to "fool the eye" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;

===Definition===
The word ''Photorealism'' was coined by [[Louis K. Meisel]]&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"&gt;[http://www.meiselgallery.com/ Meiselgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show "Twenty-two Realists."&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"&gt;Meisel (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, [[New Realism]], Sharp Focus Realism, or [[hyperrealism (painting)|Hyper-Realism]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12" /&gt;

Louis K. Meisel,&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"/&gt; two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"/&gt;  The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#  The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
#  The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semimechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
#  The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
#  The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
#  The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the [[photograph]].  In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"/&gt;  Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto [[canvas]]es.  Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide.  This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and [[virtuoso|virtuosity]] to simulate, such as [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s in specular surfaces and the [[geometry|geometric]] rigor of man-made environs.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists===
The first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as [[John Baeder]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Charles Bell (painter)|Charles Bell]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]],  and [[Tom Blackwell]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"&gt;Meisel (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--[[landscape]]s (mostly [[cityscape|urban]] rather than naturalistic), [[portrait]]s, and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"/&gt; In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) [http://onmywall.co/photorealism-technical-mastery-and-effortless-style/ "Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style"] ''On My Wall''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John DeAndrea]] are [[sculptor]]s associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated [[hair]] and real clothes. They are called ''Verists.''&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980" /&gt;

===Since 2000===

[[File:Glennray Tutor 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dream of Love'' (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist [[Glennray Tutor]]'s work]]

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries.  According to Meisel and Chase's ''Photorealism at the Millennium'', only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ten including [[John Baeder]] and Howard Kanovitz.

Artists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists.  Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by [[Glennray Tutor]]. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph.  Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with [[Franz Gertsch]] in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and [[Roberto Bernardi]] are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisel, Millennium"/&gt; This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as [[The Prague Project]], in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as "[[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]."&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media.  The artist [[William Fink|Bill Fink]] has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Photo Realism: Artist Bill Fink uses human ash to create a visual AIDS memorial|author=Steve Greenberg|date=2 June 1992|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=604|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as [[Juxtapoz]]'s 2014 book entitled ''Hyperreal'' detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

A '''possessive''' form ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|poss}}''')   	    is a word or grammatical construction used to indicate a relationship of [[possession (linguistics)|possession]] in a broad sense. This can include strict [[ownership]], or a number of other types of relation to a greater or lesser degree analogous to it.&lt;ref name="alt-usage-english1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alt-usage-english.org/genitive_and_possessive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115014832/http://www.alt-usage-english.org/genitive_and_possessive.html |archivedate=2014-11-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Most European languages feature possessive forms associated with [[personal pronoun]]s, like the [[English grammar|English]] ''my'', ''mine'', ''your'', ''yours'', ''his'' and so on. There are two main ways in which these can be used (and a [[#Terminology|variety of terminologies]] for each):
* Together with a [[noun]], as in ''my car'', ''your sisters'', ''his boss''. Here the possessive form serves as an [[adjective]] or [[determiner]], and may be called a '''possessive adjective''', '''[[possessive determiner]]''' or '''adjectival possessive pronoun'''.
* Without an accompanying noun, as in ''mine is red'', ''I prefer yours'', ''this book is his''. A possessive used in this way is called a '''substantive possessive pronoun''' or an '''absolute pronoun'''.

Some languages, including English, also have possessive forms derived from nouns or [[noun phrase]]s, such as ''Jane's'', ''cows' '' and ''nobody else's''. These can be used in the same two ways as the pronoun-derived forms: adjectivally, as in ''Jane's office''; and substantivally, as in ''that one is Jane's''.

Possessives are sometimes regarded as a [[grammatical case]] (the '''possessive case'''), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the [[genitive case]], or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the [[Cariban languages]], can be said to have a '''possessed case''', used to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the [[possessive affix]], usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''taloni'' ("my house"), where ''talo'' means "house" and the suffix ''-ni'' means "my".

The concepts of possessive forms and [[genitive case|genitive forms]] are sometimes conflated, although they are not exactly the same. The genitive form, which does not exist in modern English as an inflection, represents an ''of'' relationship, which may or may not be possessive; in other words, the possessive is a subset of genitive. For example, the genitive form "speed of the car" is equivalent to the possessive form "the car's speed". However, the genitive form "pack of dogs" is not the same as the possessive form "dogs' pack" (though it is the same as "dog pack", which is not possessive).

The [[list of glossing abbreviations|glossing abbreviation]] {{sc|'''pos'''}} or {{sc|'''poss'''}} may be used to indicate possessive forms.

==Formation==

===From pronouns===
It is common for languages to have independent [[possessive determiner]]s (adjectives) and possessive [[pronoun]]s corresponding to the [[personal pronoun]]s of the language. For example, to the [[English personal pronouns]] ''I'', ''you'', ''he'', ''she'', ''it'', ''we'', ''they'', there correspond the respective possessive determiners ''my'', ''your'', ''his'', ''her'', ''its'', ''our'' and ''their'', and the (substantival) possessive pronouns ''mine'', ''yours'', ''his'', ''hers'', ''its'' (rare), ''ours'' and ''theirs''. In some instances there is no difference in form between the determiner and the pronoun; examples include the English ''his'' (and ''its''), and informal [[Finnish (language)|Finnish]] ''meidän'' (meaning either "our" or "ours").

In some languages, possessive determiners are subject to [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun they modify, and possessive pronouns may be subject to agreement with their [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]], in terms of relevant categories of [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical case|case]]. For example, [[French grammar|French]] has ''mon'', ''ma'', ''mes'', respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English ''my'', as well as the various possessive pronoun forms ''le mien'', ''la mienne'', ''les mien(ne)s'' corresponding to English ''mine''.

Since personal pronouns may also agree in number and gender with their own antecedent or [[referent]], the possessive forms may consequently show agreement with either the "possessor" or the "possessed", or both. In French (and most other [[Romance languages]]) the third-person singular possessives do not indicate the gender of the possessor, although they agree with the possessed (''son'', ''sa'' and ''ses'' can all mean either "his", "her" or "its"). This contrasts with English and standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]], where the form of the possessives (''his'', ''her'', ''its''; ''zijn'', ''haar'') indicates the grammatical or [[natural gender]] of the possessor, but does not depend on properties of the possessed. However [[German language|German]] and several [[Dutch dialects]]&lt;ref&gt;These include [[Limburgish]] and [[Brabantian]].&lt;/ref&gt; additionally inflect their possessives, thus giving agreement with both possessor and possessed; German has ''sein'' and ''ihr'' meaning "his" and "her" respectively, but these inflect to give (for example) feminine forms like ''seine'' and ''ihre'', depending on the gender (and number and case) of the thing possessed.

In languages that have a [[genitive case]], the possessive forms corresponding to pronouns may or may not resemble the genitive of those pronouns. For example, in [[Russian grammar|Russian]], the genitive of я ''ja'' "I" is меня ''menya'' ("of me"), whereas the corresponding possessive is мой ''moy'' ("my, mine", in masculine singular nominative form). In [[German pronouns|German]] the two sets of forms are quite similar (for example, the genitive of ''ich'' "I" is ''meiner'', the corresponding possessive pronoun is also ''meiner'' in the masculine singular nominative, and the possessive determiner is ''mein'' with various endings).

Some languages have no distinct possessive determiners as such, instead using a pronoun together with a '''possessive particle''' – a [[grammatical particle]] used to indicate possession. For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], "my" or "mine' can be expressed as ''watashi no'', where ''watashi'' means "I" and ''no'' is the possessive particle. Similarly in [[Mandarin Chinese]], "my" or "mine" is ''wǒ de'', where ''wǒ'' means "I" and ''de'' is the possessive particle.

An alternative to the pronominal possessive determiner, found in some languages, including [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian grammar|Hungarian]], is the [[possessive affix]], usually a suffix, attached to the noun denoting the thing possessed. For example, in Finnish the suffix ''-ni'' means "my", producing forms such as ''taloni'' ("my house"), from ''talo'' ("house"). Hungarian possessive suffixes are used in a similar way, as in ''háza'' ("his/her house"), formed from ''ház'' ("house"). In Hungarian this affix can also be used when the possessor is represented by a full noun, as described in the next section.

Pronouns other than personal pronouns, if they have possessive forms, are likely to form them in a similar way to nouns (see below). In English, for example, possessive forms derived from other pronouns include ''one's'', ''somebody's'' and ''nobody's''. There is however a distinct form ''whose''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120721122456/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/whose] &lt;/ref&gt; for the possessive of the [[interrogative word|interrogative]] and [[relative pronoun]] ''who''; other languages may have similarly functioning words, such as the Russian чей ''chey'' ("whose?"). Another possessive found in Russian and other [[Slavic languages]] is the reflexive possessive, corresponding to the general [[reflexive pronoun]]; the Russian form is свой ''svoj'' (meaning "one's (own)", "my (own)", etc.).

===From nouns===
In some languages, possessives are formed from nouns or [[noun phrase]]s. In English, this is done using the ending ''-'s'', as in ''Jane's'', ''heaven's'', ''the boy's'', ''those men's'', or sometimes just an apostrophe, as in ''workers','' ''Jesus','' ''the soldiers'.'' Note that the ending can be added at the end of a noun phrase even when the phrase does not end with its [[head (linguistics)|head]] noun, as in ''the king of England's''; this property inclines many linguists towards the view that the ending is a [[clitic]] rather than a [[grammatical case|case ending]] (see [[#Possessive and possessed case|below]], and further at [[English possessive]]).

In languages that have a genitive case, the genitive form of a noun may sometimes be used as a possessive (as in German ''Karls Haus'' "Karl's house"). Languages such as Japanese and Chinese form possessive constructions with nouns using possessive particles, in the same way as described for pronouns above. An example from Japanese is ''neko no iro'' ("the cat's color"), where ''neko'' means "cat", ''no'' is the particle, and ''iro'' means "color".

In other languages, noun possessives must be formed [[periphrasis|periphrastically]], as in French ''la plume de ma tante'' ("my aunt's pen", literally "the pen of my aunt"). In [[Hungarian grammar|Hungarian]], the construction ''Mária háza'' is used ("Maria's house", literally "Maria her house", where the final ''-a'' in ''háza'' is the [[possessive suffix]] meaning "her"). The possessor noun can carry an additional [[dative]] marker, in which case an [[article (grammar)|article]] appears before the noun. For example, "Peter's house" may be translated either as ''Péter háza'' (literally "Peter his-house"), or ''Péternek a háza'' ("of-Peter the his-house").

==Syntax==
Possessive determiners (adjectives) are used in combination with a noun, playing the role of a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] or [[attributive adjective]]. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the [[definite article]]. For example, ''my car'' implies '''''the''' car that belongs to me/is used by me''; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*''the my car'') or other definite determiner such as a [[demonstrative]] (*''this my car''), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that ''the'' can (''all my cars'', ''my three cars'', etc.; see [[English determiners]]). This is not the case in all languages; for example in [[Italian language|Italian]] the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in ''la mia macchina'' ("my car", literally "the my car") or ''quel tuo libro'' ("that book of yours", literally "that your book").

Some languages place the possessive after the noun, as in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''boka mi'' ("my book").&lt;ref&gt;In Norwegian bokmål written form, the phrase could alternatively be written as ''min bok'' due to bokmål's Danish heritage.&lt;/ref&gt; Here again the equivalent of the definite article – in this case the definite ending ''-a'' on the noun ''bok'' – is used in addition to the possessive. However, the forms ''min bok'' or ''mi bok'', where the noun ''bok'' is in the indefinite form, are equally correct.

Possessive determiners may be modified with an [[adverb]], as adjectives are, although not as freely or as commonly as is the case with adjectives. Such modification is generally limited to such adverbs as ''more'', ''less'', or ''as much ... as'' ([[comparative]]) or ''mostly'' ([[superlative]]), for example in ''This is more my team than your team'' and ''This is mostly my team''.

Substantival possessive pronouns are used on their own and cannot be used to describe a noun, playing the role of [[noun phrase]]s, so ''mine'' may stand for "my cat", "my sister", "my things", etc. In some languages these may require articles or other determiners, as the French ''le mien'' etc. In English, the ''-'s'' possessives formed from nouns or noun phrases can be used in the same way; ''the president's'' may stand for "the president's office", "the president's policies", etc., as determined by the context.

A related use is that of the [[predicative expression]], as in sentences like ''the book is mine''. Here ''mine'' may be considered to be a [[predicate adjective]] (like ''red'' in ''the book is red'') rather than a pronoun; in English, however, the same possessive form is used anyway. Other languages may use differing forms; for example French may use ''...est à moi'' for "...is mine".

A particular use of possessive pronouns (and equivalent noun forms) in English is that illustrated in phrases like ''a friend of mine'' and ''that coat of Fred's'', used to form possessive expressions when the desired determiner is something other than the default ''the'' implied in the usual possessive determiner.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for possessive words and phrases is not consistent among all [[grammar]]ians and [[linguistics|linguists]].

What some authors refer to as ''possessives'', others may call ''genitives'', and vice versa. Nowadays, however, the term ''[[genitive case|genitive]]'' is most commonly used in relation to languages with a developed [[grammatical case|case]] system (in which the "genitive case" often has a wider range of functions than merely forming possessives), while in languages like English, where their status as a grammatical case is doubtful, such words are usually called possessives rather than genitives. A given language may have distinct genitive and possessive forms, as in the example of Russian given above. (The English possessive in ''-'s'' is sometimes called the ''[[Saxon genitive]]''; this alludes to its derivation from the genitive case that existed in [[Old English]]. It may also be called the ''prenominal genitive''; this also applies to analogous forms in languages such as German.)

Words like the English ''my'' and ''your'' have traditionally been called ''possessive adjectives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/my |title=My |website=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biber ''et al.'' (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;270&amp;ndash;72&lt;/ref&gt; However, some modern linguists note that in a language such as English they behave like [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s rather than true [[adjective]]s (see examples in the {{slink||Syntax}} section above), and thus prefer to call them ''possessive determiners''. In some other languages, however, the equivalent words behave more like true adjectives (compare the Italian example above, for instance).

While for most authors the term ''possessive pronoun'' is reserved (as in this article) for possessives like ''mine'' and ''yours'' which do not qualify an explicit noun,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygiS6xURfLgC&amp;pg=PA69 ''All about grammar'', p. 69], Rosemary Allen, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dRihR-NzP3gC&amp;pg=PT228 ''Easy French step-by-step'', p. 210], Myrna Bell Rochester, McGraw Hill Professional, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the term is sometimes taken also to include other possessive forms that correspond to pronouns, even though they behave as determiners, qualifying a noun, such as ''my'' and ''your''.&lt;ref&gt;Jesperson (1949), pp. 399&amp;ndash;405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biber ''et al.'' 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;340&amp;ndash;42&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors who classify both sets of words as ''possessive pronouns'' or ''genitive pronouns'' apply the terms '''''dependent/independent'''''&lt;ref&gt;Payne and Huddleston 2002, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''weak/strong'''''&lt;ref&gt;Quirk ''et al.'' (1985) pp.&amp;nbsp;361&amp;ndash;62&lt;/ref&gt; to refer, respectively, to ''my'', ''your'', etc. and ''mine'', ''yours'', etc. Thus ''my'' is termed a ''dependent'' (or ''weak'') ''possessive pronoun'', while ''mine'' is an ''independent'' (or ''strong'') ''possessive pronoun''. Also, the first set may be called ''adjectival'' and the second set ''substantival'' possessive pronouns.

According to the ''[[OED]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition, ''possessive''.&lt;/ref&gt; the first reference to possessive pronouns is found in 1530; the first use of ''possessive'' as a noun occurs in 1591, the first use of ''possessive case'' (which notes that it is like the Latin genitive, and may be called the genitive case in reference to English also) occurs in 1763, and the first use of ''possessive adjective'' dates from 1870.

==Possessive and possessed case==
Nouns or pronouns taking the form of a possessive are sometimes described as being in the ''possessive case''. A more commonly 
-used term in describing the grammar of various languages is ''[[genitive case]]'', but that usually denotes a case with a broader range of functions than just producing possessive forms. (Some languages occasionally use the [[dative case#Slavic languages|dative case]] to denote the possessor, as in the [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''kosa mu je gusta'' "his hair is thick" (literally "the hair to him is thick" in which "to him" is the dative pronoun ''mu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Possessivitätsausdruck durch Relativpronomen im Kroatisch-Serbischen |trans-title=The expression of possessiveness by means of relative pronouns in Croat(ian)-Serbian |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426794.POSSESSIVITATSAUSDRUCK.PDF |language=German |journal=Die Welt der Slaven |location=Munich |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=328, 337–338 |year=1995 |issn=0043-2520 |id={{ZDB|202661-2}} |archivedate=2 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNbDXnU?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426794.POSSESSIVITATSAUSDRUCK.PDF |accessdate=9 June 2015 |df= }} ([http://data.onb.ac.at/rec/AC07264858 ÖNB]).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Other theorists reject the idea that the possessive in languages like English as represents a [[grammatical case]] since possessive forms do not generally behave in a parallel fashion to what are normally identified as cases. In particular, in English, as noted above, the ''-'s'' can attach to noun phrases even when they do not end with their head noun, as in ''the king of Spain's'', which is not typical behavior for a case ending. For further discussion of the issue, see {{slink|English possessive|Status of the possessive as a grammatical case}}.

Some languages, such as the [[Cariban languages]], can be said to have a ''possessed case'' to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship.&lt;ref&gt;"On reconstructing grammar: comparative Cariban morphosyntax", by Spike Gildea, {{ISBN|0-19-510952-X}}, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTTZk5O11tgC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22possessed+case%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MxwITYH6LY6ssAOCpYXlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22possessed%20case%22&amp;f=false p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==

The relationship expressed by possessive determiners and similar forms is not necessarily one of possession in the strict sense of [[ownership]]. In English, strict possession has been found to be expressed in only about 40% of the situations labeled as "possessive" by linguists, a fact which may incline some to prefer the more traditional term "[[genitive]]".&lt;ref name="alt-usage-english1"/&gt; The "possessor" may be, for example:
*the person or thing to which the "possessed" stands in the designated relationship (''my mother'', ''his wife'', ''your subordinates'', ''our boss'');
*the person or thing of which the "possessed" is a part (''my leg'', ''the building's walls'');
*a person or thing affiliated with or identifying with the "possessed" (''his country'', ''our class'', ''my people'');
*the performer, or sometimes the undergoer, of an action (''his arrival'', ''the government's overthrow'')
*the creator, supervisor, user, etc. of the "possessed" (''Prince's album'', ''the Irish jockey's horse'').

'''The Regional Oral History Office''' (ROHO) is part of The [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The office was founded in 1954. ROHO conducts, analyzes, teaches about, and preserves [[oral history]] interviews on a wide range of topics related to the history of California and the United States. ROHO staff also conduct research on a wide range of historical topics, utilizing oral history as a central primary source to their scholarship.

ROHO's original name was the Regional Cultural History Office. It was the second oral history office founded in the country, following only Columbia University. The first interview conducted at the office, before it was officially recognized as a unit on campus, was with [[Alice B. Toklas]], the long-time partner of [[Gertrude Stein]].

Since its founding in 1954, ROHO has conducted thousands of interviews in a wide variety of subject areas ranging from law and jurisprudence to food and wine. ROHO features especially strong collections on the development of the arts and letters, science and technology, and labor, social, political, and community history in California. ROHO has also conducted numerous interviews on the history of the University of California. ROHO's interviews with scientists include [[Nobel Prize]] winners such as [[Arthur Kornberg]], [[Paul Berg]], [[Donald A. Glaser]], and [[Charles Townes]]. Other notable interviews with scientists include [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley N. Cohen]]. ROHO has also conducted significant oral histories with well-known artists and authors, such as [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[Carl Rakosi]].

ROHO houses collections of oral histories related to [[women's suffrage]] and the [[home front]] during World War II.

The interviews conducted by ROHO are deposited in over 700 manuscript libraries worldwide. Many of the interviews are accessible online. The [[Bancroft Library]] also houses the original tapes for all of the interviews conducted by ROHO. Once completed, the oral histories are referenced by both scholars and students around the world.

ROHO's first director was Corinne Gilb, who led the program from 1954 to 1958.  Between 1958 and 2000, [[Willa Baum]] directed ROHO. Under her tenure, ROHO amassed over 1,600 oral histories on a wide variety of subjects. Richard Cándida Smith, who is also a professor in the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley, directed the office until spring of 2012. During Cándida Smith's tenure, the number of oral history transcripts made available online expanded dramatically. Neil Henry, formerly Dean of the Department of Journalism  at the University of California, Berkeley, is the current director, serving a two-year appointment that commenced in September 2012.

'''Salvage ethnography''' is the recording of the practices and folklore of cultures threatened with extinction, including as a result of modernization. It is generally associated with the American [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Franz Boas]]; he and his students aimed to record vanishing [[Native American cultures in the United States|Native American cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Craig J. |last=Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780195123715 |contribution=Salvage ethnography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=%22%22salvage%20anthropology%22%22 |page=424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, anthropologists have used the term as part of a critique of 19th-century [[ethnography]] and early modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Jacob|title=Ethnographic Salvage and the Shaping of Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist |series=New Series|volume=72|issue=6|date=Dec 1970|pages=1289–1299|doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.6.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin of the term ==
The term "salvage ethnography" was coined by [[Jacob W. Gruber]], who identified its emergence with 19th-century ethnographers documenting the languages of peoples being conquered and colonized by European countries or the United States. According to Gruber, one of the first official statements acknowledging that a major effect of [[colonialism]] was the [[language extinction|destruction of existing languages]] and ways of life was ''The report of the British Select Committee of Aborigines'' (1837). 

As a scholarly response, Gruber quotes [[James Cowles Prichard]]'s address before the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1839, referring to the [[Old Testament]] tale of [[Cain and Abel]]:
{{quote|Wherever Europeans have settled, their arrival has been the harbinger of extermination to the native tribes. Whenever the simple pastoral tribes come into relations with the more civilised agricultural nations, the allotted time of their destruction is at hand; and this seems to have been the case from the time when the first shepherd fell by the hand of the first tiller of soil. Now, as the progress of colonization is so much extended of late years, and the obstacle of distance and physical difficulties are so much overcome, it may be calculated that these calamities, impending over the greater part of mankind, if we reckon by families and races, are to be accelerated in their progress; and it may happen that, in the course of another century, the aboriginal nations of most parts of the world will have ceased entirely to exist. In the meantime, if Christian nations think it not their duty to interpose and save the numerous tribes of their own species from utter extermination, it is of the greatest importance, in a philosophical point of view, to obtain much more extensive information than we now possess of their physical and moral characters. A great number of curious problems in physiology, illustrative of the history of the species, and the laws of their propagation, remain as yet imperfectly solved. The psychology of these races has been but little studied in an enlightened manner; and yet this is wanting in order to complete the history of human nature, and the philosophy of the human mind. How can this be obtained when so many tribes shall have become extinct, and their thoughts shall have perished with them?}}

== Conservation and art ==
[[Image:A smoky day at the Sugar Bowl--Hupa.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[Hupa]] fisherman—In the early 20th century, [[Edward Curtis]] traveled across America recording photographs of the disappearing lifestyle of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes.]]

[[Frances Densmore]] (1867–1957), an influential ethnomusicologist, worked in the tradition of salvage ethnography. Densmore recorded the songs and lyrics of Native Americans in an attempt to preserve them permanently. Many of her original recordings, preserved on [[wax cylinder]]s, are archived at the [[Library of Congress]].

Artists compounded the work of professional anthropologists during this time period. Photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]] (1868–1952) was preceded by painter [[George Catlin]] (1796–1872) in attempting to capture indigenous North American traditions that they believed to be disappearing. Both Curtis and Catlin have been accused of taking [[artistic license]] by embellishing a scene or making something appear more authentically "Native American". Curtis notes in the introduction to his series on the North American Indian: "The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost."  This statement reflects the artist's paternalistic concern for documenting the culture of American Indians and is representative of both the popular and academic sentiment of the time.

Salvage ethnography started to be applied methodically in [[visual anthropology]] as [[ethnographic film]] since the 1950s by [[filmmaker]]s such as [[Jean Rouch]] in France, [[Michel Brault]] and [[Pierre Perrault]] in Canada, or [[António Campos]] in Portugal (early 1960s), followed by others (1970s).

Salvage ethnography is often taught in film and [[media studies]] courses as a style of filmmaking that captures a civilization or people's former way of living. The best example of this would be [[Robert Flaherty]]'s ''[[Nanook of the North]]''. In ''Nanook'', Flaherty staged incidents and scenes that did not fairly represent the Inuit tribe's current way of life, but rather their "former majesty".

'''Serabit el-Khadim''' ({{lang-ar|سرابيط الخادم}} {{IPA-ar|saraːˈbiːtˤ alˈχaːdɪm}} (also transliterated Serabit al-Khadim, Serabit el-Khadem) is a  locality in the southwest [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]], where [[turquoise]] was mined extensively in antiquity, mainly by the ancient Egyptians. Archaeological excavation, initially by Sir [[Flinders Petrie]], revealed ancient mining camps and a long-lived Temple of [[Hathor]], the Egyptian goddess who was favoured as a protector in desert regions.

==Archaeological findings==
Thirty incised [[graffiti]] in a "[[Middle Bronze Age alphabets#Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic script]]" shed light on the [[history of the alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Kyle McCarter. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''37'''.3 (September 1974:54-68) pp 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The mines were worked by prisoners of war from southwest Asia who presumably spoke a [[Northwest Semitic]] language, such as the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] that was ancestral to [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].  After a century of study and the initial publication by [[Flinders Petrie|Sir Flinders Petrie]], researchers agree on the decipherment of a single phrase, cracked in 1916 by [[Alan Gardiner]]: לבעלת ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|l bʿlt}}'' (to the Lady) [''{{Transl|ar|DIN|baʿlat}}'' (Lady) being a title of Hathor and the feminine of the title ''[[Baal|{{Transl|ar|DIN|Baʿal}}]]'' (Lord) given to the Semitic god], although the word ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|m’hb}}'' (loved) is frequently cited as a second word. 

The script has graphic similarities with the Egyptian [[hieratic]] script, the less elaborate form of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s. In the 1950s and 1960s it was common to show the derivation of the Canaanite alphabet from hieratic, using [[William F. Albright|William Albright]]'s interpretations of Proto-Sinaitic as the key. It was generally accepted that the language of the inscriptions was Semitic, that the script had a hieratic prototype and was ancestral to the Semitic alphabets, and that the script was itself acrophonic and alphabetic (more specifically, a consonantal alphabet or [[abjad]]). The word ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|baʿlat}}'' (Lady) lends credence to the identification of the language as Semitic. However, the lack of further progress in decipherment casts doubt over the other suppositions, and the identification of the hieratic prototypes remains speculative.

Romanus Francois Butin of Catholic University of America published articles in the ''Harvard Theological Review'' based on the 1927 Harvard Mission to Serabit and the 1930 Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition. His article "The Serabit Inscriptions: II. The Decipherment and Significance of the Inscriptions" provides an early detailed study of the inscriptions and some dozen B/W photographs, hand-drawings and analysis of the previously published inscriptions, #346, 349, 350-354, and three new inscriptions, #355-368.  At that time, #355 was still in situ at Serabit but had not been photographed by the previous Harvard Mission.  In 1932, he wrote:  "The present article was begun with the limited purpose of making known the new inscriptions discovered by the Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition to Serabit in the spring of 1930. In the course of this study, I perceived that some signs doubtful in the inscriptions already published were made clear by the new slabs, and I decided to go over the entire field again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7813429 Vol. 25:2 (1932) The Serabit Expedition of 1930: IV. The Protosinaitic Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; Both articles provide an analysis of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions during earlier expeditions to the site.

==Relation to Mount Sinai==
In her book ''A History of Sinai'', [[Lina Eckenstein]] theorized that Serabit el-Khadim was the historical site of Mt. Sinai where Moses received the 10 commandments.  This theory comes in no small part to the site containing a temple of [[Hathor]] which is believed to be the Golden Calf idol constructed by the Hebrews while Moses was on the mountain top.

== Conditions ==
Aspiring K-pop idols, known as "trainees," sign contracts with management agencies when the trainee is as young as 12 or 13 years old.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=2996232|title=Why K-pop idols flee from their groups|last=Sung|first=So-young|date=2014-10-20|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may take ten years for an agency to groom the trainee and for them to debut on stage, according to the former head of the Korea Entertainment Law Society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both trainees and K-pop idols who have debuted typically live in dormitories, where their management agencies control their diets, their love lives, and their behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-25/k-pop-s-gross-double-standard-women|title=K-pop’s gross double standard for women|last=Volodzko|first=David|date=2016-04-25|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under most contracts, trainees and K-pop idols are required to pay back their management agencies for the cost of singing and dancing lessons, their wardrobes and living costs, among other things. As a result, K-pop idols may not make large profits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many K-pop groups often take years to break even, and thus do not receive their share of any profits made from their songs until their trainee debt is paid off. The notable exception to this are groups from the "Big 3" companies - [[SM Entertainment]], [[YG Entertainment]], and [[JYP Entertainment]]. Trainees under these three companies get paid as soon as they debut and generally do not face trainee debt at all, unless they leave before completion of their contracts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/01/29/how-much-money-k-pop-idol-makes-according-former-k-pop-idol&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
In 2008, three members of the [[boy band]] [[TVXQ]] took their management agency [[SM Entertainment]] to court, claiming that the agency's 13-year-contract was too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following year, in 2009, South Korea's [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Fair Trade Commission]] (KFTC) created a rule that limited entertainment contracts to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/12/135_169279.html|title=K-pop stars punished by unfair contracts|last=Kim|first=Hyo-jin|date=2014-12-03|work=Korea Times|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the KFTC again put restrictions on entertainment contracts. Among other things, the 2017 reforms reduced the financial penalties for K-pop trainees that break their contracts early and made it more difficult for companies to force K-pop idols to renew their contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2017/03/08/major-k-pop-agencies-reform-unfair-contract-clauses|title=Major K-pop agencies to reform unfair contract clauses|last=|first=|date=2017-03-08|website=SBS PopAsia|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Disquieting Muses''''' (in {{lang-it|Le Muse inquietanti}}, [[1916 in art|1916]], [[1917 in art|1917]] or [[1918 in art|1918]]&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]].&lt;ref name=Surrealism&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klingsöhr-Leroy|first1=Cathrin|last2=Grosenick|first2=Uta|title=Surrealism|year=2004|publisher=Taschen|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBZbhP3rW-YC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;ots=pk7IUYXyzn&amp;dq=the%20disquieting%20muses%20chirico&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Disquieting Muses'' was painted during [[World War I]], when De Chirico was in [[Ferrara]]. The [[Castello Estense]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La natura secondo de Chirico|url=http://www.romamultiservizi.it/node/247|publisher=Roma Multiservizi|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; near which de Chirico lived, is in the background, rust-red and among industrial buildings. At the front are the two [[Muse]]s, dressed in [[Classical antiquity|classical]] clothing. One is standing and the other sitting, and they are placed among various objects, including a red mask and staff, an [[allusion]] to [[Melpomene]] and [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], the Muses of tragedy and comedy. The statue on a pedestal in the background is [[Apollo]], leader of the Muses.&lt;ref name=Surrealism/&gt;

Giorgio Castelfranco, an art collector and critic, described the painting in 1948:
{{bquote|The spaces are dominated and interpenetrated fantastically, to such an extent that, at times, the lyric simultaneity of different coordinate systems is reached; this clearly happens in ''Metaphysical Interior'' and also in ''The Disquieting Muse'' where the box in the foreground is seen through the sitting Muse's perspective, and therefore, for the onlooker, in [[reverse perspective|reversed perspective]]... de Chirico's peculiar mindset and culture in those years, founded in a vein of art and thought that is definitely—broadly speaking—anti-[[Impressionism|impressionist]]: an idealistic critique on the categories of time and space, which had found pathetic, alluring terms in [[Schopenhauer]]'s oneric-critique, and also that of young [[Nietzsche]] with regard to the interpretation of Greek tragedy, as well as German illustration tending to classicism, which also took the enigmatic side of ancient myths into consideration.}}

The artist Carlo Belli discussed the merits of the painting in a letter to the collector Feroldi in 1939:
{{quote|[I]t is not the strangeness of the subject that makes this work a great thing, but the marvel that can arise from the unusual positioning of the objects that make up the landscape which can determine the painting's worth. It is the conscious elevation of the human spirit to a higher plane, the carrying of this life into a superior zone where everything is order and light, philosophical silence and measure [...] put two human figures in place of the mannequins [...] the faces will have their own expression and that expression will inescapably drag the work on a lower plane [...] the chronicle of psychological palpitation [...] holds the place which should be held by the sublime [...] The fantastic creatures that dwell in the de Chirican landscape contemplate reality and pour into us the amazement they feel sitting at the edge of eternity.&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;}}

This painting would later become an inspiration for [[Sylvia Plath]]'s poem "The Disquieting Muses". and for the second poem in Mark Strand's "Two de Chiricos" from his Pulitzer Prize collection, ''Blizzard of One.'' 

A copy of this painting, at the moment, is located at the Italian Trade Commission (ITC) office, 33 East 67th Street, New York City. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/inchieste/reportime/economia/italian-sounding-se-il-made-italy-ci-guadagnano-altri/dcc487d2-f54d-11e2-b38b-ce85f307318c.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World &amp;ndash; And How to Reach Them''''' is a 2008 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Lisa Witter]] and [[Lisa Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why political candidates should be sucking up to women |author=Kate Harding |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/06/02/she_spot/ |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The She Spot'' looks at the impact of women on [[social change]], and focuses on the influence women have had on the world, as well as on volunteering. The book incorporates several case studies, polls, and the potential for women to be underrepresented in these polls and studies. It also covers the potential mis-representation in marketing towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The she spot; why women are the market for changing the world--and how to reach them (Book review) |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-183483734.html |newspaper=Reference &amp; Research Book News |date=August 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''The She Spot'' has been positive, with [[Publishers Weekly]] calling it a "thoughtful, helpful guide to nonprofit marketers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nonfiction review - The She Spot: Why Women Are the Market for Changing the World—and How to Reach Them |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57675-472-6 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AdAge|AdAge's]] Matt Kinsey wrote that the book was "good fodder for discussion" but that he was unsure that Witter and Chen's "formula alone can commandeer a loyal female audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finding 'The She Spot' More Important Than You Thought |author=Matt Kinsey |url=http://adage.com/article/ad-and-marketing-book-reviews/finding-spot-important-thought/130170/ |newspaper=[[Advertising Age]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] magazine by Mary Spiro said that, "If one agrees with the premise that marketing has been male-centered or that the strategies they present are uniquely suited to impact women then this text offers plenty of practical advice for those courting female clientele" and that the end of chapter summaries offer "quick inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World--and How to Reach Them (Book review) |author=Mary Spiro |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-236034590.html |newspaper=[[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Toba Tek Singh'''" ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ٹوبہ ٹیک سنگھ}}}} &lt;small&gt;[[ALA-LC]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''Ṭobah Țek Sin&amp;#x331;gh''}} {{IPA-ur|ʈoːbəh ʈeːk sɪŋɡʱ|IPA}}) is a [[short story]] written by [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] and published in [[1955 in literature|1955]]. It follows inmates in a [[Lahore]] asylum, some of whom are to be transferred to [[India]] following the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. The story is a "powerful satire" on the relationship between India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/tobateksingh/storynotes.html Toba Tek Singh - About the story - Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The story is set two or three years after the 1947 [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], when the governments of India and Pakistan decided to exchange some Muslim, Sikh and Hindu lunatics, and revolves around Bishan Singh, a Sikh inmate of an asylum in [[Lahore]], who is from the town of [[Toba Tek Singh]]. As part of the exchange, Bishan Singh is sent under police escort to [[India]], but upon being told that his hometown Toba Tek Singh is in Pakistan, he refuses to go. The story ends with Bishan lying down in the no man's land between the two barbed wire fences: "There, behind barbed wire, was Hindustan. Here, behind the same kind of barbed wire, was Pakistan. In between, on that piece of ground that had no name, lay Toba Tek Singh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saadat Hasan Manto |authorlink=Saadat Hasan Manto |others=Frances W. Pritchett (trans.) |year=2006 |title=Toba Tek Singh |journal=Pakistani Literature |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=83 |location=Islamabad |publisher=The Pakistan Academy of Letters |editor1-first=Iftikhar |editor1-last=Arif |editor2-first=Mohammad Anwar |editor2-last=Khan |editor3-first=Khurram Khiraam |editor3-last=Siddiqui }} (Translation available on-line on [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/tobateksingh/translation.html Pritchett's website])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishan Singh's mutterings==
In the story, whenever Bishan Singh gets irritated he mutters or shouts a mix of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu]] and English which, though nonsensical, is indirectly pejorative of both India and Pakistan. For instance, "Upar di gur gur di annexe di bedhiyana di moong di daal of di Pakistan and Hindustan of di durr phitey mun", which means: "The inattention of the annexe of the rumbling upstairs of the [[dal]] of [[Mung bean|moong]] of the Pakistan and India of the go to bloody hell!"&lt;ref name="ref23yuyuj"&gt;{{Citation | title=Blooming through the ashes: an international anthology on violence and the human spirit | author=Clifford Chanin, Aili McConnon | publisher=Rutgers University Press, 2008 | isbn=978-0-8135-4213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9gQa6lo21AC | quote="Bashan Singh walked away muttering: 'Upar di gur gur di annexe di bedhiyana di mung di daal of di Pakistan and Hindustan of di dar fatay mun!'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobateksinghmanto115"&gt;{{Citation | title=ٹوبہ ٹیک سنگھ (Toba Tek Singh) | author=Saadat Hasan Manto | publisher=Four Corners, 2008 | isbn=978-81-907633-5-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQJESQAACAAJ | quote="اوپردی گڑگڑدی اینکس دی بےدھیانادی منگ دی وال دی پاکستان اینڈ ھندوستان آف دی درفٹےمنھ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==
A film based on a play adaptation of this story was made in 2005 by [[Afia Nathaniel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0486495|Toba Tek Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short film named ''[[Toba Tek Singh (film)|Toba Tek Singh]]'' will be released in 2018 in India. This film is directed by [[Ketan Mehta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Filmmaker-Ketan-Mehta-Society-is-more-violent-and-polarised-now/articleshow/51192201.cms|title=Filmmaker Ketan Mehta: Society is more violent and polarised now|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2017|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On the sixtieth anniversary of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], the Pakistani [[Ajoka Theater|theatre group Ajoka]], as part of a series of plays and performances, performed a play adaptation in India. It was described as a "commentary on the state of affairs between the two countries, where sub-committees, committees and ministerial-level talks are the panacea for all problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/08/17/stories/2007081750370300.htm Beyond the shadows, Friday Review Delhi : The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the British Broadcasting Corporation named the work among the 100 stories that shaped the world, alongside works by authors like Homer and Virginia Woolf. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-100-stories-that-shaped-the-world Stories that shaped the world Literature: The 100 stories that shaped the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 biographical film [[Manto (2018 film)|Manto]] featured the popular rant of the main protagonist in Toba Tek Singh. It is one of the five short stories by Manto that are featured in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-look-who-s-playing-nawazuddin-siddiqui-s-friend-in-manto-2334317|title=Look who's playing Nawazuddin Siddiqui's friend in Manto|work=[[DNA]]|date=25 February 2017|accessdate= 12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Varanasi''' ({{IPA-hns|ʋaːˈraːɳəsi|-|hi-Varanasi.ogg}}), also known as '''Benares''',&lt;ref&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/British_Indian_Empire_1909_Imperial_Gazetteer_of_India.jpg The name that appears on the 1909 version official map of India]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Banaras''' (''Banāras'' {{IPA-hns|bəˈnaːrəs||hi-Banaras.ogg}}), or '''[[Kingdom of Kashi|Kashi]]''' (''Kāśī'' {{IPA-hns|ˈkaːʃi||hi-Kashi.ogg}}), is a city on the banks of the river [[Ganga]] in the [[Uttar Pradesh]] state of [[North India]], {{convert|320|km|mi|-1}} south-east of the state capital, [[Lucknow]], and {{convert|121|km}} east of [[Allahabad]]. A major religious hub in [[India]], it is the [[Holy city|holiest]] of the seven sacred cities (''[[Sapta Puri]]'') in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], and played an important role in the development of [[Buddhism]] and [[Ravidassia]]. Varanasi lies along [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 2]], which connects it to [[Kolkata]], [[Kanpur]], [[Agra]], and [[Delhi]], and is served by [[Varanasi Junction railway station]] and [[Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport]].

Varanasi is also one of 72 districts in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. At the time of the 2011 census, there were a total of 8 blocks and 1329 villages in this district. The main languages of Varanasi are the [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] dialects of Hindi-Urdu.

Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]", at nearby [[Sarnath]]. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, [[mysticism]] and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. [[Tulsidas]] wrote his epic poem on Rama's life called ''[[Ram Charit Manas]]'' in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the [[Bhakti movement]] were born in Varanasi, including [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]]. [[Guru Nanak]] visited Varanasi for [[Maha Shivaratri]] in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of [[Sikhism]].

In the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Brahmin]] kings. The [[Benares State|Kingdom of Benares]] was given official status by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the [[Parliament of India]] by the current Prime Minister of India [[Narendra Modi]], who won the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2014 by a huge margin. [[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]], carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] and [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]]. Varanasi Hospital was established in 1964.

Varanasi has been a cultural centre of North India for several thousand years,{{fact||date=January 2018}} and is closely associated with the Ganges. Hindus believe that death in the city will bring [[moksha|salvation]], making it a major centre for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here.

The [[Ramnagar Fort]], near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] style of [[architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of Shiva, the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]]. The [[Kashi Naresh]] ([[Maharaja]] of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, ''[[Aj (newspaper)|Aj]]'', was first published in 1920.

==Etymology==
Traditional etymology links "Varanasi" to the names of two Ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: [[Varuna River|Varuna]], still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the [[Ganges]], bounded by Varuna and Assi.{{Sfn|Cunningham|Sastri|2002|pp=131–140}}

In the [[Rigveda]], an ancient Indian sacred collection of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] hymns, the city is referred to as Kāśī (Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root ''kaś-'' "to shine", making Varanasi known as "City of Light",{{Sfn|Eck|1982|p=10, 58, refers to "Banares – which Hindus call Kashi, the City of Light" (p. 10) and "Hindus call it Kashi, the luminous City of Light" (p. 58).}} the "luminous city as an eminent seat of learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Geography of the Rigveda |url=http://voi.org/books/rig/ch4.htm |last=Talageri |first=Shrikant G. |access-date=4 February 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60pvfNrKV?url=http://voi.org/books/rig/ch4.htm |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also used by pilgrims dating from [[Buddha]]'s days.

Hindu religious texts use many epithets to refer to Varanasi, such as Kāśikā ({{lang-sa|"the shining one"}}), Avimukta (Sanskrit: "never forsaken" by Shiva), Ānandavana (Sanskrit: "the forest of bliss"), and Rudravāsa (Sanskrit: "the place where Rudra/Śiva resides").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.up-tourism.com/destination/varanasi/about.htm|title=Varanasi: About the city|access-date=23 May 2013|publisher=Official website of Uttar Pradesh Tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708043803/http://www.up-tourism.com/destination/varanasi/about.htm|archivedate=8 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hindu Mythology===
According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by [[Shiva]],{{sfn|Melton|2007|p=29}} one of [[Trimurti|three principal deities]] along with [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]]. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018 }}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pandava]]s, the protagonists of the [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', are said to have visited the city in search of Shiva to atone for their sin of [[fratricide]] and [[Brāhmanahatya]] that they had committed during the climactic [[Kurukshetra War]].{{Sfn|Bansal|2008|pp=48–49}} It is regarded as one of seven holy cities ([[Sapta Puri]]) which can provide [[Moksha]]; [[Ayodhya]], [[Mathura]], [[Haridwar]], Kashi, [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]], [[Ujjain|Avanti]], and [[Dvārakā]] are the seven cities known as the givers of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/gpu18.htm|title=''Garuḍa Purāṇa'' XVI 114|access-date=9 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026112418/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/gpu18.htm|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological evidence===
Excavations in 2014 led to the discovery of artefacts dating back to 800 BCE. Further excavations at Aktha and [[Ramnagar, Varanasi|Ramnagar]], two sites in the vicinity of the city, unearthed artefacts dating back to 1800 BCE, supporting the view that the area was inhabited by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeolog-home.com/pages/content/banaras-inde-new-archaeological-excavations-are-going-on-to-determine-the-age-of-varanasi.html|title=Banaras (Inde): new archaeological excavations are going on to determine the age of Varanasi|access-date=22 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725052033/http://www.archeolog-home.com/pages/content/banaras-inde-new-archaeological-excavations-are-going-on-to-determine-the-age-of-varanasi.html|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient period===
Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture.{{Sfn| Pletcher|2010|pp=159–160}} During the time of [[Gautama Buddha]], Varanasi was part of the [[Kosala|Kingdom of Kosala]].{{Sfn| Pletcher|2010|pp=159–160}} The Buddha is believed to have founded [[Buddhism]] here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]", at nearby [[Sarnath]].{{Sfn|Herman|1999|p=153}}{{Sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=2536}} The celebrated Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]], also known as Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the city around 635 CE, attested that the city was a centre of religious and artistic activities, and that it extended for about {{convert|5|km|mi}} along the western bank of the Ganges.{{Sfn| Pletcher|2010|pp=159–160}}{{Sfn|Berwick|1986|p=121}} When Xuanzang, visited Varanasi in the 7th century, he named it "Polonisse" and wrote that the city had some 30 temples with about 30 monks.{{Sfn|Eck|1982|p=57}} The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi.{{Sfn|Bindloss|Brown|Elliott|2007|p=278}}

===Medieval period===
[[File:Kabir004.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kabir]], a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint]]

Varanasi remained a centre of activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including [[Kabir]] who was born here in 1389,{{Sfn|Das|1991|p=17}} and [[Ravidas]], a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual figure, who was born and lived in the city and employed in the tannery industry.{{Sfn|Merriam-Webster|1999|p=910}}

Numerous eminent scholars and preachers visited the city from across India and south Asia. [[Guru Nanak]] visited Varanasi for [[Maha Shivaratri]] in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=90}}

Varanasi experienced a ''Hindu'' cultural revival in the 16th century under the Muslim [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]], who invested in the city and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and [[Vishnu]].{{Sfn|Berwick|1986|p=121}} The Raja of [[Pune]] established the Annapurna Mandir, and the {{convert|200|m|adj=on}} Akbari Bridge was also completed during this period.{{Sfn|Mitra|2002|p=182}} The earliest tourists began arriving in the city during the 16th century.{{Sfn|Prakash|1981|p=170}} In 1665, the French traveller [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] described the architectural beauty of the Vindu Madhava temple on the side of the Ganges. The road infrastructure was also improved during this period. It was extended from [[Kolkata]] to [[Peshawar]] by Emperor [[Sher Shah Suri]]; later during the [[British Raj]] it came to be known as the famous [[Grand Trunk Road]]. In 1656, Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered the destruction of many temples and the building of mosques, causing the city to experience a temporary setback.{{Sfn|Berwick|1986|p=121}} However, after Aurangazeb's death, most of India was ruled by a confederacy of pro-Hindu kings. Much of modern Varanasi was built during this time, especially during the 18th century by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Bhumihar]].{{Sfn|Schreitmüller|2012|p=284}} The kings governing Varanasi continued to wield power and importance through much of the British Raj period, including the Maharaja of Benares, or [[Benares State|Kashi Naresh]].

The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947, during the reign of Dr. Vibhuti Narayan Singh. In the 18th century, [[Muhammad Shah]] ordered the construction of an observatory on the Ganges, attached to Man Mandir Ghat, designed to discover imperfections in the calendar in order to revise existing astronomical tables. Tourism in the city began to flourish in the 18th century.{{Sfn|Prakash|1981|p=170}} In 1791, under the rule of the [[Governor-General of India|British Governor-General]] [[Warren Hastings]], [[Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay)|Jonathan Duncan]] founded a [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi|Sanskrit College in Varanasi]].{{Sfn|Corp|2007|p=1}} In 1867, the establishment of the Varanasi Municipal Board led to significant improvements in the city's infrastructure and basic amenities of health services, drinking water supply and sanitation {{Sfn|Kochhar|2015|p=247}}

The [[British Army]] committed a massacre of Indian troops and destroyed city residences during the early stages of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{Sfn|Misra|2007|p=6}}

Author [[Mark Twain]] wrote in 1897 of Varanasi, "Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together."{{Sfn|Twain|1897|p=Chapter L}} In 1910, the British made Varanasi a new Indian state, with [[Ramnagar, Varanasi|Ramnagar]] as its capital, but with no jurisdiction over the city proper. The religious head, Kashi Naresh, has had his headquarters at the [[Ramnagar Fort]] since the 18th century, also a repository of the history of the kings of Varanasi, which is situated to the east of Varanasi, across the Ganges.&lt;ref name="A review of Varanasi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blonnet.com/life/2004/02/02/stories/2004020200050300.htm |title=A review of Varanasi |publisher=Blonnet.com |access-date=3 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924092518/http://www.blonnet.com/life/2004/02/02/stories/2004020200050300.htm |archivedate=24 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kashi Naresh is deeply revered by the local people and the chief cultural patron; some devout inhabitants consider him to be the incarnation of Shiva.{{Sfn|Mitra|2002|p=216}}

[[Annie Besant]] founded the [[Central Hindu School|Central Hindu College]], which later became a foundation for the creation of [[Banaras Hindu University]] in 1916. Besant founded the college because she wanted "to bring men of all religions together under the ideal of brotherhood in order to promote Indian cultural values and to remove ill-will among different sections of the Indian population."{{Sfn|Sharma|Sharma|2001|p=197}}

Varanasi was ceded to the Union of India in 1947, and Vibhuti Narayan Singh incorporated his territories into the United Provinces in 1949.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Varanasi is located at an elevation of {{Convert|80.71|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varanasi.nic.in/default.htm|title=DEO Varanasi|work=Tourist Information: General Information|publisher=Varanasi District Administration by National Informatics center|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628050118/http://varanasi.nic.in/default.htm|archivedate=28 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the centre of the Ganges valley of [[North India]], in the Eastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, along the left crescent-shaped bank of the Ganges, averaging between {{convert|50|ft|order=flip}} and {{convert|70|ft|order=flip}} above the river.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316}} The city is the headquarters of [[Varanasi district]]. By road, Varanasi is located {{convert|797|km}} south-east of [[New Delhi]], {{convert|320|km}} south-east of [[Lucknow]], {{convert|121|km}} east of [[Allahabad]], and {{convert|63|km}} south of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Varanasi Urban Agglomeration" – an agglomeration of seven urban sub-units – covers an area of 112.26&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately 43&amp;nbsp;mi²).&lt;ref name=heritageUNESCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sasnet.lu.se/EASASpapers/46RanaSingh.pdf |title=Varanasi as Heritage City (India) on the scale the UNESCO World Heritage List: From Contestation to Conservation |access-date=18 August 2006 |last=Singh |first=Rana P.B. |format=PDF |work=EASAS papers |publisher=Swedish South Asian Studies Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60pvfX7Np?url=http://www.sasnet.lu.se/EASASpapers/46RanaSingh.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbourhoods of the city include Adampura, Anandbagh, Bachchhaon, Bangali Tola, Bhelpura, Bulanala, Chaitganj, Chaukaghat, Chowk, Dhupchandi, Dumraon, Gandhinagar, Gautam Nagar, Giri Nagar, Gopal Vihar, Guru Nanak Nagar, Jaitpura, Kail Garh, Khanna, Kotwali, Lanka Manduadih, Luxa, Maheshpur, Mahmoorganj, Maulvibagh, Nagwar, Naipokhari, Shivala, Siddhagiribagh, and Sigra.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;

Being located in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s of North India, the land is very fertile because low level floods in the Ganges continually replenish the soil.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Varanasi is located between the Ganges confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around {{convert|4|km|mi|order=flip|0}}, and serves as a sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.{{Sfn|Kishore|2008|p=65}}

===Climate===
Varanasi experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'') with large variations between summer and winter temperatures.{{Sfn|Singh|1975|p=4}}&lt;!--Singh supports Cwa classification--&gt;{{Sfn|Pandey|1989|p=13}} The dry summer starts in April and lasts until June, followed by the monsoon season from July to October. The temperature ranges between {{convert|22|and|46|C|F|0}} in the summers. Winters in Varanasi see very large [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] variations, with warm days and downright cold nights. Cold waves from the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region cause temperatures to dip across the city in the winter from December to February and temperatures below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1110|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Fog is common in the winters, while hot dry winds, called [[Loo (wind)|loo]], blow in the summers.{{Sfn|Singh|Rana|2002|p=27}} In recent years, the water level of the Ganges has decreased significantly; upstream dams, unregulated water extraction, and dwindling glacial sources due to global warming may be to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aninews.in/newsdetail2/story39530/is-river-ganges-drying-in-varanasi.html |title=Is River Ganges drying in Varanasi |publisher=Aninews.in |access-date=3 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512213923/http://aninews.in/newsdetail2/story39530/is-river-ganges-drying-in-varanasi.html |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/ganges-receding-despite-rainfall/story-e6frg6so-1226066738979 | work=The Australian | title=Ganges receding despite rainfall | date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public maintenance===
Because of the high population density of Varanasi and the increasing number of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316-7}} [[Pollution of the Ganges]] is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fore.yale.edu/news/item/indians-keep-faith-with-ganges-despite-pollution/ |title=News &amp;#124; The Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale |first=Yasmeen |last=Mohiuddin |work=fore.yale.edu |date=2010 |access-date=4 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018001045/http://fore.yale.edu/news/item/indians-keep-faith-with-ganges-despite-pollution/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316-7}} Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.&lt;ref name="HamnerTripathi2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamner|first1=Steve|last2=Tripathi|first2=Anshuman|last3=Mishra|first3=Rajesh Kumar|last4=Bouskill|first4=Nik|last5=Broadaway|first5=Susan C.|last6=Pyle|first6=Barry H.|last7=Ford|first7=Timothy E.|title=The role of water use patterns and sewage pollution in incidence of water-borne/enteric diseases along the Ganges river in Varanasi, India|journal=International Journal of Environmental Health Research|volume=16|issue=2|year=2006|pages=113–132|issn=0960-3123|doi=10.1080/09603120500538226|pmid=16546805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Banarasi sari pallu by ashish4.JPG|thumb|upright|Banarasi sari]]

According to the 2006 City Development Plan for Varanasi, approximately 29% of Varanasi's population is employed.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}} Approximately 40% are employed in manufacturing, 26% work in trade and commerce, 19% work in other services, 8% work in transport and communication, 4% work in agriculture, 2% work in construction, and 2% are marginal workers (working for less than half of the year).{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=28}}

Among manufacturing workers, 51% work in spinning and weaving, 15% work in metal, 6% work in printing and publishing, 5% work in electrical machinery, and the rest work in a wide variety of industry sectors.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=31}} Varanasi's manufacturing industry is not well developed and is dominated by small-scale industries and household production.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}}

[[File:India - Varanasi tourist baubles - 0496.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tourists shopping for jewellery in Varanasi]]

[[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]] is the dominant industry in Varanasi.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29-31}} Muslims are the influential community in this industry with nearly half a million of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons.{{Sfn|Warikoo|2010|p=192}} Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are [[Momin Ansari]] Muslims.{{Sfn|Wood|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fq4eUi_3oMC&amp;pg=PA113 113]}} Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and [[Banarasi sari]]s, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate than elsewhere in India.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfX3sRoJ3rYC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}} The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}}

In the metal manufacturing sector, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] is a major employer.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=31}} [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]], a large power equipment manufacturer, also operates a heavy equipment maintenance plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhelherp.com/about.jsp|title=About Bharat|publisher=Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited|access-date=3 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084358/http://www.bhelherp.com/about.jsp|archivedate=11 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major commodities manufactured and traded in Varanasi include hand-knotted Mirzapur carpets, rugs, [[dhurrie]]s, brassware, copperware, wooden and clay toys, handicrafts, gold jewellery, and musical instruments.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29-31}} Important agricultural products include [[betel]] leaves (for [[paan]]), [[langra]] mangoes and [[khoa]] (solidified milk).{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=31}}{{Sfn|Mitra|2002|p=117, 169}}

Tourism is Varanasi's second most important industry.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=57}} Nearly 6.3 million domestic tourists and 690,472 foreign tourists visited Varanasi in 2015. Domestic tourist most commonly visit for religious purposes while foreign tourist visit for ghats along River Ganges and Sarnath. Most domestic tourists are from Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, while the majority of foreign tourists are from Sri Lanka and Japan.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=56}} The peak tourist season falls between October and March.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=56}} In total, there are around 12,000 beds available in the city, of which about one half are in inexpensive budget hotels and one third in [[Dharamshala (type of building)|dharamsalas]].{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=58}} Overall, Varanasi's tourist infrastructure is not well developed.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=58}}

In more modern times many of the exports from Varanasi are traded on a much smaller scale. Instead of reaching into the far markets of western Europe, dairy product exports and betel leaves reach closer markets.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The trend towards local trading is beginning to change, however, as the Indian Railway has selected Varanasi to serve as a major factory center.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A major concern for Varanasi in the face of increased tourism and industrialization are the transportation problems that plague the area.{{cn|date=November 2018}} While the city itself is connected to other major metropolises through air transport, travel within the city limits still proves problematic.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Rickshaws and Auto Rickshaws are still a common site of Varanasi streets, and while these modes of transportation are picturesque, they contribute to traffic jams and slow movement on city streets.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Ramnagar Fort===
[[File:Ramnagar Fort in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|[[Ramnagar Fort]] was built in 1750 CE by [[Kashi Naresh]] Raja [[Balwant Singh of Benares|Balwant Singh]].]]
The Ramnagar Fort, located near the Ganges on its eastern bank and opposite the Tulsi Ghat, was built in the 18th century by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh with cream-coloured ''chunar'' [[sandstone]]. The fort is a typical example of the [[Mughal architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. At present, the fort is in disrepair. The fort and its museum are the repository of the history of the kings of Benares. Cited as an "eccentric" museum, it contains a rare collection of American [[vintage car]]s, bejeweled [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]]s, an impressive weaponry hall, and a rare astrological clock.&lt;ref name=Ram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttar-pradesh/varanasi/sights/museum/ramnagar-fort-museum|title=Lonely Planet review for Ramnagar Fort &amp; Museum|access-date=6 November 2012|publisher=Lonely Planet|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616061730/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttar-pradesh/varanasi/sights/museum/ramnagar-fort-museum|archivedate=16 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, manuscripts, especially religious writings, are housed in the Saraswati Bhawan which is a part of a museum within the fort.

Many ghats are associated with Hindu legends and several are now privately owned.{{Sfn|Bansal|2008|pp=34–35}}

Many of the ghats were constructed under the patronage of the Marathas, Shindes ([[Scindia]]s), [[Holkar]]s, [[Bhonsle]]s, and [[Peshwa]]s. Most are bathing ghats, while others are used as cremation sites. A morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a popular tourist attraction. The extensive stretches of ghats in Varanasi enhance the riverfront with a multitude of shrines, temples, and palaces built "tier on tier above the water's edge".{{Sfn| Pletcher|2010|pp=159–160}}

'''The [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]]''' is the main and probably the oldest ghat of Varanasi located on the Ganges, close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. It is believed that [[Brahma]] created this ghat to welcome Shiva and sacrificed ten horses during the ''Dasa-[[Ashwamedha]] [[yajna]]'' performed there. Above and adjacent to this ghat, there are also temples dedicated to Sulatankesvara, Brahmesvara, Varahesvara, Abhaya Vinayaka, Ganga (the Ganges), and Bandi Devi, which are all important pilgrimage sites. A group of priests perform "Agni Pooja" (Sanskrit :"Worship of Fire") daily in the evening at this ghat as a dedication to Shiva, Ganga, [[Surya]] (Sun), [[Agni]] (Fire), and the entire universe. Special [[aarti]]s are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.&lt;ref name=ghats /&gt;

'''The [[Manikarnika Ghat]]''' is the Mahasmasana, the primary site for Hindu cremation in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms that are used for death anniversary rituals. According to a myth it is said that an earring of Shiva or his wife [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]] fell here. Fourth-century [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] inscriptions mention this ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.&lt;ref name=ghats /&gt;

[[File:Jain Ghat, Varanasi, UP, India.jpg|thumb|upright|Bachraj Ghat]]
'''The Jain Ghat''' : Varanasi is believed to birthplace of [[Suparshvanatha]] (7th tirthankara) and [[Parshvanatha]] (23rd tirthankara). The Jain Ghat or Bachraj Ghat is a Jain Ghat and has three Jain Temples located on the banks of the River. It is believed that the Jain Maharajas used to own these ghats. Bachraj Ghat has three Jain temples near the river's banks, and one them is a very ancient temple of Tirthankara Suparswanath.

===Music===
{{Main|Music in Varanasi}}
[[File:Goswami Tulsidas Awadhi Hindi Poet.jpg|thumb|upright|Sant Goswami Tulsidas Awadhi Hindi poet and propagator of Bhakthi music in Varanasi]]
Varanasi's music tradition is traced to the [[Puranas|Pauranic]] days. According to ancient legend, Shiva is credited with evolving music and dance forms. During the medieval era, [[Vaishnavism]], a [[Bhakti movement]], grew in popularity, and Varanasi became a thriving center for musicians such as [[Surdas]], [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Meera]] and Tulsidas. During the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the [[Dhrupad]] style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori, and Chaturang. Presently the Dhrupad maestro Pandit [[Ritwik Sanyal]] from Varanasi is working for the revival of this art-music.&lt;ref name=Music&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varanasicity.com/varanasi-music.html|title=Varanasi Music|access-date=27 May 2013|publisher=Varanasi City.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228013039/http://www.varanasicity.com/varanasi-music.html|archivedate=28 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the session, he was presented with a Festschrift, ''Cahier Calin: Makers of the Middle Ages.

Rt. Rev '''William Stubbs''' H[[FRSE]] (21 June 1825&amp;nbsp;– 22 April 1901) was an English [[historian]] and [[Anglican]] bishop. He was [[Regius Professor of History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at the [[University of Oxford]] between 1866 and 1884. He was [[Bishop of Chester]] from 1884 to 1889 and [[Bishop of Oxford]] from 1889 to 1901.

==Early life==
The son of William Morley Stubbs, a solicitor, and his wife, Mary Ann Henlock, he was born in a house on the High Street in [[Knaresborough]], [[Yorkshire]], and was educated at [[Ripon Grammar School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated MA in 1848, obtaining a first-class in [[Literae Humaniores]] and a third in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career to 1889==
Stubbs was elected a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], during his time living in [[Navestock]], [[Essex, England|Essex]], from 1850 to 1866, where he served as parish priest for the same period. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 he married Catherine Dellar, daughter of John Dellar, of Navestock, and they had several children. He was librarian at [[Lambeth Palace]], and in 1862 was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Chichele Professorship of Modern History]] at Oxford.

In 1866, Stubbs was appointed [[Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford]], and held the chair until 1884. His lectures were thinly attended, and he found them a distraction from his historical work. Some of his statutory lectures are published in his ''Lectures on Mediaeval and Modern History''. In 1872, he founded Oxford University's School of Modern History, allowing postclassical history to be taught as a distinct subject for the first time. He accepted the patronage of the [[Stubbs Society]] during his time at Oxford, where he interacted with future doyens of the historical profession.

Stubbs was rector of Cholderton, [[Wiltshire]], from 1875 to 1879, when he was appointed a canon of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He served on the ecclesiastical courts commission of 1881-1883 and wrote the weighty appendices to the report. On 25 April 1884 he was consecrated [[Bishop of Chester]], and in 1889 became [[Bishop of Oxford]] until his death. As Bishop of Oxford he was also ''ex officio'' the [[Chancellor of the Order of the Garter]]. He was a Member of the [[Chetham Society]], and served as Vice-President from 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chethamsociety.org.uk/pdf/CS_Officers_Council.pdf |title=Chetham Society: Officers and Council |publisher=Chetham Society |date=2015-11-04 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach to church office==
Stubbs was a [[High church|High Churchman]] whose doctrines and practice were grounded on learning and a veneration for antiquity. His opinions were received with marked respect by his brother prelates, and he acted as an assessor to the archbishop in the trial of [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]].

==Final illness and death==
An attack of illness in November 1900 seriously impaired Stubbs' health. He was able, however, to attend the funeral of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 2 February 1901, and preached a remarkable sermon&lt;ref&gt;William Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, 1825-1901 by William Holden Hutton, p233&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the king]] and the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|German emperor]] on the following day. His illness became critical on 20 April. He died in [[Cuddesdon]] on 22 April 1901. Stubbs was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, [[Cuddesdon]], next to the palace of the bishops of Oxford.

==Honours and degrees==
Both in England and America Stubbs was universally acknowledged as the head of all English historical scholars, and no English historian of his time was held in equal honour in European countries. Among his many distinctions he was [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] and honorary [[D.C.L.]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], Doctor ''in utroque jure'' of [[university of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]; an hon. member of the [[university of Kiev]], and of the [[Prussia]]n, [[Bavaria]]n and [[Denmark|Danish]] academies; he received the Prussian order ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'', and was corresponding member of the ''[[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]]'' of the [[Institut de France|French Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000484/19010427/018/0002|title=DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF OXFORD|date=27 April 1901|work=Tamworth Herald|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stubbs was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of his historical work==
Until Stubbs found it necessary to devote all his time to his episcopal duties, he concentrated on historical study. He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart. He also believed that the effects of individual character and human nature will render generalizations vague and useless. While pointing out that history is useful as a mental discipline and a part of a liberal education, he recommended its study chiefly for its own sake. It was in this spirit that he worked; he had the faculty of judgment and a genius for minute and critical investigation. He was equally eminent in ecclesiastical history, as an editor of texts and as the historian of the British constitution.

===''Registrum sacrum'', ''Constitutional History'', and ''Select Charters''===
In 1858 Stubbs published his ''Registrum sacrum anglicanum'', which sets forth episcopal succession in England, which was followed by many other later works, and particularly by his share in ''Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents'', edited in co-operation with the Rev. [[Arthur West Haddan|A. W. Haddan]], for the third volume of which he was especially responsible. He edited nineteen volumes for the [[Rolls series]] of ''Chronicles and Memorials''.

It is, however, by Stubbs' ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874–78) that he is most widely known as a historian. It became at once the standard authority on its subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of this book, which traces the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain till 1485, marks a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning. It was followed by its companion volume of ''Select Charters and Other Illustrations of English Constitutional History''.

===His merits as a historian===
By Stubbs' contemporaries and after his death Stubbs was considered to have been in the front rank of historical scholars both as an author and a critic, and as a master of every department of the historian's work, from the discovery of materials to the elaboration of well founded theories and literary production.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; He was a good [[palaeography|palaeographer]], and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition. His merits as an author are often judged solely by his ''Constitutional History''.

However, Stubbs' work is not entirely unquestionable. Some modern historians have questioned his acceptance of some medieval chronicles, written by monastical scribes whose views would be, to some extent, influenced by the politics of the Catholic Church. One such criticism was Stubbs' tirade against [[William Rufus]] whose character was much-maligned by the chroniclers perhaps due to his opposition to Gregorian reforms during his reign, which led to [[Archbishop Anselm]] going into exile.

Among the most notable examples of Stubbs' work for the Rolls series are the prefaces to [[Roger of Hoveden]], the ''Gesta regum'' of [[William of Malmesbury]], the ''Gesta Henrici II'', and the Memorials of St. [[Dunstan]].

==Modern views of him==
In the main Stubbs' ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by [[K. B. McFarlane]]'s 'community of interest' theory; the idea that the amount of possible conflict between a [[monarch|king]] and his nobles was actually very small (case in point, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], 1399–1413). Historians like [[Richard Partington]], [[Rosemary Horrox]] and notably [[May McKisack]], have pushed this view further.

[[J. W. Burrow]] proposed that Stubbs, like [[John Richard Green]] and [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], was an historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present which were romantically historicised and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making
&lt;blockquote&gt;the new historiography of early medieval times an extension, filling out and democratising, of older Whig notions of continuity. It was Stubbs who presented this most substantially; Green who made it popular and dramatic... It is in Freeman...of the three the most purely a narrative historian, that the strains are most apparent.'&lt;ref&gt;''A Liberal Descent: Victorian Historians and the English Past'' by J. W. Burrow, Cambridge University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0 521 24079 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
