'''AS3959''' is an [[Australian]] Standard for [[construction]] of homes in [[bushfire]] prone zones. The latest version AS3959:2009 was hurried into release after the devastation of "[[Black Saturday bushfires|Black Saturday]]" bushfires, which killed 173 people and destroyed over 2,000 homes.

The latest release of AS3959 has significant changes, bringing major changes to construction of homes to be built in the future. Under this new standard all proposed building requires the [[Real estate developer|builder]] or [[landowner]] to undergo a BAL (Bushfire Attack Level) Assessment. This requires a report tabled to establish the threat of bushfire on this future proposed dwelling. The report takes in matters such as the area FDI (Fire Danger Index), the blocks ground slope, [[vegetation]] type and density to determine the intensity of fire attack, split into 6 levels. The six levels relate to the intensity of [[Radiant heat|Radiant Heat]] exposure, with the levels being BAL-LOW (no threat or construction changes needed), BAL-12.5 (Radiant Heat levels would calculate 12.5&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-19 (19&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-29 (29&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), BAL-40 (40&amp;nbsp;kW/m²) and BAL-FZ (Flame Zone, which can be as high as 100&amp;nbsp;kW/m²).
AS3959:2009 therefore instructs what changes and test methods are required for construction to comply to the BAL Assessed levels.
AS3959:2009 from 1 May 2010 has been adopted as part of the BCA (Building Code Of Australia).

Copies of Australian Standards such as AS3959 are available from SAI Global, or see organisations such as the Victorian Building Authority, Victorian Country Fire Authority or the NSW Rural Fire Service for further information and guidelines on this subject.

The first expedition to reach the [[geographic South Pole]] was led by the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]. He and four others arrived at the pole on 14&amp;nbsp;December 1911,{{refn | name = polar date | group = n | Some sources give the date as 15&amp;nbsp;December. Since the western and eastern hemispheres—and the [[International Date Line]]—are conjoined at the South Pole, both dates can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14&amp;nbsp;December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account [[#{{sfnRef|Amundsen}}|''The South Pole'']].{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=511}}{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=xvii}} }} five weeks ahead of a British party led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] as part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later knew that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.

Amundsen's initial plans had focused on the Arctic and the conquest of the [[North Pole]] by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s polar exploration ship ''[[Fram]]'', and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers [[Frederick Cook]] and [[Robert E. Peary]] each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain of the extent to which the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June&amp;nbsp;1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when ''Fram'' was leaving their last port of call, [[Madeira]].

Amundsen made his Antarctic base, which he named "Framheim", in the [[Bay of Whales]] on the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]]. After months of preparation, depot-laying and a false start that ended in near-disaster, he and his party set out for the pole in October 1911. In the course of their journey they discovered the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], which provided their route to the [[Antarctic Plateau|polar plateau]] and ultimately to the South Pole. The party's mastery of the use of skis and their expertise with [[sled dogs]] ensured rapid and relatively trouble-free travel. Other achievements of the expedition included the first exploration of [[King Edward VII Land]] and an extensive oceanographic cruise.

The expedition's success was widely applauded, though the story of Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its achievement in the United Kingdom. Amundsen's decision to keep his true plans secret until the last moment was criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station|permanent scientific base at the pole]] bears his name, together with that of Scott.

==Background==
[[File:Gjoea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Gjøa'', the small sloop in which Amundsen and his crew conquered the Northwest Passage, 1903–06]]
Amundsen was born in [[Fredrikstad]] (around 80&amp;nbsp;km from [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, the son of a ship-owner.{{sfn|Langner|pp=25–26}} In 1893, he abandoned his medical studies at [[University of Oslo|Christiania University]] and signed up as a seaman aboard the [[seal hunting|sealer]] ''Magdalena'' for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a [[second mate]]; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's [[Hardangervidda]] plateau.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=43–57}} In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman [[Fridtjof Nansen]], Amundsen joined the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] as [[chief mate|mate]], aboard ''[[RV Belgica (1884)|Belgica]]'' under [[Adrien de Gerlache]].{{sfn|Langner|p=41}} Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by [[Antarctic sea ice|pack ice]] in the [[Bellinghausen Sea]], and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and [[scurvy]] among the crew.{{sfn|Crane|pp=74–75}} Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=64–74}}

''Belgica''{{'}}s voyage marked the beginning of what became known as the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]],{{sfn|Crane|pp=74–75}} and was rapidly followed by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the [[Northwest Passage]], the then-uncharted sea route from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] through the labyrinth of north Canadian islands. Having earned his [[Captain (nautical)|master's ticket]], Amundsen acquired a small [[sloop]], ''[[Gjøa]]'', which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar of Sweden and Norway]], the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six.{{sfn|Langner|pp=78–80}} The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered.{{sfn|Maxtone-Graham|pp=230–36}} At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers.{{sfn|Langner|pp=78–80}}

In November&amp;nbsp;1906 the American [[Robert Peary]] returned from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new [[Farthest North]] of 87°&amp;nbsp;6′—a record disputed by later historians.{{sfn|Herbert|pp=191–201}} He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt.{{sfn|Fleming|pp=348–49}} In July&amp;nbsp;1907 [[Frederick Cook|Dr Frederick Cook]], a former shipmate of Amundsen's from ''Belgica'', set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole.{{sfn|Fleming|p=351}} A month later [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' Expedition]] sailed for Antarctica, while [[Robert Falcon Scott]] was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=60–62}} Amundsen saw no reason to concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.{{sfn|Langner|pp=82–83}}

==Preparation==

===Nansen and ''Fram''===
{{further|Nansen's Fram expedition}}
[[File:Fridtjof Nansen LOC 03377u-3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fridtjof Nansen]], whose Arctic drift of 1893–96 inspired Amundsen]]
In 1893 Nansen had driven his ship ''[[Fram]]'' into the Arctic pack ice off the northern [[Siberia]]n coast and allowed it to drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Scott, J.M.|pp=140–94}} for a summary account of Nansen's ''Fram'' expedition.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=194}} He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the [[Bering Strait]], well to the east of Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|pp=547–49}}

Amundsen consulted Nansen, who insisted that ''Fram'' was the only vessel fit for such an undertaking. ''Fram'' had been designed and built in 1891–93 by [[Colin Archer]], Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect, in accordance with Nansen's exacting specifications, as a vessel that would withstand prolonged exposure to the harshest of Arctic conditions.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|pp=183–86}} The ship's most distinctive feature was its rounded hull which, according to Nansen, enabled the vessel to "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice".{{sfn|Nansen | loc=Vol. I | pp=62–68}} For extra strength the hull was sheathed in South American [[chlorocardium|greenheart]], the hardest timber available, and crossbeams and braces were fitted throughout its length.{{sfn|Nansen | loc=Vol. I | pp=62–68}} The ship's wide beam of {{convert|36|ft|m}} in relation to its overall length of {{convert|128|ft|m}} gave it a markedly stubby appearance. This shape improved its strength in the ice but affected its performance in the open sea, where it moved sluggishly and was inclined to roll most uncomfortably.{{sfn|The Fram Museum}} However, its looks, speed, and sailing qualities were secondary to the provision of a secure and warm shelter for the crew during a voyage that might extend over several years.{{sfn|Fleming|p=240}}

''Fram'' had emerged virtually unscathed from Nansen's expedition after nearly three years in the polar ice. On its return it had been refitted,{{sfn|The Fram Museum}} before spending four years under the command of [[Otto Sverdrup]], charting and exploring {{convert|100000|sqmi}} of uninhabited territory in the northern Canadian islands.{{sfn|Fairley|pp=260–61}} After Sverdrup's voyage ended in 1902 ''Fram'' was laid up in Christiania.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|pp=547–49}} Although the ship was technically the property of the state, it was tacitly acknowledged that Nansen had first call on it. After his return from the Arctic in 1896 he had aspired to take ''Fram'' on an expedition to Antarctica, but by 1907 such hopes had faded.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|pp=547–49}} Late in September of that year, Amundsen was summoned to Nansen's home and told he could have the ship.{{sfn|Scott, J.M.|pp=244–45}}

===Initial steps===
Amundsen made his plans public on 10&amp;nbsp;November 1908, at a meeting of the [[Norwegian Geographical Society]].  He would take ''Fram'' round [[Cape Horn]] to the Pacific Ocean; after provisioning in [[San Francisco]] the ship would continue northwards, through the Bering Strait to [[Point Barrow]]. From here he would set a course directly into the ice to begin a drift that would extend over four or five years. Science would be as important as geographical exploration; continuous observations would, Amundsen hoped, help to explain a number of unresolved problems.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=197–200}} The plan was received enthusiastically, and the next day [[King Haakon VII|King Haakon]]{{refn | name = on Kings | group = n | Norway had [[personal union|separated]] from Sweden in 1905. King Oscar of Sweden relinquished the Norwegian throne and [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl of Denmark]] became King Haakon VII of Norway.{{sfn|Scott, J.M.|pp=200–02}} }} opened a subscription list with a gift of 20,000&amp;nbsp;[[Norwegian krone|kroner]]. On 6&amp;nbsp;February 1909 the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] approved a grant of 75,000&amp;nbsp;kroner to refit the ship.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=205}}  The general fundraising and business management of the expedition was placed in the hands of Amundsen's brother Leon so that the explorer could concentrate on the more practical aspects of organisation.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=204–06}}

In March&amp;nbsp;1909 it was announced that Shackleton had reached a southern latitude of 88°&amp;nbsp;23′— {{convert|97|nmi|km}} from the South Pole—before turning back; thus, as Amundsen observed, in the south "a little corner remained".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=36–41}} He was unreserved in his praise for Shackleton's achievement, writing that Shackleton was the south's equivalent of Nansen in the north.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=300}} Following this near miss, Scott immediately confirmed his intention to lead an expedition (what became the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) that would encompass the "little corner" and claim the prize for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=60–62}}

===Personnel===
[[File:CroppedAmundsenFrontispiece1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Roald Amundsen, the expedition's leader]]
Amundsen chose three naval lieutenants as his expedition's officers: [[Thorvald Nilsen]], a navigator who would be second-in-command; Hjalmar Fredrik Gjertsen, and [[Kristian Prestrud]].{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=205–07}} Gjertsen, despite lacking a medical background, was made expedition doctor, and was sent on a "lightning course" in surgery and dentistry.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=72}} A naval gunner, [[Oscar Wisting]], was accepted on Prestrud's recommendation because he could turn his hand to most tasks. Although he had little previous experience of sledge dogs, Amundsen wrote that Wisting developed "a way of his own" with them, and became a useful amateur veterinarian.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=247–51}}{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=102}}

An early choice for the party was [[Olav Bjaaland]], a champion skier who was a skilled carpenter and ski-maker.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=137–38}} Bjaaland was from [[Morgedal]] in the [[Telemark]] province of Norway, a region renowned for the prowess of its skiers and as the home of the pioneer of modern techniques, [[Sondre Norheim]].{{sfn|Weinstock, J. "Sondre Norheim: Folk Hero to Immigrant"}} Amundsen shared Nansen's belief that skis and sledge dogs provided by far the most efficient method of Arctic transport, and was determined to recruit the most skilful dog drivers. [[Helmer Hanssen]], who had proved his worth on the ''Gjøa'' expedition, agreed to travel with Amundsen again.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=90 and 248}} He was joined later by [[Sverre Hassel]], an expert on dogs, and veteran of Sverdrup's 1898–1902 ''Fram'' voyage, who intended only to travel with Amundsen as far as San Francisco.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=276–77}} Mindful of the value of a competent cook, Amundsen secured the services of [[Adolf Lindstrøm]], another Sverdrup veteran who had been cook aboard ''Gjøa''.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=205–07}}

From his experiences on board ''Belgica'' and ''Gjøa'', Amundsen had learned the importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions,{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=247–51}} and with these experienced personnel he felt he had the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the ''Fram'' party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|pp=518–19, 542}} Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=247–51}} The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer [[Alexander Kuchin]] (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of [[Bjorn Helland-Hansen]], and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=286}}{{sfn|Barr|1985}}

===Change of plan===
In September&amp;nbsp;1909 newspapers carried reports that Cook and Peary had each reached the North Pole, Cook in April&amp;nbsp;1908 and Peary a year later. Asked to comment, Amundsen avoided an outright endorsement of either explorer, but surmised that "probably something will be left to be done".{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 8 September 1909}} While he avoided the controversy over the rival claims,  {{refn | name = Cook and Peary | group = n | Peary quickly denounced Cook's claim as false, and subsequent investigations cast serious doubts on the latter's records. Peary's data, though challenged by Cook, were accepted without question by the [[National Geographic Society]] (which had sponsored his expedition). Public support for Cook quickly faded, although he retained some support, including that of Amundsen. Peary was generally accepted as the conqueror of the North Pole until late 20th century research, particularly that of the explorer [[Wally Herbert]], indicated that Peary did not in fact reach the North Pole.{{sfn|Fleming|pp=365–89}}{{sfn|Herbert|pp=273–329}} }} he saw immediately that his own plans would be seriously affected. Without the allure of capturing the pole, he would struggle to maintain public interest or funding. "If the expedition was to be saved&amp;nbsp;... there was nothing left for me but to try and solve the last great problem—the South Pole". Thus Amundsen decided to go south; the Arctic drift could wait "for a year or two" until the South Pole had been conquered.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=42–43}}

Amundsen did not publicise his change of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's public and private funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was no guarantee that the backers would understand or agree to the proposed ''volte-face''.{{sfn|Crane|pp=425–26}} Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of ''Fram'',{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=214}} or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and [[Norway–United Kingdom relations|offending the British]].{{sfn|Barczewski|p=62}} Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=45–7}} This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings.{{sfn|Crane|pp=425–26}} When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.{{sfn|Jones|pp=78–79}}

The privately revised expedition schedule required ''Fram'' to leave Norway in August&amp;nbsp;1910 and sail to [[Madeira]] in the Atlantic, its only port of call. From there the ship would proceed directly to the [[Ross Sea]] in Antarctica, heading for the [[Bay of Whales]], an inlet on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (then known as the "Great Ice Barrier") where Amundsen intended to make his base camp. The Bay of Whales was the southernmost point in the Ross Sea to which a ship could penetrate, {{convert|60|nmi|km}} closer to the Pole than Scott's intended base at [[McMurdo Sound]].{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=45–7}} In 1907–09 Shackleton had considered the ice in the Bay of Whales to be unstable, but from his studies of Shackleton's records Amundsen decided that the Barrier here was grounded on [[shoal]]s or [[Skerry|skerries]], and would support a safe and secure base.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=45–7}}{{refn | name = base stability | group = n | Amundsen's theory about grounded ice was eventually proved wrong, although the ice in the vicinity of his camp did not break away significantly until 1987 and 2000.{{sfn|Solomon|pp=94–95}} }}  After landing the shore party, ''Fram'' was to carry out oceanographic work in the Atlantic before picking up the shore party early in the following year.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=45–7}}

===Transport, equipment and supplies===
[[File:BjaalandWinterclothing1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Olav Bjaaland dressed for winter travel: "Not an outfit that cut a dash by its appearance, but it was warm and strong"{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=62–64}}]]
Amundsen did not understand the apparent aversion of British explorers to dogs: "Can it be that the dog has not understood its master? Or is it the master who has not understood the dog?" he later wrote.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=58}} Following his decision to go south he ordered 100&amp;nbsp;North [[Greenland Dog|Greenland]] [[sled dog|sledge dogs]]—the best and strongest available.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=210}}

The party's ski boots, specially designed by Amundsen, were the product of two years' testing and modification in search of perfection.{{sfn|Solomon|p=163}} The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after the style of the [[Netsilik Inuit]] from reindeer skins, wolf skin, [[Burberry]] cloth and [[gabardine]].{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=78–79}} The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American [[hickory]]. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=76}} The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=77}}—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish [[Primus stove]] rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=85–86}}

From his experiences on ''Belgica'', Amundsen was aware of the dangers of scurvy. Although the true cause of the disease, [[vitamin C]] deficiency, was not understood at the time, it was generally known that the disease could be countered by eating fresh meat.{{sfn|Preston|p=219}} To neutralise the danger, Amundsen planned to supplement sledging rations with regular helpings of [[seal meat]].{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=51}} He also ordered a special kind of [[pemmican]] which included vegetables and oatmeal: "a more stimulating, nourishing and appetising food it would be impossible to find".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=55}} The expedition was well supplied with wines and spirits, for use as medicine and on festive or social occasions. Mindful of the loss of morale on ''Belgica'', Amundsen provided for leisure time with a library of around 3,000&amp;nbsp;books, a gramophone, a large quantity of records and a range of musical instruments.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=68–70}}

===Departure===
[[File:The Fram Under Sail.jpg|thumb|left|''Fram'' under sail]]

In the months before departure, funds for the expedition became harder to acquire. Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused a request for a further 25,000&amp;nbsp;kroner. Amundsen mortgaged his house to keep the expedition afloat; heavily in debt, he was now wholly dependent on the expedition's success to avoid personal financial ruin.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=244–45}}

After a month's trial cruise in the northern Atlantic, ''Fram'' sailed to [[Kristiansand]] in late July&amp;nbsp;1910 to take the dogs on board and to make final preparations for departure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredriksholm Fortress#Roald Amundsen's Dog Farm|Roald Amundsen's Dog Farm]]&lt;/ref&gt; While at Kristiansand, Amundsen received an offer of help from Peter "Don Pedro" Christophersen, a Norwegian expatriate whose brother was Norway's Minister in [[Buenos Aires]]. Christophersen would provide fuel and other provisions to ''Fram'' at either [[Montevideo]] or Buenos Aires, an offer which Amundsen gratefully accepted.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=275}} Just before ''Fram'' sailed on 9&amp;nbsp;August, Amundsen revealed the expedition's true destination to the two junior officers, Prestrud and Gjertsen. On the four-week voyage to [[Funchal]] in Madeira, a mood of uncertainty developed among the crew, who could not make sense of some of the preparations and whose questions were met with evasive answers from their officers. This, says Amundsen's biographer [[Roland Huntford]], was "enough to generate suspicion and low spirits".{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=277–78}}

''Fram'' reached Funchal on 6&amp;nbsp;September.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=125–31}} Three days later Amundsen informed the crew of the revised plan. He told them he intended to make "a detour" to the South Pole on the way to the North Pole, which was still his ultimate destination, but would have to wait for a while.{{sfn|Langner|p=115}} After Amundsen outlined his new proposals, each man was asked whether he was willing to go on, and all responded positively.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=125–31}} Amundsen wrote a lengthy letter of explanation to Nansen, stressing how the North Pole claims of Cook and Peary had dealt a "death blow" to his original plans. He felt he had been forced into this action by necessity, asked for forgiveness and expressed the hope that his achievements would ultimately atone for any offence.&lt;ref&gt;From text of Amundsen's letter, quoted in {{harvnb|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=279–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving Funchal on 9&amp;nbsp;September Amundsen sent a cable to Scott, to inform him of the change of plan. Scott's ship ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'' had left [[Cardiff]] amid much publicity on 15&amp;nbsp;June, and was due to arrive in Australia early in October. It was to [[Melbourne]] that Amundsen sent his telegram, containing the bare information that he was proceeding southwards.{{sfn|Crane|p=423}}{{refn | name = cable wording | group = n | The exact wording of this telegram has been differently reported. {{harvnb|Crane}} and {{harvnb|Preston|p=127}}, record the wording as "Am going south"; {{harvnb|Jones|p=78}}, and {{harvnb|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=299}}, give a longer text: "Beg leave to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctica". }} No indication was given of the Norwegian's plans or his destination in Antarctica; Scott wrote to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) secretary, [[John Scott Keltie]]: "We shall know in due course I suppose". News of Amundsen's revised plans reached Norway early in October and provoked a generally hostile response. Although Nansen gave his blessing and warm approval,{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=300–01}} Amundsen's actions were with few exceptions condemned by press and public, and funding dried up almost completely.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=65–66}}  Reactions in Britain were predictably adverse; an initial disbelief expressed by Keltie soon turned to anger and scorn. "I have sent full details of Amundsen's underhand conduct to Scott&amp;nbsp;... If I was Scott I would not let them land", wrote [[Clements Markham|Sir Clements Markham]], the influential former RGS president. {{sfn|Crane|p=428}} Unaware of the world's reactions, ''Fram'' sailed south for four months. The first icebergs were sighted on New Year's Day 1911; the Barrier itself came into view on 11&amp;nbsp;January, and on 14&amp;nbsp;January ''Fram'' was in the Bay of Whales.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=138–68}}

==First season, 1910–11==

===Framheim===
[[File:Framheim, February 1911.jpg|left|thumb|The base at [[Framheim]], February 1911]]
After ''Fram'' was anchored to ice in an inlet in the south-eastern corner of the Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, {{convert|2.2|nmi|km}} from the ship.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=335–38}} Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, with the door facing west; in this way the wind caught only the shorter eastern wall.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | pp=181–82}} The roof was in place by 21&amp;nbsp;January, and six days later the hut was complete.{{sfn|Turley|pp=73–74}} By then a large supply of meat—including 200&amp;nbsp;seals—had been brought to the base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole.{{sfn|Langner|p=124}} The base was dubbed [[Framheim]], "the home of ''Fram''".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=194}}

Early on the morning of 3&amp;nbsp;February, ''Terra Nova'' arrived unexpectedly in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, ''Terra Nova'' had taken a party of six men, led by [[Victor Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|Victor Campbell]], eastward to [[King Edward VII Land]]. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered ''Fram''.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=87}} Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, on the opposite side of the continent;{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=368}} this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British.{{sfn|Solomon|p=93}} The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers [[Harry Pennell]] and [[George Murray Levick]] breakfasted aboard ''Fram'', and reciprocated with lunch on the ''Terra Nova''.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|p=135}} Amundsen was relieved to learn that ''Terra Nova'' had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory.{{sfn|MacPhee|pp=89–92}} He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well.{{sfn|Langner|p=132}} Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=344–45}}

===Depot journeys===
[[File:Polar transport (Amundsen).jpg|thumb|upright|One of the men with a dog team and sledge on the Barrier in early 1911]]
In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying journeys across the Barrier, in preparation for the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would limit the amount of food and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10&amp;nbsp;February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18&amp;nbsp;dogs would pull three sledges.{{sfn|Langner|pp=144–45}} Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding ''Fram''. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the [[Southern Ocean]] and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=346}}{{refn | name = shore party | group = n | Amundsen had divided the expedition into sea and shore parties. The sea party, under Nilsen, sailed with ''Fram''; the nine-man shore party consisted of Amundsen, Prestrud, Johansen, Helmer Hanssen, Hassel, Bjaaland, Stubberud, Wisting and Lindstrøm. In [[#{{sfnRef|Amundsen}}|''The South Pole'']], Vol. I, p. 179, Amundsen omits Wisting from the shore party.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=179}} }}

When the four men began their journey south, their only knowledge of the Barrier was from books previous explorers had published, and they anticipated difficult travelling conditions. They were surprised to find the Barrier surface was much like that of a conventional glacier; they covered {{convert|15|nmi|km}} on the first day.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=347}} Amundsen noted how well his dogs were performing in these conditions, and wondered at the English aversion to the use of dogs on the Barrier.{{sfn|Langner|p=145}} The party reached 80°&amp;nbsp;S on 14&amp;nbsp;February, and after laying the depot turned for home, reaching Framheim on 16&amp;nbsp;February.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=105}}

The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22&amp;nbsp;February, with eight men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs.{{sfn|Turley|p=79}} Conditions on the Barrier had deteriorated sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9&amp;nbsp;°C (16&amp;nbsp;°F),{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=350}} and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes as low as {{convert|-40|°C}}, on 3&amp;nbsp;March the party reached 81°&amp;nbsp;S, where they established a second depot.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=352}} Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°&amp;nbsp;S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°&amp;nbsp;S on 8&amp;nbsp;March.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=352}} Amundsen could see that the dogs were exhausted;{{sfn|Langner|p=149}} the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=106}} Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending [[polar night]] made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°&amp;nbsp;S depot with six slaughtered seals—{{convert|2400|lb}} of meat.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I | p=254}} The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=357–58}}

Overall, the depot-laying journeys established three depots containing {{convert|7500|lb}} of supplies, which included {{convert|3000|lb}} of seal meat and {{convert|40|impgal|L}} of [[Kerosene|paraffin oil]].{{sfn|MacPhee|p=106}} Amundsen learned much from the journeys, especially on the second, when the dogs struggled with sledges that were too heavy. He decided to increase the number of dogs for the polar journey, if necessary at the expense of the number of men.{{sfn|Langner|p=151}} The journeys revealed some disunity among the men, particularly between Johansen and Amundsen. During the second depot journey, Johansen openly complained about the unsatisfactory nature of the equipment; Amundsen believed that his authority had been challenged.{{sfn|Langner|pp=149–50}}{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=355–56}}

===Winter===
[[File:Hassel in the oil-store.jpg|left|thumb|Sverre Hassel in the oil store at Framheim during the winter of 1911]]
The sun set over Framheim on 21&amp;nbsp;April, not to reappear for four months.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=379}} Amundsen was mindful of the boredom and loss of morale that had blighted the ''Belgica'' expedition's winter in the ice, and although there was no possibility of sledging he ensured that the shore party kept busy.{{sfn|Langner|p=159}} One urgent task was to improve the sledges, which had not worked well during the depot journeys. In addition to those chosen specifically for the expedition, Amundsen had brought along several sledges from Sverdrup's 1898–1902 ''Fram'' expedition, which he now thought would be better suited to the task ahead.  Bjaaland reduced the weight of these older sledges by almost a third by [[Plane (tool)|planing]] down the timber, and also constructed three sledges of his own from some spare [[hickory]] wood. The adapted sledges were to be used to cross the Barrier, while Bjaaland's new set would be used in the final stages of the journey, across the [[Antarctic Plateau|polar plateau]] itself.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=382–83}}  Johansen prepared the sledging rations (42,000&amp;nbsp;biscuits, 1,320&amp;nbsp;tins of pemmican and about {{convert|220|lb}} of chocolate),{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=390}} while other men worked on improving the boots, cooking equipment, goggles, skis and tents.{{sfn|Langner|p=160}} To combat the dangers of scurvy, twice a day the men ate seal meat that had been collected and frozen in quantities before the onset of winter. The cook, Lindstrøm, supplemented the vitamin C intake with bottled [[Rubus chamaemorus|cloudberries]] and [[Blueberry|blueberries]], and provided wholemeal bread made with fresh yeast, rich in [[B vitamins]].{{sfn|MacPhee|pp=120–21}}{{sfn|Langner|pp=160–61}}

While Amundsen was confident in his men and equipment, he was, Hassel recorded, tormented by thoughts of Scott's motor sledges and the fear that these would carry the British party to success.{{sfn|Langner|p=161}} With this in mind Amundsen planned to begin the polar journey as soon as the sun rose in late August, though Johansen warned that it would be too cold on the Barrier so early in the season.  Amundsen overruled him, and at sunrise on 24&amp;nbsp;August seven sledges were made ready.{{sfn|Langner|p=170}} Johansen's concerns seemed justified, as harsh conditions for the next two weeks—temperatures as low as {{convert|-58|°C}}—prevented the men from leaving.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=123}} On 8&amp;nbsp;September 1911, when the temperature rose to {{convert|-27|°C}}, Amundsen decided he could wait no longer, and the party of eight set off; Lindstrøm remained alone at Framheim.{{sfn|Langner|p=170}}

==Second season, 1911–12==
[[File:Gordon Home's Map of Amundsen's South Pole Expedition.jpg|thumb|Map showing Amundsen's route to the pole, Oct–Dec 1911. The depots marked at 80, 81 and 82° were laid in the first season, Feb–March 1911. Shackleton's 1908–09 route, as followed by Scott, is to the right.]]

===False start===
The party made good initial progress, travelling around {{convert|15|nmi|km}} each day. The dogs ran so hard that several from the strongest teams were detached from the traces and secured onto the sledges to act as ballast.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=407}} In their wolf-skin and reindeer-skin clothing the men could cope with the freezing temperatures while they kept moving, but when they stopped they suffered, and barely slept at night. The dogs' paws became frostbitten.{{sfn|Langner|p=170}} On 12&amp;nbsp;September, with temperatures down to {{convert|-56|°C}}, the party halted after only {{convert|4|nmi|km}} and built [[igloo]]s for shelter.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=407}} Amundsen now recognised that they had started the march too early in the season, and decided they should return to Framheim. He would not risk the lives of men and dogs for reasons of stubbornness.{{sfn|Langner|p=172}} Johansen, in his diary, wrote of the foolishness of starting prematurely on such a long and historic journey, and of the dangers of an obsession with beating the English.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=408}}

On 14&amp;nbsp;September, on their way back to Framheim, they left most of their equipment at the 80°&amp;nbsp;S depot, to lighten the sledges. Next day, in freezing temperatures with a strong headwind, several dogs froze to death while others, too weak to continue, were placed upon the sledges.{{sfn|Langner|pp=172–73}} On 16&amp;nbsp;September, {{convert|40|nmi|km}} from Framheim, Amundsen ordered his men to push for home as quickly as possible. Not having a sledge of his own, he leapt onto Wisting's, and with Helmer Hanssen and his team raced away, leaving the rest behind. The three arrived back at Framheim after nine hours, followed by Stubberud and Bjaaland two hours later and Hassel shortly after.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=409}}  Johansen and Prestrud were still out on the ice, without food or fuel; Prestrud's dogs had failed, and his heels were badly frostbitten. They reached Framheim after midnight, more than seventeen hours after they had turned for home.{{sfn|Langner|pp=174–75}}

Next day, Amundsen asked Johansen why he and Prestrud had been so late. Johansen answered angrily that he felt they had been abandoned, and castigated the leader for leaving his men behind.{{sfn|Langner|p=175}} Amundsen would later inform Nansen that Johansen had been "violently insubordinate"; as a result, he was excluded from the polar party, which Amundsen now reduced to five.{{sfn|Huntford|2001|p= 571}} Johansen was placed under the command of Prestrud, much his junior as an explorer, in a party that would explore [[King Edward VII Land]]. Stubberud was persuaded to join them, leaving Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Bjaaland, Hassel and Wisting as the revised South Pole party.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=131}}

===South Pole journey===

====Barrier and mountains====
[[File:AmundsenSouthPoleParty1911.jpg|thumb|left|Men and dogs at the 85°&amp;nbsp;South depot, on the way to the pole, 15&amp;nbsp;November 1911]]

Despite his eagerness to start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15&amp;nbsp;October, but was held up by the weather for a few more days.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=386}} On 19&amp;nbsp;October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey.{{sfn|Turley|p=86}} The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had discovered the previous autumn.{{sfn|Langner|p=178}} Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.{{sfn|Langner|p=178}}

Despite this near mishap they were covering more than {{convert|15|nmi|km}} a day, and reached their 82°&amp;nbsp;S depot on 5&amp;nbsp;November.  They marked their route by a line of cairns, built of snow blocks, at three-mile intervals.{{sfn|Langner|p=179}}{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=430–37}} On 17 November they reached the edge of the Barrier and faced the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Unlike Scott, who would be following the [[Beardmore Glacier]] route pioneered by Shackleton, Amundsen had to find his own route through the mountains. After probing the foothills for several days and climbing to around {{convert|1500|ft|m}}, the party found what appeared to be a clear route, a steep glacier {{convert|30|nmi|km}} long leading upwards to the [[Antarctic Plateau|plateau]]. Amundsen named this the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], after one of his chief financial backers.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=143}}{{refn | name = Named features | group = n | Other features encountered in this area and roughly mapped for the first time were named by Amundsen and his companions, mostly after themselves and those that had backed the expedition. These features included: the [[Queen Maud Mountains]], the [[Prince Olav Mountains]], [[Mount Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Mount Don Pedro Christophersen]], [[Mount Wilhelm Christophersen]], [[Mount Hanssen]], [[Mount Wisting]], [[Mount Hassel]], [[Mount Bjaaland]], [[Mount Engelstad]], the [[Liv Glacier]], and the [[Nilsen Plateau]]. }}  It was a harder ascent than the team had anticipated, made much longer by the need to take detours, and by the deep, soft snow. After three days of difficult climbing the party reached the glacier summit.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=143}} Amundsen was full of praise for his dogs, and scorned the idea that they could not work in such conditions; on 21&amp;nbsp;November the party travelled 17&amp;nbsp;miles and climbed {{convert|5000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=450}}

====March to the pole====
[[File:Axel Heiberg Glacier - Antarctica.JPG|thumb|An unidentified portion of the Axel Heiberg Glacier, Amundsen's route to the [[Antarctic Plateau]] (also called the polar plateau)]]
Upon reaching {{convert|10600|ft|m}} at the summit of the glacier, at 85°&amp;nbsp;36′&amp;nbsp;S, Amundsen prepared for the final stage of the journey. Of the 45&amp;nbsp;dogs who had made the ascent (7 had perished during the Barrier stage), only 18 would go forward; the remainder were to be killed for food. Each of the sledge-drivers killed dogs from his own team, skinned them, and divided the meat between dogs and men. "We called the place the Butchers' Shop", Amundsen recalled. "[T]here was depression and sadness in the air; we had grown so fond of our dogs".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=63–66}} Regrets did not prevent the team from enjoying the plentiful food; Wisting proved particularly skilful in his preparation and presentation of the meat.{{sfn|Langner|pp=184–85}}

The party loaded up three sledges with supplies for a march of up to 60&amp;nbsp;days, leaving the remaining provisions and dog carcasses in a depot. Bad weather prevented their departure until 25&amp;nbsp;November, when they set off cautiously over the unknown ground in persistent fog.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=67–73}}  They were travelling over an icy surface broken by frequent crevasses, which together with the poor visibility slowed their progress. Amundsen called this area the "Devil's Glacier". On 4&amp;nbsp;December they came to an area where the crevasses were concealed under layers of snow and ice with a space between, which gave what Amundsen called an "unpleasantly hollow" sound as the party passed over it. He christened this area "The Devil's Ballroom." When later that day they emerged on to more solid ground, they had reached 87°&amp;nbsp;S.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=105–07}}

On 8&amp;nbsp;December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South record of 88°&amp;nbsp;23′.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=459}} As they neared the pole, they looked for any break in the landscape that might indicate another expedition had got there ahead of them. While camped on 12 December they were momentarily alarmed by a black object that appeared on the horizon, but this proved to be their own dogs' droppings off in the distance, magnified by mirage.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=451–52}} Next day they camped at 89°&amp;nbsp;45′&amp;nbsp;S, {{convert|15|nmi|km}} from the pole.{{sfn|Langner|p=193}} On the following day, 14&amp;nbsp;December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled in front of the sledges, and at around 3&amp;nbsp;pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=487}} They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau "King Haakon VII's Plateau".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | p=122}} Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: "Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole—devil take it—had fascinated me since childhood, and now here I was at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?"{{sfn|Langner|pp=195–96}}

For the next three days the men worked to fix the exact position of the pole; after the conflicting and disputed claims of Cook and Peary in the north, Amundsen wanted to leave unmistakable markers for Scott.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=491}} After taking several [[sextant]] readings at different times of day, Bjaaland, Wisting and Hassel skied out in different directions to "box" the pole; Amundsen reasoned that between them they would bracket the exact point.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=155}} Finally the party pitched a tent, which they called [[Polheim]], as near as possible to the actual pole as they could calculate by their observations. In the tent Amundsen left equipment for Scott, and a letter addressed to King Haakon which he requested Scott to deliver.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=155}}

====Return to Framheim====
On 18 December, the party began the journey back to Framheim.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|pp=494–95}} Amundsen was determined to return to civilisation before Scott, and be first with the news.{{sfn|MacPhee|p=169}} Nevertheless, he limited their daily distances to {{convert|15|nmi|km}}, to preserve the strength of dogs and men. In the 24-hour daylight the party travelled during the national  night, to keep the sun at their backs and thus reduce the danger of [[photokeratitis|snow-blindness]].  Guided by the snow cairns built on their outward journey, they reached the Butchers' Shop on 4 January 1912, and began the descent to the Barrier.{{sfn|Turley|pp=118–19}}  The men on skis "went whizzing down", but for the sledge drivers—Helmer Hanssen and Wisting—the descent was precarious; the sledges were hard to manoeuvre, and brakes were added to the runners to enable rapid stops when crevasses were encountered.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | p=157}}

On 7 January, the party reached the first of their depots on the Barrier.{{sfn|Langner|p=206}} Amundsen now felt their pace could be increased, and the men adopted a routine of travelling {{convert|15|nmi|km}}, stopping for six hours, then resuming the march.{{sfn|Turley|p=120}} Under this regime they covered around {{convert|30|nmi|km}} a day, and on 25 January, at 4&amp;nbsp;am, they reached Framheim.  Of the 52&amp;nbsp;dogs that had started in October, 11 had survived, pulling 2 sledges. The journey to the pole and back had taken 99&amp;nbsp;days—10 fewer than scheduled—and they had covered about {{convert|1860|nmi|km}}.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=173–74}}

====Informing the world====
On his return to Framheim, Amundsen lost no time in winding up the expedition. After a farewell dinner in the hut, the party loaded the surviving dogs and the more valuable equipment aboard ''Fram'', which departed the Bay of Whales late on 30 January 1912. The destination was [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]]. During the five-week voyage Amundsen prepared his telegrams and drafted the first report that he would give to the press.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=493–97}} On 7 March, ''Fram'' reached Hobart, where Amundsen quickly learned there was as yet no news from Scott. He immediately sent telegrams to his brother Leon, to Nansen and to King Haakon, briefly informing them of his success. The next day he cabled the first full account of the story to London's ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', to which he had sold exclusive rights.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=510–11}} ''Fram'' remained in Hobart for two weeks; while there she was joined by [[Douglas Mawson]]'s ship ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'', which was in service with the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]]. Amundsen presented them with a gift of his 11 surviving dogs.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | p=352}}

===Other expedition achievements===
[[File:Kainan Maru ship 1912.jpg|thumb|left|The Japanese Antarctic Expedition's ship ''Kainan Maru'' in the Bay of Whales, January 1912]]

====Eastern party====
On 8&amp;nbsp;November 1911, Prestrud, Stubberud and Johansen had departed for King Edward VII Land.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | p=216}} The search for the point at which the solid ice of the Barrier became ice-covered land proved difficult. On 1 December the party had their first sighting of what was indubitably dry land, a [[nunatak]] which had been recorded by Scott during the [[Discovery expedition|''Discovery'' expedition]] in 1902.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=240 and 246 }} After reaching this point they collected geological specimens and samples of mosses, and briefly explored their surroundings before returning to Framheim on 16&amp;nbsp;December.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=249–61}}  They were the first men to set foot on King Edward VII Land.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=493}}

====''Fram'' and ''Kainan Maru''====
After leaving the Bay of Whales on 15 February 1911, ''Fram'' sailed for Buenos Aires where she arrived on 17 April.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | p=316}} Here, Nilsen learned that the expedition's funds were exhausted; a sum supposedly set aside for the ship's needs had not materialised. Fortunately, Amundsen's friend Don Pedro Christopherson was at hand to fulfil his earlier promises to provide supplies and fuel.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=328–31}} ''Fram'' departed in June for an oceanographic cruise between South America and Africa, which occupied the next three months.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=316–28}} The ship returned to Buenos Aires in September for final refitting and re-provisioning, before sailing south on 5 October. Strong winds and stormy seas prolonged the voyage, but the ship arrived at the Bay of Whales on 9 January 1912.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=331–46}} On 17 January the men in Framheim were surprised by the appearance of a second ship; it was ''Kainan Maru'', carrying the [[Japanese Antarctic Expedition]] led by [[Nobu Shirase]].{{sfn|Hamre|p=417}} Communication between the two expeditions was limited by language difficulties, though the Norwegians gathered that the Japanese were heading for King Edward VII Land.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II | pp=271–72}} ''Kainan Maru'' departed the next day, and on 26 January she landed a party on King Edward VII Land. This was the first landing on this shore from the sea; attempts by ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'' (1902), ''[[Nimrod (ship)|Nimrod]]'' (1908) and ''Terra Nova'' (1911) had all failed.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=527}}

==Aftermath==

===Contemporary reactions===
[[File:ClementsRMarkham geographer.jpg|thumb|upright|Clements Markham, the distinguished British geographer, was a harsh critic of Amundsen's change of plan and expressed private doubts about the Norwegian's success.]]
In Hobart, Amundsen received congratulatory telegrams from, among others, former US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. The king expressed particular pleasure that Amundsen's first port of call on his return had been on soil of the British Empire. In Norway, which only six years earlier had become an independent country after 500 years of Danish and Swedish supremacy, the news was proclaimed in banner headlines, and the national flag was flown throughout the country.  All the expedition's participants received the Norwegian South Pole medal (''Sydpolsmedaljen''), established by King Haakon to commemorate the expedition.{{sfn|Sydpolsmedaljen (Norway's South Polar medal)}}  However, Amundsen's biographer Roland Huntford refers to "the chill underneath the cheers"; there remained a residue of unease over Amundsen's tactics. One Norwegian newspaper expressed relief that Amundsen had found a new route, and had not intruded on Scott's path from McMurdo Sound.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp= 511–16}}

In Britain, press reaction to Amundsen's victory was restrained but generally positive. Apart from the enthusiastic reports in the ''Daily Chronicle'' and the ''Illustrated London News''—which each had a financial stake in Amundsen's success—the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' remarked that any cause for reproach was wiped out by the Norwegians' courage and determination. Readers of ''[[Young England magazine|Young England]]'' were exhorted not to grudge "the brave Norseman" the honour he had earned, and ''[[The Boy's Own Paper]]'' suggested that every British boy should read Amundsen's expedition account.{{sfn|Jones|pp= 89–90}} ''The Times'' correspondent offered a mild rebuke to Amundsen for his failure to inform Scott until it was too late for the latter to respond, "all the more unnecessary, for no one would have welcomed co-operation in the work of South Polar exploration more than Captain Scott&amp;nbsp;... Still, no one who knows Captain Amundsen can have any doubt of his integrity, and since he states he has reached the Pole we are bound to believe him".{{sfn|''The Times'', 9 March 1912|p=5}}

Senior figures at the RGS expressed more hostile sentiments, at least privately. To them, Amundsen's feat was the result of "a dirty trick". Markham hinted that Amundsen's claim might be fraudulent: "We must wait for the truth until the return of the ''Terra Nova''".{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp= 511–16}} When later in 1912 Amundsen addressed the RGS he felt slighted after [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the Society's president, jocularly called for "three cheers for the dogs".{{sfn|Barczewski|p=121}} Shackleton did not join in denigrating Amundsen's victory, and called him "perhaps the greatest polar explorer of today".{{sfn|Huntford (''Shackleton'')|1985|p=344}} Before she heard the news of her husband's death, [[Kathleen Scott]] conceded that Amundsen's journey "was a very fine feat&amp;nbsp;... in spite of one's irritation one has to admire it".{{sfn|Huntford (''Shackleton'')|1985|p=344}}

===Scott tragedy===
[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the polar journeys of the Scott's [[Terra Nova expedition]] (green) and Amundsen's expedition (red) to reach the South Pole]]
Amundsen left Hobart to undertake a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand. He then went to Buenos Aires where he finished writing his expedition account. Back in Norway he supervised the publication of the book, then visited Britain before embarking on a long lecture tour of the United States.{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|p=525}} In February&amp;nbsp;1913, while in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], he received the news that Scott and four comrades had reached the pole on 17&amp;nbsp;January 1912, but had all perished by 29&amp;nbsp;March, during their return journey. The bodies of Scott, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] had been discovered in November&amp;nbsp;1912, after the end of the Antarctic winter. In his initial response, Amundsen called the news "Horrible, horrible".{{sfn|Preston|p=242}} His more formal tribute followed: "Captain Scott left a record, for honesty, for sincerity, for bravery, for everything that makes a man".{{sfn|Jones|p=248}}

According to Huntford, the news of Scott's death meant that "Amundsen the victor was eclipsed&amp;nbsp;... by Scott the martyr".{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=525–26}} In the United Kingdom a myth quickly developed in which Scott was portrayed as one who had behaved nobly and played the game fairly. He had been defeated because, by contrast, Amundsen was a mere glory-seeker who had concealed his true intentions, had used dogs rather than relying on honest [[manhauling|man-hauling]] and had slaughtered these same dogs for food. Furthermore, he was considered a "professional" which, in the mindset of upper-class Britain of that time, diminished anything he might have accomplished.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp= 1–2}} This narrative was heavily reinforced with the publication of Scott's journals and his "Message to the Public".  Huntford points out that "[Scott's] literary talent was his trump. It was as if he had reached out from his buried tent and taken revenge."{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=525–26}} Even so, among explorers Amundsen's name continued to be respected.  In his account of the ''Terra Nova'' expedition written a few years later, Scott's comrade [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] wrote that the primary reason for Amundsen's success was "the very remarkable qualities of the man", specifically his courage in choosing to discover a new route rather than follow the known path.{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|p=607}}

===Historical perspective===
{{further|Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions}}
[[File:Amundsen Maud 1998-06-28.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of Amundsen's last ship, ''Maud'', in [[Cambridge Bay]] ([[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]), where it sank in 1930. &lt;br&gt;{{coord|69|7|8.28|N|105|1|11.61|W|scale:1000|display=inline}}]]
The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift—to which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary—until July&amp;nbsp;1918. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, ''[[Maud (ship)|Maud]]'', which remained in Arctic waters for the next seven years. The ship did not drift over the North Pole, although in the course of the expedition it became the second ship to traverse the [[North-East Passage]].{{sfn|Huntford (''The Last Place on Earth'')|1985|pp=532–33}} Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12&amp;nbsp;May 1926, aboard the airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' with [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and [[Umberto Nobile]], Amundsen flew over the North Pole. He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men to see both poles.{{sfn|Fleming|pp=411–14}} In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and [[Spitsbergen]].{{sfn|Fleming|p=420}}

The four men who had stood at the pole with Amundsen were all asked to accompany their leader on the ''Maud'' drift. Bjaaland and Hassel declined; neither participated in any further polar ventures.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=496}}{{sfn|Sverre Helge Hassel}} Helmer Hanssen and Wisting both joined ''Maud''; the latter took over the leadership when Amundsen left the expedition. In 1936 Wisting captained ''Fram'' on the ship's final voyage to Oslo, where it became a museum.{{sfn|Oscar Wisting}} Johansen, who had been unable to settle back into normal life on his return from Antarctica, became withdrawn and uncommunicative. He refused to discuss his experiences or his dispute with Amundsen, and retreated into a life of depression and poverty. On 4&amp;nbsp;January 1913 he shot himself in his Oslo lodgings.{{sfn|Huntford|1979|p=529}}

The Scott myth lasted until the final quarter of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, when it was replaced by one that characterised him as a "heroic bungler" whose failure was largely the result of his own mistakes. This portrayal, the cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski asserts, is as fallacious as the earlier one in which he was considered beyond criticism.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=1–2}} In the early 21st&amp;nbsp;century, writers have suggested more reasoned explanations for the Scott tragedy than his incompetence, and his reputation has to some extent been rescued.{{sfn|''The Daily Telegraph'', 19 December 2004}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard |last=Gray | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed spotlight on Scott has also highlighted Amundsen's achievements: Barczewski writes that "Amundsen and his men reached the pole due to a combination of superb planning, long experience with sledge-dogs and skis and impressive physical stamina".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=1–2}} In her account of Scott's expedition, [[Diana Preston]] is equally specific in identifying the basis of Amundsen's success. He was focused on the single goal of reaching the pole, whereas Scott had to reconcile the competing claims of geographical exploration and scientific knowledge. "A practical and experienced professional, [Amundsen] planned carefully and applied all the lessons he had learned in the Arctic&amp;nbsp;... [H]e relied exclusively on the well-tried means of transport and unsentimentally exploited their food potential. He was similarly efficient and unsentimental in his management of his men".{{sfn|Preston|p=221}} The United States' scientific base at the South Pole, founded in 1957, is named the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]], to honour the memories of both polar pioneers.{{sfn|National Science Foundation, 27 April 2009}}

===Modern research===
In a paper published 100 years after the Amundsen expedition, researchers claimed that the tent and flags are buried under {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} of ice and about a minute of latitude north of the South Pole,&lt;ref name=orheim&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orheim|first1=Olav|title=The present location of the tent that Roald Amundsen left behind at the South Pole in December 1911|journal=Polar Record|date=21 January 2011|volume=47|issue=3|pages=268–270|doi=10.1017/S0032247410000719}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about one [[nautical mile]].  Scott's party was the last to see the tent, which they found on 18 January 1912. [[Henry Robertson Bowers]] took a photo of the tent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://southpoledoc.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/in-search-of-amundsens-tent/|title=In Search of Amundsen's Tent|first=|last=|date=3 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but died returning from the Pole.

The '''''Annals of Tigernach''''' ([[Abbreviation|abbr.]] '''AT''') is a [[chronicle]] probably originating in [[Clonmacnoise]], [[Ireland]]. The language is a mixture of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Old Irish|Old]] and [[Middle Irish]].

Many of the pre-historic entries come from the 12th-century MS, [[Rawlinson B 502]].&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, ''Early Christian Ireland: Introduction to the Sources'', pp. 99-162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the real importance of the chronicle is for the period 489-766, 973–1003 and 1018–1178.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; These three fragments survive from the 14th-century MS [[Rawlinson B 488]].&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The coverage of the period 766 to 973 is lost, but is thought to survive in abbreviated form in the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum|Chronicon Scottorum]]'' (abbr. '''CT''').&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; The latter is defective for the period 718 to 804, but as much of its content is derived from the hypothetical ''[[The Chronicle of Ireland|Chronicle of Ireland]]'' (itself partly derived from the ''[[Iona Chronicle]]''), of which the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' (abbr. '''AU''') and ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]'' (abbr. '''AI''') are also derived, we have some idea of what the entries contained.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]] postulates that AU and AT diverged from the ''Chronicle of Ireland'' sometime before the year 913.&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;

The chronicle owes its modern name to [[Tigernach Ua Braín]] (d. 1088), [[abbot of Clonmacnoise]], but this does not mean that he was also its author. A note added to the entry for 1088, the year of his death, in Rawlinson B 488 states that the text was written by Tigernach up to that point. If he was not merely the scribe of the original text copied by the 14th-century scribe, it may mean that he was one of the [[annalist]]s responsible for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, "Ua Braín, Tigernach (''d''. 1088)"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6165">{{Sound change}}
In [[phonology]], '''apocope''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|ɒ|k|ə|p|iː}}{{refn|{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=2016-01-21|Apocope}}}}{{refn|{{Cite Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2016-01-21|Apocope}}}}) is the loss ([[elision]]) of one or more sounds from the end of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel.

==Etymology==
''Apocope'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀποκοπή}} ({{transl|grc|apokopḗ}}) from {{lang|grc|ἀποκόπτειν}} ({{transl|grc|apokóptein}}) "cutting off", from {{lang|grc|ἀπο-}} ({{transl|grc|apo-}}) "away from" and {{lang|grc|κόπτειν}} ({{transl|grc|kóptein}}) "to cut".

==Historical sound change==
In [[historical linguistics]], ''apocope'' is often the loss of an unstressed vowel.

===Loss of an unstressed vowel or vowel and nasal===
* Vulgar Latin {{lang|la|panem}} → Spanish {{lang|es|pan}} (''bread'')
* Vulgar Latin {{lang|la|lupum}} → French {{lang|fr|loup}} (''wolf'')
* Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*landą}} → [[Old English|Old]], [[Middle English|Middle]], and Modern English ''land''
* Old English {{wikt-lang|ang|lufu}} → Modern English ''love'' (noun)
* Old English {{wikt-lang|ang|lufian}} → Modern English ''love'' (verb)

===Loss of other sounds===
* [[Rhoticity in English|Non-rhotic]] English accents, including British [[Received Pronunciation#Comparison with other varieties of English|Received Pronunciation]], suppress the final ''r'' in each syllable (except when it is followed by a vowel). (In some accents, the suppressed ''r'' lengthens or [[r-colored vowel|modifies the preceding vowel]].)
* French pronunciation [[French phonology#Liaison|suppresses the final consonant of each word]] (though it [[liaison (French)|moves to the following word]] in the sentence, if that word begins with a vowel).
* Latin {{lang|la|illud}} → Spanish {{lang|es|ello}}

===Case marker===
In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and the [[Sami languages]], apocopes explain the forms of grammatical cases. For example, a [[nominative case|nominative]] is described as having apocope of the final vowel, but the [[genitive case|genitive]] does not. Throughout its history, however, the genitive case marker has also undergone apocope: Estonian {{lang|et|linn}} ("a city") and {{lang|et|linna}} ("of a city") are derived from {{lang|et|linna}} and {{lang|et|linnan}} respectively, as can still be seen in the corresponding [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word. In the genitive form, the final {{IPA|/n/}}, while it was being deleted, blocked the loss of {{IPA|/a/}}. In [[colloquial Finnish]], the final vowel is sometimes omitted from case markers.

==Grammatical rule==
Some languages have apocopations that are internalized as mandatory forms. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], for example, some [[adjective]]s that come before the [[noun]] lose the final vowel or syllable if they precede a noun (mainly) in the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] [[grammatical number|singular]] form. In Spanish, some [[adverb]]s and [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] have apocopations as well.

* '''Adjectives'''
** {{lang|es|grande}} ("big, great") → {{lang|es|gran}} → {{lang|es|gran mujer}} ([[grammatical gender|feminine]]) ("great woman". However, if the adjective follows the noun, the final syllable remains, but the meaning may also change: {{lang|es|mujer grande}}, meaning "large woman")
** {{lang|es|bueno}} ("good") → {{lang|es|buen}} → {{lang|es|buen hombre}} ([[grammatical gender|masculine]]) ("good man"; the final vowel remains in {{lang|es|hombre bueno}}, with no accompanying change in meaning)
* '''Adverbs'''
** {{lang|es|tanto}} ("so much") → {{lang|es|tan}} ("so") → {{lang|es|tan hermoso}} ("so beautiful")
* '''Cardinal numbers'''
** {{lang|es|uno}} ("one, a, an") → {{lang|es|un}} → {{lang|es|un niño}} ("a child")
** {{lang|es|ciento}} ("hundred") → {{lang|es|cien}} → {{lang|es|Cien años de soledad}} ("[[One hundred years of solitude]]")
* '''Ordinal numbers'''
** {{lang|es|primero}} ("first") → {{lang|es|primer}} → {{lang|es|primer premio}} ("first prize")
** {{lang|es|segundo}} ("second") → {{lang|es|según}} ("according to") → {{lang|es|según él}} ("according to him")
** {{lang|es|tercero}} ("third") → {{lang|es|tercer}} → {{lang|es|tercer lugar}} ("third place")
** {{lang|es|postrero}} ("final") → {{lang|es|postrer}} → {{lang|es|postrer día}} ("final day")

==Informal speech==
Various numerous sorts of informal abbreviations might be classed as apocope:
* English ''photograph'' → ''photo''
* English ''animation'' → Japanese {{transl|ja|animēshon}} ({{lang|ja|アニメーション}})  → {{transl|ja|anime}} ({{lang|ja|アニメ}})
* English ''synchronization'' → ''sync'', ''synch'', ''syncro'', or ''synchro''
* English ''Alexander'' → ''Alex'', ''Alec'' and so on with other [[hypocorism]]s
* French {{lang|fr|sympathique}} → {{lang|fr|sympa}} meaning "nice"
* French {{lang|fr|réactionnaire}} → {{lang|fr|réac}} meaning "reactionary"
* Spanish {{lang|es|fotografía}} → {{lang|es|foto}} meaning "photography"
* Spanish {{lang|es|televisión}} → {{lang|es|tele}} meaning "television" (cf. French {{lang|fr|télé}} for {{lang|fr|télévision}})

For a list of similar apocopations in the English language, see [[List of English apocopations]].

[[Diminutives in Australian English]] lists many apocopations.

The process is also linguistically subsumed under one called ''[[clipping (morphology)|clipping]]'', or ''truncation''.

The '''Audubon Nature Institute''' is a family of museums and parks dedicated to nature and based in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

It consists of the [[Audubon Zoo]], [[Aquarium of the Americas]], Audubon Louisiana Nature Center, [[Audubon Park, New Orleans|Audubon Park]], [[Woldenberg Park (New Orleans)|Woldenberg Riverfront Park]], [[Freeport-McMoRan]] Audubon Species Survival Center, [[Entergy]] [[IMAX]] Theatre, Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (ACRES), Audubon Wilderness Park, and the [[Audubon Insectarium]].

==History==

===1800s===
The Audubon family of nature sites and facilities began with Audubon Park &amp;ndash; once home to Native Americans &amp;ndash; and later, to New Orleans' first mayor, [[Étienne de Boré]]. He founded the nation's first commercial sugar plantation here, when New Orleans was still part of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial Louisiana]]; and developed its first granulated sugar through a process invented by [[Norbert Rillieux]], a local [[Free people of color|free man of color]].

The land did not fall into public hands until 1850, when a philanthropist [[Will and testament|willed]] it to the city. During the [[US Civil War]], the location alternately hosted a [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] military camp and a [[Union Army|Union]] hospital. In 1866, it was the activation site for the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], the "[[Buffalo Soldiers]]," whose defense of the United States' western frontier made an indelible mark on America's [[African-American]] heritage.

Site improvements made for the [[World Cotton Centennial|World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition of 1884]] (Louisiana's first [[World's Fair]]) laid the foundation for an urban park. The city had designated the land for this purpose in 1871; and in 1886, city planners changed the park's name from Upper City Park to [[Audubon Park, New Orleans|Audubon Park]]. This was in tribute to artist/naturalist [[John James Audubon]] who painted many of his famed ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' in Louisiana.

A governing board was appointed by the city in 1894 to find the best way to develop the land; and by the turn of the century, development had been entrusted to landscape architect [[John Charles Olmsted]]. Olmsted's family firm had risen to prominence for its design of New York City's [[Central Park]], and New Orleanians soon watched their own scenic retreat materialize from Louisiana swamp land.

===1900s: from decline to revitalization===
[http://nolasatellitegovernment.tulane.edu/organization.php?oID=6 The Audubon Commission] was established by State Act in 1914 to maintain and develop Audubon Park. A flight cage was added to the park in 1916, and its popularity launched the community's call for a full-scale zoo. Community leaders united as the New Orleans Zoological Society, and (in a tradition carried on today) private donations soon funded a monkey cage, a mammal cage and a deer paddock. The first elephant, purchased by Louisiana schoolchildren, arrived in 1924. An aquarium and a colonnaded sea lion pool fueled the momentum, and by 1929, the collection boasted hundreds of animals.

When the Depression of the 1930s shut down private donations, the city's hope for a zoo was kept alive by the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). This federal agency funded construction of new zoo buildings, and in 1938, a $50,000 bequest from local benefactor Valentine Merz enabled the opening of the Merz Memorial Zoo.

Expensive to maintain and operate, the Merz facility held its own until the 1950s. Deterioration followed as city appropriations dwindled, private donations dried up and public interest waned. There were a few bright moments (including the 1956 arrival of the first endangered [[whooping crane]] hatched in a zoo), but times were mostly bad. Blasted by the media as an animal "ghetto" in 1958 and urged to "clean up or close up" by the [[Humane Society of the United States]] in 1970, the Zoo—now called Audubon Zoo—begged recovery.

Recovery finally came through the efforts of devoted community volunteers, and a remarkable public/private collaboration through the Audubon Commission. In 1972 the Commission spearheaded passage of a special referendum which generated nearly $2 million in bonds to finance the beginning of the Zoo's restoration. The volunteers formally rallied as Friends of the Zoo, and in 1973, [[Ron Forman]]—the City Hall Liaison for Audubon Park—came on board with a grand vision that evolved into a new master plan for the Zoo. Forman and the Audubon Commission expanded the Zoo to its current 58 acres, allowing for sweeping natural habitats that mirrored wild environments: the African Savanna, North American Grasslands and the South American Pampas. Other new adventures included a Children's Zoo and a World of Primates exhibit. Audubon Zoo's Phoenix-like rise led to accreditation from the [[American Zoo and Aquarium Association]] in 1981. Industry peers were further impressed by the 1984 debut of the Louisiana Swamp Exhibit. Its unprecedented exhibit style not only displayed native animals in a stunningly realistic environment, it used cultural elements to capture the lifestyle of the Cajun people who have endeared Louisiana's swamplands to the world.

Audubon's incredible turnaround set a new benchmark for zoo exhibits—and New Orleans success stories. Most importantly, the Zoo's rebirth firmly anchored Audubon among the nation's top-rated zoological parks and inspired support for future developments that would benefit the city culturally—and economically. By the mid-1980s, Audubon was lobbying for an exciting new educational resource that would highlight aquatic habitats while reintroducing New Orleanians to their own, legendary [[Mississippi River]]. Where decaying warehouses blocked public access to the river's banks, Ron Forman, his team, and their supporters envisioned a lush community park with a sparkling centerpiece: [[Audubon Aquarium of the Americas]].

Vision became reality as local citizens overwhelming approved a millage to service $25 million in bonds to fund construction of the Aquarium and Woldenberg Riverfront Park. The project not only set a new, broader course for Audubon. It promised the city a much-needed family attraction that could drive its tourism industry to new heights.

Woldenberg Park opened in 1989, the same year the Friends of the Zoo evolved into Audubon Nature Institute. The Aquarium followed in 1990, drawing huge crowds for its Labor Day opening. Four months later, the facility had already exceeded its first-year attendance projections. And Audubon Nature Institute was ready, once again, to leverage its success for new achievements.

===2000s: focus on conservation===
In the next decade, Audubon Nature Institute adopted an ambitious new mission incorporating [[wildlife conservation]], science education, and family entertainment. New ways to captivate and educate visitors emerged. The Aquarium expanded into a new wing housing Entergy IMAX® Theatre and a Changing Exhibits Gallery, while Woldenberg Park also extended its borders. The Zoo 2000 master plan saw completion through the addition of the CNG (now Dominion) Learning Center; engaging new exhibits (e.g. Komodo dragons and Jaguar Jungle); the state-of-the-art Columbia Animal Healthcare Center; and a grand new entrance befitting a world-class zoo.

Audubon Louisiana Nature Center joined the growing family in a 1994 merger and later developed new educational programs for Audubon Wilderness Park, a private West Bank preserve which would welcome schoolchildren and other scheduled groups to discover native animals and habitats.

Through each new development, the family birthplace—Audubon Park—has endured as a much-loved community resource that combines habitat preservation with human pastimes. The extensive 2002 renovation of its historic Golf Course shaped beautiful new vistas enjoyed by all park users who, like generations before them, embrace the site as a center of New Orleans life.

Innovation remained a guiding force as Audubon Nature Institute sought to grow its commitment to wildlife conservation—on a global scale. With successful [[breeding program]]s already in place at the Zoo and the Aquarium, Audubon addressed the critical need for additional population management space with the 1993 opening of Freeport-McMoRan Audubon Species Survival Center. Unique in the world, the campus combines research laboratories with acres of pristine natural habitat where rare and endangered animals can roam and reproduce. Exotic wildcats, Mississippi [[sandhill crane]]s, [[whooping cranes]], [[saddlebill storks]], and other vanishing animals find sanctuary and flourish on these grounds, while scientists on-site at Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species wield assisted reproduction technologies in the war against wildlife extinction.

Employing vital partnerships with universities, government agencies and other conservation-dedicated organizations, the Research Center team continues to earn international renown through amazing achievements. These include the world's first African wildcat clones;&lt;ref&gt;See: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4172688.stm&lt;/ref&gt; the first caracal cat created from a frozen-thawed embryo; the first African [[serval]] wildcat born as a result of [[in vitro fertilization]]; and a "[[Frozen Zoo]]," which preserves the genetic material of hundreds of diminishing animal species—ensuring their survival in the future.

Audubon Nature Institute added an exciting new branch to the family tree on June 13, 2008—[[Audubon Butterfly Garden and Insectarium]]. Located in the historic U.S. Custom House in downtown New Orleans, the Butterfly Garden and Insectarium was the first major new attraction to open in the city since Hurricane Katrina.

The Butterfly Garden and Insectarium celebrates the world of bugs with 13 gallery rooms containing more than 70 live animal enclosures, 30 mounted specimen cases and a multi-sensory immersive theater experience. There are about 100 live [[arthropod]] species throughout as well as a variety of fish. Visitors can experience live insect encounters, discover [[Insects#Relationship to humans|cultural aspects of insects]], sample exotic insect cuisine, shrink in size to see the world from a bug's perspective, and enjoy the tranquility of a Japanese garden while watching hundreds of butterflies flit about.

This one-of-a-kind interactive experience is another "living classroom" designed to show how human lives are affected by nature—and what we all stand to lose without careful stewardship of its every, treasured resource.

==Public outreach and impact==
Constantly attuned to local needs, Audubon Nature Institute shapes its myriad programs to benefit our community at all levels, from providing much-needed educational resources to nurturing economic development.

Audubon educators collaborate with public school teachers and administrators to help fill a science education void created by funding shortfalls. Afterschool programs, teacher training sessions, field trip enrichment programs and family learning opportunities are staged at all of Audubon's public facilities, including the Zoo's Jeri and Robert Nims Community Center. Outreach vehicles, learning kits, and other initiatives extend Audubon's teaching arm directly into area classrooms—programs like the Internet-based WILD-LAB curriculum or Coast to Classroom widen that reach still more.

Ensuring that all community members enjoy access to Audubon Nature Institute is an ongoing priority achieved through summer discounts made available to students in financially disadvantaged schools; minority hiring initiatives; vendor policies that ensure opportunities for Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (EDB); and celebration of the city's great cultural diversity through such Audubon-hosted events as [http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/festivals/multiculturalfestivals/soulfest.html Soul Fest], Black History Month activities and the [http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/festivals/multiculturalfestivals/asianfestival.html Asian Pacific-American Festival].

The Audubon Nature Institute continues to play a vital role in the local economy as well. With more than $250 million in capital investments, a $40 million annual budget, a workforce of more than 600 employees, and the generation of $19 million in local and state sales taxes each year, Audubon has an annual economic impact of $330 million. This is an amazing return on investments made in the Audubon vision by generations of supporters—and a remarkable accomplishment for an organization that, unlike its peers, receives little or no city or state funding for day-to-day operations.

==Effects of Hurricane Katrina==
The 2005 [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused substantial physical destruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/09/07/katrina.zoos/ |title=Katrina kills most fish in New Orleans aquarium - Sep 7, 2005 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; wiped out all Audubon operating revenues and forced the layoff of nearly 600 employees. Nonetheless, Aquarium staff remained at their posts throughout the storm, as well as the subsequent flooding, doing what they could for the animals in their charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0909_050909_orleans_zoo.html |title=Aquarium Animals Evacuate New Orleans; Zoo Gets Relief |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellany==
The institute was the executive producer of "[[Hurricane on the Bayou]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurricaneonthebayou.com/html/ "Hurricane on the Bayou": official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304081749/http://hurricaneonthebayou.com/html/ |date=March 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[IMAX]] film released on the anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s landfall in 2006.&lt;ref name="WP-2-22-07"&gt;Philip Kennicott, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/21/AR2007032102167.html "Rose-Colored Lens: In Louisiana, Environmental Destruction Never Looked So Pretty"], Washington Post, March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute is no longer a part of the [[National Wetlands Coalition]], but it is a "cooperating organization" with America's Wetland Campaign,&lt;ref name="WP-2-22-07"/&gt; which is sponsored by [[BG Group|British Gas]], [[Citgo]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Shell Oil]] and other leading energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=2&amp;cid=30 |title=Our Partners &amp;#124; America's Wetland |publisher=Americaswetland.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buchenwald Property 80623.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Reichsbank]] used to bank the [[gold]] [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s of [[Buchenwald]] victims for the [[SS]], 5 May 1945]]
The '''August Frank memorandum''' of 26 September 1942 was a directive from SS Lieutenant General (''[[Obergruppenführer]]'') [[August Frank]] of the [[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt|SS concentration camp administration department]] (SS-WVHA).  The memorandum provides a measure of the detailed planning that Frank and other Nazis put into the carrying out of the [[Holocaust]]. It includes instructions as to the disposition of postage stamp collections and underwear of the murdered Jews. It is clear that the Nazis were intent in removing everything of value from their victims.

The memorandum contains an instruction that the [[Yellow badge|yellow stars]] that the Nazis forced Jews to wear on their clothing were to be removed before the clothing was redistributed to [[ethnic Germans]] whom the Nazis were resettling into occupied Poland.  This memorandum, when it came to light after the war, played a key role in refuting Frank's claims that he had no knowledge that Jews were being murdered en masse in the extermination camps of [[Operation Reinhard|Operation ''Reinhard'']].&lt;ref name = Pohl_992-997&gt;{{Citation | author =  [[Nuremberg Military Tribunal]] | author-link =  | contribution = Judgment of the Tribunal (regarding August Frank), 3 November 1947 | editor-last =  | editor-first = | title = United States of America v.

== Text of the memorandum ==
The top secret memorandum, printed in multiple copies, was sent to the Chief of the SS Garrison [[Nisko Plan|Administration Lublin]], and to the Chief of Administration Concentration Camp [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] among others. English translation, provided by the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg Military Tribunal]] during the [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Trials of War Criminals]]:

{{quote|text=Without taking into account the overall regulations which are expected to be issued during October, pertaining to the utilization of mobile and immobile property of the evacuated Jews, the following procedure has to be followed with regard to the property carried by them — property, which will in all orders in the future be called goods originating from thefts, receiving of stolen goods, and hoarded goods: &lt;br&gt;
'''1. a.''' Cash money in [[Reichsbank]] notes have to be paid into the account: Economic and Administrative Main Office 158/1488 with the Reich Bank in Berlin-Schoeneberg. &lt;br&gt;
'''b.''' Foreign exchange (coined or uncoined), rare metals, jewelry, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, gold from teeth and scrap gold have to be delivered to the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office. The latter is responsible for the immediate delivery to the Reichsbank.&lt;br&gt;
'''c.''' Watches and clocks of all kinds, alarm clocks, fountain pens, [[mechanical pencil]]s, hand and electrical razors, pocketknives, scissors, flashlights, wallets, and purses are to be repaired by the Economic and Administrative Main Office in special repair shops, cleaned, and evaluated; and have to be delivered quickly to front line troops.  Delivery to the troops is on a cash basis through the post exchanges. Three-fourth price grades are to be set and it has to be made sure that each officer and man cannot buy more than one watch.  Exempt from sale are the gold watches, the utilization of which rests with me. The proceeds go to the Reich.&lt;br&gt;
'''d.''' Men's underwear and men's clothing including footwear has to be sorted and valued. After covering the needs of the concentration camp inmates and in exceptions for the troops they are to be handed over to the [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle|Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]]. The proceeds go to the Reich in all cases.&lt;br&gt;
'''e.''' Women's clothing and women's underwear, including footwear; children's clothing and children's underwear, including footwear; have to be handed over to the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle against payment. Underwear of pure [[silk]] is to be handed over to the Reich Ministry of Economics according to orders by the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office. This order refers also to underwear, under letter.&lt;ref&gt;The original states "The same applies to underwear [or ''laundry'' or ''linens''] under letter '''d''' [men's clothing]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''f.''' Featherbeds, quilts, woolen blankets, cloth for suits, shawls, umbrellas, walking sticks, thermos flasks, ear flaps, baby carriages, combs, handbags, leather belts, shopping baskets, tobacco pipes, sun glasses, mirrors, table knives, forks and spoons, knapsacks, and suitcases made from leather or artificial material are to be delivered to the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle. The question of payment will be decided later.&lt;br&gt;
The needs in quilts, woolen blankets, thermos flasks, ear flaps, combs, table knives, forks and spoons, and knapsacks can be furnished from [[Majdanek concentration camp|Lublin]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] from these stocks against payment from budget funds.&lt;br&gt;
'''g.''' Linen, such as bed sheets, bed linen, pillows, towels, wiping cloths, and tablecloths are to be handed over to the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle against payment.  Bed sheets, bed linen, towels, wiping cloths, and table cloths can be furnished for the needs of troops from these stocks against payment from budget funds.&lt;br&gt;
'''h.''' Spectacles and eyeglasses of every kind are to be handed in to the medical office for utilization. (Spectacles with golden frames have to be handed in without glasses together with the rare metals). A settlement of accounts for the spectacles and eyeglasses need not take place with regard to their low value and their limited use.&lt;br&gt;
'''i.''' Valuable furs of all kinds, raw and cured, are to be delivered to the [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office|SS-WVHA]].&lt;br&gt;
'''j.''' Ordinary furs (lamb, hare, and rabbit skins) are to be reported to the SS-WVHA, Amt B II, and are to be delivered to the clothing plant of the [[Waffen-SS]], [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] near [[Fürstenberg/Havel|Fürstenberg]] ([[Mecklenburg]]).&lt;br&gt;
'''k.''' All items mentioned under the letters d, e, and f, which have only one-fifth or two-fifths of the full value, or are useless altogether will be delivered via the SS-WVHA to the Reich Ministry for Economics for utilization.&lt;br&gt; 
For the decision on items which are not mentioned under the letters b-i, application for a decision as to their utilization should be made to the chief of the WVHA.

'''2'''. The SS-WVHA will establish all prices under observation of the legally controlled prices. This estimation, however, can be made later on. Petty evaluations which only waste time and personnel may be eliminated.  Average prices for single items have to be established in general. For instance, one pair of used men's trousers 3.00 ℛℳ, one woolen blanket 6.00 ℛℳ, etc. For the delivery of useless items to the Reich Ministry for Economics, average Kilo prices will have to be established.

It has to be strictly observed, that the [[Yellow_badge#Nazi_Europe|Jewish Star]] is removed from all garments and outer garments which are to be delivered. Furthermore, items which are to be delivered have to be searched for hidden and sewed-in values, this should be carried out with the greatest possible care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10688">'''BIBFRAME''' (Bibliographic Framework) is a [[data model]] for bibliographic description.  BIBFRAME was designed to replace the [[MARC standards]], and to use [[linked data]] principles to make [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]] more useful both within and outside the library community.&lt;ref name=web-of-data&gt;{{cite report|last=Miller|first=Eric|title=Bibliographic Framework as a Web of Data:  Linked Data Model and Supporting Services|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/pdf/marcld-report-11-21-2012.pdf|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=28 May 2014|author2=Uche Ogbuji |author3=Victoria Mueller |author4=Kathy MacDougall |date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The MARC Standards, which BIBFRAME seeks to replace, were developed by [[Henriette Avram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Henriette Avram, 'Mother of MARC,' Dies|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0605/avram.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the US [[Library of Congress]] during the 1960s. By 1971, MARC formats had become the national standard for dissemination of [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]] in the United States, and the international standard by 1973.

In a provocatively titled 2002 article, library technologist [[Roy Tennant]] argued that "MARC Must Die", noting that the standard was old; used only within the library community; and designed to be a display, rather than a storage or retrieval format.&lt;ref name="tennant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tennant|first=Roy|title=MARC Must Die|journal=Library Journal|volume=127|issue=17|pages=26–27|url = http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/10/ljarchives/marc-must-die/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report from the Library of Congress wrote that MARC is "based on forty-year old techniques for data management and is out of step with programming styles of today."&lt;ref name=on-the-record&gt;{{cite report|title=On the Record|publisher=The Library of Congress Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibliographic-future/news/lcwg-ontherecord-jan08-final.pdf|date=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Library of Congress announced that it had contracted with Zepheira, a data management company, to develop a linked data alternative to MARC.&lt;ref name=zepheira-release&gt;{{cite web|title=The Library of Congress Announces Modeling Initiative|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/news/bibframe-052212.html|work=BIBFRAME|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the library announced a new model called MARC Resources (MARCR).&lt;ref name=mccallum&gt;{{cite web|last=McCallum|first=Sally|title=Bibliographic Framework Initiative Approach for MARC Data as Linked Data|url=http://igelu.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IGeLU-sally-McCallum.pptx|work=7th Annual IGeLU Conference|accessdate=30 May 2014|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, the library released a more complete draft of the model, renamed BIBFRAME.&lt;ref name=web-of-data /&gt; {{refn|group=nb|For a detailed history of discontent with the MARC standards between Tennant's 2002 article and the 2012 announcement of BIBFRAME, see {{cite journal|last=Kroeger|first=Angela|title=The Road to BIBFRAME: The Evolution of the Idea of Bibliographic Transition into a Post-MARC Future|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=51|issue=8|pages=873–890|doi=10.1080/01639374.2013.823584 |year=2013 }}}}

The Library of Congress released version 2.0 of BIBFRAME in 2016.&lt;ref name="overview20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/bibframe2-model.html|title=Overview of the BIBFRAME 2.0 Model|last=|first=|date=21 Apr 2016|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccallumJlis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Sally|title=BIBFRAME Development|journal=JLIS.it|volume=8|issue=3|pages=71-85|url= https://www.jlis.it/article/view/12415|doi=10.4403/jlis.it-12415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Bibframe2-model.jpg|thumb|Illustration of BIBFRAME 2.0 model, with three core levels of abstraction (in blue)—Work, Instance, Item—and three related classes (in orange)—Agent, Subject, Event.]]
BIBFRAME is expressed in [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and based on three categories of abstraction (work, instance, item), with three additional classes (agent, subject, event) that relate to the core categories.&lt;ref name=overview20 /&gt;  While the ''work'' entity in BIBFRAME may be "considered as the union of the disjoint ''work'' and ''expression'' entities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapounidou|first=Sofia|last2=Sfakakis|first2=Michalis|last3=Papatheodorou|first3=Christos|date=2016-06-01|title=Representing and integrating bibliographic information into the Semantic Web: A comparison of four conceptual models|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551516650410|journal=Journal of Information Science|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=525–553|doi=10.1177/0165551516650410}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA's]] [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] (FRBR) entity relationship model, BIBFRAME's ''instance'' entity is analogous to the FRBR ''manifestation'' entity. This represents an apparent break with FRBR and the FRBR-based [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) cataloging code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Erik|title=Three Case Studies in Linked Open Data|journal=Library Technology Reports|volume=49|issue=5|pages=26–43|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original BIBFRAME model argues that the new model "can reflect the FRBR relationships in terms of a graph rather than as hierarchical relationships, after applying a reductionist technique."&lt;ref name=web-of-data /&gt; Since both FRBR and BIBFRAME have been expressed in RDF, interoperability between the two models is technically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Highlights of Library Data Models in the Era of Linked Open Data|last1=Zapounidou|first1=Sofia|last2=Sfakakis|first2=Michalis|last3=Papatheodorou|first3=Christos|date=November 19–22, 2013|publisher=Springer|booktitle=Metadata and Semantics Research|isbn=9783319034362|pages=396–407|conferenceurl=http://mtsr2013.teithe.gr/|conference=Metadata and Semantics Research Conference, Thessaloniki, Greece|editor1=Emmanouel Garoufallou|editor2=Jane Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific formats===
While the BIBFRAME model currently includes a ''serial'' entity, there are still a number of issues to be addressed before the model can be used for [[Periodical literature|serials]] cataloging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fallgren|first=Nancy|author2=Lauruhn, Michael |author3=Reynolds, Regina Romano |author4= Kaplan, Laurie |title=The Missing Link: The Evolving Current State of Linked Data for Serials|journal=The Serials Librarian|date=2 May 2014|volume=66|issue=1-4|pages=123–138|doi=10.1080/0361526X.2014.879690}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  BIBFRAME lacks several serials-related data fields available in MARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=kiegel|title=MARC 008 for continuing resources|url=https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe/issues/169|website=GitHub|accessdate=22 April 2015|ref=github165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report was very positive on BIBFRAME's suitability for describing audio and video resources.  However, the report also expressed some concern about the high-level ''Work'' entity, which is unsuitable for modeling certain audio resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Malssen |first1=Kara |title=BIBFRAME AV Modeling Study: Defining a Flexible Model for Description of Audiovisual Resources |url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/pdf/bibframe-avmodelingstudy-may15-2014.pdf |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=1 August 2014 |ref=van-malssen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810111936/http://www.loc.gov/bibframe/pdf/bibframe-avmodelingstudy-may15-2014.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
* Colorado College's Tutt Library has created several experimental apps using BIBFRAME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Jeremy|title=Building a Library App Portfolio with Redis and Django|journal=code4lib|date=2013|issue=19|url=http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7349|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 14 other research libraries are testing the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/implementation/register.html|title=BIBFRAME Implementation Register|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ExLibris published a roadmap to implement BIBFRAME in its library systems, which includes a MARC-to-BIBFRAME transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proquest.com/about/news/2017/Ex-Libris-Increases-Library-Connectivity-with-Implementation-BIBFRAME.html|title=Ex Libris Increases Library Connectivity with Implementation of BIBFRAME Roadmap |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews adjusted many of the entries to reflect LDS modifications of traditional Christian beliefs and also added a number of entries to address doctrines taught exclusively by the LDS Church. However, the majority of the content of the ''Bible Dictionary'' is identical to the Cambridge publication. The secretary of the committee was [[William James Mortimer]].

The LDS ''Bible Dictionary'' is published in all English-language versions of the Bible printed by the church except for of the barebones KJV Bible distributed free of charge by [[Mormon missionaries]]. In other LDS-printed Bibles, it is found on pages 599 to 793 of the appendix materials, immediately following the Topical Guide and immediately preceding excerpts from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]. The LDS Church provides the complete contents of the [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/ Bible Dictionary online].

Despite being packaged with the LDS publication of the Bible, the ''Bible Dictionary'' is not part of the LDS Church's [[Standard Works|open canon of scripture]]. Its preface states, "It is not intended as an official or revealed endorsement by the Church of the doctrinal, historical, cultural, and other matters set forth."&lt;ref name = preface/&gt;

[[File:Bischofsturm-hamburg2.JPG|thumb|The Bishop's Tower with café]]
The '''Bishop's Tower''' ({{lang-de|Bischofsturm}}), or '''Bishop's Castle''' (''{{lang|de|Bischofsburg}}''), is an [[archaeological site]] in the historic city center of [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], containing the oldest known remains of a stone building in the city. The site includes the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] of a circular [[tower]] and a [[water well|well]], originally believed to represent the 11th-century stone residence of [[Archbishop]] [[Adalbrand of Bremen|Adalbrand]] of [[Hamburg-Bremen|Bremen]]. Later finds, however, disproved this theory and it is now considered to be part of a 12th-century defensive structure.&lt;ref name="Trede"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trede | first = Beate | title = Der Bischofsturm | editors = Mitteilungen des Museums- und Heimatvereins Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.V., Helms-Museum | journal = Helms-Museum Aktuell | volume = 24 |date=December 2011 | pages = 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and significance ==
The tower's foundations lie under a commercial building at the corner of ''{{lang|de|Kreuslerstraße}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Speersort}}'' in the immediate vicinity of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]]. The area is a light [[geest]], where the first settlement of Hamburg has been documented. The base of the tower was discovered on 30 August 1962 during demolition work for the St. Peter's Community Center. Initially it was assumed that displaced [[boulder]]s from nearby ''{{lang|de|Steinstraße}}'' had been found, which is believed to be the oldest street of the city of Hamburg, and an ancient trade route. But after further excavation the remaining foundations of the tower were uncovered.

Until the 2008 excavations, it was thought to be the stone house of the Archbishop Adalbrand, built as a round tower and mentioned in the Hamburg church history of 1074 by [[Adam of Bremen]]. Further construction on St. Peter's Community Center enabled new studies of the historic area, leading to the discovery that the tower's foundation coincided with the creation of a [[moat]] to the west, located right in front of the ''{{lang|de|Heidenwall}}'', a timber soil [[palisade]] known as the first [[fortification]] of Hamburg. With this information the [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] was corrected to the 12th century. A possible interpretation is that the tower represents a side gate or a part of the [[city gate]].&lt;ref name="Trede"/&gt;

== The finds ==
The tower's foundation is a stone circle of boulders with an outer diameter of {{convert|19|m|ft}} and an inner diameter of {{convert|11|m|ft}}. The majority of these stones have a diameter of {{convert|1|m|ft}} or more. On the west side was a [[water well]] with a depth of {{convert|4|m|ft}}, a diameter of {{convert|4.4|m|ft}}, and was made of [[field stone]]s roughly {{convert|50|cm|in}} in diameter.

== The showroom ==
A showroom was built for the tower's foundations and other artifacts in early 1969 in the basement of the newly completed community center (and later commercial building). After demolition in 2008 for the construction of the {{lang|de|St. Petri-Hof}} building, the showroom was redesigned as a branch of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Hamburg Archaeological Museum]]. It is now freely accessible to visitors through a commercial bakery on the ground floor, which has also set up a café amidst the tower's foundations.&lt;ref name="Trede"/&gt;

'''DSLReports''' is a North American-oriented [[broadband]] information and review site based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/bonus/1101/consumer.htm | title = Service gripes can be tough to untangle | date= 8 November 2001 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''USA Today'' | author =Andrew Backover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's main focus is on [[internet]], [[phone]], [[cable TV]], [[fiber optics]], and [[wireless]] services in the United States and Canada, as well as other countries (United Kingdom and Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/ccarch/2001-05-07-komando.htm | title = A guide to Mother's Day on the Web | date= 11 March 2002 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''USA Today'' | author = Kim Komando }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/18/technology/18broadband.html?ex=1321506000&amp;en=588e1690532b1cc7&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | title = Not Always Full Speed Ahead | date= 18 November 2006 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The New York Times | author = MATT RICHTEL and KEN BELSON }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== "Broadband Reports" ===

In the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], DSLReports was concurrently branded as "BroadbandReports.com," a domain that now redirects to dslreports.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/journal-gets-it-wrong-net_b_151076.html | title = 
WSJ Gets It Wrong: Net Neutrality Still in the Front Seat | date= 15 December 2008| accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''Huffington Post'' | author = Timothy Karr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1555416,00.asp | title = Top 100 Classics | date= 20 April 2004 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''PC Magazine'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 SQL Injection attack ===

Over a four-hour period on April 27, 2011 an automated [[SQL Injection]] attack occurred on the DSLReports website. The attack was able to extract 8% of the site's username/password pairs, which amounted to approximately 8,000 of the 9,000 active accounts and 90,000 old or inactive accounts created during the site's 10-year history.&lt;ref name="Cnet News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20058471-245.html|title=DSLReports says member information stolen|publisher= ''Cnet News'' |date=2011-04-28|accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Tech Herald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201117/7127/DSLReports-com-breach-exposed-more-than-100-000-accounts|title=DSLReports.com breach exposed more than 100,000 accounts|publisher=''The Tech Herald''|date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2011-04-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430234009/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201117/7127/DSLReports-com-breach-exposed-more-than-100-000-accounts|archivedate=2011-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the intrusion was detected, stopped and the extent of the compromised accounts had been assessed, passwords for those accounts were automatically reset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2011/04/29/dsl-reports-intrusion-compromises-over-9000-accounts/ | title = DSL Reports intrusion compromises over 9000 accounts | date= 9 April 2011 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''Helpnet Security'' | author = Zeljka Zorz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

DSLReports rates and reviews cable, DSL and fiber optic internet services from providers all over North America. The site also runs support and discussion forums and offers online tools for testing internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/technology/01askk.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | title = Staying Updated On Security | date= 1 February 2007 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The New York Times | author = J. D. BIERSDORFER }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reviews ===

DSLReports allows its users to submit reviews of their [[Internet service provider]] (ISP), Web hosting service, digital phone service (VOIP), and more.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dslreports.com/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt; Users may also read reviews written by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010902&amp;slug=ptmrsh02 | title = DSL could solve your domain name woes | date= 1 September 2001 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''Seattle Times'' | author = Patrick Marhsall }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many large ISPs have over a thousand reviews on the site. Reviews may be filtered for the user's location and/or connectivity preference.

=== News ===

The site is a source of [[internet]] related news and opinion, and occasionally breaks stories about broadband internet service providers, such as [[Time Warner Cable]]'s 2008 decision to test consumption-based billing with subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/timewarner-internet-idUSN1721882120080117 | title = RPT-Time Warner to test Internet billing based on usage | date= 17 January 2008 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''Reuters'' | author = Yinka Adegoke }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, when [[Charter Communications]] began sending letters to high-speed internet customers regarding a new website tracking policy, reports of the letters first appeared on DSLReports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/charter-will-monitor-customers-web-surfing-to-target-ads/ | title = Charter Will Monitor Customers’ Web Surfing to Target Ads | date= 14 May 2008 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The New York Times | author = Saul Hansell }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSLReport's editors post Internet-related news and opinion items on the site's front page throughout the day. Common topics of news items and features include [[wireless]] technologies, [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing, upgrades and new offerings from ISPs, legal issues, regulatory issues, and security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/12/05/DI2008120501026.html | title = Security Fix Live | date= 5 December 2008 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The Washington Post | author = Brian Krebbs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tools ===

DSLReports is reported to have the most comprehensive package of internet and connection testing tools available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083000543.html | title = Tools for Geeks | date= 30 August 2006 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The Washington Post | author = Steve Bass }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Speed tests ====

The DSLReports speed test claims to be the best speed test and the first popular speed test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speed test - how fast is your internet? {{!}} DSLReports, ISP Information|url = https://www.dslreports.com/speedtest|website = DSL Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed test uses HTML5.

==== Ping tests ====

DSLReports does have a ping and jitter test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ping test - how good is your internet? {{!}} DSLReports, ISP Information|url = https://www.dslreports.com/tools/pingtest/|website = DSL Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other tests and tools ====

Other tools include stream tests, line monitoring, tweak testing, packet loss testing, and many other tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speed tests, ping tests and bandwidth tools {{!}} DSLReports, ISP Information|url = https://www.dslreports.com/tools|website = DSL Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/technology/personaltech/21basics.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = How to Travel at a Million Files a Minute | date= 20 August 2008 | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | work = The New York Times | author = AZADEH ENSHA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thenakedpc.com/articles/v03/08/0308-02.html | title = DSL: Improve Your Speed, Part 3 - The Naked PC Newsletter (#3.08) | accessdate = 3 February 2017 | publisher = ''TNPC News'' | author = Lee Hudspeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these services are provided free of charge, but others require the user to purchase "tool points", which are approximately $1.

==Community==

DSLReports operates over 200 forums, many of which focus on Internet and computer-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISP discussion forums {{!}} DSLReports, ISP Information|url = https://www.dslreports.com/forums/all/|website = DSL Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forums are dedicated to general conversation, political discussions, do-it-yourself projects or regional discussions. There are over a 1.8 million total registered users on the DSLReports forums.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dslreports.com/who/&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion forum is automatically created for every news and opinion article posted on the front page, which allows members to discuss the article in question. Although membership is free, the forum community allows for anonymous posting so the information or source in [anonymous] posts may be questionable as compared to posts made by actual frequent members of the site.

'''Domen''' is a [[mountain]] on the [[Varanger Peninsula]] in eastern [[Finnmark]] county, [[Norway]]. The {{convert|164|m|adj=on}} tall mountain is located near the coast between the small [[fishing village]] [[Kiberg]] and the island of [[Vardøya]]. Domen is bare and flat-topped, with a steep slope towards the [[Barents Sea]] below.  The [[European route E75]] highway which runs along the western side of the mountain from [[Svartnes]] to [[Kiberg]].  The road is often closed in the winter due to bad weather.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Domen|title=Domen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The [[Old Norse]] name of the [[Arctic Sea]] was ''Dumbshaf''. This sea (''haf'') was named after the mountain ''Dumbr'' (an old form of ''Domen''). The name is probably related to the English word ''dumb'', but in what meaning is unclear.

==History and folklore==
Domen is often associated with the [[witch trials]] in Finnmark during the 17th century. Vardø was the site of approximately 70 witch trials between 1601 and 1663. This was a large number, since there were only a couple of hundred inhabitants in the area at that time.

According to folklore, Vardø and Domen became infamous as ''the end of the world'', [[Ultima Thule]] and the entrance to [[Hell]] was said to be somewhere around Domen or Vardø, and so witches flew to Domen to meet the devil for [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Alm|first=Ellen Janette|title=Statens rolle i trolldomsprosessene i Danmark og Norge på 1500- og 1600-tallet|type=Thesis|publisher=University of Tromso|year=2000|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Willumsen|first=Liv Helene|title=Seventeenth-Century Witchcraft Trials in Scotland and Northern Norway|type=Thesis|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles Pudlowski''' (born 15 November 1950 in [[Metz]], [[Moselle]]) is a French journalist, writer, literary and gastronomic critic. He writes the blog ''[http://www.gillespudlowski.com/ les Pieds dans le Plat]'', writes for ''Saveurs'', ''Cuisine et Vins de France'' and ''[[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]]''. He is also the author of the Pudlo guides.

== Biography ==
Gilles Pudlowski is a writer and journalist, both a gastronomic and literary critic. He publishes the blog: [http://www.gillespudlowski.com/ les Pieds dans le Plat]. 

After graduating from the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudoc.fr/076437795.&lt;/ref&gt; and a history degree, he made his debut at ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'' founded by {{ill|Philippe Tesson|fr}} before joining ''[[Les Nouvelles littéraires]]''. [[Jean-François Kahn]], who took up the latter magazine, entrusted him with responsibility for the literary pages and asked him to take charge also of the [[gastronomic]] chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xfo54y_souriez-vous-eytes-informeys-jean-francois-kahn_news&amp;start=2495 Interview] of [[Jean-François Kahn]], in ''Souriez, vous êtes informés'', on [[France Inter]], 17 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Millau]], who spotted him in 1979, offered him to collaborate with the [[Gault Millau]], promising him a career of rigorous criticism in these terms: "In this job, people know how to eat or write, rarely both, sometimes none of the two. If you can do both, you're sure to succeed".

He latter wrote for ''[[Paris Match]]'', ''Cuisine et Vins de France'', (where he created the category of "plates", awarding one to three plates to good restaurants, the pot with good quality / price ratio and the broken plate, which will make much of his reputation as "the Zorro of the critique" at the disappointing tables). He has worked with ''Panorama du Médecin'', ''Parcours'', ''Le Figaro'', Cuisine TV, [[France Inter]], ''Bon Voyage'', ''Air France Madame''.

[[File:Gilles Pudlowski.JPG|thumb|left|Gilles Pudlowski in 2014.]]
His reputation is notably linked to the weekly ''[[Le Point]]'', of which he was the official columnist from 1986 to 2014. He was a senior reporter and was responsible for the pages of tourism and gastronomy, while actively collaborating on the literary section.

From 1990 to 2016, Gilles Pudlowski gave a weekly column to ''[[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]]'' and, from 1992 to 2015, to ''[[Le Républicain lorrain]]'', for, if he is Lorrain by birth, he is an Alsatian at heart.

For the magazines ''Saveurs et Cuisine et Vins de France'', he made major reports on the regions of France and portraits of the chefs in Europe and in the world. He also contributed to the magazine ''Service Littéraire'' of {{ill|François Cérésa|fr}}. Since 2016, he has been a member of the j[http://www.livreshebdo.fr/article/les-15-titres-retenus-pour-le-prix-premier-roman-2016 ury du prix du premier roman]. 

After a few piecemeal trials (including several editions of ''52 week-ends autour de Paris'' or ''le Guide de l’Alsace heureuse'', he created, in 1989, his own "global" guide. It is first of all the Pudlowski Guide of the Gourmet Cities ([[Albin Michel]]) which obtained the Gutenberg of the practical book in 1990. The ''Pudlo Paris'' is published every year from 1990, like the ''Pudlo France'', since 2000, by Michel Lafon.

Gilles Pudlowski has also published "Pudlos" in pocket format devoted to Parisian bistros, Brittany, Alsace, Lorraine, Corsica and Luxembourg. Since 2007, the "Pudlo Paris" and the "Pudlo France" have been published in New York by the Little Book Room, editorial emanation of [[The New York Review of Books]], which also published (in 2008) small Pudlos "Britanny-Normandy", "Alsace" and "Provence Côte d'Azur". The US press sees it as the "best kept secret of French gourmets" and in particular, like the New York Times, that "his plates are more reliable than Michelin stars".

As a confirmed writer, Gilles Pudlowski published autobiographical essays on the theme of attachment to France, such as ''Devoir de Français'', ''L’Amour du pays'' ([[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]]), crowned by the [[Prix Jacques Chardonne]] and the [[Prix Maurice Genevoix]], but also ''Les Chemins de la Douce France'' ([[Plon (publisher)|Plon]]) as well as a novel, ''Le Voyage de Clémence'' (Flammarion, 1987) and ''Le Dictionnaire amoureux de l'Alsace'' (Plon).

He is also responsible for the preface of the Larousse gastronomique (2007), literary anthologies (''L'Année Poétique'', ''Le Goût de Strasbourg''),art books (''Les Grandes gueules'', ''Elles sont chefs'', ''Les Trésors gourmands de la France'', ''France Bistrots'', ''Les Plus belles tables de France''), As well as a handbook of good manners: ''Comment être critique gastronomique et garder la ligne'', which he will update a few years later with ''À quoi sert vraiment un critique gastronomique'', which became the reference work on this domain.

Pudlowski won the prize La Mazille for lifetime achievement at the gourmet festival [[Périgueux]] in 1992 and the price Amunátegui - [[Curnonsky]], awarded by the {{ill|Association professionnelle des chroniqueurs et informateurs de la gastronomie et du vin|fr}} (Professional Association of chroniclers and informants Gastronomy and wine]), in December 2008.

Pudlowski was awarded the second ''Prix des Écrivains gastronomes'' on 7 March 2015 for ''Le Tour de France Gourmand'' at {{ill|Éditions du Chêne|fr}}.

His blog ''Les Pieds dans le plat'', obtained ''La Gastronomie Numérique'' award at "Gastronomades 2015".

'''Google Base'''  was a [[database]] provided by [[Google]] into which any user can add almost any type of content, such as text, images, and structured information in formats such as [[XML]],  [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], or [[WordPerfect]].  As of September 2010, the product has since been downgraded to [[Google Merchant Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlebase.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-google-merchant-center.html|title=Introducing the Google Merchant Center|author=|date=|website=googlebase.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Google finds it relevant, submitted content may appear on [[Google Product Search|its shopping search engine]], [[Google Maps]] or even the web search. The piece of content can then be labeled with attributes like the ingredients for a recipe or the camera model for [[stock photography]]. Because information about the service was leaked before public release, it generated much interest in the [[information technology]] community prior to release. Google subsequently responded on their blog with an [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/rumor-of-day.html official statement]:

:"You may have seen stories today reporting on a new product that we're testing, and speculating about our plans. Here's what's really going on. We are testing a new way for content owners to submit their content to Google, which we hope will complement existing methods such as our web crawl and Google [[Sitemaps]]. We think it's an exciting product, and we'll let you know when there's more news."

Files can be uploaded to the Google Base servers by browsing your computer or the web, by various [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] methods, or by [[Application programming interface|API]] coding. Online tools are provided to view the number of downloads of the user's files, and other performance measures.

On December 17, 2010, it was announced that Google Base's API is deprecated in favor of a set of new APIs known as Google Shopping APIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlemerchantblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/new-shopping-apis-and-deprecation-of.html|title=New Shopping APIs and Deprecation of the Base API|author=|date=|website=googlemerchantblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''''' refers to two different revisions of a Bible encyclopedia. The first version was published under the general editorship of the [[fundamentalist]] [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr (1844–1913)]], among other objectives to counteract the impact of [[higher criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;'' The religious bodies of America'' Frederick Emanuel Mayer, Arthur Carl Piepkorn – 1961 "5 ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' was published under the general editorship of James Orr (Chicago: Howard-Severance Co., 1915) to counteract the impact of higher criticism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The original encyclopedia was published by the Howard-Severance Co., Chicago, in 1915. It is in the public domain and can be found freely available at various sites. A revised version, edited by [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]], was published by [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] in 1989. It contains articles by nearly 200 [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholars about [[archaeological]] discoveries, the language and literature of Bible lands, customs, family life, occupations, and the historical and religious environments of Bible people.

== Reception ==
Writing in a 1984 book review for ''[[Churchman (journal)|The Churchman]]'', Stephen Motyer said the conservatism of the ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' "is that of broad, main-line [[evangelicalism]], although it seems to be slightly more conservative than the work it replaces". He also says it makes "dogmatic use of the Bible", and adds: "sometimes it seems to go over the top somewhat". However, he concludes "The criticisms I have made do not, to my mind, qualify the great solid worth of this production....I...seriously commend this encyclopedia..."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Motyer, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/churchman/098-01_062.pdf Book Reviews – ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributors ==
This list of contributors is taken from the Revised Edition. An asterisk (*) indicates that the person contributed an article to the 1915 edition that is still in the Revised Edition. New articles far outnumber older revised articles in the revised version. For some reason many contributors are listed more than once in the revised version. It is likely that the multiple listings is because of the scholar being at different institutions during the long process of revision. A scholar may have been employed at one school when they submitted one article in the beginning of the revision process and by the end they were employed at another school when they submitted their last article. The subject of the revision process and the rationale for retaining and updating some articles from the 1915 version is discussed in the preface and introduction of the revised version.

''[[Kemp v Santam Insurance Co Ltd and Another]]''&lt;ref&gt;1975 (2) SA 329 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in the [[South African law of delict]]. It was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by Diemont J on 5 and 6 November, and 11 to 13 December 1974. Judgment was handed down on 12 February 1975. The plaintiff was represented by LA Rose-Innes, SC, and with him IG Farlam. His attorneys were Silberbauers. The defendant was represented by GD Griessel, and his attorneys were Jan S. de Villiers &amp; Sons. Attorneys for the third party to the case were Truter &amp; Lombard, and they were represented by Edwin A. Kellaway.

The case concerned an action for damages. Diemont J determined that, if part of the mechanism or the equipment or the accessories to a motor vehicle become detached while the vehicle is being driven and cause injury to a third party, the injury "arises out of" the driving of the vehicle, within the meaning of that phrase in section 11(1) of the [[Motor Vehicle Insurance Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Act 29 of 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Labour Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Laborista}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Argentina]].

==History==
The party was founded by [[Peronist]] [[trade union]] leaders at the end of October 1945. The party organization was built up around the Peronist unions, and most of its representatives in different elected offices had been recruited from the ranks of the trade union movements. The party was led by an Organizing Committee with 52 members. The party had little structure of its own, and its popularity was mainly dependent on being identified with [[Juan Perón]].&lt;ref name="fioc1"/&gt; Luis Gay, of the telephone workers union, was the general secretary of the party. Another prominent trade union leader taking part in the founding of the party was Cipriano Reyes (a leader of the meat-packers union). Reyes became vice president of the party. The party published ''El Laborista''.&lt;ref&gt;James, Daniel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNuL7-qGUC Resistance and Integration: Peronism and the Argentine Working Class, 1946-1976]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. pp. 17, 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="per"&gt;Mcguire, James W. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MfY60uIwKP8C Peronism Without Peron: Unions, Parties, and Democracy in Argentina]''. Stanford: Stanford Univ Press, 1999. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Robert Jackson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCc4QThKRSMC A History of Organized Labor in Argentina]''. Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few months before the founding of the party, the [[British Labour Party]] had won a resounding election victory. The Argentinian party name was borrowed from the British party, and the Argentinian party organization was modelled after its British counterpart (with unions as an integral party organization).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Robert Jackson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCc4QThKRSMC A History of Organized Labor in Argentina]''. Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003. pp. 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The presidential and parliamentary elections held in February 1946 resulted in a major success for the Labour Party. The party was responsible for mobilizing most of the votes for Juan Perón. It also gained a majority in both chambers of parliament. The party maintained a stance of critical support to the government of Perón. The party called for [[nationalization]]s, [[social welfare]], [[women's suffrage]] and [[land reform]].&lt;ref name="fioc1"&gt;Bergquist, Charles W. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LT6rAAAAIAAJ Labor in Latin America: Comparative Essays on Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1986. pp. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="per"/&gt; Moreover, the party criticized limitations on the [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref name="sab"/&gt; Perón kept a certain distance from the Labour Party, favouring Radicals and dissident conservatives for the most important positions.&lt;ref name="bui"&gt;Mainwaring, Scott, and Timothy Scully. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PeeeAAAAIAAJ Building Democratic Institutions: Party Systems in Latin America]''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1995. pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1946 Perón ordered that the three parties that had supported his candidacy be dissolved into a unity party, ''Partido Único de la Revolución''. The ''laboristas'' initially rejected the idea of a merger into the unity party (which in 1947 was renamed  the [[Peronist Party]]).&lt;ref name="bui"/&gt; However, in July 1947 it decided to dissolve itself and called on its members to join the Peronist Party as its 'labour nucleus'.&lt;ref name="sab"&gt;Tcach Abad, César.

Buenos Aires: Editorial Biblos, 2006. pp. 109-110 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Labour Party had been disbanded, its former leaders (such as Reyes) suffered from government repression.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie, and Ian Roxborough.

The following is a list of the highest-grossing [[live-action/animated film]]s, films that combine live action and [[animation]] characters. [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] characters are not counted as animation if the film tries to make them look real. Otherwise a large part of modern films with non-human characters would be included.

==Highest-grossing live-action/animated films==

All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 1980, and films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.

2006, 2010, 2011, and 2016 are the most represented years on the list, with four films each.

Lesko received his undergraduate degree from [[Marquette University]] in Milwaukee, then went to Vietnam as a navigator for the [[U.S. Navy]]. When Lesko returned he earned a master's degree in [[business administration]] ([[MBA]]) from [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.

In 1975, Lesko quit his job designing computerized information systems and co-founded Washington Researchers with his then-wife Leila K. Kight.&lt;ref name=Kernan1979-3-20&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/147018445|title=The Facts Fanciers... From Cocoa Beans to Clothespins|last=Kernan|first=Michael|date=20 March 1979|work=The Washington Post|access-date=6 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a slow start, Lesko hit upon the idea of sending out a professional newsletter telling people how to get free information. The newsletter started bringing in clients, and by 1979 Washington Researchers employed 30 people in its Washington, D.C. office.&lt;ref name=Kernan1979-3-20 /&gt;

As  side lines of business, Lesko began publishing directories for those who preferred to do their own research, such as the ''Researcher's Guide to Washington'', and conducting seminars on the types of information then available from the government.&lt;ref name=Kernan1979-3-20 /&gt;

Lesko was able to interest publisher [[Viking Press|Viking]] in his idea to publish a directory of government information sources in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media Fast Track|date=13 January 1980|work=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; That book, ''Getting Yours: The Complete Guide to Government Money'', was published by Viking's Penguin subsidiary in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/147447111|title=Media Fast Track|last=|first=|date=25 April 1982|work=The Washington Post|access-date=6 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims to have researched government grants for over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesko lives in [[Kensington, Maryland|Kensington]], Maryland, with his third wife [[Wendy Schaetzel Lesko]] and their two sons, Max and Morgan.

==Criticism==
Critics claim that Lesko is misleading in his advertisements. A 2004 report by the [[New York State Consumer Protection Board]] claimed that most of the grants mentioned in Lesko's books were actually public assistance programs that many people were not eligible for, and that Lesko misrepresented examples of people who had taken advantage of government programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2004 |url=http://www.consumer.state.ny.us/pdf/misleading_grant_guides.pdf |title=How misleading advertising is feeding a nationwide boom in government grant scams |format=PDF |publisher=New York State Consumer Protection Board |accessdate=2006-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207041420/http://www.consumer.state.ny.us/pdf/misleading_grant_guides.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' criticized him for having implied a current association with the paper long after ending a 1992–1994 ''NYT'' column.&lt;ref name="nyt-free-money"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph P. |last=Fred |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/nyregion/13lesko.html?ex=1265950800&amp;en=e0c158bc33ea5e70&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland |title=Free Money? Sure. Heard of Food Stamps? |work=The New York Times |date=3 March 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-22}} "In August 2006, Lesko modified his credentials on his Web site, lesko.com, which described him (as his books did) as a columnist for ''[[Good Housekeeping Magazine]]'' and ''The New York Times'' Syndicate. He wrote the magazine column in the 1980s and the column for the syndicate from 1992 to 1994. Both organizations recently told him that these did not justify his suggestion of a current association."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Lesko was named #99 in [[Bernard Goldberg]]'s book ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]'' because, "He is a symbol for self-centered free-riders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophistry.com/specials/100-people.html|publisher=Philosophy History|title=Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America? And Why?|first=Philip |last=Dhingra|date=8 Aug 2005|quote=He is a symbol for self-centered free-riders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''Washington Post'' in July 2007, Lesko admitted having assembled his books from government guides to grants and loans: "His business model is simple: 'I get stuff for free and I sell it for as much as I can get.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Carlson|date=15 July 2007|title=Marked Man
|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/14/AR2007071401118_2.html?hpid=artslot%E2%8A%82=AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the season four episode of ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' titled "[[The Better Man]]", [[Jefferson Twilight]] trains with cardboard cut-outs of various villains. When one of the cut-outs turns out to be Matthew Lesko, Jefferson explains that he mistook Lesko for a villain "he was wearing punctuation on his suit", like that worn by [[Batman]] villain [[Riddler]].  The Alchemist contends that he "helps people get free money from the government" and therefore is a good guy.
* In the season two episode of ''[[Drawn Together]]'' titled "[[Little Orphan Hero]]", The question mark suit that Spanky Ham wears in the TV commercial is a reference to Lesko.
* Comedian [[Andy Dick]] parodied Lesko on his short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy program ''[[The Andy Dick Show]]''.
* In [[Scrubs (season 6)|season 6]], episode 21 ("My Rabbit") of the television series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', Dr. Cox refers to Lesko in a rant: "Pregnant women are among a select group of people who are actually allowed to act insane, much like sports [[mascot]]s, local weathermen, [[theme park]] performers and that guy with the question mark jacket who teaches people how to get free money from the government."
* In [[MAD (magazine)|''MAD'']] Classic #45, Lesko is placed second on the 50 Worst Things About Advertising.
* Lesko appeared as himself in advertisements for the album ''[[Danger Doom]]''.

'''Microsoft Academic''' is a free public [[web search engine]] for [[Academic publishing|academic publication]]s and literature, developed by [[Microsoft Research]]. Re-launched in 2016, the tool features an entirely new data structure and search engine using [[semantic search]] technologies. It currently indexes over 375 million entities,&lt;ref name="MicrosoftAcademic"&gt;[https://academic.microsoft.com/ Microsoft Academic]&lt;/ref&gt; 170 million of which are academic papers.&lt;ref name="MicrosoftAcademic"/&gt; The Academic Knowledge API offers information retrieval from the underlying database using REST endpoints for advanced research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Microsoft|title=Academic Knowledge API|url=https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/academic-knowledge-api|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service replaces the earlier Microsoft research project, [[Microsoft Academic Search]], which ended development in 2012.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/05/the-decline-and-fall-of-microsoft-academic-search.html | title=The decline and fall of Microsoft Academic Search | website=blogs.nature.com | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date=20 May 2014 | first=Richard | last=Van Noorden | accessdate=22 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary reviews by bibliometricians suggest the new Microsoft Academic Search is a competitor to [[Google Scholar]], [[Web of Science]], and [[Scopus]] for academic research purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harzing|first1=Anne-Wil|title=Microsoft Academic (Search):  a Phoenix arisen from the ashes?|journal=Scientometrics|url=http://www.harzing.com/download/mas.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hug|first1=Sven E.|last2=Braendle|first2=Martin P.|title=The coverage of Microsoft Academic: Analyzing the publication output of a university|journal=Scientometrics|volume=113|pages=1551|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2535-3|arxiv=1703.05539|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as citation analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harzing|first1=Anne-Wil|last2=Alakangas|first2=Satu|title=Microsoft Academic:  is the Phoenix  getting wings ?|journal=Scientometrics|url=http://www.harzing.com/download/mas2.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hug|first1=Sven E.|last2=Ochsner|first2=Michael|last3=Braendle|first3=Martin P.|title=Citation analysis with Microsoft Academic|journal=Scientometrics|volume=111|pages=371|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2247-8|arxiv=1609.05354|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haunschild|first1=Robin|last2=Hug|first2=Sven E.|last3=Braendle|first3=Martin P.|last4=Bornmann|first4=Lutz|title=The number of linked references of publications in Microsoft Academic in comparison with the Web of Science|journal=Scientometrics|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2567-8|arxiv=1710.04031|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''National Film Archive of Japan'''|国立映画アーカイブ|Kokuritsu Eiga Ākaibu}} is an [[independent administrative institution]] and one of Japan's six national museums of art, which specializes in preserving and exhibiting the film heritage of Japan. In its previous incarnation, it was the National Film Center, which was part of the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]]. In April 2018, it became independent of the National Museum of Modern Art and was officially elevated to the rank of a national museum.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|title=６館目の国立美術館 国立映画アーカイブがきょう誕生|url=http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/entertainment/news/CK2018040102000148.html|website=東京新聞 TOKYO Web|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding of National Film Archive of Japan in April, 2018 {{!}} The National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.|url=http://www.momat.go.jp/english/ge/topics/founding-of-national-film-archive-of-japan-in-april-2018/|publisher=The National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFAJ is located in [[Kyōbashi, Tokyo]], and is Japan's only public institution devoted to cinema, holding about 40,000 films, and numerous other materials, in its collection. The Archive has film-related materials on permanent display; and it holds special screenings in its theaters. The NFAJ is a member of [[The International Federation of Film Archives]]. It preserves many important works of Japanese and world film history, including films designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]] like ''[[Momijigari (film)|Momijigari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hakkutsu sareta eigatachi 2009|url=http://www.momat.go.jp/FC/NFC_Calendar/2009-5A/kaisetsu.html|publisher=National Film Center, National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo|accessdate=10 December 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

[[File:Anime cell 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from the oldest existing example of a Japanese animated film originally made for the cinema -- ''Namakura-gatana'' (1917). This unique 2-minute film was restored and initially screened for the public in 2008.]]
The NFAJ restored a Japanese animated film which had been first released in 1917—the oldest existing example of a Japanese animated film originally made for the cinema. The film, [[Namakura Gatana|"The Blunt Samurai Sword"]] (''Namakura-gatana'') is the first work of [[Jun'ichi Kōuchi]], one of the founders of Japanese animated film.&lt;ref name="anime1917"&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080328TDY03102.htm "Old anime discovered, restored,"] ''Daily Yomiuri Online.'' March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A rare surviving print was unexpectedly discovered in an antique market in Osaka. In the silent comedy, the animation tells the story of a samurai warrior who is tricked into buying a dull-edged sword. He tries to attack passers-by in an effort to test the sword's quality, but lower-class townspeople fight back and knock him down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imprinttalk.com/?p=1557 "Japan’s oldest animation films,"] ''ImprintTALK.'' March 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The animated story lasts just two minutes. Although the ultimate status of the film remains uncertain, it was screened by NFC for the public in late April 2008. With the involvement of the NFAJ, the animated film became something more than an historical artifact—it also became an illustration of the progress film restoration has made over recent decades.&lt;ref name="anime1917"/&gt;

The National Film Archive collection includes original movie scripts (such as [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s [[Rashomon]], [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s [[Tokyo Story]] and [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s [[Osaka Elegy]]), original movie posters - [[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]], [[Rashomon]], [[Tokyo Story]], [[The Life of Oharu]] etc. - photos shot on the set, movie cameras and actors and actresses' personal effects (such as [[Kinuyo Tanaka]]'s).

==Location==

The NFAJ's Tokyo headquarters in the Kyōbashi building is a one-minute walk from [[Kyōbashi Station (Tokyo)|Kyōbashi Station]] (Station G-10) on the [[Tokyo Metro Ginza Line]]. It is also a one-minute walk from [[Takarachō Station (Tokyo)|Takarachō Station]] (Station A-12) on the [[Toei Asakusa Line]].[http://www.momat.go.jp/english/map_info.html] An NFAJ branch is located in the city of [[Sagamihara, Kanagawa|Sagamihara]] in neighboring [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].

The '''Nike of Callimachus''' ({{lang-el|Nίκη του Καλλιμάχου}}) also known as ''The Dedication of Callimachus'', is a statue that the Athenians created in honor of the [[Callimachus (polemarch)|Callimachus]].

== History ==

Callimachus was the Athenian [[polemarch]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]] at 490 BC. He had the last vote and voted in favour of a battle, when the 10 [[strategoi]] were split evenly on the matter.

He was killed at the battle and the Athenians erected the statue for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh6110.htm Herodotus Book 6: Erato, 114] "In this part of the work was slain the polemarch Callimachos after having proved himself a good man,..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was erected in a prominent spot near the northwest corner of the Parthenon (not the [[Parthenon]] that we can see today, but the [[Older Parthenon|previous temple]] which was destroyed by the Persians) on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. The statue was severely damaged by the [[Persian people|Persians]] a decade later (480 BC) when they conquered [[Athens]]. They burned and destroyed the city and its monuments, including the Nike of Callimachus ([[Perserschutt]]).

== Statue ==
[[File:EPMA-6339-IGI(2)609-Kallimachos dedication-1.JPG|thumb|Part of the inscribed column before the restoration when it was on display at the [[Epigraphical Museum]]]]

The statue depicts [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (Victory), in the form of a draped woman with wings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Hornblower | first1= Simon| last2=  Spawforth| first2= Antony| last3=  Eidinow| first3= Esther| title= The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization (Oxford Companions)| url= | publisher= OUP Oxford|date=2014| page= 546|isbn= 978-0198706779}}"She may have two or four wings.

Some parts of the statue such as the head, the hands and more were never recovered after the damage.

The neck of the Nike has nine holes for metal jewelry, which has been lost. She probably held a [[caduceus]] in her hand.

== Inscription ==

The text of the inscription on the monument was carved in two lines.&lt;ref name="Archaic and Classical Greek Epigram 101"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keesling|first1=Catharine|editor1-last=Baumbach|editor1-first=Manuel|editor2-last=Petrovic|editor2-first=Andrej|editor3-last=Petrovic|editor3-first=Ivana|title=Archaic and Classical Greek Epigram|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521118057|page=101|chapter=The Callimachus monument on the Athenian Acropolis (CEG 256) and Athenian Commemoration of the Persian Wars}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is a rare example of a preserved dedicatory [[epigram]], with its statue and base, from the late [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]].

Only 35% of the original text is visible due to the destruction.&lt;ref name="enet.gr"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=160944| title= Η Νίκη του Καλλίμαχου θα ξαναπετάξει στο Μουσείο της Ακρόπολης|date= 2010| website= http://www.enet.gr/| publisher= eleftherotypia| access-date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==

On October 26, 2010 after it was restored, it was displayed to the public for the first time as a complete monument at the [[Acropolis Museum]]. The statue has been affixed to a metal column that holds the various parts in place and is built so that additional fragments can be attached if they are found. According to the curator of the new Acropolis Museum, the monument has been reconstructed in a modern fashion using only the original shards in their correct positions, so that a visitor might be able to see the authentic version.

The unveiling of the Nike monument was among a series of events scheduled by the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Greece)|culture and tourism ministry of Greece]] to celebrate the 2,500th anniversary of the Battle of Marathon.
During the unveiling of the statue the Greek minister stressed:

“Today we are not unveiling the monument of just another heroic general but a monument to a democratic process that changed the course of history."&lt;ref name="Kathimerini"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kathimerini.gr/409072/article/politismos/arxeio-politismoy/h-nikh-toy-kallimaxoy-apokalyptetai-25-aiwnes-meta| title = Η Νίκη του Καλλιμάχου αποκαλύπτεται 25 αιώνες μετά| year=2010| language = Greek| website= http://www.kathimerini.gr/| publisher= Kathimerini| access-date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also reminded the audience of the words that [[Miltiades]] said to Callimachus just before the polemarch cast his vote:

“Everything now rests on you.”&lt;ref name="Kathimerini"/&gt;

The statue is on display in the Archaic Monuments’ section of the [[Acropolis Museum]]. In the Museum in front of the original statue there is also a small copy showing how the statue looked when it was whole and undamaged.&lt;ref name=greekreporter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.diathens.gr/files/b/7/51/NEWSLETTER_NOVEMBER_2010.pdf| title = NEWSLETTER NOVEMBER 2010| last=| first=| date=| website= http://www.diathens.com/| publisher= Det Danske Instituti Athens| access-date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operating system advocacy''' is the practice of attempting to increase the awareness and improve the perception of a [[computer]] [[operating system]]. The motivation behind this may be to increase the number of users of a system, to assert the superiority of one choice over another or out of [[brand loyalty]], pride in an operating system's abilities, or, with open source operating systems, political or philosophical reasons, or to persuade software vendors to [[porting|port]] specific applications or device drivers to the platform.

Operating system advocacy can vary widely in tone and form, from seriously studied and researched comparisons to [[Flaming (Internet)|heated debates]] on [[mailing list]]s and other [[Internet forum|forums]]. Advocates are often normal users who devote their spare time to advocacy of their operating system of choice. Many have a deep and abiding interest in the use, design and construction of operating systems and an emotional investment in their favourite operating system.

Operating system advocacy can be compared to advocacy in other fields, particularly [[browser wars|browser]], [[editor war]]s, [[programming language]]s and [[video game console]]s, as well as the "Ford vs. Chevy" and similar debates in [[car culture]].

==Usenet and other advocacy forums==
Due to the often emotional nature of advocacy debate and its sometimes narrow appeal to the wider user population, forums for discussion of advocacy are often separate from those for general discussion. Under the [[Usenet]] ''comp.os.*'' and ''comp.sys.*'' hierarchy, there are often ''*.advocacy'' groups devoted exclusively to advocating their respective operating systems. Some of these groups, such as ''comp.sys.amiga.advocacy'', can remain active even after their subject OS ceases to be a market force. The ''Guide to the Windows newsgroups'' exhorts Usenet posters not to "get involved in arguments about Windows vs. OS/2 vs. Macintosh vs. NeXTSTEP ''except'' in the comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.saigon.com/cbmsw/wnewsfaq.html | title= Guide to the Windows newsgroups |author1 = Tom Haapanen |author2 =Sean Graham | work= | accessdate = 2005-09-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024083232/http://www.saigon.com/cbmsw/wnewsfaq.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating system advocacy discussions, on Usenet and elsewhere, have spawned a variety of [[jargon]] describing commonly seen behaviour, including "MicroDroid"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MicroDroid.html MicroDroid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Amiga Persecution Complex".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html Amiga Persecution Complex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional form and negative characteristics often associated with operating system advocacy have led some to create guidelines explaining what they consider to be positive advocacy, such as the ''Linux Advocacy Guidelines''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue14/advocate.html Linux Gazette, issue 14 (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Guidelines for Effective OS/2 Advocacy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.os2bbs.com/file_d/text/PSM951.HTM Guidelines for Effective OS/2 Advocacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy and specific operating systems==
&lt;!-- Alphabetical order --&gt;

===FreeBSD===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
[[FreeBSD]] is served by a [[mailing list]] specifically for advocacy discussion. Advocacy-related materials and links are provided on the [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD website], including a page of [[logo]]s.

===Linux===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
As there are a large number of [[Linux distribution]]s, there are many organizations involved in [[Linux]] advocacy, including companies directly involved in the development of distributions as well as purely advocacy-based groups, such as [[SEUL]]. Promotion takes on a wide variety of forms from [[Tux (mascot)|Tux]] [[Stuffed toy|plush toys]] to [[t-shirt]]s and [[poster]]s, and even to more unorthodox forms, such as body paints and video games.

===Macintosh OS===
{{see also|Apple evangelist|Reality distortion field|The Cult of Mac (book)}}
From the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl advertisement]] and "Test Drive a Macintosh" to the [[Apple Switch ad campaign|Apple Switch]] and [[Get a Mac]] advertising campaigns, [[Apple Computer]] has a long history of advocating its platform through traditional media. This also covers advocacy of the [[Macintosh]] hardware, peripherals and even lifestyle choices, with both fans and the company projecting a [[hip (slang)|hip]] and trendy image while negatively portraying [[Microsoft Windows]], [[IBM]] or other competitors as anything from awkward and dated to a totalitarian [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] figure.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Microsoft Windows===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
{{see also|Bundling of Microsoft Windows}}
[[Neowin.net]] wrote editorials opposing Windows-bashing in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=32934 Neowin.net - Why Vista Will Not Be The Last OS Microsoft Makes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has attempted to boost popularity of Windows 7 with a launch party program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetBSD===
Like FreeBSD, the [[NetBSD]] Foundation hosts a [[mailing list]] especially for advocacy. This mailing list is automatically archived and made accessible online.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;The mailing list archives are [http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide some official advocacy material, such as posters and flyers and an official "powered by" logo&lt;ref name="fn_2"&gt;The advocacy page is [http://netbsd.org/gallery/advocacy/ here] and the logo [http://netbsd.org/gallery/logos.html#official-logo here].&lt;/ref&gt; with a license permitting use on any product running NetBSD.

===OpenBSD===
{{see also|OpenBSD#Distribution and marketing}}

Like FreeBSD and NetBSD, the [[OpenBSD]] project provides a mailing list specifically intended for advocacy, advocacy@openbsd.org. It was created on July 21, 1998 for discussion of user groups, stickers, shirts and the promotion of OpenBSD's image and also to host all [[Flaming (Internet)|flame-worthy]] discussions. As a part of its advocacy, the project also maintains a list of consulting firms and individual consultants around the world on its website&lt;ref name="fn_3"&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/support.html OpenBSD Support and Consulting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}} and has produced a number of slogans, including "Free, Functional &amp; Secure", "Secure by default", and "Power. Security. Flexibility." Each OpenBSD release features an original song&lt;ref name="fn_4"&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html OpenBSD release song lyrics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of artwork.&lt;ref name="fn_5"&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/art1.html OpenBSD Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}}

===OS/2===
{{see also|Team OS/2}}

''[[Team OS/2]]'' was a [[grassroots]] organization conceived by an [[IBM]] employee and initially joined by other IBMers which quickly spread outside IBM. Whether IBM employees or not, Team OS/2 members initially volunteered their time and passion without official sanction from or connection to IBM. Members would promote OS/2 at trade shows, conferences, fairs, and in stores, participate in operating system discussions on [[CompuServe]], [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[Fidonet]] and Usenet, throw parties, help users install OS/2, contact media figures to explain OS/2 and generate interest, and in general exercise creativity and initiative in helping popularize OS/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/Team-OS2-FAQ/ | title= Team OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions | author= Christian Alice Scarborough | work= | accessdate = 2005-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}}
The industry dynamics that gave rise to such passionate{{Weasel inline|date=October 2013}} advocacy were multi-faceted. Perhaps{{vague|date=October 2013}} the leading cause was antipathy for the idea that Microsoft could and would establish a monopoly for Windows and DOS, widely deemed as far inferior to OS/2. Additionally, many users feared that IBM, who had proven eminently capable of developing a superior PC operating system, knew very little about consumer marketing in the high-tech marketplace or establishing even a superior product as a standard in the cut-throat, get-there-first-at-any-cost arena dominated by Microsoft.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Finally, the mere fact that so many copies of Windows were shipping to users (whom OS/2 advocates viewed as uncritical and uninformed), coupled with the fact that so many in the industry had so much riding on the success of OS/2, created conditions ripe for so many trying to take matters into their own hands.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The only spark that was needed for this combustible situation to ignite was an example of evangelism provided by the "new IBM" - a few employees who took "empowerment" seriously, able to coordinate their efforts through participation in TEAMOS2 FORUM, an [[IBM VNET|internal IBM discussion group]]) - and passionate supporters outside IBM who adopted the ideas and modeled the behaviors of those who were early activists within IBM.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum.jpg|thumb|350px|A 10th-century [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'' from Reims, now in Berlin]]
[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum - illustrated codex.jpg|thumb|350px|An 11th-century illustrated [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'', now in Salerno]]
The '''''Origo Gentis Langobardorum''''' ([[Latin]] for "Origin of the tribe of the Lombards") is a short, 7th-century AD Latin account offering a [[founding myth]] of the [[Lombards|Lombard people]]. The first part visions the origin and naming of the Lombards, and the following text more resembles a [[king-list]], up until the rule of [[Perctarit]] (672&amp;ndash;688), which helps date the original writing of the text. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Manuscripts==
The account has been preserved in three ''codices'', mostly containing legalistic writings compiled in the reign of [[Rothari]] and known as ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'' or ''[[Leges Langobardorum]]''. As such, ''Origo Gentis Langobardorum'' is preserved in three manuscripts, Modena, Biblioteca Capitolare 0.I.2 (9th century), Cava de’ Tirreni, Archivio Della Badia 4, (early 9th century) and Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional 413 (early 11th century).

==Reception==
''Origo Gentis Langobardorum'' is also the textual source of the Lombard theonym ''godan'' (''[[Wōdanaz]]'').

The ''Origo'' is summarized somewhat faithfully in the ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' by [[Paulus Diaconus]].  For the legend of origin Paulus Diaconus makes separate text paragraphs for, respectively, the conflict with the Vandals and the consulting with Frea and Godan, and he precedes the description of Frea and Godan with "loco antiquitas ridiculam fabulam" . Whereas the ''Origo'' is only extant in three copies, there are hundreds of medieval copies of the ''Historia''.

==Contents==
Following is a free translation. 

;Origin
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Wodan]], with [[Frigg]]a, looks down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women below (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]].]]
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards looking up at Wodan and Frigga (1905) by Emil Doepler.]] The text mentions an island [[Scandza|Scandanan]], the home of the Winnili. Their ruler was a woman called Gambara,  with her sons Ybor and Agio. The leaders of the [[Vandals]], Ambri and Assi, asked them to pay them tribute, but they refused, saying they would fight them. Ambri and Assi then went to [[Odin|Godan]], and asked him for victory over the Winnili. Godan replied that he would give the victory to whomever he saw first at sunrise. At the same time, Gambara and her sons asked [[Frigg|Frea]], Godan's wife, for victory. Frea advised that the women of the Winnili should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and join their men for battle. At sunrise, Frea turned her husband's bed so that he was facing east, and woke him. Godan saw the women of the Winnili, their hair tied in front of their faces, and asked "Who are these longbeards?", and Frea replied, since you named them, give them victory, and he did. From this day, the Winnili were called ''Langobardi'', "longbeards". 

;Migration
After this, the Lombards migrated, and they came to Golaida (perhaps at the [[Oder]]), and later they ruled Aldonus and Anthaib (unclear, perhaps in [[Bavaria]]) and Bainaib (also Banthaib; perhaps in [[Bohemia]]) and Burgundaib (perhaps territory of the [[Burgundians]], at the Middle [[Rhine]] ), and they chose as their king Agilmund, son of Agion, from the line of Gugingus, and later they were ruled by Laiamicho of the same dynasty, and after him Lethuc, who ruled for some 40 years. He was succeeded by his son, Aldihoc, and after him, Godehoc ruled. 

;The Danubian lands
[[Odoacer|Audochari]] came from [[Ravenna]] with the [[Alans]],
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;487, Audochari fought the Rugii&lt;/ref&gt;  and came to Rugilanda ([[Lower Austria]], north of the [[Danube]]) to fight the [[Rugii]], and he killed Theuvanue their king, and returned to Italy with many captives. The Lombards consequently left their land and lived in Rugilanda for some years.

Gudehoc was succeeded by his son, Claffo, and he by his son, [[Tato]]. The Lombards tarried at Feld for three years, where Tato fought and killed Rodolfo, king of the [[Heruli]].

[[Wacho]] son of Unichus killed Tato, and Ildichus, Tato's son fought Wacho, but he had to flee to the [[Gepids]], where he died. Wacho had three wives, the first Raicunda, daughter of Fisud, king of the [[Thuringii|Turingi]], the second Austrigusa, a daughter of the Gippidi, who had two daughters, Wisigarda, who married [[Theodebert I|Theudipert]], king of the [[Franks]], and [[Waldrada|Walderada]], who married Suscald, another king of the Franks, who didn't like her and gave her to Garipald, and the third Silinga, daughter of the king of the Heruli, who had a son named Waltari, who succeeded Wacho and ruled for seven years. Farigaidus was the last of the [[Lething Dynasty|line of Lethuc]].

After Waltari ruled [[Auduin]], who led the Lombards to [[Pannonia]]. [[Albuin]], son of Auduin and his wife Rodelenda ruled after him. Albuin fought and killed Cunimund, king of the Gippidi. Albuin took to wife Cunimund's daughter, Rosemunda, and after she died Flutsuinda, daughter of Flothario, king of the Franks. She had a daughter called Albsuinda. 

;Italy
After the Lombards had lived in Pannonia for 42 years, Albuin led them into Italy, in the month of April, and two years later, Albuin was [[King of Italy|lord of Italy]]. 
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;565, Albuin became lord of Italy&lt;/ref&gt;  He ruled for three years before he was killed by Hilmichis and his wife Rosemunda, in the palace in [[Verona]]. The Lombards, however, didn't suffer Hilmichis to rule them, so Rosamunda called the prefect Longinus that he should capture Ravenna, and Hilmichis and Rosamunda escaped  with Albsuinda, daughter of king Albuin, and the whole treasury of Ravenna. Longinus then tried to persuade Rosamunda to kill Hilmichis, so she might marry him, and she followed his advice and poisoned him, but as Hilmichis drank the poison, he realized what was happening, and he asked Rosamunda to drink with him, and they died together. Thus, Longinus was left with all the treasures of the Lombards, and with Albsuinda, the king's daughter, whom he carried away to the Emperor at [[Constantinople]].

After Albuin, [[Cleph]] 
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;572-574, Cleph&lt;/ref&gt;  was king for two years. Then there followed an interregnum of twelve years, during which the Lombards were ruled by dukes. After this, [[Authari|Autarinus]],
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;584-590, Autarinus&lt;/ref&gt;   son of Claffo was king for seven years. He married Theudelenda, daughter of Garipald, and also Walderade of [[Bavaria]]. With Theudelenda came Gundoald her brother, and Autarinus made him duke of [[Asti]]. 

[[Agilulf|Acquo]], duke of the Turingi came from the Thaurini, and married queen Theudelenda, becoming king of the Lombards. He killed his enemies, Zangrolf of Verona, Mimulf of the [[Isola San Giulio|Island of Saint Julian]], Gaidulf of [[Bergamo]], and others. With Theudelenda, he had a daughter called Gunperga, and he ruled for six years.

After him ruled [[Arioald|Aroal]], 
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;c. 624-636, Aroal&lt;/ref&gt;  for twelve years, and after him [[Rothari]] 
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;636-652, Rothari&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Harodingians|Arodus]] family, and he broke the a city and fortress of the Romans, and he fought at the Scutella river, killing 8,000 Romans. Rothari ruled for 17 years, and after him [[Aripert I|Aripert]] 
&lt;ref group='origo'&gt;653- 661, Aripert&lt;/ref&gt;  for nine years, and after him [[Grimoald I of Benevento|Grimoald]], for nine years. After Grimoald, [[Perctarit|Berthari]] was king.

The '''Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum''' is based at [[Duxford]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] and tells the story of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and other airborne forces.

==History==
[[File:Paramuseum3.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Interior of the former museum at Aldershot]]
The museum was established by a meeting of the Committee of the Parachute Regiment Association in October 1946. It was housed in various barracks until a permanent home at Browning Barracks at the [[Aldershot Garrison]] was opened by Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery|Lord Montgomery]] on 23 March 1969. The museum moved to a new home in partnership with [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] under the Airborne Assault name in late 2008. The new attraction was opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], Colonel-in-Chief of The Parachute Regiment on 8 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Airborne Assault: Stories of men who go to war from the air|first=Robert J |last=Kershaw|year=2008|publisher= Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exhibits==
New multimedia displays tell the story of today's airborne soldier and his heritage from 1940 when British Airborne Forces were first formed at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parachute-regiment.co.uk/post/88368521892/the-formation-of-the-airborne-forces|title=The Formation of the Airborne Forces|publisher=Parachute Regiment|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays include the original briefing models for airborne operations of [[World War II]], including Bruneval, [[D-Day]] and the [[Operation Varsity|Rhine Crossing]]. The phases of the battle of  [[Arnhem]] and [[Operation Market Garden]] are fully explained in a dedicated exhibit. Broad coverage is given to the post-war campaigns from [[Borneo]] and [[Suez]] to the [[Falklands War]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Exhibits of light weapons and heavy drop equipment from jeeps to field guns are suspended as if dropping into action. An original nosecone of the [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]]glider which carried airlanding troops into action at [[Normandy]] and the Rhine is featured, as well as [[Brian (dog)|Bing the Paradog]], who dropped in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-man-trained-dogs-parachute-5382477 |title=Liverpool man trained dogs to parachute into Normandy for D-Day landings|publisher=The Liverpool Echo]|date= 30 July 2013|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medal Gallery==
The Medal Gallery exhibits many of the medals awarded to British airborne troops, including the posthumous [[Victoria Cross|VCs]] awarded to Lt. [[John Hollington Grayburn]] of the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36907 |date=1945-01-23 |pages=561–562|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Lionel Ernest Queripel]] of the 10th Battalion the Parachute Regiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 36917|date=20 March 1945 |page=669|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that awarded in 2007 to Corporal [[Bryan Budd]], of the 3rd Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58182 |page=17351 |date=15 December 2006 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ParaData resource==
{{see|List of Second World War British airborne battalions}}
The vision for Airborne Assault is a unique attraction bringing alive the history and modern reality of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces. Central to this is ParaData - a comprehensive database record of all who have served, and are currently serving, linked to accounts and details of relevant campaigns and engagements. Photographs, documents, letters and film and audio interviews are appended to each entry where available, and contributions of further material are invited. The database aims to be a definitive history and a continually updated resource.  While paying respect to those who have served and their families, this will engage a younger audience, especially with reference to the National Curriculum, through the use of the latest technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.paradata.org.uk |title=The database|publisher=ParaData |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peranakan Museum''' is a museum in Singapore specialising in [[Peranakan]] culture. A sister museum to the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]],  it is the first of its kind in the world, that explores Peranakan cultures in Singapore and other former [[Straits Settlements]] in [[Malacca]] and [[ Penang]], and other Peranakan communities in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="newest"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore’s Newest Museum Opens: showcasing the finest and most comprehensive Peranakan collection in the world|publisher=Asian Civilizations Museum|date=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Old Tao Nan School]] building at Armenian Street, which once served as an extended wing to the artefact collection of the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]]. 

==History==
On January 1, 2006 the Museum, known then as ''ACM 1''&lt;ref name="newest"/&gt; closed the Armenian Street wing for a major revamp. At its closure, the museum management chose [[Peranakan]] culture theme over a children's museum and a Chinese ceramic museum as their new showcase in the Tao Nan School space. This enabled the Museum to house the world's most distinctive and comprehensive Peranakan museum collection of artifacts and wares, with a potential annual visitorship numbers of 112,000 people. Also, the revamp enabled 25 per cent more exhibition space for contextual displays for different aspects of Peranakan home and lifestyle. It also includes plans for Peranakan-themed eateries and shops in the row of four shop-houses adjacent to its building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boo|first=Krist|title=Closing end-2005: reopening as Peranakan showcase after 2 years; Armenian Street museum wants to have the best collection in the world, and it's a week of free entry before $12m revamp|publisher=Straits Times|date=2005-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum officially opened on April 25, 2008, with ten permanent galleries showcasing main themes of Peranakan life. A central feature of the museum is the Peranakan Wedding Bed which once belonged to Mrs. Quah Hong Chiam of Penang, and the very bed where she gave birth to the first seven of her 11 children.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Singapore’s Newest Museum Opens Annex I (Fact Sheet)|publisher=Asian Civilizations Museum|date=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different  galleries are found in the following manner:
* Gallery 1 (Level 1)
* Galleries 2 – 5 (Level 2)
* Galleries 6 - 10 (Level 3)
* Special Exhibitions Galleries (Level 3)

Gallery 1 titled ''Origins'' provides an introduction to Peranakan culture and to various Peranakan communities in Singapore, Malacca, Penang and Southeast Asia. Visitors to the subsequent rooms will learn about the story of the traditional 12-day Peranakan wedding, where significant ceremonies like the lap chai (exchange of gifts) and chiu thau (coming of age) are presented. Visitors can also see the
elaborate wedding chamber and a wedding procession taking place indoors on Level 2. Gallery 6 ''Nonya'', features the arts and crafts of Nonyas like beadwork, along with a display on the Nonya kebaya, and the womenfolks' role of transmitting cultural values to Peranakan children. Gallery 7 shows ''Religion'', on Peranakans and their faiths. Gallery 8 illustrates the commerce, politics and social affairs of prominent Peranakans in Singapore’s history in this exhibition titled ''Public Life.'' Gallery 9 on ''Food and Feasting'', provides a grand banquet setting with the world’s best collection of nonya porcelain. And finally the visual experience concludes with an introspection of modern Peranakans and how they feel about their heritage and the future of their culture in Gallery 10 (''Conversations''). Additional ''Special Exhibitions Galleries'' will feature changing specific-themed exhibitions.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15361">A '''points-based immigration system''' is an [[immigration]] system where a noncitizen's eligibility to immigrate is (partly or wholly) determined by whether that noncitizen is able to score above a threshold number of points in a scoring system that might include such factors as education level, wealth, connection with the country, language fluency, existing job offer, or others.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29594642|title = Immigration points-based systems compared|last = Donald|first = Adam|date = June 1, 2016|accessdate = November 24, 2017|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.economist.com/news/international/21701753-countries-invented-points-based-immigration-systems-have-concluded-they-do-not|title = What’s the point?

They may also have additional criteria that points-based immigrants need to satisfy, such as no criminal record or no involvement with terrorist organizations. Some countries that use points-based immigration systems are the [[United Kingdom]] (see [[points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|main article]]), [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=workpermit/&gt;&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.loc.gov/law/help/points-based-immigration/index.php|title = Points-Based Immigration Systems|publisher = [[Library of Congress]]|accessdate = November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Australia are the two countries with the most experience with the points-based system, and are often used as the comparison points when judging whether a country's immigration system is points-based.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Buchanan, Tariq Ahmad, &amp; Clare Feikert-Ahalt.

== Points-based systems by country ==

=== Canada ===

[[Canada]] was the first country to introduce a points-based immigration system, doing so in 1967.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.centreforum.org/assets/pubs/points-based-system.pdf|title = Britain's points based migration system|last = Murray|first = Alasdair|publisher = Centre Forum|date = January 1, 2011|accessdate = November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} The change came as Canada was moving past an immigration system that distinguished based on race and country of origin.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt; The new system favored youth, education, experience and fluency in English or French, i.e., broad [[human capital]] as opposed to a specific job offer or job-specific skills.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt; The points-based immigration system has been identified as one of the factors in the change in Canada's immigrant distribution from 85% European to 15% European and leveled the field of immigration.&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In response to lower and declining labor force participation among people admitted through the points-based system relative to native Canadian workers, two reasons were identified: lack of recognition by Canadian employers of foreign educational degrees, and poor language fluency. As a result, the government changed its points-based system to weigh English and French language fluency more heavily.&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt; The system was also changed so that any skilled applicant with a job offer scores higher than any applicant without.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; The application process was again revamped due to the gap between a foreign candidate and an employer and reduced the points for job offer, they also changed the system to an invitation to immigrate method that allows an open expression of interest with the option the pool of candidates can remain a year or two in the system to meet the frequently published "lottery point" and get invited. The lack of visibility of qualified immigrant candidate profiles in the job bank for the employers and hiring agencies in reaching out with a job offer was observed to lag the process.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

Canada has been cited as an example of a successful use of a points-based system and a society that embraces multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-canada-got-immigration-right-1474033169|title = How Canada Got Immigration Right.

In 1972, the Labor Government elected in [[Australia]] decided migrants would be granted a visa based on personal attributes and ability to contribute to Australian society.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In 1989, Australia formalized a points-based immigration system similar to Canada's&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt; (''The Economist'' gives a date of 1979 for initial rollout of the policy).&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; Like Canada, Australia switched to the points-based system as it was transitioning out of its history of race-based (Briton-focused, white-only) immigration policy.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt;{{rp|16}} Australia's experience of the system is unique with smaller changes in regulations and diverse options through provincial programs. Australia shifted to an application process where people were invited to express interest if they meet a required-straight forward score and the applicants would be invited per labour market requirements within a year or two after being in the pool.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-australias-points-system-for-immigration-26065&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Australia's points-based system was cited as an inspiration and was raised as an elegant point during discussions of immigration policy in the [[United Kingdom]] in the context of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-australias-points-system-for-immigration-26065|title = Explainer: what is Australia’s ‘points system’ for immigration?|date = June 22, 2016|accessdate = November 24, 2017|publisher = ''The Conversation''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ft.com/content/c1b8471c-296b-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89|title = Australia’s points system is more liberal than you think.

=== United Kingdom ===

{{further|Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)}}

Between 2008 and 2010, the U. K. phased in a points-based immigration system for regulating immigration from outside the [[European Economic Area]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' reports that the system did not evolve into a points-based system like that of Australia or Canada due to the numerous special exemptions carved out by various interest groups, and subsequent slashing of immigration under the Tory government.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; However, specialty based immigration is open in the United Kingdom.

=== United States of America ===
Before 1950's America had a points-based system of immigration. The Trump Administration has proposed to bring back the system for issuing green cards, to make the USCIS system efficient and to reduce backlogs. The administration also intends to cancel their current [[green card lottery]] and [[chain migration]] systems by implementing point based system. Even-though the new Visa will have regulations and caps, it might be open for anyone who meets the standards. Due to the increasing need for [[Laborer]]s and subsequent support for illegal alien workers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/reports/133.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program-data-hub/unauthorized-immigrant-population-profiles&lt;/ref&gt; (like in the agricultural industry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-california-agriculture-trump-immigration-tariffs-20180315-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;), a legalized satisfaction for the service industry needs in form of laborer immigration (an extended form of H-2B visa) is in the workings, it as such avoids 457 visa/temporary work permit problems that is common in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/30/australian-slavery-inquiry-told-fruit-pickers-brainwashed-and-trapped-in-debt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/fruit-picking-investigation/&lt;/ref&gt; (Australia, however, have snubbed the Visa from January 2018 and replaced it with 482 Visa that allows immigration and requires Individual band score of 5 in IELTS exams for the candidates, and for [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] employers to pay [[Tithe|ten percent]] of the salary offered to the foreign worker at the [[Skilling Australians Fund]] per year.) In the developing system the immigrants will be welcomed to work specifically in the service sector for a required period of time, and for equitable reasons they can qualify for green card by natural processing with the entry requirement that the immigrant meet an English language proficiency and show of their willingness to enter into an American education program (like community colleges) for gaining skills and basis for cultural integration while working, this will be counted as a goodwill factor in citizenship application. Absence of criminal records will also be a significant criteria for successful entry. However, highly skilled immigrants might require a job offer through a governmental "job match and selection" platform along with meeting the entry requirements to avoid "Ph.D cabdrivers" phenomenon and hostile [[brain drain]] of their native country. Specialty professionals ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] field) will be selected per labor market statistical projection that will have a safeguard for displacement of jobs for citizens per Americans first policy by maintaining attraction of new and competent overseas workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/03/news/economy/merit-based-immigration-trump/index.html|title=Trump's merit-based immigration system: Who would get in?|first=Octavio Blanco and Tal|last=Kopan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/02/politics/cotton-perdue-trump-bill-point-system-merit-based/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===

[[New Zealand]] introduced a points-based system in 1991.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

== Initial assumptions of points-based systems ==

=== Points-based systems that incorporate job offers and language fluency can lead to better immigrant employment rates ===

Both Canada and Australia began with points-based systems focused more on human capital than on specific job offers, but both found through experience that this resulted in lower immigrant employment rates compared with natives or with immigrants in certain states and provinces. This led Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University to claim that "pure" point systems "don't work."&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; Both countries modified their points-based systems to take job offers into account.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=centreforum/&gt;{{rp|19-20}} But this didn't open window for job opportunities or an open channel for immigrant candidates and employers; additional paperwork and lack of channels have been observed resulting in low rates of immigration and many have reverted or reduced points required in these factors.

=== Points-based systems require frequent tweaking ===

Demetrios Papademetriou of the [[Migration Policy Institute]] argued, based on the frequent tweaking of criteria used by Canada and Australia, that points-based systems require frequent tweaking in order to be successful.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; Given the slow pace of United States immigration legislation, he argued that this required a greater level of planning for the bureaucracy than seen in the United States immigration system, so to gain autonomy for the implementation of a points-based system would be a challenge for the United States.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

'''Price v Sports Marine Ltd''' is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability exclusion clauses which are generally prohibited for non business transactions under section 43 of the Consumer Guarantees Act.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |isbn=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |pages=237–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Price's owned a 17&amp;nbsp;ft Searay boat, which they placed with Sports Marine to sell on their behalf. The Price's agreed to a non liability clause with Sport's Marine.

Whilst the boat was at Sports Marine, one of their staff damaged the boat during the test run, damage which Sports Marine argued that the non liability clause stopped them for being liable. The Prices argued that the CGA makes such clauses unenforceable regarding consumer transactions.

==Held==
The clause was a breach of section 32(c) of the CGA.

[[File:AGMA Ostrakon Thémistocle 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vote cast against [[Themistocles]]; a quorum of 6,000 was required for [[ostracism]] under the [[Athenian democracy]], according to [[Plutarch]]; a similar quorum was necessary in the following century for grants of [[Athenian citizenship#Athenian citizenship|citizenship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy and Participation in Athens |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=Sinclair, R. K. |isbn=0521423899 |year=1988 |pages=114–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{United States Senate}}A '''quorum''' is the minimum number of members of a [[deliberative assembly]] (a body that uses [[parliamentary procedure]], such as a legislature) necessary to conduct the business of that group. According to ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'', the "requirement for a quorum is protection against totally unrepresentative action in the name of the body by an unduly small number of persons."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 21|edition = 11th|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/book.html|display-authors = etal|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170813113356/http://www.robertsrules.com/book.html|archivedate = 13 August 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''quorum'' is from a [[Middle English]] wording of the [[Letters patent|commission]] formerly issued to [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]], derived from [[Latin]] ''quorum'', "of whom", [[genitive]] plural of ''qui'', "[[Who (pronoun)|who]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quorum Quorum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123080802/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quorum |date=23 November 2016 }}," ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary'', 11th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ''quora'' as plural of ''quorum'' is not a valid Latin formation.

==Number constituting a quorum==
Each assembly determines the number of members that constitutes a quorum in its governing documents (such as in its constitution, [[charter]], [[bylaw]]s or [[Rules of order|standing orders]]). The quorum may also be set by law. ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' states that the quorum set in an organization's bylaws "should approximate the largest number that can be depended on to attend any meeting except in very bad weather or other extremely unfavorable conditions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the absence of such a provision, a quorum in an assembly whose membership can be determined is a majority of the entire membership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the meetings of a [[Convention (meeting)|convention]], unless provided otherwise, a quorum is a majority of registered [[delegate]]s, even if some have departed. In a [[mass meeting]] or in an organization in which the membership cannot be accurately determined, the quorum consists of those who attend the meeting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[committee]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Board of directors|boards]], a quorum is a majority of the members of the board or committee unless provided otherwise. The board or committee cannot set its own quorum unless given such power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]] or its variants, a quorum is the same as the assembly unless otherwise provided.

In online groups, a quorum has to be determined in a different manner since no one is actually "present".  The rules establishing such groups would have to prescribe this determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is that a quorum in such groups could be established as "present" if enough members state that they are "present" at the designated meeting time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aipparl.org/pdf/AIPemeet5.PDF|title = Electronic Meetings: Rules for Electronic (e-mail) Meetings or The E-liberative Assembly|date = July 2001|access-date = 23 January 2016|website = aipparl.org|publisher = American Institute of Parliamentarians|last = Stackpole|first = John D.|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171148/http://www.aipparl.org/pdf/AIPemeet5.PDF|archivedate = 3 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determination of a quorum==
The chairman of the group has the responsibility to determine if a quorum is present.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, any member can raise a [[point of order]] about an apparent absence of a quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#3|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 3)|date = |accessdate = 13 December 2015|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#3|archivedate = 12 November 2004|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is difficult to determine exactly when a quorum was lost, points of order relating to the absence of a quorum are "generally not permitted to affect prior action; but upon clear and convincing proof, such a point of order can be given effect retrospectively by a ruling of the presiding officer, subject to [[Appeal (motion)|appeal]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Limited actions in the absence of a quorum ==
When a quorum is not met, the assembly can only take limited procedural actions. These limited actions are [[Fix the time to which to adjourn|to fix the time to which to adjourn]], [[Adjourn (motion)|adjourn]], [[Recess (motion)|recess]], or take measures to obtain a quorum, such as a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] that absent members be contacted during a recess.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any other business that is conducted is not valid unless it is [[Ratification|ratified]] at a later meeting where a quorum is present. However, there is no obligation to ratify such action and those responsible may be punished for their actions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Call of the house==
In legislatures and other assemblies that have the legal power to compel the attendance of their members, the call of the house procedure may be used to obtain a quorum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|pp = 350–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure does not exist in ordinary societies, since [[voluntary association]]s have no [[Coercion|coercive]] power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When a call of the house is ordered, the [[clerk]] calls the roll of members and then the names of absentees. Members who do not have an excused absence are arrested and brought in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The arrested members may be charged a fee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Examples in United States Senate ===
In the [[United States Senate]], the procedure was used in the early morning hours of 25 February 1988. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]], then the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], moved a call of the house after the minority [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] walked out in an attempt to deny the Senate a quorum after Senate aides began bringing [[Camp bed|cots]] into the Senate [[cloakroom]]s in preparation for an all-night session over [[campaign finance reform]] for congressional elections. Byrd's motion was approved 45-3 and [[arrest warrant]]s were signed for all 46 Republicans. [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant-at-Arms]] [[Henry K. Giugni]] and his staff searched the Capitol's corridor and [[Congressional office buildings|Senate office buildings]] for absent Senators, and after checking several empty offices, spotted Senator [[Steve Symms]] of [[Idaho]], who fled down a hallway and escaped arrest. After a cleaning woman gave a tip that Senator [[Robert Packwood]] of [[Oregon]] was in his office, Giugni opened the door with a [[skeleton key]]. Packwood attempted to shove the door closed, but Giugni and two assistants pushed it open. Packwood was "carried feet-first into the Senate chamber by three plainclothes officers" and sustained bruised [[knuckle]]s.&lt;ref name="latimes1988"&gt;Lauter, David. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/news/mn-45210_1_quorum-call Senate Police Seize Packwood for Quorum Call] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110815174023/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/news/mn-45210_1_quorum-call |date=15 August 2011 }}." ''Los Angeles Times'' 25 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1988, the last time the procedure had been used was during a 1942 [[filibuster]] over [[civil rights]] legislation.&lt;ref name="latimes1988"/&gt; [[Southern United States|Southern]] Democrat senators had spent days filibustering legislation to end [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], just days after [[United States Senate elections, 1942|midterm elections]] had resulted in the loss of nine seats. Democratic Majority Leader [[Alben W. Barkley]] obtained an order on a Saturday session on 14 November 1942, directing Sergeant at Arms Chesley W. Jurney to round up the five Southern absentees to obtain a quorum. Jurney sent his Deputy Sergeant at Arms, J. Mark Trice, to the apartment of Democratic Senator [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]] of [[Tennessee]] at the [[Mayflower Hotel]]. Then 73 years old and the third-most [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior Senator]], McKellar was later described by Republican Senator [[Bill Frist]] in his book on Tennessee senators as an "extraordinarily shrewd man of husky dimensions with a long memory and a short fuse." Trice called from the lobby, but McKellar refused to answer his phone, so the deputy sergeant at arms walked up to the apartment and convinced the senator's [[maid]] to let him in:&lt;ref name="senate1942"&gt;"[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Getting_even.htm November 14, 1942: Arrests Compel Senate Quorum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829034540/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Getting_even.htm |date=29 August 2017 }}." United States Senate History.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When Trice explained that McKellar was urgently needed back at the Capitol, the 73-year-old legislator agreed to accompany him. As they approached the Senate wing, McKellar suddenly realized what was up. An aide later recalled, "His face grew redder and redder. By the time the car reached the Senate entrance, McKellar shot out and barreled through the corridors to find the source of his summons."&lt;br&gt;Barkley got his quorum...&lt;ref name="senate1942"/&gt;}}

==Quorum-busting==
The tactic of '''quorum-busting'''—causing a quorum to be prevented from the meeting—has been used in legislative bodies by minorities seeking to block the adoption of some measure they oppose. This generally only happens where the quorum is a super-majority, as quorums of a majority or less of the membership mean that the support of a majority of members is always sufficient for the quorum (as well as for passage). Rules to discourage quorum-busting have been adopted by legislative bodies, such as the call of the house, outlined above.

Quorum-busting has been used for centuries. For instance, during his time in the [[Illinois Legislature]], [[Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln#Illinois State Bank|Abraham Lincoln]] leapt out of a first story window (the doors of the [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site (Illinois)|Capitol]] had been locked to prevent legislators from fleeing) in a failed attempt to prevent a quorum from being present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald|first=David Herbert|title=Lincoln|year=1995|publisher=Random House|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent prominent example of quorum-busting occurred during the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], in which the majority [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[Texas House of Representatives]] sought to carry out a controversial mid-decade congressional [[redistricting]] [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] which would have favored Republicans by displacing five Democratic U.S. Representatives from Texas (the [[Texas Five]]) from their districts. The House [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], certain of defeat if a quorum were present, took a plane to the neighboring state of [[Oklahoma]] to prevent a quorum from being present (and thus the passage of the bill). The group gained the nickname "the [[Killer Ds]]."

Similarly, the minority Democrats in the [[Texas Legislature]]'s [[upper chamber]], the [[Texas Senate]], fled to [[New Mexico]] to prevent a quorum of the Senate to prevent a redistricting bill from being considered during a [[special session]]. The [[Texas Eleven]] stayed in New Mexico for 46 days before [[John Whitmire]] returned to Texas, creating a quorum. Because there was now no point in staying in New Mexico, the remaining ten members of the Texas Eleven returned to Texas to vote in opposition to the bill.

During the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]], fourteen Democratic members of the [[Wisconsin Senate]] went to Illinois in order to bust the necessary 20-member quorum. Democrats in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] did the same in order to block another union-related bill, causing the legislative clock on the bill to expire. Traveling out of their state placed these legislators beyond the jurisdiction of state troopers who could compel them to return to the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703842004576162911431447084?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=Wall Street Journal |title=Indiana GOP Drops Union Bill, but Democrats Stay Out of State |date=24 February 2011 |first=Thomas M. |last=Burton |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514004758/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703842004576162911431447084?mod=googlenews_wsj |archivedate=14 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearing quorum==
&lt;!--Note that [[Disappearing quorum]] redirects here--&gt;
The similar tactic of '''disappearing quorum''' (refusing to vote although physically present on the floor) was used by the minority to block votes in the United States House of Representatives until 1890. That year, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] ordered that members who were present but [[Abstention|abstaining]] would count in the quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Pre-Twentieth Century Look at the House Committee on Rules, The Reed Rules|url = http://archives.democrats.rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm|website = archives.democrats.rules.house.gov|access-date = 27 January 2016|publisher = The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Rules|date = December 1998|last = Oleszek|first = Walter J.|deadurl = no|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160127191820/http://archives.democrats.rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm|archivedate = 27 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/12/18/the-history-and-lessons-of-congressional-crises/congressional-rules-remembered-and-forgotten|title=The History and Lessons of Congressional Crises|work=The New York Times|access-date=27 March 2017|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328105140/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/12/18/the-history-and-lessons-of-congressional-crises/congressional-rules-remembered-and-forgotten|archivedate=28 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/01/house-quorum-rule-changed-jan-29-1890-018113|title=House quorum rule changed, Jan. 29, 1890|work=POLITICO|access-date=27 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328195532/http://www.politico.com/story/2009/01/house-quorum-rule-changed-jan-29-1890-018113|archivedate=28 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
[[Section 22 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 22]] and [[Section 39 of the Constitution of Australia|section 39]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]] set the quorum for sittings of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at one-third of the whole number of MPs and senators, respectively, but [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] is permitted to change the quorum for each House by ordinary legislation.

In the House of Representatives, the quorum was amended down to one-fifth by the House of Representatives (Quorum) Act 1989, which means the quorum of the current House of 150 MPs is 30 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/pubs/gtp/chapter4.htm |title=Guide to Procedures |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=18 March 2005 |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221185344/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/pubs/gtp/chapter4.htm |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the senate, the quorum was amended down to one-quarter by the Senate (Quorum) Act 1991, so 19 senators is a quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/odgers/chap0802.htm |title=Chapter 8, Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Eleventh Edition |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815185831/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/odgers/chap0802.htm |archivedate=15 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quorum includes the occupant of the [[President of the Australian Senate|Chair]] and is not reduced by the death or resignation of a member or senator.

If at the beginning of a sitting the quorum is not met, the bells are rung for five minutes and a count is then taken; if the quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned until the next sitting day. During the sitting, any MP or senator may draw attention to the lack of quorum in which the bells are rung for four minutes, and if a quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned.

Although quorum-busting is virtually unheard of in Australia, it is not unknown for parties to deliberately use quorum counts as a disruptive tactic and there have been some suggestions to enact rules to restrict this practice; however, this is very difficult due to the explicit mention of a quorum in the constitution. It is considered disorderly to call attention to quorum when one exists and members or senators who do so can be punished.

=== Austria ===
In the [[National Council of Austria]] at least one-third of the representatives must be present, so that they may decide on a simple law (participation quorum of 33.3%). At least half of the members must participate if a constitutional law should pass the parliament (participation quorum of 50% based on the total number of members). Over and above that, constitutional laws require the consent of at least two-thirds of the members present (quorum agreement of 66.6% based on the number of voting present).

===Canada===
In Canada, the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] sets quorum for sittings of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] at 20 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]. If a member calls for quorum to be counted and a first count shows there are fewer than 20 members, bells are rung to call in the members; if after 15 minutes there are still fewer than 20 members, the session is adjourned to the next sitting day; the members present sign a roll on the table of the house, and this list is included in the Journal of the House. There is no need for quorum when the attendance of the House is requested in the [[Senate of Canada]], for example, when [[Royal Assent]] is being given to bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?DocId=1001&amp;Sec=Ch09&amp;Seq=3&amp;Lang=E |title=Marleau, Robert, and Camille Montpetit, eds.

=== Germany ===
In the German [[Bundestag]] at least half of the members (311 out of 622) must be present so that it is empowered to make resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/rechtsgrundlagen/go_btg/go06.html |title=§ 45 Geschäftsordnung des Deutschen Bundestages |publisher=Bundestag.de |date= |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703112724/http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/rechtsgrundlagen/go_btg/go06.html |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is however common that fewer members are present, because they can still make effective decisions as long as no parliamentary group or 5% of the members of the parliament are complaining about the lack of quorum. This, in rare cases, is used by opposition parties to delay votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-beendet-sitzung-wegen-zu-wenig-teilnehmern-a-839079.html |title=Bundestag bricht überraschend Sitzung ab |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616093852/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-beendet-sitzung-wegen-zu-wenig-teilnehmern-a-839079.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
Article 75 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]] stipulates that the quorum required for the meetings of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) as "not less than one-half of its members". Between 1997 and 2012 the quorum was 30, and since 2012 it has been 35. Prior to 1997 [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]], the quorum was set at 20.

The quorum for the [[Select committee (Westminster system)|panels, committees and subcommittees]] is, nevertheless, one-third or three members, whichever the greater, as according to the Rules of Procedure. The three standing committees, namely, the Finance Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Members' Interests, is exceptional that the quorums are 9, 3 and 3 respectively.

Quorum-busting was used at least twice since 1997. In 2005, when some [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy members]] of the council paid a silent tribute to late leader of the People's Republic of China, [[Zhao Ziyang]], against the Rules of Procedure, the [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|president of the council]] suspended the meeting. When the meeting was recalled, [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing members]] refused to return to the chamber, forcing the meeting to be adjourned.

On 27 January 2010, when five pro-democracy members were intending to make their resignation speeches, pro-Beijing members of the council left the chamber as a sign of protest. One of the pro-Beijing members nevertheless stayed in the chamber to call for the quorum to be counted, effectively forcing the meeting to be adjourned. The resignation was intended as a [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|''de facto'' referendum]] across all five [[Geographical constituency|geographical constituencies]] of the territory, involving the entire electorate, which would not be officially recognised anyway. Most other factions, although against the move by these five Members, stayed in the chamber.

On 2 May 2012, when the LegCo was debating a law change to bar resigning legislators to participate in by-elections in 6 months, effectively discouraging any more "de facto" referenda, some of the five pro-democracy members who resigned constantly issued quorum calls, especially when they were making their resignation speeches intended for 2 years before. In the nine-hour meeting, 23 quorum calls were issued, taking up to 3 hours. When LegCo reconvened on 3 May, it was adjourned for lack of quorum amid a boycott by the pan-democrats. The pro-government members drew a timetable to ensure a quorum, but it failed to prevent another lack of quorum.

On 18 June 2015, when the LegCo was due to vote on a [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform|resolution to amend the provisions for the election of the territory's Chief Executive]], pro-Beijing members left the chamber to force a quorum roll call to make sure that a sick member could be able to rush back to the chamber. However some of the members stayed behind, citing miscommunication, and the division proceeded with two members above the required quorum of 35. While the resolution was originally predicted to be narrowly defeated due to not able to get super-majority support votes, it turned out to be a landslide defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/one-sick-lawmaker-makes-vote-on-hong-kong-democracy-a-landslide|title=One Sick Lawmaker Makes Vote on Hong Kong Democracy a Landslide|author=|date=18 June 2015|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711085549/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/one-sick-lawmaker-makes-vote-on-hong-kong-democracy-a-landslide|archivedate=11 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum-busting and attempts to thwart it are also a common feature during the annual motion debate related to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen massacre]] moved by pro-democracy Members. The quorum is called to be counted from time to time by the pan-democrats, in order to force the pro-Beijing camp to keep some members in the chamber.

=== India ===
{{further|Constitution of India|Parliament of India}}

[[s:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 100 .7BVoting in Houses, power of Houses to act notwithstanding vacancies and quorum.7D|Article 100]] of the [[Constitution of India]] stipulates that at least 10% of total number of members of the House must be present to constitute the quorum to constitute a meeting of either House of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. For example, if the House has the total membership of 250, at least 25 members must be present for the House to proceed with its business.&lt;ref name="Rajya sabha handbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rajya sabha handbook|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/chapter1-1.asp|accessdate=3 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927002923/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/chapter1-1.asp|archivedate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If at any time during a meeting of a House there is no quorum, the Chairman has to either adjourn the House or suspend it until there is a quorum.&lt;ref name="Rajya sabha handbook"/&gt;

=== Ireland ===
According to the most recent standing orders, published in 2011, the Quorum for the Irish Parliament (The Oireachtas) for both the house and senate is 20 members.

The chamber of Dail Eireann is rarely full outside question time, with often just one government representative (often an ordinary member of parliament, not a minister) present to answer opposition questions.

===Philippines===
In [[Congress of the Philippines]], half of the membership (13 in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and 149 in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]) is needed to muster a quorum. If someone contests the lack of quorum, a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll call]] shall be done, and if there is indeed less than a majority of members present, the meeting shall be adjourned.

Both majority and minority blocs in Congress have used the lack of quorum in defeating bills that they don't want to be passed without putting it to a vote. After an election during the [[lame-duck session]], quorums are notoriously difficult to muster, more so in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] as winning incumbents may opt to go on vacation, and defeated incumbents may opt to not to show up.

===Turkey===

According to article 96 of the [[Turkish Constitution]], unless otherwise stipulated in the Constitution, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] shall convene with at least, one-third of the total number of members (184 out of 550) and shall take decisions by an absolute majority of those present; however, the quorum for decisions can, under no circumstances, be less than a quarter plus one of the total
number of members.

Before the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|constitutional referendum of 2007]], there was a quorum of two-thirds required in the Turkish Parliament. The opposition parties used the quorum to deadlock the [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|presidential election of 2007]], making it impossible for the parliament to choose a president. As a result, the ruling AK party proposed a referendum to lower the quorum. Nearly seventy percent of the participants supported the constitutional changes.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] has a quorum of 40 MPs, including the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], out of 650 members of the House. There is no need for a quorum to be present at all times. Commons debates could theoretically continue even if just one MP and the Speaker were present. However, if a [[Division of the assembly|division]] is called and fewer than 40 MPs are present, then a decision on the business being considered is postponed and the House moves on to consider the next item of business. The quorum for votes on legislation in the [[House of Lords]] is 30, but just three of the 753 [[Peerage|peers]], including the [[Lord Speaker]], are required to be present for a debate to take place.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82488.stm Quorum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204030810/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82488.stm |date=4 December 2009 }}" (23 October 2008). BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Quorum was a select group of the [[Justices of the Peace]] in each county in [[early modern Britain]]. In theory, they were men experienced in law, but many of the Quorum were appointed because of their status. Some legislation required the involvement of a member of the Quorum, (e.g., granting a license to a [[badger (person)|badger]]). In practice, they increasingly were not qualified, as the proportion in the Quorum rose faster than the proportion who were called to the bar or practising lawyers. By 1532, an average 45% of Justices of the Peace nationally were of the Quorum. In [[Somerset]], the proportion rose from 52% in 1562 to 93% in 1636. By then, most of those not on the Quorum were new to the bench. Sometimes Justices of the Peace were removed from the Quorum as a disciplinary measure less drastic than removal from the bench.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, J.H. The Justice of the Peace in England 1558-1640, Oxford, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The large deliberative bodies of the United Nations (the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], as well as their subsidiary organs) generally require the attendance of one-third of the membership (currently 65 states in the General Assembly and 18 in ECOSOC) to conduct most business, but a majority of members (currently 97 states in the General Assembly and 28 states in ECOSOC) in order to take any substantive decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url   =https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml| title   =UN General Assembly Rules of Procedure| author   =[[United Nations General Assembly]]| date   =| work   =| publisher   =United Nations| accessdate   =23 April 2012| deadurl   =no| archiveurl   =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113095649/http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml| archivedate   =13 January 2012| df   =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/pdf/rules.pdf | title = UN Economic and Social Council Rules of Procedure | author = [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] | date =  | work =  | publisher = United Nations | accessdate = 23 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331003602/http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/pdf/rules.pdf | archivedate = 31 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of the [[United Nations Security Council]] make no provisions for quorum, but nine votes are in all cases required to pass any substantive measure, effectively meaning that a meeting with fewer than nine members in attendance is pointless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |title=UN Security Council Provisional Rules of Procedure |author=[[United Nations Security Council]] |year=1983 |work= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510224150/http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |archivedate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 5, Clause 1]] of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business..." Therefore, in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] a quorum is a [[majority|simple majority]] of their respective members. The only exception is that stated in the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], which provides that in cases in which no candidate for President of the United States receives a majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], the election is decided by the House of Representatives, in which case "a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states," and in cases in which no candidate for Vice President of the United States has been elected, the election is decided by the Senate, in which case "a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators."

The Senate has the additional ordinary requirement in [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule VI|Rule VI]] of its [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|Standing Rules]] that "A quorum shall consist of a majority of the Senators duly chosen and [[Oath of office|sworn]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rybicki|first1=Elizabeth|title=Quorum Requirements in the Senate: Committee and Chamber|date=8 June 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-775.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212000552/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-775.pdf|archivedate=12 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maajid Nawaz speaking at LibDem campaign event.jpg|thumb|[[Maajid Nawaz]]'s use of the phrase "regressive left" has been a part of his opposition to [[Islamism]], the [[Qur'anic literalism|literalist]] pole of [[Islam]] that emphasises [[Sharia]] (Islamic law), [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] political unity and an Islamic state]]
"'''Regressive left'''" (also formulated as "'''regressive liberals'''" and "'''regressive leftists'''") is a  [[neologism]] and political [[epithet]], used as a [[pejorative]] to describe a section of [[left-wing politics]] who are accused of holding paradoxical, [[reactionary]] views by their [[Toleration|tolerance]] of [[Liberalism|illiberal]] principles and ideologies, particularly [[identity politics]] (emphasis on group identities like race and gender, rather than on the individual)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;, and opposition to free speech&lt;ref&gt;https://quillette.com/2017/02/03/free-speech-and-the-regressive-left-the-road-back-to-reason/&lt;/ref&gt; for the sake of [[multiculturalism]] and [[cultural relativism]].

== Concept ==
In 2007, [[Maajid Nawaz]] renounced his previous association with the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] in favor of [[Islam and secularism|secular Islam]]. He is co-founder and chairman of [[Quilliam (think tank)|Quilliam]], a counter-extremism [[think tank]] based in [[London]] that seeks to challenge Islamist ideology.&lt;ref name="Radical"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawaz|first=Maajid|date=2012|title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C|publisher=WH Allen|page=210|isbn=9781448131617|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/about/staff/maajid-nawaz/|title=Maajid Nawaz (Quilliam)|publisher=Quilliam|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawaz has used the phrase "regressive left" to describe left-leaning people who—in his opinion—pander to Islamism, which he defines as a "global totalitarian theo-political project" with a "desire to impose any given interpretation of Islam over society as law"&lt;ref name="rad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawaz|first=Maajid|date=2012|title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C|publisher=WH Allen|isbn=9781448131617}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he opposes on the ground that "any desire to impose any version of Islam over anyone anywhere, ever, is a fundamental violation of our basic civil liberties".&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/the-british-left-s-hypocritical-embrace-of-islamism.html|title=The British Left's Hypocritical Embrace of Islamism|author=Maajid Nawaz|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nawaz, such sympathizers of Islamism include "[[Atheism|atheists]] who are on the side of the Islamists, defending Islamism in the name of cultural tolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQhu1A-Ats|title=Lateline: An atheist and a Muslim on the future of Islam|author=[[Tony Jones (news journalist)|Tony Jones]]|work=[[Lateline]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=28 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2015 interview with political talk show host [[Dave Rubin]], Nawaz elucidated further the reasoning behind his choice of the word "regressive" and hypothesized that a section of people on the left "genuinely believe" that they are fighting an "ideological war" against neoconservative and neocolonialist foreign policies of Western governments which promote state-organized violence and chaos in the form of wars and military invasions. In contrast, he claims that such leftists forgo their duty to denounce the violent acts of theocratic extremists such as Islamists, at times going so far as to "make alliances" with some of the most regressive, theocratic and murderous regimes and organizations. He cited [[Jeremy Corbyn]], leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as an example of someone who "has been historically very close" to supporters of Islamist organisations like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]]. In Nawaz's opinion, it is possible to denounce both neoconservative foreign policies such as the Iraq War (which he had opposed) and theocratic extremism, but those that he labels "regressive leftists" fail to do so he says.&lt;ref name=Nawaz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Dave|title=Maajid Nawaz and Dave Rubin Discuss the Regressive Left and Political Correctness|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/2/maajid-nawaz-and-dave-rubin-discuss-the-regressive-left-political-correctness-0_twq2e3jhwn8|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=Rubin Report|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nawaz, the notion that Muslims cannot cope with criticism or mockery of Islam and only react violently is "patronizing, self-pity inspiring mollycoddling" of the very Muslims it claims to serve and emancipate, because it does not expect them to be civil and control their anger.&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt; This "racism of low expectations" lowers the moral standards of people within minorities, seeking excuses if they express [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]],&lt;!-- Source has been checked: although not in the text, it is in the actual video presentation. --&gt; [[chauvinism]], [[bigotry]] or [[antisemitism]], whilst holding members of the majority to "universal liberal standards".&lt;ref name="Bigthink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/maajid-nawaz-on-islamic-reform|title=Je Suis Muslim: How Universal Secular Rights Protect Muslim Communities the Most|author=Maajid Nawaz|date=18 November 2015|publisher=[[Big Think]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haras Rafiq, managing director of Quilliam, expressed the view that there is a tendency of some on the left to excuse Islamism: "We have not got to grips with the symbiotic relationship between Islamism and far-right hatred, and the regressive left that is prepared to excuse Islamism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Lebor|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/25/donald-trump-worse-voldemort-europeans-say-404653.html|title=Donald Trump: The America Stereotype Europeans Love To Hate|work=Newsweek|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the term ==

In September 2015, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz participated in a public forum hosted by [[Harvard University]]'s Institute of Politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI9QwEKqrso|title=Islam and the Future of Tolerance|author=Harvard's Institute of Politics hosting Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz|publisher=Harvard’s Institute of Politics|date=|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later published in a short book, titled ''[[Islam and the Future of Tolerance]]'' (2015). In a review of the book in the magazine ''[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]'', political writer Brian Stewart noted that according to both Nawaz and Harris "regressive leftists" in the West are "willfully blind" to the fact that jihadists and Islamists make up a significant portion (20% in Harris's estimate) of the global Muslim community and the minority Muslim communities within the West, even though these factions are opposed to liberal values such as individual autonomy, freedom of expression, democracy, women's rights, gay rights, etc. Nawaz and Harris have denounced the paradoxically illiberal, isolationist and censuring attitude towards any criticism of this phenomenon, which they contend betrays universal liberal values and also abandons supporting and defending the most vulnerable liberal members living within the Muslim community such as women, homosexuals and apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Brian|date=7 October 2015|title=A Liberal Atheist and a Liberal Muslim Discuss the Problems of Contemporary Islam|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425169/sam-harris-maajid-nawaz-islam-book|journal=[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ''The Washington Times'' reported that American comedian and show host [[Bill Maher]] and British biologist and [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] author [[Richard Dawkins]] "lamented regressive leftists who fail to understand they are anything but liberal when it comes to Islam".&lt;ref name="WT20151003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/bill-maher-richard-dawkins-blast-regressive-libera/|title=Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins blast 'regressive liberals' giving a 'free pass' to Islam|author=Kellan Howell|date=3 October 2015|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maher noted a willingness to criticise anything except [[Islam]], excusing it as "their culture", to which Dawkins responded: "Well, to hell with their culture".&lt;ref name="Maher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvvQJ_zsL1U|title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Richard Dawkins – Regressive Leftists (HBO)|date=2 October 2015|work=[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]|publisher=HBO|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/611231/Richard-Dawkins-in-extraordinary-blast-at-Muslims-To-hell-with-their-culture|title='To hell with their culture' - Richard Dawkins in extraordinary blast at Muslims|author=John Worthing|work=The Independent|date=27 October 2015|access-date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making reference to student initiatives to disinvite ex-Muslim speakers on campus, Dawkins saw this as "a betrayal of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-dawkins-free-speech_561038c4e4b0af3706e11397|title=Richard Dawkins: College Students Are Betraying The Free Speech Movement|author=Tyler Kingkade|work=Huffington Post|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2015, Sam Harris frequently used the term in his exchanges with the media, saying the greatest danger is that the "regressive left" is willing to give up [[freedom of speech]] "out of fear of offending minorities", which will lead to [[censorship]] imposed by those minorities, citing American journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s comments on the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] as an example.&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/sam-harris-unloads-on-the-regressive-left|title=Sam Harris Unloads on the Regressive Left|author=Chris Beck|work=[[Splice Today]]|publisher=[[Russ Smith (publisher)|Russ Smith]]|date=21 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Illing|title=Sam Harris talks Islam, ISIS, atheism, GOP madness: "We are confronting people, in dozens of countries, who despise more or less everything that we value"|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/25/harris_and_illing_correspondence/|publisher=Salon.com|date=25 November 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris considers [[Reza Aslan]]&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125/&gt; and [[Noam Chomsky]] to be of the regressive left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/sam-harris-is-still-mad-about-liberals-who-followed-noam-chomsky-off-the-edge-of-the-world/|title=Sam Harris is still mad about 'liberals who followed Noam Chomsky off the edge of the world'|publisher=Rawstory.com|date=16 October 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell'', 15 October 15, 2015, MSNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 in an appearance on the talk radio show ''[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist Hour]]'', author and philosopher [[Peter Boghossian]] defined the term as a pejorative used to describe those on the left that have made the "strangest bedfellows" with the Islamists. According to him, the word "regressive" is used to contrast with the word "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" – the latter being the group that is egalitarian and wants to create systems of justice and [[racial equality]], while the former being a group that "[looks] for the worst in people... and [does] not extend hermeneutics of charity, or a charitable interpretation of anything anyone says, but uses it as a hammer to beat people down". In addition, Boghossian believes that "regressive leftists" have become "hyper-moralists" and champions of their perceived victims. He cites the historical wrongdoings such as [[slavery in the United States]] and [[colonialism]] as a legitimate concern that has caused mistrust of anything Western and capitalistic. He also added that "there are people who have suffered and still suffer legitimate instances of racism, homophobia etc. The problem is that every time the word racist is just thrown around like that, that word loses its meaning. And it should have quite a sting. That should be a horrible word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|title=The Humanist Hour #175: The "Regressive Left" and Safe Spaces, with Dr. Peter Boghossian|website=thehumanist.com|publisher=The Humanist Hour|host=Bo Bennett, Kim Ellington|date=4 November 2015|time=4:08, 9:48, 0:10|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234501/http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|archivedate=11 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, talk show host Dave Rubin hosted discussions about the "regressive left" in several ''[[The Rubin Report]]'' segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/8/milo-yiannopoulos-and-dave-rubin-discuss-gay-rights-and-cultural-libertarians-0_40xbq9svp490|title=Milo Yiannopoulos and Dave Rubin Discuss Gay Rights and Cultural Libertarians|publisher=Ora TV|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin describes the regressive left as "the left's version of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]", saying that the regressive left will damage the Democratic Party in a similar way the Tea Party damages the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Rubin7Oct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzzLiJ6na1k|title=Dave Rubin: Regressives are the Left's Tea Party|work=[[The Rubin Report]]|date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator [[David Pakman]] supported the concept in his [[The David Pakman Show|talk show]], saying "there are liberals who do use [[cultural relativism]] and distaste for US foreign policy as an excuse to defend or at least minimize violence and injustice that they would certainly otherwise oppose". Pakman has distanced himself from the term, saying that it is misused by conservatives to insult all liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Would David Appear on Drunken Peasants or Illiberal Podcasts?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMremqM8Q28|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=The Truth About the Regressive Left|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=315icKVWb6w|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakman suggests that the actual regressive leftists are leftists who use authoritarianism to enforce progressivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Authoritarian Leftism: The Actual "Regressive Left"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCUrTMmtHbo|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In November 2015, psychiatrist Khwaja Khusro Tariq from ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' classified the term as an unsubstantiated [[Ad hominem|''ad hominem'' attack]], stating that the harshest critics of Islam are courted by both liberal and conservative media in the United States. Khusro also stated the term has been directed towards Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky, both of whom he said have never condoned violence or opined on the doctrine of Islam. He argued that there was no genuine inhibition on speaking against the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tariq|first=Khwaja|date=11 November 2015|title="Regressive Liberals": The New Mantra of Islamophobia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khwaja-khusro-tariq/regressive-liberals-the-n_b_8597284.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate= 9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Joseph Bernstein, a ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' reporter on [[World Wide Web|web culture]], wrote that according to [[Google Trends]] interest in the term "shot up" in late 2015. According to Bernstein, instead of criticising "cultural tolerance gone too far", the phrase has "become a catch-all for any element of the dominant [[new media]] culture that the anti-[[Social justice warrior|SJW]] internet doesn't like". He also suggests that even though the term can be sourced back to self-described liberal commentators like Nawaz, Maher and Dawkins, it is currently heavily used by the [[alt-right]] and other Anti-SJW Groups on Internet forums and social media as part of their rhetorical warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|date=16 March 2016|title=The Rise Of The #Regressiveleft Hashtag|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-rise-of-the-regressiveleft-hashtag#.tf71OEVY1|newspaper=Buzzfeed|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Michael's Castle''' ({{lang-ru|Миха́йловский за́мок}}, ''Mikhailovsky zamok''), also called the '''Mikhailovsky Castle''' or the '''Engineers' Castle''' ({{lang-ru|Инженерный замок}}, ''Inzhenerny zamok''), is a former royal residence in the historic centre of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. St. Michael's Castle was built as a residence for [[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul I]] by architects [[Vincenzo Brenna]] and [[Vasili Bazhenov]] in 1797-1801.  The [[castle]] looks different from each side, as the architects used motifs of various architectural styles such as [[French Baroque and Classicism|French Classicism]], [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

St. Michael's Castle was built to the south of the [[Summer Garden]] and replaced the small wooden palace of [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth Petrovna]].  Afraid of intrigues and [[assassination]] plots, Emperor Paul I disliked the [[Winter Palace]] where he never felt safe.  Due to his personal fascination with medieval [[knight]]s and his constant fear of assassination, the new royal residence was built like a [[castle]] around a small octagonal courtyard. The building with rounded corners was surrounded by the waters of the [[Moika River]], the [[Fontanka River]] and two specially dug canals (the Church Canal and the Sunday Canal), transforming the castle area into an artificial island which could only be reached by [[drawbridge]]s.

Construction began on 26 February ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] 9 March), 1797 and the castle was solemnly consecrated on 8 November 1800, ''i.e.'' on [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael's Day]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] calendar, though finishing work on the interior continued until March 1801. In 1800, the [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] [[equestrian statue|equestrian]] [[Monument to Peter I (St. Michael's Castle)|Monument to Peter the Great]] was set up in front of the castle. This statue had been designed during Peter the Great's lifetime and later, with the casting being completed in 1747 by the architect [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. By order of Paul I, the inscription "''From Great Grandson to Great Grandfather''" was made on the pedestal that is decorated with [[bas-relief]]s depicting scenes of two Russian victories over [[Sweden]] during the [[Great Northern War]].

Paul I was assassinated only 40 nights after he moved into his newly built castle. He was murdered on 12 March 1801, in his own bedroom, by a group of dismissed officers headed by [[Levin August, count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]]. The conspirators forced him to a table, and tried to compel him to sign his [[abdication]]. Paul offered some resistance, and one of the assassins struck him with a sword, and he was then strangled and trampled to death. He was succeeded by his son, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who was actually in the palace at the time and was informed of his accession by General [[Nicholas Zubov]], one of the assassins.

After Paul's death, the [[Russian Empire|imperial]] family returned to the Winter Palace; St. Michael's Castle was abandoned and in 1823 was given to the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|army]]'s [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Main Engineering School]] (later to become the Nikolayevskaya Engineering Academy and now the Military Engineering-Technical University). From then on, the building was known as the ''Engineers' Castle''. Between 1838 and 1843, the Russian writer [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] studied as a cadet at the Main Engineering School. 

In the early 1990s, St. Michael's Castle became a branch of the [[Russian Museum]] and now houses its Portrait Gallery, featuring official portraits of the Russian Emperors and Empresses and various dignitaries and celebrities from the late 17th to the early 20th century.

During the [[Terri Schiavo case|Terri Schiavo controversy]] in March 2005, a [[talking point]]s memo on the controversy was written by [[Brian Darling]], the legal counsel to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Mel Martinez]] of [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7412110/ Senator’s office produced Schiavo memo - Politics - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The memo suggested the Schiavo case offered "a great political issue" that would appeal to the party's [[Base (politics)|base]] (core supporters) and could be used against Senator [[Bill Nelson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Florida]] who was up for [[U.S. Senate election, 2006|reelection in 2006]], because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill which came to be known as the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html The Seattle Times: Nation &amp; World: GOP memo says issue offers political rewards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Nelson was nevertheless reelected as Senator on November 7, 2006 with 60% of the vote.

Martinez stated that he had not read the memo before he inadvertently passed it to [[Iowa]] Senator [[Tom Harkin]], a Democratic supporter of the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] legislation which gave [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] [[jurisdiction]] to review the Terri Schiavo case.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Then it became public knowledge.

After the existence of the memo was reported by [[ABC News]] and [[The Washington Post]], Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] denounced the memo and asserted that the Republican Party's interest in the case was solely based on moral grounds. Darling remained silent about his authorship of the memo as commentators from the conservative magazine [[Weekly Standard]] and other publications questioned its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/406istku.asp The ABCs of Media Bias&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/416virea.asp Fake but Accurate Again?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the memo had not been disclosed by either ABC News or the Washington Post. The Washington Post says that it neither implied that the memo originated from a Republican source nor that it was circulated by Republicans, though it did in fact make these assertions when it published the story by reporters Mike Allen and Manuel Roig-Franzia on its wire service on March 19, 2005. The authorship claim was removed before publication of the print version on March 20, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11250-2005Mar29.html Doubts Raised On Schiavo Memo (washingtonpost.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24015-2005Apr3.html Leaving the Anchor Desk, Its Greatest Generation (washingtonpost.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2005, Darling admitted to writing the memo, and resigned his position as legal counsel to Senator Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A32554-2005Apr6?language=printer washingtonpost.com: Counsel to GOP Senator Wrote Memo On Schiavo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for its further distribution remains a matter of dispute between Republicans and Democrats.

'''The Blackjacks''' were a [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]]. The team consisted of [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Blackjack Lanza]]. After forming in the 1970s, they wrestled in a variety of [[professional wrestling promotion]]s, including the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF). They were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

==History==

===The original Blackjacks===
The duo first joined forces in the 1970s. They were managed by [[Bobby Heenan]].&lt;ref name=WWE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/blackjacks/bio/|title=The Blackjacks Bio|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-08-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703044752/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/blackjacks/bio/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blackjacks won multiple tag team titles, including the WWA Tag Team Championship and two tag-team championships in WCCW. They, however, are most known for winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF Tag Team Championship]] (with [[Lou Albano]] as their manager) on August 26, 1975 by defeating [[Dominic DeNucci]] and [[Pat Barrett (wrestler)|Pat Barrett]].&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team Title History|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2006, The Blackjacks were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Heenan.&lt;ref name=WWE/&gt;

===The New Blackjacks===
In early 1997, Mulligan’s son, [[Barry Windham]], and Lanza’s nephew, [[John Layfield|Justin "Hawk" Bradshaw]], formed The New Blackjacks in the WWF. They were known as Blackjack Windham and Blackjack Bradshaw, who originally competed as [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], but later as [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]].&lt;ref name=SLAM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/bradshaw.html |title=John Layfield's SLAM! Profile |publisher=slam.canoe.ca |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They competed in a four-way tag team match at [[WrestleMania 13]], which was won by [[The Headbangers]]. They would then feud with [[The Godwinns]]. The team never reached the success of their predecessors and disbanded in January 1998, as Windham turned on Bradshaw.

'''''Women Who Run with the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype''''' is a book by [[Jungian analyst]], author and poet [[Clarissa Pinkola Estés]], Ph.D, published in 1992 by [[Ballantine Books]]. It spent 145 weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] over a three-year span, a record at the time.&lt;ref name="Mendoza221"&gt;Sylvia Mendoza, ''The Book of Latina Women: 150 Vidas of Passion, Strength, and Success'', Adams Media, 2004, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;. Estés won a Las Primeras Award from the [[Mexican American]] Women's Foundation for being the First Latina on the ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Legacy of Latina Leadership: Las Primeras Awardees, 1990-2014 |publisher=[[MANA, A National Latina Organization]] |url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2799c9_91617dd6a32a46f88d769ffadd86ab17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also appeared on other best seller lists, including ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', and ''[[Library Journal]]''.

Estés had been producing popular audiotapes of her stories and research and was approached by publishers to turn them into a book.&lt;ref name="Mendoza221"/&gt; 

In ''Women Who Run with the Wolves'', Estés analyses [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[Folklore|folk tales]] and stories from different cultures to uncover the Wild Woman archetype of the feminine psyche. The book stems from these interpretations of old tales and creates this wolf-woman parallel, by incorporating her own previous studies that suggest "wolves and women are relational by nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/weekinreview/conversations-clarissa-pinkola-estes-message-for-all-women-run-free-wild-like.html|title=Conversations/Clarissa Pinkola Estes; A Message for All Women: Run Free and Wild Like the Wolf|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the archetype is associated with the work of [[Carl Jung]]. Estés produces this new collection of words to describe the female psyche in ''Women who Run with the Wolves'' as it is a psychology of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the soul. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarissapinkolaestes.com/women_who_run_with_the_wolves__myths_and_stories_of_the_wild_woman_archetype_101250.htm|title=Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype - Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estés|website=www.clarissapinkolaestes.com|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
