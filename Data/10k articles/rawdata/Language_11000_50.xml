'''Albanian Sign Language''' (AlbSL, {{sq|Gjuha e Shenjave Shqipe}}) is one of the [[deaf sign languages]] of [[Europe]].  It is unrelated to other sign languages of the Balkans. 

It is relatively young, having developed primarily since the collapse of Communism in 1990. During the communist era, deaf people did not associate with each other on a regular basis. Their communication was primarily with hearing people, and so was strongly influenced by [[Albanian language|Albanian]], with extensive use of [[fingerspelling]] and initialized signs, along with some gestures borrowed from hearing people. After the collapse of communism, deaf people began to congregate and a fully-fledged sign language developed. They invented new signs to replace the former use of fingerspelling, and also came into contact with [[International Sign]] and other European sign languages, resulting in a large number of [[loan word]]s. The language continues to change rapidly, with innovations tending to radiate outward from the capital, [[Tirana]], to rural areas.&lt;ref name="Hoyer2007"&gt;

'''Angolar Creole''' is a minority [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-based [[creole language]] of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], spoken in the southernmost towns of [[São Tomé Island]] and sparsely along the coast, especially by [[Angolares|Angolar]] people. It is also called by its native speakers as ''n'golá''. It is a [[creole language]], based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with a heavy substrate of a dialect of [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]] (port. Quimbundo), a [[Bantu language]] from inland [[Angola]], where many had been enslaved.

According to their external history, the following three types of creole have been distinguished: 
#plantation creoles,
#fort creoles,
#maroon creoles
(Bickerton 1988) 

Angolar Creole is considered a maroon creole.&lt;ref&gt;http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/sum07/myths/creoles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beal conjecture''' is the following [[conjecture]] in [[number theory]]:
{{unsolved|mathematics|Is the Beal conjecture true?}}
:If

:: &lt;math&gt; A^x +B^y = C^z,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are positive integers with ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' &gt; 2, then ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' have a common [[prime factor]].

Equivalently,

:There are no solutions to the above equation in positive integers ''A, B, C, x, y, z'' with ''A, B'', and ''C'' being pairwise [[coprime]] and all of ''x, y, z'' being greater than 2.

The conjecture was formulated in 1993 by [[Andrew Beal]], a banker and amateur mathematician, while investigating [[generalization]]s of [[Fermat's last theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-supported/beal-conjecture | title=Beal Conjecture | publisher=American Mathematical Society | access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BealWebsite&gt;{{cite web|title=Beal Conjecture|url=http://www.bealconjecture.com/|publisher=Bealconjecture.com|accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, Beal has offered a monetary prize for a peer-reviewed proof of this conjecture or a counterexample.&lt;ref name="Mauldin"/&gt;  The value of the prize has increased several times and is currently $1 million.&lt;ref name="BealPrize"/&gt;

In some publications, this conjecture has occasionally been referred to as a generalized Fermat equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.math.sfu.ca/~ichen/pub/BeChDaYa.pdf | title = Generalized Fermat Equations: A Miscellany | first1 = Michael A. | last1=Bennett | first2=Imin | last2=Chen | first3 = Sander R. | last3=Dahmen | first4= Soroosh | last4 = Yazdani | date = June 2014 | publisher = Simon Fraser University | access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mauldin conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_559.htm | title = Mauldin / Tijdeman-Zagier Conjecture | publisher = Prime Puzzles | access-date = 1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tijdeman-Zagier conjecture.&lt;ref name=Elkies&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkies| first = Noam D. | title=The ABC's of Number Theory | journal = The Harvard College Mathematics Review | year=2007 | volume=1 | issue = 1 | url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2793857/Elkies%20-%20ABCs%20of%20Number%20Theory.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Moscow Mathematics|volume=4|year=2004|title=Open Diophantine Problems|pages=245–305|author=Michel Waldschmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PrimeNumbers/&gt;

==Related examples==
To illustrate, the solution &lt;math&gt; 3^3 + 6^3 = 3^5 &lt;/math&gt; has bases with a common factor of 3, the solution &lt;math&gt; 7^3 + 7^4 = 14^3 &lt;/math&gt; has bases with a common factor of 7, and &lt;math&gt; 2^n + 2^n = 2^{n+1} &lt;/math&gt; has bases with a common factor of 2. Indeed the equation has infinitely many solutions where the bases share a common factor, including generalizations of the above three examples, respectively

:&lt;math&gt;3^{3n}+[2(3^{n})]^{3}=3^{3n+2}, \quad \quad n \ge1;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(a^{n}-1)^{kn}+(a^{n}-1)^{kn+1}=[a(a^{n}-1)^{k}]^{n}, \quad \quad a \ge2, \quad k \ge1, \quad n \ge3;&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;[a(a^n+b^n)]^n+[b(a^n+b^n)]^n=(a^n+b^n)^{n+1}, \quad \quad a \ge1, \quad b \ge1, \quad n \ge3.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, for each solution (with or without coprime bases), there are infinitely many solutions with the same set of exponents and an increasing set of non-coprime bases.  That is, for solution

:&lt;math&gt;A_1^{x}+B_1^{y}=C_1^{z}&lt;/math&gt;

we additionally have

:&lt;math&gt;A_{n}^{x}+B_{n}^{y}=C_{n}^{z};&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;n \ge2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;A_{n}= (A_{n-1}^{yz+1}) (B_{n-1}^{yz  }) (C_{n-1}^{yz  }) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_{n}= (A_{n-1}^{xz  }) (B_{n-1}^{xz+1}) (C_{n-1}^{xz  }) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{n}= (A_{n-1}^{xy  }) (B_{n-1}^{xy  }) (C_{n-1}^{xy+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

Any solutions to the Beal conjecture will necessarily involve three terms all of which are [[Powerful number#Generalization|3-powerful number]]s, i.e. numbers where the exponent of every prime factor is at least three.  It is known that there are an infinite number of such sums involving coprime 3-powerful numbers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On A Conjecture of Erdos on 3-Powerful Numbers|last = Nitaj|first=Abderrahmane|year=1995|journal=Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society|volume=27|issue=4|pages=317–318|doi=10.1112/blms/27.4.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, such sums are rare.  The smallest two examples are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
271^3 + 2^3\ 3^5\ 73^3 = 919^3 &amp;= 776{,}151{,}559 \\
3^4\ 29^3\ 89^3 + 7^3\ 11^3\ 167^3 = 2^7\ 5^4\ 353^3 &amp;= 3{,}518{,}958{,}160{,}000 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

What distinguishes Beal's conjecture is that it requires each of the three terms to be expressible as a single power.

==Relation to other conjectures==
[[Fermat's Last Theorem]] established that &lt;math&gt;A^n + B^n = C^n&lt;/math&gt; has no solutions for ''n'' &gt; 2 for positive integers ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''.  If any solutions had existed to Fermat's Last Theorem, then by dividing out every common factor, there would also exist solutions with ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' coprime.  Hence, Fermat's Last Theorem can be seen as a [[special case]] of the Beal conjecture restricted to ''x'' = ''y'' = ''z''.

The [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]] is that &lt;math&gt; A^x +B^y = C^z&lt;/math&gt; has only finitely many solutions with ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' being positive integers with no common prime factor and ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' being positive integers satisfying &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt; Beal's conjecture can be restated as "All Fermat–Catalan conjecture solutions will use 2 as an exponent."

The [[abc conjecture]] would imply that there are at most finitely many counterexamples to Beal's conjecture.

==Partial results==
In the cases below where 2 is an exponent, multiples of 2 are also proven, since a power can be squared. Similarly, where ''n'' is an exponent, multiples of ''n'' are also proven. Where solutions involving a second power are alluded to below, they can be found specifically at [[Fermat-Catalan conjecture#Known solutions]].

* The case [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ≥ 3 is implied by Fermat's Last Theorem.
* The case (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (2, 4, 4) and all its permutations were proven to have no solutions by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the 1600s. (See [[Proof by infinite descent#Non-solvability of r2 + s4 = t4|one proof here]] and another [[Fermat's right triangle theorem#Fermat's proof|here]].)
*A potential class of solutions to the equation, namely those with ''A, B, C'' also forming a [[Pythagorean triple]], were considered by L. Jesmanowicz in the 1950s. J. Jozefiak proved that there are an infinite number of primitive Pythagorean triples that cannot satisfy the Beal equation. Further results are due to Chao Ko.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wacław Sierpiński]], ''Pythagorean triangles'', Dover, 2003, p. 55 (orig. Graduate School of Science, Yeshiva University, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The case ''x = y = z'' is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], proven to have no solutions by [[Andrew Wiles]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/billionaire-offers-1-million-solve-math-problem-153508422.html |title=Billionaire Offers $1 Million to Solve Math Problem &amp;#124; ABC News Blogs – Yahoo |publisher=Gma.yahoo.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The case (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (5, 2''n'', 2''n'') and all its permutations were proved for ''n'' ≥ 2 by Chen.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;
* The impossibility of the case ''A'' = 1 or ''B'' = 1  is implied by [[Catalan's conjecture]], proven in 2002 by [[Preda Mihăilescu]]. (Notice ''C'' cannot be 1, or one of ''A'' and ''B'' must be 0, which is not permitted.)
* The case (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (2, 3, 7) and all its permutations were proven to have only five solutions, none of them involving an even power greater than 2, by [[Bjorn Poonen]], Edward F.

==Prize==

For a published proof or counterexample, banker [[Andrew Beal]] initially offered a prize of US $5,000 in 1997, raising it to $50,000 over ten years,&lt;ref name="Mauldin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Daniel Mauldin |title=A Generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem: The Beal Conjecture and Prize Problem |journal=[[Notices of the AMS]] |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1436–1439 |year=1997 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199711/beal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since raised it to US $1,000,000.&lt;ref name="BealPrize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-supported/beal-prize |title=Beal Prize |publisher=Ams.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) holds the $1 million prize in a trust until the Beal conjecture is solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/beale-conjecture-1-million-dollar-prize-2013-6 | title=If You Can Solve This Math Problem, Then A Texas Banker Will Give You $1 Million | author=Walter Hickey | date=5 June 2013 | publisher=Business Insider | access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supervised by the Beal Prize Committee (BPC), which is appointed by the AMS president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/5338/20130605/1-million-math-problem-banker-d-andrew.htm | title=$1 Million Math Problem: Banker D.

==Variants==
The counterexamples &lt;math&gt; 7^3 + 13^2 = 2^9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1^m + 2^3 = 3^2&lt;/math&gt; show that the conjecture would be false if one of the exponents were allowed to be 2. The [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]] is an open conjecture dealing with such cases. If we allow that at most one of the exponents is 2, then there may be only finitely many solutions (except the case &lt;math&gt;1^m + 2^3 = 3^2&lt;/math&gt;).

If ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' can have a common prime factor then the conjecture is not true; a classic counterexample is &lt;math&gt;2^{10} + 2^{10} = 2^{11}&lt;/math&gt;.

A variation of the conjecture asserting that ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' (instead of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'') must have a common prime factor is not true. A counterexample is &lt;math&gt;27^4 +162^3 = 9^7,&lt;/math&gt; in which 4, 3, and 7 have no common prime factor. (In fact, the maximum common prime factor of the exponents that is valid is 2; a common factor greater than 2 would be a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem.)

The conjecture is not valid over the larger domain of [[Gaussian integers]]. After a prize of $50 was offered for a counterexample, Fred W. Helenius provided &lt;math&gt;(-2+i)^3 + (-2-i)^3 = (1+i)^4.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathpuzzle.com/Gaussians.html |title=Neglected Gaussians |publisher=Mathpuzzle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cape Verdean Portuguese''' ({{lang-pt|Português cabo-verdiano}}) is the variety of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] spoken in [[Cape Verde]].

== Status ==
While [[Cape Verdean Creole]] is the [[mother tongue]] of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, Portuguese is the [[official language]].  Creole is, therefore, used [[colloquial]]ly, in everyday usage, while Portuguese is used in official situations, at schools, in the media, etc. Portuguese and Creole live in a state of [[diglossia]], meaning that Portuguese is usually used in formal situations, in the media, business, education, judicial system and legislature, while Creole is preferred for informal situations as a [[vernacular language]] in day-to-day life and daily activities.

Portuguese is not spoken uniformly in Cape Verde.  There is a ''continuum'' that reveals several aspects: greater or lesser education, greater or lesser exposure to Portuguese, greater or lesser frequency in Portuguese usage, etc.

There is no institution that regulates the usage of Portuguese in Cape Verde.  Nevertheless, there are some empiric concepts about what is "correct" or "incorrect" concerning the way of speaking, resulting from:
# consensual models among people that are the more educated and/or more exposed to Portuguese;
# consensual models among scholars, language teachers, etc.
# when some linguistic phenomena occur in a systematic and regular way, they are no longer considered deviance to the standard, but rather a genuine expression of a regional community;

Another interesting phenomenon is that, if by one side the Portuguese in Cape Verde has developed some specificities, on the other side, during the years of colonization the paradigmatic models were from [[European Portuguese]], and as of today, the reference works (grammars, dictionaries, school manuals, etc.) are from Portugal.  Therefore, we are in the presence of two movements in opposite directions that happen simultaneously: on one side the Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde moves toward a development of its own characteristics, and on the other side the [[European Portuguese]] standards are still making some pressure that slows down the development of a typically Cape Verdean variety.

== Characteristics ==
The Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde is based on the [[European Portuguese]]. That's not too surprising, due to the historical relationship between the two countries, and by the fact that the language standardizing instruments (grammars, dictionaries, school manuals) are based on standards from Portugal. However, there are differences that in spite of being small are enough to set Cape Verdean Portuguese apart from European Portuguese. Despite some minor differences in the pronunciation by speakers of the northern and southern islands (see below), due to the small size of the territory one cannot say that there are dialectal divisions in the Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde, making up the Cape Verdean Portuguese on its whole a [[dialect]]al variety of Portuguese.

=== Phonetics ===
The phonetics of the Cape Verdean Portuguese and European Portuguese are close to each other. Here are the most striking differences:
# Consonants
## {{IPA|/l/}}&lt;br&gt;In Cape Verdean Portuguese {{IPA|/l/}} is '''laminal dental''' {{IPA|[l̪]}}, i.e., it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the upper teeth. It is similar to the “'''l'''” sound in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]]. &lt;br&gt;The “'''l'''” sound in European Portuguese is '''velarized alveolar''' {{IPA|[ɫ̳]}}, i.e., it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the alveolar ridge, well behind the upper teeth, with the tongue making a curve with the concavity pointing up, and the back of the tongue approaching the vellum. It is similar to the {{IPA|/l/}} in [[English language|English]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].
## {{IPA|/ʁ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{IPA|/ʁ/}} has the same variability as in European Portuguese. It is either pronounced as an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}} (more frequent in the Southern Islands) or either as an uvular trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}}, voiced uvular fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}} or voiced velar fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}} (more frequent in the Northern Islands).
## Intervocalic {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}&lt;br&gt;In Portugal, these are realized as the fricatives {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}. In Cape Verde they are always pronounced as plosives {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}.
# Vowels and diphthongs
## Unstressed open vowels&lt;br&gt;In European Portuguese there are cases when the unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} is pronounced open {{IPA|[a]}}:&lt;br&gt;- when it originates etymologically from {{angle bracket|aa}} (''s'''a'''dio'', ''T'''a'''vares'', ''c'''a'''veira'', etc.);&lt;br&gt;- when a final {{angle bracket|a}} is followed by an initial {{angle bracket|a}} (''minh'''a a'''miga'', ''cas'''a a'''marela'', ''um'''a an'''tena'', etc.);&lt;br&gt;- when the {{angle bracket|a}} is followed by a preconsonantal {{IPA|/l/}} ('''''a'''lguém'', ''f'''a'''ltou'', etc.);&lt;br&gt;- other cases harder to explain (''c'''a'''mião'', ''r'''a'''cismo'', etc.)&lt;br&gt;In Cape Verdean Portuguese there is the tendency to realize these as close {{IPA|[ɐ]}}:&lt;br&gt;- ''v'''a'''dio'', ''c'''a'''veira'', ''minh'''a a'''miga'', ''um'''a an'''tena'', '''''a'''lguém'', ''f'''a'''ltou'', are all pronounced with {{IPA|[ɐ]}};&lt;br&gt;Note that in the educated register some instances of the unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} are pronounced open {{IPA|[a]}}: ''b'''a'''ptismo'', ''fr'''a'''cção'', '''''a'''ctor'', etc.
## Unstressed initial {{angle bracket|o}}&lt;br&gt;In Cape Verde, the unstressed initial {{angle bracket|o}} is always pronounced close {{IPA|[o]}}.
## Unstressed initial {{angle bracket|e}}&lt;br&gt;In Portugal the written unstressed initial {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}. In Cape Verde, according to the word (and the speaker) it’s either pronounced {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[i]}}. Probably, the natural tendency is to pronounce {{IPA|[e]}} (in a parallel way to the initial “'''o'''”) being the pronunciation {{IPA|[i]}} resulting from European Portuguese pressure. Many Cape Verdean speakers clearly distinguish in the pronunciation certain word pairs: ''eminência'' \ ''iminência'', ''emita'' \ ''imita'', ''emigrante'' \ ''imigrante'', ''elegível'' \ ''ilegível'', ''emergir'' \ ''imergir'', etc.
## Unstressed initial “'''e'''” before “'''s'''” + consonant&lt;br&gt;In Portugal the unstressed initial “'''e'''” before “'''s'''” + consonant is pronounced {{IPA|[ɨ]}}. In Cape Verde, this “'''e'''” is not pronounced at all, beginning the word by a voiceless palatal fricative {{IPA|[ʃ]}} ('''''es'''tado'', '''''es'''pátula'', '''''es'''quadro'') or by a voiced palatal fricative {{IPA|[ʒ]}} ('''''es'''belto'', '''''es'''ganar'').
## {{IPA|/ɨ/}}&lt;br&gt;Some Cape Verdean speakers haves some trouble pronouncing the unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} sound, pronounced {{IPA|[ɨ]}} in European Portuguese (''r'''e'''v'''e'''lar'', ''m'''e'''dir'', ''d'''e'''bat'''e'''''). This trouble is solved in two different ways:
### speakers from the Southern Islands pronounce it as {{IPA|[i]}};
### speakers from the Northern Islands delete it (check point 7 farther below);&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, an epenthetic {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is never inserted after final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, as it is the case for some speakers in Portugal. Thus, in Cape Verde, ''normal'', ''barril'', ''cantar'', ''beber'' are never pronounced ''normal'''e''''', ''barril'''e''''', ''cantar'''e''''', ''beber'''e'''''.
## Unstressed /i/ and /u/&lt;br&gt;In Cape Verde there is no dissimilation of two /i/ or /u/ like it happens in Portugal. Words like ''medicina'', ''vizinho'' are actually pronounced ''me-di-ssi-'', ''vi-zi-'' and not ''me-de-ssi-'', ''ve-zi-'' like in Portugal. Words like ''futuro'', ''Sofia'' are actually pronounced ''fu-tu-'', ''su-fi-'' and not ''fe-tu-'', ''Se-fi-'' like in Portugal.
## Unstressed {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}&lt;br&gt;Speakers from the Northern Islands frequently delete these vowels.&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, either what is mentioned in this point as what was mentioned on point 5 are considered pronunciation errors by Cape Verdeans themselves.
## Diphthongs&lt;br&gt;In standard European Portuguese the orthographical sequence “'''ei'''” is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐj]}}, while the sequence “'''ou'''” is pronounced {{IPA|[o]}}. In Cape Verde these diphthongs are pronounced as the writing suggests: {{angle bracket|ei}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ej]}}, while {{angle bracket|ou}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ow]}}.&lt;br&gt;In the same way, the sequence {{angle bracket|em}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ẽj]}}, and not {{IPA|[ɐ̃j]}} like in standard European Portuguese.
## Stressed “'''e'''” before palatal sounds&lt;br&gt;In the same way as the previous point, the stressed “'''e'''” before the palatals {{IPA|/ʎ, ɲ, ʃ, ʒ/}}) is pronounced {{IPA|[e]}} and not {{IPA|[ɐ]}} like in standard European Portuguese.
## The sequence {{angle bracket|ui}}&lt;br&gt; The sequence {{angle bracket|ui}} in the word “muito” is pronounced as an oral diphthong {{IPA|[uj]}}, rather than a nasalized diphthong {{IPA|[ũj]}}.

=== Morphology and syntax  ===
In the morphology there are not big differences towards European Portuguese, being noted however the preference for some forms. The syntax reveals now and then some Creole structures that are transposed to Portuguese.
# In Portugal there are several ways for the 2nd person treatment that are expressed by ''tu'' "you (familiar)", ''você'' "you (respectful)", ''o senhor'' “sir”, ''a senhora'' “madam”, ''Sr. Dr. '' “Doctor” (or any other professional title), calling the person by its name but using the 3rd person (ex.: ''O Manuel fazia-me isso, por favor? '' “Manuel would do this for me, please”), etc. Each of those ways correspond to several levels of intimacy, levels of respect, hierarchy levels, etc.&lt;br&gt;The treatment for the 2nd person in Cape Verde is simpler, there are only two levels: ''tu'' “you” (intimacy, familiar or same age treatment) and ''você'' “you” (respectful treatment) that can be used indistinguishably from ''o senhor'' “sir” or ''a senhora'' “madam”.
# In Creole there is no specific form for the future tense. The future in Creole is expressed with the auxiliary verb “to go”. That is probably the reason why Cape Verdeans prefer using a composite form for the future in Portuguese instead of a simple form (''eu vou fazer'' “I am going to do instead of ''eu farei'' “I will do”).&lt;br&gt;The same happens with the conditional (''se chovesse eu não ia sair'' “if it rained I was not going to leave” instead of ''se chovesse eu não sairia'' “if it rained I wouldn’t leave”).
# It is frequent the usage of the interrogative in the negative form, especially when someone offers something: ''Não queres uma xícara de café?'' “Don’t you want a cup of coffee?”; ''Não precisas da minha ajuda?'' “Don’t you need my help?”.
# In Creole there are no definite articles. That is probably the reason why the definite article is sometimes not used. Ex.: ''Pedro foi'' instead of ''O Pedro foi'' “Pedro went”).
# The first person of the plural in the past in verbs from the first conjugation is not pronounced with an open {{IPA|[a]}} (even if the orthography requests that!). ''Cantámos'', ''louvámos'', ''brincámos'' pronounced with closed {{IPA|[ɐ]}}.
# Since there is no verbal inflexion in Creole, the usage of personal pronouns is mandatory. That is probably the reason why in Cape Verdean Portuguese the omission of the personal pronouns is rare. Ex.: ''Eu desço as escadas'' more frequently than ''Desço as escadas'' “I go down the stairs”.
# Also because the inflexion of words in Creole is weak, the word order is more rigid.  Creole does not allow the flexibility, the inversions and word order changes that Portuguese allows.&lt;br&gt;In every day usage, it is not natural to a Cape Verdean speaker, when speaking Portuguese, to use inversions and word order changes. For example, what in Portugal could be said ''espero eu que um dia lá chegues'' (literally “hope I that one day there you arrive”), to a Cape Verdean speaker would be more natural to say ''eu espero que tu chegues lá um dia'' (literally “I hope that you arrive there one day”).&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, it is not an impeachment to, at literary level, be used the flexibility mentioned before.
# Some frequent mistakes in Portugal, such as ''póssamos'' (instead of ''possamos''), ''tu fizestes'' (instead of ''tu fizeste''), ''tu hades fazer'' (instead of ''tu hás de fazer''), ''dei-te a ti'' (instead of ''dei-te''), etc. are not registered in Cape Verde.

=== Lexicon and semantics ===
In the lexicon and in the semantics one can notice strong influences from Creole. But the frontier between a Creole substratum in Cape Verdean Portuguese and a Creole superstratum in Cape Verdean Portuguese is not clear. Since nearly all the words in Creole originate from Portuguese, the usage of certain forms is not clear if they are Portuguese archaisms that have remained in Cape Verdean Portuguese, or if they are Creole words that were (re)introduced in Portuguese.

In some other cases, even when speaking Portuguese, is more frequent to use a Creole word than the corresponding Portuguese one.
# Some words are specific and reveal some particularities of the fauna, the flora, the ethnography, the cuisine, the climate, etc.
## ''azedinha'' ([[gooseberry]]) instead of ''groselha'';
## ''babosa'' ([[aloe vera]]) instead of ''aloe vera'';
## ''bandeja'' ([[Platter (dishware)|platter]]) instead of ''tabuleiro'';
## ''beijo'' ([[meringue]]) ''instead of suspiro'';
## ''calabaceira'' ([[Adansonia digitata|baobab]]) instead of ''embondeiro'';
## ''carambola'' ([[marbles]]) instead of ''berlinde'';
## ''fatia parida'' ([[french toast]]) instead of ''rabanada'';
## ''gaita'' ([[accordion]]) instead of ''acordeão'';
## ''geada'' ([[dew]]) instead of ''orvalho'';
## ''malagueta'' ([[chilli pepper]]) instead of ''piri-piri'', but the word [[Malagueta pepper|malagueta]] is also used in the Portuguese-speaking world;
## ''mancarra'' ([[peanut]]) instead of ''amendoim'';
## ''mel'' understood as [[sugarcane]] honey; the bee [[honey]] is known as ''mel de abelha'';
## ''passarinha'' ([[kingfisher]]) instead of ''martim-pescador'';
## ''tambarina'' ([[tamarind]]) instead of ''tamarindo'';
## ''tchota'' ([[sparrow]]) instead of ''pardal'';
## ''violão'' ([[Classical guitar|guitar]]) same usage in Brazil, but different in Portugal (''viola'');
# Other objects, ideas or expressions are expressed differently. Ex.:
## one picks up the phone saying ''alô'', and not ''estou'' or ''está'' as in Portugal, but the same in Brazil;
## what in Portugal is called indiscriminately ''mala'', in Cape Verde has several denominations accordingly to the object: ''mala'' “suitcase”, ''pasta'' “briefcase”, ''carteira'' “purse”, ''saco de senhora'' “lady handbag”, ''arca'' “trunk”, etc.;
## on the other side, what in Portugal can be called ''sobretudo'' “overcoat”, ''casaco'' “coat”, ''blusão'' “jersey”, ''kispo'' “anorak”, ''blazer'', etc., in Cape Verde is simply called ''casaco'';
## it’s said ''máquina de calcular'' (and not ''calculadora'' “calculator”), ''máquina de fotocópias'' (and not ''fotocopiadora'' “Xerox machine”), ''cartucho de tinta'' (and not ''tinteiro'' “ink cartridge”);
&lt;!-- Hidding text while the translation is not finished
## devido ao clima, a água para beber nunca é servida à temperatura ambiente, ela é servida ou «fresca» ou «gelada»; a expressão «água natural» não é conhecida em C. Verde;
## a palavra «autocarro» é usada indiscriminadamente para o que em Portugal se diferencia como «autocarro» e «camioneta»;
## os agrupamentos musicais são geralmente conhecidos como «grupos» ou «conjuntos», e não «bandas» como em Portugal; o termo «banda» é limitado às bandas filarmónicas; mais curioso ainda é o emprego no plural do nome das respectivas bandas em Portugal (os «Madre Deus», os «Trovante», os «Mesa», etc.); em Cabo Verde o nome dos conjuntos não costuma vir com artigo («Bulimundo», «Cabo Verde Show», «Finaçom», «Voz de Cabo Verde», etc. – notável excepção: «Os Tubarões»), e quando estão integrados numa frase a concordância do verbo também é feita no singular («Bulimundo» actuou…, «Voz de Cabo Verde» lançou um disco…, «Livity» regressa…, etc.);
--&gt;
# Because the closer neighboring countries of Cape Verde are francophones, in diplomatic environment or in environments more in contact with foreigners some neologisms appear, strongly rejected by scholars and purists in Cape Verde. For ex.: ''engajar'' (from French ''engager''), ''atitude revanchista'' (from French ''revanche''), ''adereço'' meaning “address” (is it from French ''adresse'' or from English “address”?). However, the fact that in Creole is pronounced “''tchanci''” makes one believe that the usage of the word ''chance'' (in Cape Verdean Portuguese) is an Anglicism (English “chance”), and not a Gallicism (French ''chance'');
# In spite of some words being used with exactly the same meaning of European Portuguese, they are also used with the meaning in Creole. Ex.:
## ''malcriado'', rebel, unsubmissive, instead of rude;
## ''afronta'', desperation, instead of outrage;
## ''pudera! '', exclamation meaning “of course!”
## ''rocha'', mountain, instead of rock
## ''inocente'', naïf, instead of innocent;
# Some meanings in Portugal are simply not known in Cape Verde. Ex.:
##''abalar'' is only known with the meaning of “to shake”, and not with the meaning of “to leave”;
## ''ilhéu'' is only known with the meaning of “islet”, and not with the meaning of “island inhabitant”;

Cape Verde has participated on the works towards the ellaboration of the ''[[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|Acordo Ortográfico]]'' — with a delegation composed of the linguist Manuel Veiga&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.governo.cv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86|title=Dr. Manuel Monteiro da Veiga – Página oficial do governo de Cabo Verde|language=|author=|website=|date=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121235041/http://www.governo.cv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the writer Moacyr Rodrigues — and has ratified the document. In 1998 Cape Verde was the host of the II [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLP]] Summit, held in [[Praia]], where the first ''“Protocolo Modificativo ao Acordo Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa”'' was signed, which removed from the original text the original date of enforcement (1994). Cape Verde has ratified this document, as well as the ''“Segundo Protocolo Modificativo”'' (April 2005), being the second country (after Brazil) to complete the entire procedure for the enforcement of the Spelling Agreement.

According to Prime Minister [[José Maria Neves]], Cape Verde is in favor of a “spell approach” between the existing variants in Portugal and Brazil and sees Portuguese as “an important tool for the development of Cape Verde”.&lt;ref name="aeiou.expresso.pt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&amp;op=view&amp;fokey=ex.stories/303279 |title=Cabo Verde: "Um instrumento de desenvolvimento" |language= |author= |website= |date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite of the Spelling Agreement 1990 having become effective on October 1, 2015,&lt;ref name="asemana.sapo.cv"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article113376&amp;var_recherche=acordo%20ortogr%E1fico&amp;ak=1 |title=Acordo Ortográfico entra em vigor em Cabo Verde e "será irreversível"|language= |author= |website= |date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the country the rules of Spelling Agreement of 1945 continues to prevail.

{{Spanish language}}
'''Chilote''' is a [[dialect]] of [[Spanish language]] spoken on the southern Chilean islands of [[Chiloé Archipelago]] (Spanish: ''Archipiélago de Chiloé'' or simply, ''Chiloé''). It has distinct differences from standard [[Chilean Spanish]] in accent, pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary, especially by influences from local dialect of [[Mapuche language]] (called ''huilliche'' or ''veliche'') and some [[conservative (language)|conservative traits]].

After the [[battle of Curalaba]] (1598) and the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities]] Chiloé was further isolated from the rest of [[Chile]] and developed a culture with little influences from Spain or mainland Chile. During the 17th and 18th century most of the archipelagoes population was [[bilingual]] and according to [[John Byron]] many Spaniards preferred to use the Local [[Huilliche]] language by considering it more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, John. El naufragio de la fragata "Wager". 1955. Santiago: Zig-zag.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, governor [[Narciso de Santa María]] complained that Spanish settlers in the islands could not speak Spanish properly but did well on veliche and that this second language was more used.&lt;ref&gt;Cárdenas, Renato; Montiel, Dante y Hall, Catherine. Los chono y los veliche de Chiloé. 1991 Santiago: Olimpho. p. 277 p&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuyo Spanish''' or '''Cuyano Spanish''' (Español Cuyano) is the [[dialect]] of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] that evolved in the [[Cuyo Province|historical province of Cuyo]] and that is now spoken in the Argentine provinces of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] and [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]]. To a lesser extent it is also spoken in the provinces of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] and [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]]. Cuyo Spanish shares a series of common traits with [[Chilean Spanish]] due to settlement history and commercial ties. Later on, under the Argentine Republic [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the dialect of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Uruguay]] influenced Cuyo Spanish.

'''Developmental dysfluency''' is considered a normal part of childhood development. About twenty-five percent of children experience some loss in fluency.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of developmental dysfluency include the repetition of sounds or pauses between words. These symptoms have generally been noted within youngsters from 18 months to 5 years of age. This may persist for weeks or months but eventually disappears due to the maturation of the child's nervous system.

ex.: "Daddy, I was, I was, um, um, I was..."

Instances like the aforementioned example indicate that the child is learning to use language. On the other hand, children with [[stutter|stuttering disorder]], will likely repeat sounds or one-syllable words three or more times. They may also prolong sounds for two or more seconds. In comparison, stuttering can be seen as a process where a word appears to become "stuck," and the person may grimace, jerk the head or neck as he struggles to overcome the stutter.

Children with normal dysfluency tend to have stuttering difficulties that come and go. Generally this is during [[preschool]] years and the problem normally ceases altogether by the time a child starts school.

'''E''' or '''Wuse'''/'''Wusehua''' ({{zh|t=五色話|s=五色话|p=Wŭsè Huà|l=Colored Language}}) is a [[Tai languages|Tai]]–[[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[mixed language]] spoken primarily in [[Rongshui Miao Autonomous County]], [[Guangxi]], [[China]]. It contains features of both Tai and Chinese varieties, generally adopting Chinese vocabulary into Tai grammar. E is a [[tonal language]]—distinguishing between seven [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]—and contains a few rare phonemes: [[voicelessness|voiceless]] versions of the more common [[nasal consonant]]s and [[alveolar lateral approximant]].

==Etymology==
The E language's unusual [[pinyin]]-transliterated name, which is also an [[Autological word|autonym]], consists of a single letter ''[[e]]''.{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|p=138}} The character, which is written "[[wikt:诶#Mandarin|诶]]" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]] and "[[wikt:誒#Mandarin|誒]]" in [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]], usually denotes an expression of affirmation.{{sfn|Unihan Database|1991}} The language's speakers also refer to their language as ''Kjang E''&lt;!-- etymology? --&gt;.{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|p=138}} ''Wusehua'' is a derogatory name for E.{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Linguistics|2003|p=207}}

==Geographical distribution==
[[File:Guilin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] people in [[Guilin]]]]
In 1992, E was spoken by about 30,000 people,{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|p=138}} but by 2008 this number had dwindled to 9,000.{{sfn|Greenhill|Blust|Gray|2008}} Most E speakers are classified as [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] by the Chinese government. E speakers live primarily in the [[Guangxi]] autonomous region of China, specifically in the [[Rongshui Miao Autonomous County|Rongshui Miao]] county and border areas of [[Luocheng Mulao Autonomous County|Luocheng Mulao]]. Villages inhabited by E speakers include Xiatan, Simo, Xinglong, and the Yonglei district. [[Ethnologue]] classifies E as rank 6b (Threatened). E speakers' most commonly spoken other languages are [[Yue Chinese]] and the Guiliu variant of [[Southwestern Mandarin|Southwestern]] [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}

==Phonology==
E's consonant and vowel inventories are mostly similar to those of its parent languages. However, it contains a few unusual consonants: the voiceless [[nasal consonants]] {{IPAblink|n̥}}, {{IPAblink|ŋ̥}}, {{IPAblink|m̥}}, and the [[voiceless alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPAblink|l̥}}. All are [[voicelessness|voiceless]] versions of consonants that, in most languages, are always [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]. E allows [[syllabic consonant]]s and [[diphthong]]s.{{sfn|Greenhill|Blust|Gray|2008}}

Like most Southeast Asian languages, including Tai and the [[varieties of Chinese]], E is [[tonal language|tonal]].{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|pp=135–144}} The language is described as having seven tones, with the seventh varying [[allophone|allophonically]] with the [[vowel length|length]] of the vowel it is attached to. With numbers ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest tone and 5 the highest, the contours of the various tones in E are as follows.{{sfn|Greenhill|Blust|Gray|2008}}

==Grammar and lexicon==
E is usually classified as a [[mixed language]] deriving ultimately from the [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] families, which both inhabit southern [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Linguistics|2003|p=207}} Some non-Chinese scholars, however, consider it a Tai-Kadai language with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] influence.{{sfn|Moseley|2012|p=72}} Whatever its classification, the grammar resembles that of the [[Tai languages|Tai]] branch of Tai-Kadai. E's grammatical features appear to be a mix of [[Northern Zhuang language|Northern Zhuang]], [[Mulam language|Mulam]], and [[Kam language|Kam]].{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|pp=135–144}} The [[Caolan language|Caolan]] language of Vietnam also displays many similarities with E.{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|pp=135–144}}

The vocabulary, however, is mostly Chinese, based on Guiliu and the Tuguai variant of [[Pinghua]].{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}{{sfn|Edmondson|1992|pp=135–144}} Out of the 2,000 most commonly used E words, only about 200 are of Tai-Kadai origin.{{sfn|Meizhin|2007|pp=2596–2620}} E also inherits elements of these Chinese dialects' [[Standard Chinese phonology|phonology]] and compound word formation.{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}} E [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is primarily [[analytic language|analytic]], with concepts such as [[affirmative and negative|negation]] expressed with auxiliary words (''pat&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') and no pronominal [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]].{{sfn|Greenhill|Blust|Gray|2008}}

In its pronouns, E distinguishes for [[grammatical person|person]] between first, second, and third; in [[grammatical number|number]] between singular and plural; and, in the case of the first-person plural, [[we#inclusive and exclusive we|between inclusive and exclusive ''we'']]. E does not, however, make distinctions for [[grammatical gender]].{{sfn|Greenhill|Blust|Gray|2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">The '''equity of redemption''' refers to the right of a mortgagor in [[law]] to redeem his or her property once the debt secured by the [[mortgage law|mortgage]] has been discharged.

==Overview==
Historically, a mortgagor (the borrower) and a mortgagee (the lender) executed a conveyance of legal title to the property in favour of the mortgagee as security for the loan.  If the loan was repaid, then the mortgagee would return the property; if the loan was not repaid, then the mortgagee would keep the property in satisfaction of the debt. The equity of redemption was the right to petition the [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] to compel the mortgagee to transfer the property back to the mortgagor once the secured obligation had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Santley v Wilde]]'' [1899] 2 Ch 474&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most mortgages are granted by [[Security interest#Statutory mortgage|statutory charge]] rather than by a formal conveyance, although theoretically there is usually nothing to stop two parties from executing a mortgage in the more traditional manner.&lt;ref&gt;Some countries have limited the grant of traditional mortgages by statute in some circumstances. For example, in [[England and Wales]] a mortgage of land may only be made by way of statutory charge or demise for a term of years absolute (a lease), see sections 85-86 of the Law of Property Act 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the courts have been astute to ensure that the mortgagee did not introduce any artificial stipulations into the contractual arrangements to impede a mortgagor's ability to satisfy obligations and reclaim the property. Such impediments are "clogs" on the equity of redemption, and the courts of equity were particularly astute&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Jones v Morgan]]|year=2001|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=995}} at para 50.&lt;/ref&gt; in striking down any provision which was, or in later cases, which may be, a clog.

Where [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is pledged in [[prime brokerage]] transactions, it is common for the broker to rehypothecate the collateral. Concerns remained, however, that because the rehypothecation might theoretically mean that the lender could lose title to the collateral, and thereby possibly be unable to reconvey it to the primary customer, it was speculated that such rehypothecation is possibly unlawful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The tide has for some years now turned against striking down every clause in a mortgage document that might conceivably impede the right to redeem.&lt;ref&gt;The tide began to turn in ''[[Biggs v Hoddinott]]'' [1898] 2 Ch 307, where it was held that, in a brewery mortgage case, a covenant to take beer from the mortgagee limited to the continuance of the security did not clog the equity of redemption, it being generally realised that an extreme response to perceived clogs undermined the commercial arrangements of the parties.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equity of redemption is itself recognised as a separate species of property, and can be bought, sold or even itself mortgaged by the holder.

Historically the equity of redemption would naturally expire upon the mortgagor breaching the terms of repayment. However, in modern times, extinguishing the equity of redemption (and leaving the mortgagee with absolute title to the property) ordinarily requires a court order in most jurisdictions. For both legal and practical reasons, the use of [[foreclosure]] as a remedy has fallen into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;Foreclosure used to be a mortgagee’s primary remedy, but "it is now rarely sought or granted." see ''[[Palk v Mortgage Services Funding plc]]'' [1993] Ch 330 at 336&lt;/ref&gt;  Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1112">'''Georges Duthuit''' (1891–1973) was a [[People of France|French]] writer, art critic and historian.

Duthuit was a key commentator on [[Matisse]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], and [[Bram van Velde]]. He maintained a close association with the [[surrealists]], particularly [[André Masson]]. In 1939, he was among the intellectuals convened for [[Georges Bataille|George Bataille's]] [[College of Sociology]]. Part of his correspondences on contemporary art with [[Samuel Beckett]] form the text ''[[Three Dialogues]]'', originally published in the literary journal, ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]''.

'''Gerda Helena Wrede-Paischeff''' (26 November 1896 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1967), better known as '''Gerda Wrede''', was a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] actor and [[speech therapist]].&lt;ref name=UF/&gt;

Born in [[Piikkiö]], Gerda Wrede attended the [[Swedish Theatre]]'s acting school in [[Helsinki]] between 1914 and 1916. After finishing her training, she worked at the theatre as an actor until 1921, and then again from 1927 to 1928. In 1931, she became the acting director of the school, and was promoted to the position of principal in 1941.&lt;ref name=UF/&gt;

She was the aunt of the film and theatre director [[Caspar Wrede]].&lt;ref name="HDSC"&gt;{{cite book|editor=John Sundholm|others=et al.|title=Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QktG6a4YnQYC&amp;pg=PA414|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7899-0|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gurdev Singh Kaunke''' (Punjabi: ਗੁਰਦੇਵ ਸਿੰਘ ਕਾਉਂਕੇ) (1949 – 1 January 1993) was a Sikh priest who served as the acting [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]] from 1986 to 1993.

==Early life==

Gurdev Singh was born in 1949 at village Kaunke Kalan under [[Jagraon]] subdivision of [[Ludhiana]] district in [[Punjab, India]]. His father was Gurdial Singh and mother Chand Kaur. Gurdev Singh's grandfather, Jathedar Totha Singh was a companion of [[Baba Nand Singh ji|Baba Nand Singh]] of Nanaksar. At a young age, Singh took the vows of the Khalsa and became an initiated Sikh. After completing 6 levels of primary school, he enrolled into [[Damdami Taksal]].&lt;ref name="NF84"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Zorawar|title=Shaheed Jathedar Gurdev Singh Kaunke|url=http://www.neverforget84.com/shaheeds/shaheed-jathedar-gurdev-singh-kaunke|website=Neverforget84.com|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jathedar of Akal Takht==
A [[Sarbat Khalsa]] was called at [[Akal Takht]] in [[Amritsar]] on 26 January 1986. At the gathering, the delegation of Sarbat Khalsa announced Jasbir Singh Rode as the [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]]. Rode was imprisoned during his appointment; therefore, the delegation assigned Kaunke to serve as the acting [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]].&lt;ref name="GoL"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Harjinder|title=Game of Love|date=2011|publisher=Akaal Publishers|location=Walsall|isbn=9780955458712|pages=96–97|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1986, the Panthic Committee held a press conference at [[Harmandir Sahib]] and declared an independent Punjabi Sikh homeland, [[Khalistan]]. Straight after the declaration, all members of the Panthic Committee escaped the scene. Subsequently, the police and army surrounded the premises and arrested Jathedar Kaunke, being the only person of significance at the complex.&lt;ref name="GoL" /&gt;

Whilst Gurdev Singh Kaunke was imprisoned, [[Gurbachan Singh Manochahal]] and later Professor Darshan Singh served as the acting [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]].&lt;ref name="MoS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walia|first1=Varinder|title=‘Misdeeds’ of stalwarts during militancy Amritsar ex-DC reveals it all|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020713/main2.htm|website=The Tribune|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1970, Singh married Gurmel Kaur through the [[Anand Karaj]] ceremony. The couple had seven children.&lt;ref name="NF84" /&gt;

==Tortured to Death==
{{third-party|section|date=November 2016}}
Gurdev Singh Kaunke was arrested by a group of police officers led by Inspector Gurmit Singh on 25 December 1992, from his home in Kaunke Kalan.&lt;ref name="IHRO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaur|first1=Gurmel|last2=Kaur|first2=Paramjit|title=IHRO Report on Jathedar Bhai Gurdev Singh Kaunke on his clandestine murder|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBzzpltvZMk|website=YouTube|publisher=International Human Rights Organization (IHRO)|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, Jathedar Kaunke's wife, Gurmail Kaur found out that he had been moved from Sadar Police Station Jagraon to the Criminal Investigation Agency (CIA) interrogation center at Jagraon. When Kaunke's wife brought food to the interrogation center, the police officer told her that Gurdev Singh Kaunke was in no shape to eat anything due to torture. This fact was also confirmed by a youth who was released on 30 December and a doctor who had seen him in custody.&lt;ref name="WSO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Balpreet|title=First Hand Account of the Murder of Jathedar Gurdev Singh Kaunke|url=http://www.worldsikh.org/first_hand_accounts_of_the_murder_of_jathedar_gurdev_singh_kaunke|website=World Sikh|publisher=World Sikh Organization of Canada|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December, Gurmail Kaur was informed that Gurdev Singh Kaunke was taken away from the CIA interrogation center. After that, Jathedar Kaunke's whereabouts could not be discovered. The police authorities claimed that Kaunke escaped from custody of 2 January 1993, after breaking a chain restraining him.&lt;ref name="WSO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramakrishnan|first1=Nitya|title=In custody : law, impunity and prisoner abuse in South Asia|date=2013|publisher=Sage|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788132109464|pages=149–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, the Committee for Coordination of Disappearances in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] (CCDP) investigated the enforced disappearance of Gurdev Singh Kaunke. The CCDP acquired conclusive evidence to show that Kaunke was inhumanly tortured first at Sadar police station of Jagraon and then at the CIA interrogation center of Jagraon from 25 December 1992 to 1 January 1993. The Committee also acquired irrefutable evidence to establish that the former [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]] was killed under torture.&lt;ref name="USCG"&gt;{{cite book|title=Congressional Record|date=25 June 1998|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|location=Washington|isbn=9780160680359|page=14238|edition=Volume 144 - Part 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police Accounts==
{{third-party|section|date=November 2016}}
The Committee for Coordination of Disappearances in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] (CCDP) led by Ram Naryan Kumar uncovered the mysterious disappearance of Gurdev Singh Kaunke through the deposition of two police officers who had personal knowledge of the incident. The first deposition was given by Darshan Singh who had been invited by Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Swaran Ghotna of Jagraon to join the police in May 1992. The other deposition was given by a serving SSP of the [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]] who was an eyewitness of the torture and death of Gurdev Singh Kaunke.&lt;ref name="WSO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IC" /&gt;

'''Independent Liberal''' is a description allowed in politics to denote party affiliation.  It is used to designate a politician as a [[Liberalism|liberal]], yet [[Independent (politician)|independent]] of the official Liberal Party of a country. Those parties were the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], or the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] of the United Kingdom, or the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]].

==Canada==
Independent Liberal Members of Parliament (or of the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislative assembly) are typically former Liberal [[caucus]] members who were either expelled from the Liberal Party caucus or [[Whip (politics)|resigned the whip]] due to a political disagreement. More recent examples, include [[Don Johnston]] who sat as an Independent Liberal from January 18, 1988 until the adjournment of parliament due to his resignation from the Liberal caucus as a result of his support of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] which the party opposed, [[Jag Bhaduria]] who sat as an Independent Liberal from 1994 to 1996 following his expulsion from the Liberal caucus and [[Dennis Mills]] who briefly left the Liberal caucus in 1996 to sit as an "Independent Liberal" to protest the Liberal government's failure to abolish the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST).

Independent Liberal candidates for parliament or the legislature have been those who generally subscribe to Liberal Party principles but either have not been selected as an official Liberal Party candidate or decline to seek the party's nomination due to a disagreement with the party on certain issues. Under the current ''Elections Act'' a candidate who is not affiliated with a political party can only describe themselves on the ballot as Independent or "No Affiliation" and cannot describe themselves in terms of an existing political party. Accordingly, no candidate for the [[House of Commons of Canada]] has officially designated themselves an "Independent Liberal" since the [[Canadian federal election, 1968|1968 federal election]] and no Independent Liberal candidate has been elected to the House of Commons since the [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957 federal election]].

A number of Quebec Liberal MPs left the party and sat as Independent Liberals as a result of the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] as they opposed the Liberal government's decision to implement conscription. The most prominent of these was [[Charles Gavan Power]] who resigned from Cabinet over the issue. Several ran for re-election in the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 federal election]] as Independent Liberals. [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s government was returned with only a minority of Liberal MPs in parliament but was able to govern as a [[majority government]] with the support of Independent Liberal MPs, most of whom rejoined the party in the course of the parliament.

==United Kingdom==
'''Independent Liberal''' is a description once used in [[United Kingdom|British]] politics to denote a form of non-party affiliation.  It was used to designate a politician as a [[Liberalism|Liberal]] who was [[Independent (politician)|independent]] of any political party, particularly of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] before its  transformation in the 1980s into the [[Liberal Democratic Party (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

Since the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] came into force, a candidate for election can no longer be described as an "Independent Liberal" on a ballot paper, as the 1998 Act prohibits any description which could cause confusion with a registered political party. In practice, the description used is either the name of a registered party or the word "Independent".

==New Zealand==
'''Independent Liberal''' was a definition in New Zealand politics in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries for Independents that aligned themselves with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]]. It is often difficult to determine whether candidates were official Liberal or Independent Liberal and many electorates had more Liberal candidates standing than seats available. From {{NZ election link year|1893}} to {{NZ election link year|1908}} the New Zealand Liberal Party was the only formalised political party to win any seats in parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18791">'''Information extraction''' ('''IE''') is the task of automatically extracting structured information from [[unstructured data|unstructured]] and/or semi-structured [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] documents. In most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of [[natural language processing]] (NLP). Recent activities in [[multimedia]] document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images/audio/video could be seen as information extraction.

Due to the difficulty of the problem, current approaches to IE focus on narrowly restricted domains.  An example is the extraction from newswire reports of corporate mergers, such as denoted by the formal relation: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MergerBetween}(company_1, company_2, date)&lt;/math&gt;,
from an online news sentence such as:
:''"Yesterday, New York based Foo Inc. announced their acquisition of Bar Corp."''

A broad goal of IE is to allow computation to be done on the previously unstructured data.  A more specific goal is to allow [[logical reasoning]] to draw inferences based on the logical content of the input data.  Structured data is semantically well-defined data from a chosen target domain, interpreted with respect to category and [[context (language use)|context]].

Information Extraction is the part of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising automatic methods for text management, beyond its transmission, storage and display. The discipline of [[information retrieval]] (IR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~guvenir/courses/CS550/Seminar/freitag2000-ml.pdf|title = Machine Learning for Information Extraction in Informal Domains|last = FREITAG|first = DAYNE|date = |journal = 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in The Netherlands|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed automatic methods, typically of a statistical flavor, for indexing large document collections and classifying documents. Another complementary approach is that of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task. In terms of both difficulty and emphasis,  IE deals with tasks in between both IR and NLP. In terms of input, IE assumes the existence of a set of documents in which each document follows a template, i.e. describes one or more entities or events  in a manner that is similar to those in other documents but differing in the details. An example, consider a group of newswire articles on Latin American terrorism with each article presumed to be based upon one or more terroristic acts. We also define for any given IE task a template, which is a(or a set of) case frame(s) to hold the information contained in a single document. For the terrorism example, a template would have slots corresponding to the perpetrator, victim, and weapon of the terroristic act, and the date on which the event happened. An IE system for this problem is required to “understand” an attack article only enough to find data corresponding to the slots in this template.

==History==
Information extraction dates back to the late 1970s in the early days of NLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.14.7943|title=Automatic Extraction of Facts from Press Releases to Generate News Stories|first1=Peggy M. |last1=Andersen|first2=Philip J. |last2=Hayes |first3= Alison K. |last3=Huettner |first4= Linda M. |last4=Schmandt |first5= Irene B. |last5=Nirenburg |first6= Steven P. |last6=Weinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early commercial system from the mid-1980s was JASPER built for [[Reuters]] by the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0115153D:US-carnegie-group-inc|title=Carnegie Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of providing [[Electronic communication network|real-time financial news]] to financial traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.61.6480|title=Information Extraction|first1=Jim |last1=Cowie |first2= Yorick |last2=Wilks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1987, IE was spurred by a series of [[Message Understanding Conference]]s. MUC is a competition-based conference&lt;ref&gt;Marco Costantino, Paolo Coletti, Information Extraction in Finance, Wit Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84564-146-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the following domains: 
*MUC-1 (1987), MUC-2 (1989): Naval operations messages.
*MUC-3 (1991), MUC-4 (1992): Terrorism in Latin American countries.
*MUC-5 (1993): [[Joint venture]]s and microelectronics domain.
*MUC-6 (1995): News articles on management changes.
*MUC-7 (1998): Satellite launch reports.

Considerable support came from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]), who wished to automate mundane tasks performed by government analysts, such as scanning newspapers for possible links to terrorism.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Present significance==
The present significance of IE pertains to the growing amount of information available in unstructured form. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[world wide web]], refers to the existing [[Internet]] as the web of ''documents'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tomheath.com/papers/bizer-heath-berners-lee-ijswis-linked-data.pdf|title=Linked Data - The Story So Far}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocates that more of the content be made available as a [[semantic web|web of ''data'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html|title=Tim Berners-Lee on the next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this transpires, the web largely consists of unstructured documents lacking semantic [[metadata]].  Knowledge contained within these documents can be made more accessible for machine processing by means of transformation into [[relational database|relational form]], or by marking-up with [[XML]] tags.  An intelligent agent monitoring a news data feed requires IE to transform unstructured data into something that can be reasoned with.  A typical application of IE is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and populate a database with the information extracted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rohini Kesavan Srihari|R. K. Srihari]], W. Li, C. Niu and T. Cornell,"InfoXtract: A Customizable Intermediate Level Information Extraction Engine",[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?iid=359643 Journal of Natural Language Engineering], Cambridge U. Press, 14(1), 2008, pp.33-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasks and subtasks==
Applying information extraction to text is linked to the problem of [[text simplification]] in order to create a structured view of the information present in free text. The overall goal being to create a more easily machine-readable text to process the sentences. Typical IE tasks and subtasks include:

* Template filling: Extracting a fixed set of fields from a document, e.g. extract perpetrators, victims, time, etc. from a newspaper article about a terrorist attack.
** Event extraction: Given an input document, output zero or more event templates. For instance, a newspaper article might describe multiple terrorist attacks.
* [[Knowledge Base]] Population: Fill a database of facts given a set of documents. Typically the database is in the form of triplets, (entity 1, relation, entity 2), e.g. ([[Barack Obama]], Spouse, [[Michelle Obama]])
** [[Named entity recognition]]: recognition of known entity names (for people and organizations), place names, temporal expressions, and certain types of numerical expressions, by employing existing knowledge of the domain or information extracted from other sentences. Typically the recognition task involves assigning a unique identifier to the extracted entity. A simpler task is ''named entity detection'', which aims at detecting entities without having any existing knowledge about the entity instances. For example, in processing the sentence "M. Smith likes fishing", ''named entity detection'' would denote '''detecting''' that the phrase "M. Smith" does refer to a person, but without necessarily having (or using) any knowledge about a certain ''M. Smith'' who is (or, "might be") the specific person whom that sentence is talking about.
** [[Coreference]] resolution: detection of [[coreference]] and [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] links between text entities. In IE tasks, this is typically restricted to finding links between previously-extracted named entities. For example, "International Business Machines" and "IBM" refer to the same real-world entity. If we take the two sentences "M. Smith likes fishing. But he doesn't like biking", it would be beneficial to detect that "he" is referring to the previously detected person "M. Smith".
** [[Relationship extraction]]: identification of relations between entities, such as:
*** PERSON works for ORGANIZATION (extracted from the sentence "Bill works for IBM.")
*** PERSON located in LOCATION (extracted from the sentence "Bill is in France.")
* Semi-structured information extraction which may refer to any IE that tries to restore some kind of information structure that has been lost through publication, such as:
** Table extraction: finding and extracting tables from documents.
** Comments extraction : extracting comments from actual content of article in order to restore the link between author of each sentence
* Language and vocabulary analysis
**[[Terminology extraction]]: finding the relevant terms for a given [[text corpus|corpus]]
* Audio extraction
** Template-based music extraction: finding relevant characteristic in an audio signal taken from a given repertoire; for instance &lt;ref&gt;A.Zils, F.Pachet, O.Delerue and F. Gouyon, [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2002/ZilsMusic.pdf Automatic Extraction of Drum Tracks from Polyphonic Music Signals], Proceedings of WedelMusic, Darmstadt, Germany, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; time indexes of occurrences of percussive sounds can be extracted in order to represent the essential rhythmic component of a music piece.

Note that this list is not exhaustive and that the exact meaning of IE activities is not commonly accepted and that many approaches combine multiple sub-tasks of IE in order to achieve a wider goal. Machine learning, statistical analysis and/or natural language processing are often used in IE.

IE on non-text documents is becoming an increasingly interesting topic{{when|date=March 2017}} in research, and information extracted from multimedia documents can now{{when|date=March 2017}} be expressed in a high level structure as it is done on text. This naturally leads to the fusion of extracted information from multiple kinds of documents and sources.

==World Wide Web applications==
IE has been the focus of the MUC conferences. The proliferation of the [[World Wide Web|Web]], however, intensified the need for developing IE systems that help people to cope with the [[data deluge|enormous amount of data]] that is available online. Systems that perform IE from online text should meet the requirements of low cost, flexibility in development and easy adaptation to new domains. MUC systems fail to meet those criteria. Moreover, linguistic analysis performed for unstructured text does not exploit the HTML/[[XML]] tags and the layout formats that are available in online texts. As a result, less linguistically intensive approaches have been developed for IE on the Web using [[Wrapper (data mining)|wrappers]], which are sets of highly accurate rules that extract a particular page's content. Manually developing wrappers has proved to be a time-consuming task, requiring a high level of expertise. [[Machine learning]] techniques, either [[Supervised learning|supervised]] or [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]], have been used to induce such rules automatically.

''Wrappers'' typically handle highly structured collections of web pages, such as product catalogs and telephone directories. They fail, however, when the text type is less structured, which is also common on the Web. Recent effort on ''adaptive information extraction'' motivates the development of IE systems that can handle different types of text, from well-structured to almost free text -where common wrappers fail- including mixed types. Such systems can exploit shallow natural language knowledge and thus can be also applied to less structured texts.

A recent{{when|date=March 2017}} development is Visual Information Extraction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|arxiv = 1506.08454|title=WYSIWYE: An Algebra for Expressing Spatial and Textual Rules for Information Extraction|first1=Vijil  |last1=Chenthamarakshan|first2=Prasad M |last2=Desphande |first3= Raghu |last3=Krishnapuram |first4= Ramakrishnan |last4=Varadarajan |first5= Knut |last5=Stolze|bibcode=2015arXiv150608454C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.21.8236|title=Visual Web Information Extraction with Lixto|first1=Robert  |last1=Baumgartner|first2=Sergio |last2=Flesca |first3= Georg |last3=Gottlob}}&lt;/ref&gt; that relies on rendering a webpage in a browser and creating rules based on the proximity of regions in the rendered web page. This helps in extracting entities from complex web pages that may exhibit a visual pattern, but lack a discernible pattern in the HTML source code.

==Approaches==
The following standard approaches are now widely accepted:
* Hand-written regular expressions (or nested group of regular expressions)
* Using classifiers
** Generative: [[naïve Bayes classifier]]
** Discriminative: [[Principle of maximum entropy#Maximum entropy models|maximum entropy models]] such as [[Multinomial logistic regression]]
* Sequence models
** [[Recurrent neural network]]
** [[Hidden Markov model]]
** Conditional Markov model (CMM) / [[Maximum-entropy Markov model]] (MEMM)
** [[Conditional random field]]s (CRF) are commonly used in conjunction with IE for tasks as varied as extracting information from research papers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ipm.2005.09.002 | title = Information extraction from research papers using conditional random fields☆ | year = 2006 | last1 = Peng | first1 = F. | last2 = McCallum | first2 = A. | journal = Information Processing &amp; Management | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 963}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extracting navigation instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Frame-based Knowledge Representation from Route Instructions|last1=Shimizu|first1=Nobuyuki|last2=Hass|first2=Andrew|url=http://www.cs.albany.edu/~shimizu/shimizu+haas2006frame.pdf|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other approaches exist for IE including hybrid approaches that combine some of the standard approaches previously listed.

==Chart==
This chart gives a partial system of [[diaphoneme]]s for English. The symbols for the diaphonemes are given in bold, followed by their most common phonetic values. For the vowels, a separate phonetic value is given for each major dialect, and words used to name corresponding [[lexical set]]s are also given. The diaphonemes and lexical sets given here are based on RP and General American; they are not sufficient to express all of the distinctions found in other dialects, such as Australian English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Juan Bautista (de) Pomar''' (c. 1535 &amp;ndash; after 1601) was a [[mestizo]] descendant of the rulers of [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], a historian and writer on prehispanic [[Aztec]] history. He is the author of two major works. His '''''Relación de Texcoco''''' was written in response to the [[Relaciones geográficas|Relación geográfica]] ca.1580.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]] and John B. Glass. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #1086, p. 355-56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to references by [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], he was born around 1535 at [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]]. He was the great grandson of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], and was of [[mestizo|mixed indigenous and Spanish]] heritage on his father's side. Considered noble by the Spaniards, he was able to obtain one of his great-grandfather's royal houses, known as the Nezahualcoyotl, in Texcoco.

Pomar was raised as a Christian but learned Aztec tradition from his mother. He was [[bilingual]] and spoke and wrote in both Spanish and the native language of the Aztecs, [[Nahuatl]]. He is credited with one of the most important compilations of [[Nahuatl]] poetry, ''[[Romances de los señores de Nueva España]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]] and John B. Glass. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #1087, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomar's major work includes an account of the [[Aztecs]] and [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolcas]] ''Relación de Juan Bautista Pomar'' completed in 1582. He interviewed aged [[Nahuas]], who recounted memory of the older and lost customs of their people. His account, written at the suggestion of the protomedic of [[Philip II of Spain]], complements with the works of [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl|Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl]]. 

Pomar also wrote an account with the intention of claiming his rights to the legacy of Nezahualcoyotl.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

She is the first Bhutanese woman to write a novel in English.

Choden was born in [[Bumthang District]]. Her parents were feudal landlords. At the age of nine, her father sent her to school in India, where she learned English.&lt;ref&gt;Avijit Ghosh.

''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]]''. 3 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She has a BA Honours in [[Psychology]] from [[Indraprastha College]] in [[Delhi]] and a BA in [[Sociology]] from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. She has worked for the [[United Nations Development Program]] in Bhutan. She and her Swiss husband currently live in [[Thimphu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zubaanbooks.com/zubaan_author_details.asp?AuthorID=16 Zubaan Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052006/http://www.zubaanbooks.com/zubaan_author_details.asp?AuthorID=16 |date=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Circle of Karma'', published 2005, is her first novel. It takes place in the 1950s, the initial period of imperially regulated [[modernization]] in Bhutan. The main character, a [[Women in Bhutan|Bhutanese woman]] and road-builder by occupation, is forced to deal both with the traditional, restrictive [[gender role]]s of pre-modern Bhutan and the new kinds of [[sexism]] developing as men gain economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Sujatha Mathai.

{{Culture of France}}
Of the '''languages of France''', the [[national language]], [[French language|French]], is the only [[official language]] according to the second article of the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]], and its [[Standard French|standardized variant]] is by far the most widely spoken.

Several [[regional language]]s are also spoken to varying degrees as a secondary language after French, such as [[High German language|German dialects]] (Alsatian 1.44%), [[Celtic languages]] (Breton 0.61%) and other [[Gallo-Romance languages]] ([[Langues d'Oïl]] 1.25%, [[Occitan]] 1.33%). Some of these languages have also been spoken in neighbouring countries, such as [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] or [[Spain]].

==Status==
{{Main|Language policy in France}}
The official language of the French Republic is French (art. 2 of the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]]) and the French government is, [[Toubon Law|by law]], compelled to communicate primarily in French. The government, furthermore, mandates that commercial advertising be available in French (though it can also use other languages). The French government, however, does not mandate the use of French by private individuals or corporations or in any other media.

A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of [[regional languages]] was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Article 75-1: (a new article): "Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France" ("Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France"). See [[:fr:Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008|Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/lang-reg/rapport_cerquiglini/langues-france.html Report] written for the government by [[Bernard Cerquiglini]] identified 75 languages that would qualify for recognition under the government's proposed ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Of those languages, 24 are indigenous to the European territory of the state while all the others are from overseas areas of the French Republic (in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and South America).

Although ratification was blocked by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] as contradicting the Fifth Republic's constitutional provision enshrining French as the language of the Republic, the government continues to recognise regional and minority languages to a limited extent (i.e. without granting them official status) and the ''Délégation générale à la langue française'' has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had ''et aux langues de France'' added to its title. The category of ''languages of France'' (in French: ''langues de France'') is thus administratively recognised even if this does not go so far as to provide any official status. Following his election as President, [[François Hollande]] reasserted in 2012 his campaign platform to ratify the European Charter and ensure a clear legal framework for regional languages (within a programme of administrative decentralisation that would give competencies to the regions in language policy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollande : "Je ferai ratifier la Charte des langues régionales"|url=http://www.eitb.com/fr/infos/politique/detail/958543/langues-regionales--hollande-fera-ratifier-charte-langues/|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=EITB|date=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional languages of France are sometimes called ''[[patois]]'', but this term (roughly meaning "dialects") is often considered derogatory. ''Patois'' is used to refer to supposedly purely oral languages,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} but this does not, for instance, take into account that Occitan was already being written at a time when French was not and its literature has continued to thrive, with a [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] for [[Frédéric Mistral]] in 1904.

It is estimated that at the time of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, only half of the population of France could speak French, and as late as 1871 only a quarter spoke French as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/transcript/357/hist-276 |title=Open Yale Courses |publisher=Oyc.yale.edu |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language education===
The topic of the teaching of regional languages in public primary and secondary schools is controversial. Proponents of the measure state that it would be necessary for the preservation of those languages and to show respect to the local culture. Opponents contend that local languages are often non-standardised (thus making curricula difficult), of dubious practical usefulness (since most are spoken by a small number of people, without any sizable corpus of publications) and that the curriculum and funding of public schools are already too strained. The topic also leads to wider controversial questions of autonomy of the ''[[région]]s''. Regarding other languages, English, Spanish, Italian and German are the most commonly studied foreign languages in French schools.

In April 2001, the Minister of Education, [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prouvenco.presso.free.fr/archi.educ.html#lang |title=Educacioun |publisher=Prouvenco.presso.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  admitted formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools.

===Cross-border languages===
Some of the languages of France are also [[cross-border language]]s (for example, [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Frainc-Comtou dialect|Franc-Comtois]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and others), some of which enjoy a recognised or official status in the respective neighbouring state or territory. French itself is also a cross-border language, being spoken in neighbouring [[Languages of Andorra|Andorra]], [[Languages of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Languages of Italy|Italy]], [[Languages of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Languages of Monaco|Monaco]], and [[Languages of Switzerland|Switzerland]].

==Statistics==
At the 1999 census, [[INSEE]] sampled 380,000 adult people all across [[Metropolitan France]], and asked them questions about their family situation. One of the questions was about the languages that their parents spoke with them before the age of 5. This is the first time serious statistics were computed about the proportion of mother tongues in France. The results were published in ''Enquête familiale, Insee, 1999''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Here is a list of the nine most prominent mother tongues in France based on ''Enquête familiale''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} &lt;!--Unsourced section ?--&gt;

|| 102% (2% of people have both French and another language as their mother tongue, thus, they are counted twice)
|}

When the people with mother tongue and people with some exposure to the language before the age of 5 (see note #3 below) are added together, the five most widely spoken languages in metropolitan France are (note that the percentages add up to more than 100, because many bilingual people are now counted twice):

* French: 42,100,000 (92%)
* Occitan: 1,670,000 (3.65%)
* German and German dialects: 1,440,000 (3.15%)
* Oïl languages (excl. French): 1,420,000 (3.10%)
* Arabic: 1,170,000 (2.55%)

===Notes on the table===
# The data in the table are about '''[[mother tongue]]s''', and not about actual language practice. It states that 14% of the adult people living in France in 1999 were born and raised up to the age of 5 in families that spoke only (or predominantly) some other languages than French. It does not mean that 14% of adult people in France spoke some other languages than French in 1999.
# Only adults (i.e. 18 years and older) were surveyed. This means that French people born between 1981 and 1999 are not included in the survey. The mother tongue of the younger generations is more predominantly French than is the case with the older generations because, as the ''Enquête familiale'' survey explains, regional and immigrant language transmission decreases dramatically with each new generation, as French replaces the regional and immigrant languages. In the ''Enquête familiale'' survey, only 35% of parents whose mother tongue was a regional or immigrant language reported that they spoke that language to their children. Thus, the 86% figure of people with French as their mother tongue is an underestimate because the younger generations whose predominant mother tongue is French are not counted.
# The concept of "mother tongue" may not give a complete idea of the phenomenon of minority languages in France. This is because there are many people who were born and raised in families in which parents spoke to them only (or predominantly) French, but in which some regional or immigration languages were also occasionally used. One example:  while the data shows that 610,000 adults in 1999 had one of the Occitan dialects as their mother tongue, the survey also found out that another 1,060,000 adults were born and raised in families in which one of the Occitan dialects was occasionally spoken. Some of these 1,060,000 people may speak Occitan as fluently as the 610,000 people who have it as a mother tongue, while some other (the majority, probably) have only a limited knowledge of Occitan. That 1,670,000 adults are speakers of Occitan cannot be corroborated, but it may be the case that the total number of people with some form of exposure to Occitan is higher than the 610,000 figure, though some of may have stopped using the language altogether since then.

'''''Lost in Translation''''' is a novel written by [[Nicole Mones]], published by Bantam Dell in 1999. It is the story of an American woman trying to lose her past by living as a translator in [[China]]. Emotionally charged and erotic, this widely translated bestseller has been universally praised for its authoritative portrayal of a China rarely captured in contemporary fiction. The novel’s accolades include the Kafka Prize for the year’s best work of fiction by any American woman, the Pacific Northwest Bookseller’s Association Book Award for the year’s best novel from the five northwestern states, and the New York Times Book Review’s ''Notable Book'' and ''Editor’s Choice''.

== Summary ==
Expatriate translator Alice Mannegan spends her nights in Beijing’s smoky bars, seeking fleeting encounters with Chinese men to blot out the shame of her racist father back in Texas. But when she signs on to an archaeological expedition searching for the missing bones of Peking Man in China’s remote Northwest deserts, her world cracks open. As the group follows the trail of the Jesuit philosopher/paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin to close in on one of archaeology’s greatest mysteries, Alice finds herself increasingly drawn to a Chinese professor who is shackled by his own painful memories. Love in all its forms–human, sexual, divine, between a nation and its history, a man and his past, a father and his daughter–drives the story to its breathtaking finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lost in Translation {{!}} Nicole Mones|url = http://www.nicolemones.com/books/lost-in-translation/|website = www.nicolemones.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews and comments ==
* Julie Checkoway: "Isn't ancestry, one's place in a personal, familial and cultural lineage, a difficult fact to ignore or erase? It is the obsessive concern with this question that drives the plot of Nicole Mones's ambitious debut novel, Lost in Translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicole Mones - Lost in Translation - Book Review|url = http://bookpage.com/reviews/173-nicole-mones-lost-translation#.Vpjf5hXhDIU|website = BookPage.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lisa See: "Mones has used her story to talk about race and racism, especially in the ways that Chinese and Americans view each other. (...) While Mones seems to be exploring issues of race and taboo, her treatment of them is finally muddled. Still, her search for (...) that enigmatic place where man and woman fall in love is thought-provoking, sometimes disturbing and undeniably entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sex, Race and Peking Man|url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20seelt.html|website = www.nytimes.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blog interview discussing her works, Mones described Alice, the main character, as "one of the few characters who really seemed to write herself". Mones also recalls her past working in China as an inspiration for Alice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NICOLE MONES: NIGHT IN SHANGHAI TOOK ME FIVE YEARS|url = http://landofbooks.org/2015/03/29/nicole-mones-night-in-shanghai-took-me-five-years/|website = Land Of Books|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"When I was young, I was close to a young man whose father was suspected of having committed a racially motivated murder during the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. in the early 1960s. The burden of second-hand guilt lay heavy on my friend, and he moved to Hong Kong and refused to return to America. Then, he was killed in an accident. Looking back, I think I started writing the novel a few years after his death in order to play out his story and give it an ending."''

The '''Matica srpska''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Матица српска}})&lt;ref name=n/&gt; is the oldest cultural-scientific institution of [[Serbia]]. Matica Srpska was founded in 1826, in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] (today a part of Budapest),&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; and moved to [[Novi Sad]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Matica}}
{{moresources|section|date=April 2018}}
Of all the Slavic [[matica]]s, ''Matica Srpska'' was the first to be established in the [[Habsburg Empire]] on the ancestral territory of the [[Raci (ethnonym)|Rascians]] (better known as [[Rascia]]) at the time of a [[Serbia|Serb]] national and cultural awakening, while under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] thralldom.&lt;ref&gt;Srbi u Vojvodini, Том 2 by Dušan J. Popović, Matica srpska, 1990, pg. 3&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matica Srpska Charter.jpg|thumb|Matica Srpska Charter]]

In the national awakening, the Serbs of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]] played an instrumental role as, by force of historical circumstance, they formed at this period the core of Serb intellectual life. One of the most important tasks facing the Serbs, in advancing cultural-national rebirth, was the solution of the literary language problem, and, as a result of the first fifty years of the 19th century, saw the [[Serbs in Vojvodina|Vojvodina Serbs]] engaged in an intense debate about the kind of literary language that their newly revitalized, emerging nation should adopt.

For the Slavic people, as well as the non-Slavs, under the [[Habsburg Empire]], the ''Matica'' foundation fomented the development of national cultures. Indeed, the oldest is Matica srpska founded in 1826 in Pest by [[Jovan Hadžić]] and his business backers, Josif Milovuk (1793-1850), Jovan Demetrović (1778-1830), Gavrilo Bozitovac (1789-1856), Andrija Rozmirović, Petar Rajić, and Djordje Stanković (1782-1853) at the same time as the [[Hungarian Academy]] was being built. Jovan Hadžić prepared its by-laws, secured its charter, and also served as its first president while Josif Milovuk served as its first secretary. In addition to books, it published the journal ''Serbski letopis'', founded two years earlier by Georgije Magarašević, [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]], and [[Lukijan Mušicki]] in [[Novi Sad]], where Magaraševic was professor and Šafárik the director of Novi Sad's Serbian Gymnasium.

The story of the Matica Srpska actually began in 1824,&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; when the Austrian authorities permitted writer [[Georgije Magarašević]], a professor at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the town of [[Novi Sad]], to publish a literary and scholarly journal entitled ''"Serbski letopis"'' (''"Serbian Annals"'').&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; Magarašević had little financial backing but soon found benefactors who supported his efforts. In time, the writers and editors of the publication developed into a learned society, successfully overcoming pressures applied by mistrustful Austrian officials as well as later financial difficulties. With varying degrees of success but with great perseverance, it has continued to support and guide Serb intellectual endeavor, first as a part of the Habsburg Empire and much later in Serbia.

In 1838, a wealthy Serb landowner, [[Sava Tekelija]], left the ''Matica'' a legacy to support Serbian students at the University of Pest and a college named after him, Tekelijanum (Tokolyanum in Hungarian). The Hungarian authorities were suspicious of the ''Matica'' and even suspended its activities in 1835–1836 for alleged pan-Slavism, but they resisted Serb efforts to move the institution to Novi Sad. In 1863 the move was nevertheless accomplished, and the ''Matica'', as well as the journal ''Letopis'', is flourishing there today.

The ''Matica Srpska'' Society was one of the initiators of the [[Novi Sad agreement]] on the [[Serbo-Croatian language]] (1954), and it led the action for making the unique orthography of the language (1960). They compiled ''The Vocabulary of Serbian Standard Literary Language'' in six volumes (1967–76).{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In [[Yugoslavia]], ''Matica srpska'' was one half of a joint project (with [[Matica hrvatska]]) to develop a common [[Serbo-Croatian]] dictionary. Mid-way through the project (1967), Matica hrvatska, in accordance with the declaration of principles about the [[Croatian language]], withdrew, and Matica srpska was left to finish the dictionary on her own.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

''Matica Srpska'' has been an example to many Slavic nations. Based on this model the following institutions were established: Czech Matica in 1831, Illyrian Matica in 1842 (in 1874 renamed to [[Matica Hrvatska]]); Matica Lužičkosrpska in 1847, Halych-Russian Matica in [[Lviv]] in 1848; Moravian Matica in 1849; Matica Dalmatinska in [[Zadar]] in 1861; [[Slovak Matica]] in 1863; [[Slovenian Matica]] in 1864; Matica Opava in 1877; Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1898. (from which Silesian Matica came to be in 1968); Polish Matica in [[Lvov]] (1882); Educational Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1885; Educational Matica in [[Warsaw]] in 1905; Bulgarian Matica in [[Constantinople]] in 1909 and the new Bulgarian Matica in 1989.

==Activities and library==
Matica Srpska publishes the ''Letopis Matice srpske'' magazine, which is one of the oldest in the world,&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; being continuously published since 1824.

The institution has already published numerous books by authors such as [[Jovan Sterija Popović]] since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.bms.rs/ebiblioteka/publications/view/4567 Publication of 1828] on the Website of the Library, retrieved on 2017-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law of the ''Matica Srpska Society'' (1986) regulates matters of endowment and legacy, given by the national benefactors, and how money is spent for various cultural and educational purposes.

The ''Matica Srpska'' has a library with over 3,500,000 books and other documents.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

A '''Media Block''' or '''Integrated Media Block''' is a component in a [[digital cinema]] [[Digital projector|projection]] system.  Its purpose is to convert the Digital Cinema Package&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/node/7120|title=The ABCs of DCPs: Unwrapping the Digital Cinema Package {{!}} Film Journal International|website=www.filmjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DCP) content into data that ultimately produces picture and sound in a theater in compliance with [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] anti-[[Copyright infringement|piracy]] [[Data encryption|encryption]] requirements.

==Terminology==

DCI specification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcimovies.com/specification/index.html|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) - DIGITAL CINEMA SYSTEM SPECIFICATION, VERSION 1.2|last=companyv|website=dcimovies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for two different security system architectures.

In the first the Media Block is outside of the projector. This design is simply referred to as a "Media Block" (MB) and is typically a device attached directly to the [[motherboard]] of a [[Digital cinema|Digital Cinema]] server.  The media block is usually connected to the projector by dual-link [[Serial digital interface|SDI]] cables.  Such media block is limited to processing [[2K resolution|2K]] output, downscaling 4K DCPs if necessary.

The second architecture describes an "Integrated Media Block" (IMB). This refers to a device attached and integrated directly into the projector, which receives image data from the server, usually via a [[Category 6 cable|cat6]] [[Ethernet]] connection.  They can process 2K and [[4K resolution|4K]] output.

Some hardware implementations integrate the entire server on a single board and are able to work both as a MB as well as an IMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr?newsID=5035|title=GDC Technology Heralds a New Era for Cinema Operation with its 6th Generation SR-1000 Media Block|website=www.dcinematoday.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gdc-tech.com/ndownload/product/SR1000/SR1000%20cover%20ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security Features==

Upon ingestion into a DCP server, [[Key Delivery Message|KDM]]s are stored on [[flash memory]] in the media block or IMB.  A KDM is written to enable the playback of a specific DCP during a specific time windows and on a specific media block or IMB, identified by its [[serial number]] during the authoring process.  Media blocks and IMBs also contain a secure clock that is set in the factory cannot be altered by the end user, which the DCP servers to which they are attached use to determine showtimes.  The secure clock prevents [[Movie theater|theaters]] from showing encrypted movies outside the times authorized by the KDM (e.g. after it has expired) by simply changing the date and time in the server's [[BIOS]].  Media blocks and IMBs also typically include [[Tamper resistance|anti-tamper devices]], designed to [[self-destruct]] the unit if unauthorized modification of its hardware, software or secure clock is attempted.

In US professional sports an '''offer sheet''' is a contract offered to a [[restricted free agent]] by a team other than the one for which he played during the prior season. Different leagues have different ways to handle offer sheets.

==NHL==
In the [[National Hockey League]], an offer sheet is a contract offered to a [[restricted free agent]] by a team other than the one for which he played during the prior season. If the player signs the offer sheet, his current team has seven days to match the contract offer and keep the player or else he goes to the team that gave the offer sheet, with compensation going to his first team.

=== Time period===
Restricted (Group 2) NHL free agents can discuss new contracts with other teams beginning on the day after that season's entry draft, which is also the deadline for a team to make a qualifying offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zielinski|first1=Missy|title=What exactly is a restricted free agent?|url=https://www.nhl.com/lightning/news/what-exactly-is-a-restricted-free-agent/c-721878|website=NHL.com|accessdate=March 5, 2018|date=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions must cease if a player accepts a contract from his own team or is confirmed to go into [[arbitration]] with his team, be it player- or team-filed.

=== Compensation ===
When a player accepts an offer sheet and his team declines to match the value of the contract, his former team is entitled to draft pick compensation in the next upcoming draft or drafts based on the averaged yearly salary of the contract. This averaged annual salary is determined by dividing the total compensation by the lesser of the number of years of the Offer Sheet or five years (the latter clause has potentially come into play with one offer sheet---offered to [[Shea Weber]] in the 2012 offseason).  These values were originally set for the 2005 offseason to coincide with the new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]], with percentage increases annually equal to the same percentage increase in the average salaries of all NHL players. The 2005 and '''2018''' offseason values are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Offer Sheet Compensation | url=https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/2018/05/2018-offer-sheet-compensation.html | publisher=Pro Hockey Rumors | date=2018-05-14 | accessdate=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team may not have two different players sign offer sheets at the same time if the value of the offered contracts would involve any of the same draft picks as compensation. For example, if a restricted free agent accepts a contract with a yearly salary of at least $8,410,977, the team can only offer to other restricted free agents contracts less than $3,364,392 per year, since those would not require any first round pick as compensation. In addition, if a team does not have a pick in the next upcoming draft available for compensation, they may not make a contract offer in the certain range where that pick is needed for compensation. Teams may not use draft picks acquired in trades with other teams, but extra acquired draft picks can influence a team's decision to submit an offer sheet.

===Effect of the salary cap===
Prior to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], teams could spend as much or as little as they wanted, therefore most offer sheets were matched. This caused offers to restricted free agents to be rare to avoid ill will amongst general managers; there were no offer sheets made in the six years prior to the lockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sabres keep Vanek by matching Oilers' $50M offer | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/sabres/2007-07-06-vanek_N.htm | last=Allen | first=Kevin | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=2006-07-06 | accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 2005 [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]], the NHL assigned a [[salary cap]] ceiling and floor for each season, so teams must spend money more wisely. This means it is more likely that general managers will offer a contract to a younger player with potential that their team does not see as much value in matching, rather saving money for other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ducks irked as Penner lands big deal with Oilers | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/oilers/2007-08-02-penner-oilers-contract_N.htm | last=Brehm | first=Mike | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=2007-08-02 | accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also leads to teams signing their own players to long-term contracts before they are eligible for restricted free agency, possibly locking them in at a lower rate than they will have to pay later, depending on each player's future performance; contracts cannot be renegotiated under the current CBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lowe's offer sheet tactic could soon become the norm | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=2958884 | last=Burnside | first=Scott | publisher=[[ESPN.com]] | date=2007-08-13 | accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time for teams to lock up players, prevent raids | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/columnist/allen/2007-10-11-allenfreeagents_N.htm?csp=34 | last=Allen | first=Kevin | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=2007-10-11 | accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential benefit to a player whose current team matches an offer sheet is that the player cannot be traded for the next calendar year.

Since the 2004-05 lockout, seven restricted free agents have signed offer sheets, and only one player has changed teams as the result of an offer sheet: [[Dustin Penner]] prior to the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]]. Penner is also the only player since 1997 ([[Chris Gratton]]) to change teams via an offer sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hjalmarsson Fallout, GM’s to Trust, and Should Penguins Retire Jagr’s Number? | url=http://thehockeywriters.com/hjalmarsson-fallout-gms-to-trust-and-should-penguins-retire-jagrs-number/ | last=Colligan | first=Mike | date=2010-07-13 | accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk invested in real and cap dollars along with the negative reaction to an offer sheet has led to the act of signing an offer sheet becoming rare under the current CBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Is-the-restricted-free-agent-offer-sheet-becomin?urn=nhl,178746 | title=Is the restricted free-agent offer sheet becoming extinct? | publisher=[[Yahoo!

=== NHL Players signing offer sheets ===
{{Main|List of NHL players who have signed offer sheets}}

==NBA==
The [[National Basketball Association]] uses the term offer sheet to refer to a contract offered by another team to a restricted free agent of at least one year. His current team has two days to match the offer or lose the player to the new team. However, unlike NHL offer sheets, NBA offer sheets do not require a team to relinquish a draft pick or other compensation.

==NFL==
The [[National Football League]] uses the term offer sheet to refer to an offer made by another team to a restricted free agent. If the restricted free agent accepts an offer sheet from a new club, his old club has "right of first refusal", a five-day period in which it may match the offer and retain him, or choose not to match the offer, in which case it may receive one or more draft picks for the upcoming draft from the player's new club. If an offer sheet is not executed, the player's rights revert to his old club the day after negotiations must end.

'''Ongota''' (also known as Birale, Birayle) is a [[moribund language]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. UNESCO reported in 2012 that out of a total ethnic population of 115, only 12 elderly native speakers remained, the rest of their small village on the west bank of the [[Weito River]] having adopted the [[Tsamai language]] instead.&lt;ref name="ongota1"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/download.php?versionID=16679 Nomination File No. 00493 For Inscription on The List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need Of Urgent Safeguarding In 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The default word order is [[subject–object–verb]]. The classification of the language is obscure (Sava &amp; Tosco 2015).

==History of the people==
{{Off-topic|Ongota people|date=April 2015}}
Oral history of the Ongota tells that they originated from a number of different populations from Dikinte, Maale and Arbore among others. During a stay in Maale territory, which today lies at their north, the collection of clans were chased south due to their hunting of Maale livestock. They followed the banks of the [[Weito River]] until they reached the Arbore, where they were turned away back north and settled where they are today. This account differs from that of the Maale, who claim that the Ongota were originally a part of the Maale who migrated and did not return.&lt;ref name="Sava, Graziano 2010. pp. 213"&gt;Sava, Graziano, &amp; Thubauville, Sophia, 2010. “The Ongota : a branch of the Maale? ; ethnographic, historic and linguistic traces of contact of the Ongota people.” In ''"To live with others: essays on cultural neighborhood in southern Ethiopia''", edited by E. Gabbert, &amp; S. Thubauville, (pp. 213‐235). Koln: Koppe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Ongota has features of both [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] languages that confuse its classification, and linguists and anthropologists have been unable to clearly trace its linguistic roots so far. Savà and Tosco (2007) claim that Ongota's morphology is [[Tsamai language|Ts'amakko]] and that ~50% of the lexicon can be connected to Ts'amakko roots. They also report that Aklilu Yilma of [[Addis Ababa University]] considers Ongota to be a pidginised creole. They state that this "conclusion is strengthened by a local legend stating that Ongota originated from a multiethnic melting pot."  They further report that [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] considers Ongota to be [[Cushitic]], Vaclav Blaz̆ek (1991, 2001, and forth.) Nilo-Saharan, and Cushiticist Maarten Mous (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Savà, Graziano and M. Tosco (2007). Review article of: Harold C. Fleming Ongota: A Decisive Language in African Prehistory. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz: 2006. In: Aethiopica 10 (2007): 223-232.p. 1. - "Ongota is also mentioned as an isolate (see, for example, Mous 2003)" http://www.maurotosco.net/ewExternalFiles/SAVA%26TOSCO_review_FLEMING_Aethiopica_2007.pdf ||| Mous, Maarten (2003). “Loss of linguistic diversity in Africa”. In: Mark Janse – Sijmen Tol (eds.) Language Death and Language Maintenance: Theoretical, Practical and Descriptive Approaches. Benjamins, Amsterdam: 157–170. p. 164. 5. Isolates - "Ongota is an unclassified language with 8 speakers in southwest Ethiopia shifting to a minority Cushitic language, Ts'amakko (Savä, this volume)." http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=10.1.1.218.5996&lt;/ref&gt; mentions it as a [[language isolate]]. Savà and Tosco (2003, 2007), themselves, believe it to be an [[East Cushitic]] language with a Nilo-Saharan [[substratum]]—that is, that Ongota speakers shifted to East Cushitic from an earlier Nilo-Saharan language, traces of which still remain. [[Harold C. Fleming|Fleming]] (2006) considers it to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic. Bonny Sands (2009) believes Savà and Tosco's proposal to be the most convincing proposal. Sava &amp; Tosco (2015) leave it unclassified, possibly an isolate but possibly so affected by superstrate influence that the original affiliation of the language has been obscured.

==Decline==
The main mechanism behind the decline of Ongota is marriage with other communities. In a brief expedition in the early 1990s, a number of researchers made the observation that many Ongota men married Tsamakko women. The child would grow up speaking only the mother's language, but not the father's. (Mikesh, P. et al., 1992–1993) This trend has continued through the recent years.&lt;ref name="Sava, Graziano 2010. pp. 213"/&gt;

'''Paicî''' is the most widely spoken of the two dozen languages on the main island of [[New Caledonia]]. It is spoken in a band across the center of the island, from [[Poindimié]] to [[Ponérihouen]].

==Phonology==

Paicî has a rather simple inventory of consonants, compared to other languages of New Caledonia, but it has an unusually large number of nasal vowels. Paicî syllables are restricted to [[consonant|C]][[vowel|V]].&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;Gordon &amp; Maddieson ([[#GM|1996]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===

| || || {{IPA|ɾ̠}} || ||
|-
! colspan=2|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
| || || {{IPA|l̠}} || {{IPA|j}} || {{IPA|w}}
|}

The palatal stops could be considered affricates because they occur with a heavily fricated release. The lateral and tap do not occur word-initially, except in a few loanwords and the prefix {{IPA|/ɾɜ/}} ''they''.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;

Because nasal stops are always followed by nasal vowels, but prenasalized stops are always followed by oral vowels, it might be argued that nasal and prenasalized stops are [[allophone|allophonic]], which would reduce the Paicî consonant inventory to 13.

===Vowels===
Paicî has a symmetrical system of ten oral vowels, all found both long and short without any significant difference in quality, and seven nasal vowels, some of which may also be long and short. Because sequences of two short vowels may carry two tones but long vowels are restricted to carrying one tone, they appear to be phonemically long vowels rather than sequences.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;

===Tones===
Like its neighbour [[Cèmuhî]], Paicî is one of the few [[Austronesian languages]] which have developed [[tone (linguistics)|contrastive tone]],&lt;ref&gt;Rivierre ([[#tones|1974]]).&lt;/ref&gt; involving three registers: high, mid, low. Additionally, there are vowels with no inherent tone, whose tone is determined by their environment. Words commonly have the same tone on all vowels, so tone may belong to the word rather than the syllable.

In [[philately]] a '''parcel stamp''' is a stamp specifically issued to pay the fee for the transport of a [[Package delivery|parcel]] through the [[postal system]] and usually marked as such. It is to be distinguished from a [[postage stamp]] used to pay the cost of posting a parcel, although there may no practical distinction as far as the sender is concerned. Parcel stamps issued by governments have the same status in philately as postage stamps, but parcel stamps issued by private railway companies or road carriers are regarded as [[cinderella stamps]] and many parcel stamps are also [[railway stamp]]s. 

The ''international'' parcel post service was established by the [[Universal Postal Union]] on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Postal Union: Its History and Progress.

[https://www.webcitation.org/6IVeZU7LR Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
Belgium has a long history of railway parcel stamps with the first being issued for the Belgian State Railways in 1879.&lt;ref name=mackay&gt;[[James A. Mackay|Mackay, James]]. ''Stamp Collecting: Philatelic Terms Illustrated''. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2003, p. 99. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous different series have been issued since then.

==Britain==
Britain has not issued any stamps inscribed specifically for parcels, but several stamps have been [[overprint]]ed with the words '''Govt. Parcels''' (Government Parcels). The overprints have been widely forged.

A wide variety of parcel stamps have been issued in Britain by private road operators including bus and [[tram]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Beech|Beech, David]]. ''[https://www.webcitation.org/60dkKph7p Great Britain and Ireland: The Carriage of Parcels by Tramway and Omnibus: Services and Stamps].'' London: [[British Library]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
The first Italian parcel stamps were issued in 1884 and since 1914 they have been in two parts&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt; marked ''pacchi postali''. The right hand part was retained by the sender as a receipt and the left hand part applied to the parcel.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R.J. &amp; Anthony, K.W. ''The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia'', Stanley Paul, London, 1966, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909/10, over 14 million parcels were being sent annually in Italy.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Chester Lloyd, [https://archive.org/details/jstor-1820220 "The Parcel Post in Foreign Countries"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 22, No. 6 (June 1914), pp. 509–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The United States==
The first and last U.S. parcel stamps were issued in 1912, along with parcel [[postage due]] stamps.&lt;ref name=mackay/&gt;  In this series, which was soon discontinued, the 20-cent value is noteworthy for being the first postage stamp in the world to depict an [[airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1847usa.com/ByYear/1912.htm The Parcel Post Issues of 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7492">A '''phase vocoder''' is a type of [[vocoder]] which can [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]] both the [[frequency]] and [[time domain]]s of audio signals by using [[Phase (waves)|phase]] information.  The computer [[algorithm]] allows [[frequency-domain]] modifications to a digital sound file (typically [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time expansion/compression and pitch shifting]]).

At the heart of the phase vocoder is the [[short-time Fourier transform]] (STFT), typically coded using [[fast Fourier transform]]s. The STFT converts a [[time domain]] representation of sound into a [[time-frequency representation]] (the "analysis" phase), allowing modifications to the amplitudes or phases of specific frequency components of the sound, before resynthesis of the time-frequency domain representation into the time domain by the inverse STFT. The time evolution of the resynthesized sound can be changed by means of  modifying the time position of the STFT frames prior to the resynthesis operation
allowing for time-scale modification of the original sound file.

== Phase coherence problem ==
The main problem that has to be solved for all cases of manipulation of the STFT is the fact that individual signal components (sinusoids, impulses) will be spread over multiple frames and multiple STFT frequency locations (bins).  This is because the STFT analysis is done using overlapping [[Window function|analysis windows]]. The windowing results in [[spectral leakage]] such that the information of individual sinusoidal components is spread over adjacent STFT bins. To avoid border effects of tapering of the  analysis windows, STFT analysis windows overlap in time. This time overlap results in the fact that adjacent STFT analyses are strongly correlated (a sinusoid present in analysis frame at time "t" will be present in the subsequent frames as well). The problem of signal transformation with the phase vocoder is related to the problem that all modifications that are done in the STFT representation need to preserve the appropriate correlation between adjacent frequency bins (vertical coherence) and time frames (horizontal coherence). Except in the case of extremely simple synthetic sounds, these appropriate correlations can be preserved only approximately, and since the invention of the phase vocoder research has been mainly concerned with finding algorithms that would preserve the vertical and horizontal coherence of the STFT representation after the modification. The phase coherence problem was investigated for quite a while before appropriate solutions emerged.

== History ==
The phase vocoder was introduced in 1966 by Flanagan as an algorithm that would preserve horizontal coherence between the phases of bins that represent sinusoidal components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01706.x|author=Flanagan J.L. and Golden, R. M.|title=Phase vocoder|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=45|pages=1493–1509|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original phase vocoder did not take into account the vertical coherence between adjacent frequency bins, and therefore, time stretching with this system did produce sound signals that were missing clarity.

The optimal reconstruction of the sound signal from STFT after amplitude modifications has been proposed by Griffin and Lim in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TASSP.1984.1164317|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.306.7858&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|author=Griffin D. and Lim J.|title=Signal Estimation from Modified Short-Time Fourier Transform|journal=IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing|volume=32|issue=2|pages= 236–243|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm does not consider the problem of producing a coherent STFT, but it does allow finding the sound signal that has an STFT that is as close as possible to the modified STFT even if the modified STFT is not coherent (does not represent any signal).

The problem of the vertical coherence remained a major issue for the quality of time scaling operations until 1999 when Laroche and Dolson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a means to preserve phase consistency across spectral bins. The proposition of Laroche and Dolson has to be seen as a turning point in phase vocoder history. It has been shown that by means of ensuring vertical phase consistency  very high quality time scaling transformations can be obtained.

The algorithm proposed by Laroche did not allow preservation of vertical phase coherence for sound onsets (note onsets). A solution for this problem has been proposed by Roebel.&lt;ref&gt;Roebel A., "A new approach to transient processing in the phase vocoder", DAFx, 2003.

== Use in music ==
British composer [[Trevor Wishart]] used phase vocoder analyses and transformations of a human voice as the basis for his composition ''Vox 5'' (part of his larger [[Vox Cycle]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, T. "The Composition of Vox 5". Computer Music Journal 12/4, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Transfigured Wind]]'' by American composer [[Roger Reynolds]] uses the phase vocoder to perform time-stretching of flute sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Serra, X. '[http://mtg.upf.edu/node/304 A System for Sound Analysis/Transformation/Synthesis based on Deterministic plus Stochastic Decomposition]', p.12 (PhD Thesis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The music of [[JoAnn Kuchera-Morin]] makes some of the earliest and most extensive use of phase vocoder transformations, such as in ''Dreampaths'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;[[Curtis Roads|Roads, Curtis]] (2004). ''Microsound'', p.318. MIT Press. {{ISBN|9780262681544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proprietary [[Auto-Tune]] pitch-correcting software, widely used in commercial music production, is based on the phase vocoder principle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In [[music]], a '''reduction''' is an [[arrangement]] or [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of an existing [[sheet music|score]] or [[musical composition|composition]] in which complexity is lessened to make [[musical analysis|analysis]], performance, or practice easier or clearer; the number of [[part (music)|parts]] may be reduced or [[rhythm]] may be simplified, such as through the use of [[block chord]]s.

==Orchestral==

An '''orchestral reduction''' is a [[sheet music]] arrangement of a work originally for full symphony [[orchestra]] (such as a symphony, overture, or opera), rearranged for a single instrument (typically [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]), a smaller orchestra, or a [[chamber ensemble]] with or without a keyboard (e.g. a [[string quartet]]). A reduction for solo piano is sometimes called a [[#Piano|piano reduction]] or ''piano score''.

During opera rehearsals, a [[répétiteur]] (piano player) will typically read from a piano reduction of the opera. When a choir is learning a work scored for choir and full orchestra, the initial rehearsals will usually be done with a pianist playing a piano reduction of the orchestra part. Before the advent of the [[phonograph]], arrangements of orchestral works for solo piano or [[piano four hands]] were in common use for enjoyment at home.

A reduction for a smaller orchestra or chamber ensemble may be used when not enough players are available, when a venue is too small to accommodate the full orchestra, to accompany less powerful voices, or to save money by hiring fewer players.

==Piano==
&lt;!--[[Piano transcription]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
A '''piano reduction''' or '''piano transcription''' is [[sheet music]] for the [[piano]] (a ''piano score'') that has been compressed and/or simplified so as to fit on a two-line staff and be playable on the piano. It is also considered a style of [[orchestration]] or music [[arrangement]] less well known as ''contraction scoring'', a subset of [[elastic scoring]].

The most notable example is [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|transcriptions]] for solo piano of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s symphonies, which are arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Reflections_on_Liszt.html?id=4URhKNWu0XQC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], a piano reduction should "only be like the view of a sculpture from ''one'' viewpoint", and he advises that [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|thickness]] should largely be ignored, since "the attempt to make a useful object equally usable for a variety of purposes is usually the way to spoil it completely".&lt;ref name="The Modern Piano Reduction"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Arnold |year=1975 |chapter=The Modern Piano Reduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbXtxJezk5cC&amp;pg=PA348 |title=Style and Idea: Selected Writings of Arnold Schoenberg |pages=348–350 |isbn=978-0-520-05294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay''' ({{lang-bn|শরদিন্দু বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়}}; 30 March 1899 – 22 September 1970) was a Bengali writer. He was also actively involved with [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] as well as [[Bollywood]]. His most famous creation is the fictional detective [[Byomkesh Bakshi]].

He wrote different forms of prose: novels, short stories, plays and [[screenplays]]. However, his forte was short stories and novels. He wrote historical fiction like ''Kaler Mandira'', ''GourMollar'' (initially named as ''Mouri Nodir Teere''), ''Tumi Sandhyar Megh'', ''Tungabhadrar Teere'' (all novels), ''Chuya-Chandan'', ''Maru O Sangha'' (later made into a Hindi film named ''Trishangni'') and stories of the supernatural with the recurring character ''Baroda, the Ghost Investigator''. Besides, he wrote many songs and poems.

==Personal life and education==
He was born to Tarabhushan and Bijaliprabha Bandyopadhyay at his maternal grandparents' home in Jaunpur, United Province, India. The family hailed from Purnea, Bihar, India. He passed the matriculation examination in 1915 and took admission in [[Vidyasagar College]], [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. While studying there, he published his first work, ''Jaubansmriti'', a collection of poems, at the age of 20. In 1919, he passed the B.A. examination. He studied law in [[Patna]] and then devoted his time to writing.

==Critical review==
Bandyopadhyay wrote short stories, [[historical novels|historical]] as well as social novels, poems, [[songs]], essays, and stage plays. He also wrote several [[screen play]]s, some of which were based on his other writings. His stories are always very short and generally have a twist ending; in this respect, he can be compared to another prominent author, [[Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay]], a.k.a. [[Bonoful]]. Humor, wit and satire are prevalent in his work. The main theme of most of his writings is romance. He was very selective and a perfectionist.

==Career==
The first [[Byomkesh Bakshi]] work appeared in 1932. One of his earliest stories, ''Raktasandhya'', appeared in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in 1939 and was later included in ''The Scarlet Dusk'' (2003), a collection of 5 of his stories translated into English.
He moved to [[Mumbai]] in 1938 to write screenplays for [[Bombay Talkies]] and other film banners. He gave up ties with the film industry in 1952, and moved to [[Pune]], to concentrate on writing. He wrote several ghost stories, historical romances and children's stories in Bengali over the next 18 years{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==Characters==

===Byomkesh Bakshi===
''[[Byomkesh Bakshi]]'' is a detective. He calls himself ''Satyanweshi'' or the truth-seeker. {{Main|Byomkesh Bakshi}}

===Boroda===
''Boroda'' is a ghost-hunter and in writer's words Bhootanweshi. Like the Mejokorta of [[Premendra Mitra]], he has direct interactions with ghosts. In ''Byomkesh O Boroda'', the two characters meet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''sports ticket derivative''' is a type of [[futures contract]] specifically for sports tickets.  Typical terms of a ticket future contract stipulate that a ticket to a specific game (typically a championship game, such as [[Super Bowl]] or [[World Series]]) is delivered to the holder of the contract contingent on a specific team making it to that event.  Ticket futures were first offered by [[yoonew]] in 2004, under the title of '''Team Fantasy Seats'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.forbes.com/home/entrepreneurs/2005/12/21/yoonew-ticketmaster-tickets-cx_bn_1222yoonew.html | title=Forbes - "Final Four Tickets at 80% Off" | date=22 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sports ticket futures were first offered in 2004 by [[yoonew]].  They came in the form of '''Team Fantasy Seats''' which allowed investors and fans to buy a contract for a [[Super Bowl]] or [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] ticket contingent on a specific team reaching the event.

As of September, 2008, [[yoonew]] has offered '''sports ticket derivatives''' for the [[Super Bowl]], [[NFC Championship Game]], [[AFC Championship Game]], [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Final Four]], College Football [[BCS National Championship Game]], [[NBA Finals]], MLB [[World Series]], [[Stanley Cup Finals]], and [[UEFA European Football Championship]]. Launching in 2011 Ticketscore.com is the current leader within this marketplace offering ticket derivatives for the NFL,MLB,NHL,NBA and major collegiate sports.

==How it works==
For example, you could purchase a Team Fantasy Seat through [[yoonew]] for the [[New York Giants]] at a market-based price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/super-bowl-tickets-at-a-fraction-of-the-price-super-deal-or-super-swindle/ | title= Super Bowl Tickets At A Fraction Of The Price: Super Deal Or Super Swindle?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Giants make it to the [[Super Bowl]], the holder of the contract receives a [[Super Bowl]] ticket at no additional cost. Ticketscore.com allows you to buy into a price reduced team contract and pay over a term of up to 26 weeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1405">In [[digital telephony]], a '''talkspurt''' is a continuous segment of [[speech]] between [[silence|silent]] intervals where only [[background noise]] can be heard. Segmenting speech streams into talkspurts allows bandwidth to be conserved by not sending excess data in silent intervals, and also allows [[synchronization]], [[Data buffer|buffering]] and other parameters of the communications system to be readjusted in the intervals between talkspurts.

The term "talkspurt" is not a recent coinage: it was in use as long ago as 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orion.research.bell-labs.com/BSTJ/images/Vol38/bstj38-2-353.pdf|title=Engineering aspects of TASI|author=K.

The talkspurt/silence distinction is used in a wide variety of digital speech transport systems, including [[GSM]] and [[packetized speech]] systems such as [[voice over IP]].

Silence between talkspurts may sometimes be replaced by [[comfort noise]].

'''Terminology planning''' is a [[planning]] activity for developing [[domain communication]] largely according to the needs and requirements of [[knowledge representation]]. Domain-specific conventions of knowledge representation &amp;mdash; depending on the domain as such or text within a domain, may comprise not only linguistic representation of [[concept]]s (i.e.[[term (language)|terms]]), but also all kinds of non-linguistic representations (e.g. [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, [[formula]]e, [[number]]s, [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[depiction]]s). Therefore, to different degrees depending on the particular domain, terminology planning may have to take into account these non-linguistic representations as well.

== Terminology Planning and Language Planning ==
While the focus of [[language planning]] is the deliberate manipulation and development of a linguistic entity to improve [[communication]] in society or a [[language community]] at large, terminology planning may be [[language]] independent or in its objective across languages, aiming at the improvement of communication in a specific domain or application thereof. 

While terminology planning is an important part of language planning it may be useful for language communities to separate the two activities for simplification of its complexity in order to better focus programmes and resources, and thus receive better results.

Because language planning also concerns the development of the lexicon of a language, and because domain communication consists to a great extent of linguistic representations of concepts there exists a large area of overlapping between the two concepts. The biggest difference lies in the different point of view and scope (and goal).

== Terminology Policy ==
Public strategy formulated at the level of political decision-making in a more or less autonomous language community with the aim of developing or regulating emerging or existing terminologies for an array of purposes. Examples of such regulated terminologies are the hundreds of standards that the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] publishes on an ongoing basis.

*ISO 2424:2007 Textile floor coverings &amp;mdash; Vocabulary
*ISO 3918:2007 Milking machine installations &amp;mdash; Vocabulary
*ISO 9999:2007 Assistive products for persons with disability &amp;mdash; Classification and terminology
*ISO 23718:2007 Metallic materials &amp;mdash; Mechanical testing &amp;mdash; Vocabulary
*ISO/TR 24098:2007 Intelligent transport systems &amp;mdash; System architecture, taxonomy and terminology

== Target groups of terminology planning policies ==
[[Strategic planning]] of terminology work and terminology resources is not only a matter of concern for [[government]]s and other [[public administration]]. Furthermore, due to the crucial role of terminology for [[scientific-technical planning]], [[industry]], [[risk communication]] and [[business]] communication processes, as well as basically any other event of domain communication, terminology planning policies play an increasing role for [[corporate]] communication of all types ([[Commerce|commercial]], [[non-commercial]]). Especially [[Company|enterprises]] increasingly feel the need for a systematic terminology planning in connection with corporate language or [[language localization]] and [[translation]] questions.

However, despite the need for strategic terminology planning the term "Terminology Planning/Policies" has not caught on in these communities and may be referred to in a variety of other terms. A meta-language is required.

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]] and in [[religion]], '''testimony''' is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''testis'', referring to the notion of a disinterested [[Third-party source|third-party]] witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testify|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testify |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testimony|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testimony |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In the [[law]], testimony is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is obtained from a [[witness]] who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by [[oath]] or [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] under penalty of [[perjury]]. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an [[expert witness]], testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. 

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
 
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as "consistent with" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a "match". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an [[Objection (law)|objection]], which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* [[best evidence rule]]
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* [[compound question]] or narrative
* [[hearsay]]
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words "irrelevant" and "immaterial" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* [[leading question]]
* [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* vague
* [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate issue testimony]]
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the [[United States]], an attorney often had to follow an objection with an '''exception''' to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to "take an exception" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to [[Witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness. This may be done using [[cross-examination]], calling into question the witness's [[Competence (law)|competence]], or by attacking the [[Character evidence|character]] or [[Habit evidence|habit]] of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

==Religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fasting]] --&gt;
[[Christians]] in general, especially within the [[Evangelical]] tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own [[baptism]] or at [[evangelistic]] events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet.

===Types===
Many [[Holiness movement|holiness]] churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life.

In the [[Religious Society of Friends]], the word ''testimony'' is used to refer to the ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] ''testify'' or ''bear witness'' to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word ''testimony'' refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which ''testifies'' to their beliefs. Common areas which modern [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] are said to testify are [[peace testimony|testimony towards peace]], [[testimony of simplicity|testimony to simplicity]], [[testimony of integrity|testimony to truth and integrity]], [[testimony of equality|testimony to equality]].

In some [[religion]]s (most notably [[Mormonism]] and [[Islam]]) many adherents testify as a profession of their [[faith]], often to a congregation of believers. In [[Mormonism]], testifying is also referred to as "bearing one's testimony," and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]]—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within [[Mormon]] [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], the word "testimony"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://lds.org/study/topics/testimony?lang=eng |contribution= Testimony |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become synonymous with "belief." Although testimony and belief are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having "lost their testimony."

==Literature==
[[File:Bataan Death March Testimonies.jpg|thumb|[[Bataan Death March|Bataan Death March Testimonies]]]]
Some published [[oral history|oral]] or written [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[narrative]]s are considered "testimonial [[literature]]" particularly when they present [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[first-person narrative|first person]] accounts of [[human rights]] abuses, [[violence]] and [[war]], and living under conditions of social [[oppression]]. This usage of the term comes originally from [[Latin America]] and the Spanish term ''"testimonio"'' when it emerged from human rights [[tribunal]]s,  [[truth commissions]], and other [[international human rights instruments]] in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is ''[[I, Rigoberta Menchú]]''. The autobiographies of [[Frederick Douglass]] can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this [[genre]].

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], a testimony is known as statements that are based on personal experience or personal knowledge. A statement is accepted on the basis of person's testimony if his or her asserting it renders it acceptable. We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:
# The claim is implausible;
# The person or the source in which the [[Cause of action|claim]] is quoted lacks [[credibility]];
# The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own [[experience]] and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A practical study of Argument|edition=6th|author=[[Trudy Govier]]|origyear=1985|year=2005|isbn=9780534605254}} For the notion of testimony in general, and especially after David Hume, see the seminal research by C. A. J. Coady, Testimony: A Philosophical Study, Oxford 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vinayaka Krishna Gokak''' (9 August 1909 – 28 April 1992) was a major writer in the [[Kannada language]] and a scholar of English and [[Kannada literature]]s. He was the fifth writer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; to be honoured with the [[Jnanpith Award]] in 1990 for [[Kannada language]], for his [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''Bharatha Sindhu Rashmi''. Bharatha Sindhu Rashmi deals with the [[Vedic period|Vedic age]] and is perhaps the longest epic narrative in any language in the 20th Century. In 1961, Gokak was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] from the Government of India for ''Dyava Prithvi''.

==Academic life==
Gokak was born on 9 August 1909 to Sundarabai and Krishna Rao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Stanley|authorlink1=Stanley Reed (British politician)|title=The Indian And Pakistan Year Book And Who's Who 1950|date=1950|publisher=[[The Times Group|Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd.]]|page=679|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.15206|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Majid High School, [[Savanur]], and attended the [[Karnatak College Dharwar]], where he studied literature. He was later awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first class honours]] by the [[University of Oxford]]. On his return from Oxford in 1938, he became the principal of [[Willingdon College, Sangli]]. He was principal of [[Rajaram College]], Kolhapur, Maharashtra from 1950 to 1952. Between 1983 and 1987, he served as the president of the [[Sahitya Akademi]]. He also served as the Director of [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]], [[Shimla]], and the [[English and Foreign Languages University|Central Institute of English]], [[Hyderabad]]. He was an ardent devotee of the spiritual guru [[Sathya Sai Baba]] and served as the first Vice-Chancellor of [[Sri Sathya Sai University|Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning]], [[Puttaparthi]], between 1981 and 1985, after a stint with the [[Bangalore University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V. K. Gokak dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19920429&amp;printsec=frontpage|newspaper=The Indian Express|accessdate=27 April 2017|page=10|date=29 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel ''Samarasave Jeevana'' is considered one of the typical works of Navodaya literature in Kannada.

==Literary Career and Success==

Gokak was a prolific writer in both Kannada and English. He was deeply influenced by the Kannada poet D.R Bendre who mentored him during his early forays into Kannada literature. Bendre is reputed to have said that were Gokak to allow his talent to bloom in Kannada, there was a bright future in wait for Gokak and Kannada literature.

His epic 'Bharatha Sindhurashmi', running into 35000 lines, is notably the longest epic written in this century, for which he received the Jnanpith Award and also honorary doctorates from Karnataka University and Pacific University, USA.

His novel 'Samarasave Jeevana' was translated by his daughter Yashodhara Bhat into English under the title 'The Agony and the Ecstasy' and released to worldwide popularity.

In the 1980s, Karnataka was in the midst of an agitation which demanded the replacement of Sanskrit with Kannada as the medium of instruction in schools. V.K Gokak also headed the 'Gokak Committee' which recommended declaring Kannada as the first language in schools in the state.

Gokak's writing reflected his interest in religion, philosophy, education and cultures. His education abroad prompted him to write two sets of travelogues.

The Navodaya movement was at its peak and Gokak stayed true to his spirit- his poems showed nuances of Victorian poetry, oral traditions in Kannada storytelling and epics in Sanskrit and Kannada.

V.K Gokak wrote many collections of poetry under the pen name Vinayaka. These collections include 'Samudra Geethegalu', 'Baaladeguladalli', 'Abhyudaya', 'Dhyava Prithvi' and 'Urnabha'.

Gokak's anthology of poetry by Indian poets titled The Golden Treasury of Indo Anglican poetry was a treatise on poets like Sri Aurobindo, Sarojini Naidu and Toru Dutta, Nissim Ezekiel and Kamala Das.

In the late 1960s he was deeply influenced by Sri Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi and over the years, Gokak became the medium for translating the guru's words into English and spreading it to the world. His book 'The Advent of Sathya Sai' explains the meaning of Sathya Sai Baba's miracles, his work with the poor and his impact on the educational system.

The state of Karnataka hosts a series of literary events to mark Gokak's birth centenary on 9 August of every year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63969">'''Vocal learning''' is the ability to modify acoustic and syntactic sounds, acquire new sounds via imitation, and produce vocalizations. "Vocalizations" in this case refers only to sounds generated by the vocal organ (mammalian [[larynx]] or avian [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]]) as opposed to by the lips, teeth, and tongue, which require substantially less motor control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petkov | first1 = CI. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | title = Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates. | journal = Front Evol Neurosci | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 12 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3389/fnevo.2012.00012 | pmid = 22912615 | pmc = 3419981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare trait, vocal learning is a critical substrate for spoken language and has only been detected in eight animal groups despite the wide array of vocalizing species; these include [[humans]], [[bats]], [[cetaceans]], [[pinnipeds]] ([[Pinniped|seals]] and [[sea lions]]), [[elephants]], and three distantly related bird groups including [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Vocal learning is distinct from [[auditory learning]], or the ability to form memories of sounds heard, a relatively common trait which is present in all vertebrates tested. For example, dogs can be trained to understand the word "sit" even though the human word is not in its innate auditory repertoire (auditory learning). However, the dog cannot imitate and produce the word "sit" itself as vocal learners can.

==Classification==
[[File:Continuum Hypothesis.tiff|thumb|400px|Hypothetical distributions of two behavioral phenotypes: vocal learning and sensory (auditory) sequence learning. We hypothesize that the behavioral phenotypes of vocal learning and auditory learning are distributed along several categories.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}} (A) Vocal learning complexity phenotype and (B) auditory sequence learning phenotype. The left axis (blue) illustrates the hypothetical distribution of species along the behavioral phenotype dimensions. The right axis (black step functions) illustrates different types of transitions along the hypothesized vocal-learning (A) or auditory-learning (B) complexity dimensions. Whether the actual distributions are continuous functions (blue curves), will need to be tested, in relation to the alternatives that there are several categories with gradual transitions or step functions (black curves). Although auditory learning is a prerequisite for vocal learning and there can be a correlation between the two phenotypes (A–B), the two need not be interdependent. A theoretical Turing machine (Turing, 1968) is illustrated [G∗], which can outperform humans on memory for digitized auditory input but is not a vocal learner. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Historically, species have been classified into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non-learner based on their ability to produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species, with evidence from [[social isolation]], deafening studies, and [[cross-fostering]] experiments.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt; However, vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species, resulting in a spectrum of ability. The vocalizations of [[songbirds]] and [[whales]] have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of humans but are limited to Finite-State Grammars (FSGs), where they can generate strings of sequences with limited structural complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okanoya|first=K|title=The Bengalese finch: a window on the behavioral neurobiology of birdsong syntax|journal=Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.|year=2004|volume=1016|pages=724–735|doi=10.1196/annals.1298.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, on the other hand, show deeper hierarchical relationships, such as the nesting of phrases within others, and demonstrate compositional [[syntax]], where changes in syntactic organization generate new meanings, both of which are beyond the capabilities of other vocal learning groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurford|first=JR|title=The Origins of Grammar: Language in the Light of Evolution|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal learning phenotype also differ within groups and closely related species will not display the same abilities. Within avian vocal learners, for example, [[zebra finch]] songs only contain strictly linear transitions that go through different syllables in a motif from beginning to end, yet [[mockingbird]] and [[nightingale]] songs show element repetition within a range of legal repetitions, non-adjacent relationships between distant song elements, and forward and backward branching in song element transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honda|first=E|author2=Okanoya K |title=Acoustical and syntactical com- parisons between songs of the white-backed Munia (Lonchura striata) and its domesticated strain, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica)|journal=Zool. Sci.|year=1999|volume=16|pages=319–326|doi=10.2108/zsj.16.319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parrots]] are even more complex as they can imitate the speech of heterospecifics like humans and synchronize their movements to a rhythmic beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachner|first=A |author2=Brady TF |author3=Pepperberg IM |author4=Hauser MD|title=Spontaneous motor entrainment to music in multiple vocal mim- icking species.|journal=Curr. Biol.|year=2009|volume=19|pages=831–836|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.061 |pmid=19409786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuum hypothesis===
Even further complicating the original binary classification is evidence from recent studies that suggests that there is greater variability in a non-learner's ability to modify vocalizations based on experience than previously thought. Findings in suboscine [[passerine birds]], [[non-human primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], has led to the proposal of the vocal learning continuum hypothesis by [[Erich Jarvis]] and Gustavo Arriaga. Based on the apparent variations seen in various studies, the continuum hypothesis reclassifies species into non-learner, limited vocal learner, moderate vocal learning, complex vocal learner and high vocal learner categories where higher tiers have fewer species. Under this system, previously identified non-human vocal learners like [[songbirds]] are considered complex learners while humans fall under the “high” category; non-human [[primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], which are traditionally classified as non-learners, are considered limited vocal learners under this system.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Evidence of vocal learning in various species==

===Known vocal learners===

====Birds====
The most extensively studied [[model organism]]s of vocal learning are found in birds, namely songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds.  The degree of vocal learning in each specific species varies. While many parrots and certain songbirds like canaries can imitate and spontaneously combine learned sounds during all periods of their life, other songbirds and hummingbirds are limited to a certain songs learned during their [[critical period]].

====Bats====
The first evidence for audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal was produced by Karl-Heinz Esser in 1994. Hand-reared infant [[lesser spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomos discolor'') were able to adapt their isolation calls to an external reference signal. Isolation calls in a control group that had no reference signal did not show the same adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esser | first1 = KH | year = 1994 | title = Audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal: the lesser spear-nosed bat ''Phyllostomus discolor'' | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 5 | issue = 14| pages = 1718–1720 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199409080-00007 | pmid=7827315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for vocal learning in bats appeared in 1998 when Janette Wenrick Boughman studied female [[greater spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomus hastatus''). These bats live in unrelated groups and use group contact calls that differ among [[social groups]]. Each social group has a single call, which differs in frequency and temporal characteristics. When individual bats were introduced to a new social group, the group call began to morph, taking on new frequency and temporal characteristics, and over time, calls of transfer and resident bats in the same group more closely resembled their new modified call than their old calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boughman | first1 = JW | year = 1998 | title = Vocal learning by greater spear-nosed bats | url = | journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 227–233 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cetaceans====

=====Whales=====
Male [[humpback whales]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') sing as a form of [[sexual display]] while [[Animal migration|migrating]] to and from their breeding grounds. All males in a population produce the same song which can change over time, indicating vocal learning and [[cultural transmission]], a characteristic shared by some bird populations. Songs become increasingly dissimilar over distance and populations in different oceans have dissimilar songs.

Whale songs recorded along the east coast of Australia in 1996 showed introduction of a novel song by two foreign whales who had migrated from the west Australian coast to the east Australian coast. In just two years, all members of the population had switched songs. This new song was nearly identical to ones sung by migrating humpback whales on the west Australian Coast, and the two new singers who introduced the song are hypothesized to have introduced the new "foreign" song to the population on the east Australian coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noad | first1 = MJ | last2 = Cato | first2 = DH | last3 = Bryden | first3 = MM | last4 = Jenner | first4 = MN | last5 = Jenner | first5 = KC. | year = 2000 | title = Cultural revolution in whale songs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | page = 537 |pmid=11117730|doi=10.1038/35046199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal learning has also been seen in [[killer whale]]s (''Orcinus orca''). Two juvenile killer whales, separated from their natal pods, were seen mimicking cries of [[California sea lion]]s (''Zalophus californianus'') that were near the region they lived in. The composition of the calls of these two juveniles were also different from their natal groups, reflecting more of the sea lion calls than that of the whales.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, AD; Griffin, RM; Howitt, D; Larsson, L, Miller, PJO; and Hoelzel, AR. (2006). Killer whales are capable of vocal learning. ''Biol. Lett.'', 2, pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dolphins=====
Captive [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops truncatus'') can be trained to emit sounds through their blowhole in open air. Through training, these vocal emissions can be altered from natural patterns to resemble sounds like the human voice, measurable through the number of bursts of sound emitted by the dolphin. In 92% of exchanges between humans and dolphins, the number of bursts equaled ±1 of the number of syllables spoken by a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lilly | first1 = JC. | year = 1965 | title = Vocal mimicry in tursiops: ability to match numbers and durations of human vocal bursts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 147 | issue = 3655| pages = 300–301 | doi=10.1126/science.147.3655.300 | pmid=17788214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used an underwater keyboard to demonstrate that dolphins are able to learn various whistles in order to do an activity or obtain an object. Complete mimicry occurred within ten attempts for these trained dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reiss | first1 = D | last2 = McCowan | first2 = B | year = 1993 | title = Spontaneous vocal mimicry and production by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): Evidence for vocal learning | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 107 | issue = 3| pages = 301–312 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.107.3.301 | pmid=8375147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of dolphins have given even more evidence of spontaneous [[mimicry]] of species-specific whistles and other biological and computer-generated signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herman | first1 = LM | last2 = Richards | first2 = DG | last3 = Wolz | first3 = JP. | year = 1984 | title = Comprehension of sentences by bottlenosed dolphins | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 129–219 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(84)90003-9 | pmid=6540652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such vocal learning has also been identified in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins develop a distinct signature whistle in the first few months of life, which is used to identify and distinguish itself from other individuals. This individual distinctiveness could have been a driving force for evolution by providing higher species fitness since complex communication is largely correlated with increased intelligence.  However, vocal identification is present in vocal non-learners as well. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the evolution of vocal learning. Each signature whistle can be learned by other individuals for identification purposes and are used primarily when the dolphin in question is out of sight. Bottlenose dolphins use their learned whistles in matching interactions, which are likely to be used while addressing each other, signalling alliance membership to a third party, or preventing deception by an imitating dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janik | first1 = VM.| year = 2000 | title =  Whistle matching in wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5483| pages = 1355–1357  | quote = Comparative studies indicate that whistles vary in structure across populations and species (Steiner 1981; Ding et al. 1995; Rendell et al. 1999), with whistle divergence perhaps facilitating species recognition and speciation (Podos et al. 2002).| doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1355 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mate attraction and territory defense have also been seen as possible contributors to vocal learning evolution. Studies on this topic point out that while both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce a more varied arrangement of vocalizations and frequencies, which studies show may be more preferred by females. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How animals communicate|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that male Atlantic bottlenose dolphins may initiate a challenge by facing another dolphin, opening its mouth, thereby exposing its teeth, or arching its back slightly and holding its head downward. This behavior is more along the lines of visual communication but still may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations such as burst-pulsed sounds. The burst-pulsed sounds, which are more complex and varied than the whistles, are often utilized to convey excitement, dominance or aggression such as when they are competing for the same piece of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janik|first1=Vincent|title=Communication in bottlenose dolphins: 50 years of signature whistle research|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|volume=199|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1007/s00359-013-0817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dolphins also produce these forceful sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. On the sexual side &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How Animals Communicate|pages=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw that dolphins may solicit a sexual response from another by swimming in front of it, looking back, and rolling on its side to display the genital region. These observations provide yet another example of visual communication where dolphins exhibit different postures and non-vocal behaviors to communicate with others that also may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations. Sexual selection for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.

====Seals====
Captive [[harbor seal]]s (''Phoca vitulina'') were recorded mimicking human words such as "hello", "Hoover" (the seal's own name) and producing other speech-like sounds. Most of the vocalizations occurred during the reproductive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ralls | first1 = K | last2 = Fiorelli | first2 = P | last3 = Gish | first3 = S. | year = 1985 | title = Vocalizations and vocal mimicry in captive harbour seals, Phoca vitulina | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1050–1056 | doi=10.1139/z85-157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More evidence of vocal learning in seals occurs in [[southern elephant seal]]s (''Mirounga leonine''). Young males imitate the vocal cries of successful older males during their [[breeding season]]. [[northern elephant seal|northern]] and southern elephant seals have a highly [[polygynous]] mating system with a vast disparity in mating success. In other words, few males guard huge [[harem (zoology)|harems]] of females, eliciting intense [[Sexual selection in mammals#Male-male competition|male-male competition]]. Antagonistic vocal cries play an important role in inter-male competitions and are hypothesized to demonstrate the resource-holding potential of the emitter. In both species, antagonistic vocal cries vary geographically and are structurally complex and individually distinct. Males displays unique calls, which can be identified by the specific arrangement of syllable and syllable parts.

Harem holders frequently vocalize to keep peripheral males away from females, and these vocalizations are the dominant component in a young juvenile's acoustic habitat. Successful vocalizations are heard by juveniles, who then imitate these calls as they get older in an attempt to obtain a harem for themselves. Novel vocal types expressed by dominant males spread quickly through populations of breeding elephant seals and are even imitated by juveniles in the same season.

Genetic analysis indicated that successful vocal patterns were not passed down hereditarily, indicating that this behavior is learned. Progeny of successful harem holders do not display their father's vocal calls and the call that makes one male successful often disappears entirely from the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanvito | first1 = S | last2 = Galimberti | first2 = F | last3 = Miller | first3 = EH. | year = 2007 | title = Observational evidences of vocal learning in southern elephant seals: a longitudinal study | url = | journal = Ethology | volume = 113 | issue = 2| pages = 137–146 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elephants====
Mlaika, a ten-year-old adolescent female [[African elephant]], has been recorded imitating truck sounds coming from the Nairobi-Mombasa highway three miles away. Analysis of Mlaika's truck-like calls show that they are different from the normal calls of African elephants, and that her calls are a general model of truck sounds, not copies of the sounds of trucks recorded at the same time of the calls. In other words, Mlaika's truck calls are not imitations of the trucks that she hears, but rather, a generalized model she developed over time.

Other evidence of vocal learning in elephants occurred in a cross-fostering situation with a captive African elephant. At the [[Basel Zoo]] in [[Switzerland]], Calimero, a male [[African elephant]], was kept with two female [[Asian elephants]]. Recordings of his cries shows evidence of chirping noises, typically only produced by [[Asian elephants]]. The duration and frequency of these calls differs from recorded instances of chirping calls from other African elephants and more closely resembles the chirping calls of [[Asian elephants]].&lt;ref&gt;Poole, JH et al. (2005). "Animal behaviour: elephants are capable of vocal learning." ''Nature'' 434.7032 : 455-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversial or limited vocal learners===
The following species are not formally considered vocal learners, but some evidence has suggested they may have limited abilities to modify their vocalizations. Further research is needed in these species to fully understand their learning abilities.

====Non-human primates====
Early research asserted that primate calls are fully formed at an early age in development, yet recently some studies have suggested these calls are modified later in life.&lt;ref name=owren&gt;Owren, MJ, et al. (1992). "'Food' Calls Produced by Adult Female Rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese (M. fuscata) Macaques, Their Normally-Raised Offspring, and Offspring Cross-Fostered between Species." ''Behaviour'': 218-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Masataka and Fujita cross-fostered [[Japanese macaque|Japanese]] and [[rhesus monkeys]] in the same room and demonstrated that foraging calls were learned directly from their foster mothers, providing evidence of vocal learning.&lt;ref&gt;Masataka, N; and Fujita, K. (1989). "Vocal learning of Japanese and rhesus monkeys." ''Behaviour'': 191-199.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when another independent group was unable to reproduce these results, Masataka and Fujita's findings were questioned.&lt;ref name=owren /&gt; Adding to the evidence against vocal learning in [[non-human primates]] is the suggestion that regional differences in calls maybe be attributed to genetic differences between populations and not vocal learning.&lt;ref name=snowdon&gt;Snowdon, CT. (2009). "Plasticity of communication in non-human primates," in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', eds M. Naguib and V. M. Janik (Burlington, NJ: Academic Press), 239–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies argue that [[non-human primates]] do have some limited vocal learning ability, demonstrating that they can modify their vocalizations in a limited fashion through laryngeal control&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; and lip movements.&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = WD | last2 = Taglialatela | first2 = J | last3 = Leavens | first3 = DA. | year = 2007 | title = Chimpanzees differentially produce novel vocalizations to capture the attention of a human | url = | journal = Anim. Behav. | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 281–286 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.004| pmc = 1832264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wich&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wich | first1 = SA | last2 = Swartz | first2 = KB | last3 = Hardus | first3 = ME | last4 = Lameira | first4 = AR | last5 = Stromberg | first5 = E | last6 = Shumaker | first6 = RW. | year = 2009 | title = A case of spontaneous acquisition of a human sound by an orangutan | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1007/s10329-008-0117-y | pmid=19052691}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chimpanzee]]s in both captivity and in the wild have been recorded producing novel sounds to attract attention. By puckering their lips and making a vibrating sounds, they can make a "raspberry" call, which has been imitated by both naïve captive and wild individuals.&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; There is also evidence of an [[orangutan]] learning to whistle by copying a human, an ability previously unseen in the species.&lt;ref name=wich /&gt; A cross-fostering experiment with [[marmoset]]s and [[macaque]]s showed convergence in pitch and other acoustic features in their supposedly innate calls,&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; demonstrating the ability, albeit limited, for vocal learning.

====Mice====
[[Mouse|Mice]] produce long sequences of vocalizations or "songs" that are used for both isolation calls in pups when cold or removed from nest and for [[courtship display|courtship]] when males sense a female or detect [[pheromones]] in their urine. These [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vocalizations consist of discrete syllables and patterns, with species-specific differences. Males tend to use particular syllable types that can be used to differentiate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holy | first1 = TE | last2 = Guo | first2 = Z. | year = 2005 | title = Ultrasonic songs of male mice | url = | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 12| page = e386 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030386 | pmid=16248680 | pmc=1275525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been intense debate on whether these songs are innate or learned. In 2011, Kikusui ''et al''. cross-fostered two strains of mice with distinct song [[phenotypes]] and discovered that strain-specific characteristics of each song persisted in the offspring, indicating that these vocalizations are innate.&lt;ref&gt;Kikusui, T; et al. (2011). "Cross fostering experiments suggest that mice songs are innate." ''PloS'' one 6.3: e17721.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later work by Arriaga et al. contradicted these results as their study found a motor cortex region active during singing, which projects directly to brainstem motor neurons and is also important for keeping songs stereotyped and on [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Vocal control by forebrain motor areas and direct cortical projections to vocal motor neurons are both features of vocal learning. Furthermore, male mice were shown to depend on auditory feedback to maintain some ultrasonic song features, and sub-strains with differences in their songs were able to match each other’s pitch when cross-housed under competitive social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arriaga|first=G |author2=Zhou E.P. |author3=Jarvis E.D.|title=Of Mice, Birds, and Men: The Mouse Ultrasonic Song System Has Some Features Similar to Humans and Song- Learning Birds|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046610|pmid=23071596|pmc=346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | year = 2013 | title = Mouse vocal communication system: Are ultrasounds learned or innate?. | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 124 | issue = 1| pages = 96–116 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2012.10.002| pmc = 3886250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this conflicting evidence, it remains unclear whether mice are vocal non-learners or limited vocal learners.

====Goats====
When [[goats]] are placed in different social groups, they modify their calls to show more similarity to that of the group, which provides evidence they may be limited vocal learners according to Erich Jarvis' continuum hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Arriaga 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = EP. | last3 = Jarvis | first3 = ED. | title = Of mice, birds, and men: the mouse ultrasonic song system has some features similar to humans and song-learning birds. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = e46610 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0046610 | pmid = 23071596 | pmc = 346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
As vocal learning is such a rare trait that evolved in distant groups, there are many theories to explain the striking similarities between vocal learners, especially within avian vocal learners.

===Adaptive advantage===
There are several proposed hypotheses that explain the selection for vocal learning based on environment and behavior. These include:&lt;ref name=jarvis2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Bird Song Systems: Evolution|journal=Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=2|pages=217–225.|doi=10.1016/b978-008045046-9.00935-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Individual identification: In most vocal-learning species, individuals have their own songs which serve as a unique signature to differentiate themselves from others in the population, which some suggest has driven selection of vocal learning. However, identification by voice, rather than by song or name, is present in vocal non-learners as well. Among vocal learners, only [[humans]] and maybe [[bottlenose dolphins]] actually use unique names. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the [[evolution]] of vocal learning.
* Semantic communication: Semantic vocal communication associates specific vocalizations with animate or inanimate objects to convey a factual message. This hypothesis asserts that vocal learning evolved to facilitate enhanced communication of these specific messages as opposed to affective communication, which conveys emotional content. For example, humans are able to shout "watch out for that car!" when another is in danger while crossing the street instead of just making a noise to indicate urgency, which is less effective at conveying the exact danger at hand. However, many vocal non-learners, including [[chickens]] and velvet monkeys, have been shown to use their innate calls to communicate semantic information such as ‘a food source’ or 'predator.' Further discrediting this hypothesis is the fact that vocal learning birds also use innate calls for this purpose and only rarely use their learned vocalizations for semantic communication (for example, the [[grey parrot]] can mimic human speech and the black-capped chickadee uses calls to indicate predator size). As learned vocalizations rarely convey semantic information, this hypothesis also does not fully explain the evolution of vocal learning.
* Mate attraction and territory defense: While both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce more varied [[syntax]] and [[frequency modulation]], which have been shown to be preferred by females in [[songbirds]]. For example, [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] use two voices to produce large [[frequency modulation]] variations called "sexy syllables" or "sexy songs", which are thought to stimulate [[estrogen]] production in females. When vocal non-learner females were presented with artificially increased [[frequency modulation]]s in their innate vocalizations, more mating was stimulated. [[Sexual selection]] for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.
* Rapid adaptation to sound propagation in different environments: Vocal non-learners produce their sounds best in specific habitats, making them more susceptible to changes in the environment. For example, pigeons' low-frequency calls travel best near the ground, and so communication higher in the air is much less effective. In contrast, vocal learners can change voice characteristics to suit their current environment, which presumably allows for better group communication.

===Predatory pressure===
With the many possible advantages outlined above, it still remains unclear as to why vocal learning is so rare. One proposed explanation is that predatory pressure applies a strong selective force against vocal learning.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt; If mates prefer more variable vocalizations, predators may also be more strongly attracted to more variable vocalizations. As innate calls are typically constant, predators quickly habituate to these vocalizations and ignore them as background noise. In contrast, the variable vocalizations of vocal learners are less likely to be ignored, possibly increasing the [[predation]] rate among vocal learners. In this case, relaxed predation pressure or some mechanism to overcome increased predation must first develop to facilitate the evolution of vocal learning. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that many mammalian vocal learners including [[human]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[elephant]]s have very few major predators. Similarly, several avian vocal learners have behaviors that are effective in avoiding predators, from the rapid flight and escape behavior of [[hummingbirds]] to predator mobbing in [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]].

While little research has been done in this area, some studies have supported the predation hypothesis. One study showed that Bengalese finches bred in captivity for 250 years without predation or human selection for singing behavior show increased variability in [[syntax]] than their conspecifics in the wild. A similar experiment with captive [[zebra finch]]es demonstrated the same result as captive birds had increased song variability, which was then preferred by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zann|first=RA|title=The Zebra Finch: A Synthesis of Field and Laboratory Studies|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these studies are promising, more research is needed in this area to compare predation rates across vocal learners and non-learners.

===Phylogeny===

====Birds====
[[File:Avian Tree.tiff|thumb|400px|Avian phylogenetic tree and the complex-vocal learning phenotype. Shown is an avian phylogenetic tree (based on: Hackett et al., 2008). Identified in red text and ∗ are three groups of complex-vocal learning birds. Below the figure are summarized three alternative hypotheses on the evolutionary mechanisms of complex-vocal learning in birds. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Modern birds supposedly evolved from a common ancestor around the [[Cretaceous]]-Paleogene boundary at the time of the extinction of dinosaurs, about 66 million years ago. Out of the thirty [[Bird#Classification of modern bird orders|avian orders]], only three evolved vocal learning and all have incredibly similar forebrain structures despite the fact that they are distantly related (for example, [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]] are as distantly related as [[humans]] and [[dolphins]]). Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that vocal learning evolved among birds at least two or three independent times, in [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Depending on the interpretation of the trees, there were either three gains in all three lineages or two gains, in [[hummingbirds]] and the common ancestor of [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]], with a loss in the [[suboscine]] songbirds. There are several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;
* Independent convergent evolution: All three avian groups evolved vocal learning and similar neural pathways independently (not through a common ancestor). This suggests that there are strong [[epigenetic]] constraints imposed by the environment or morphological needs, and so this hypothesis predicts that groups that newly evolve vocal learning will also develop similar neural circuits.
* Common ancestor: This alternative hypothesis suggests that vocal learning birds evolved the trait from a distant common ancestor, which was then lost four independent times in interrelated vocal non-learners. Possible causes include high survival costs of vocal learning (predation) or weak adaptive benefits that did not induce strong selection for the trait for organisms in other environments. 
* Rudimentary structures in non-learners: This alternative hypothesis states that avian non-learners actually do possess rudimentary or undeveloped brain structures necessary for song learning, which were enlarged in vocal learning species. Significantly, this concept challenges the current assumption that vocal nuclei are unique to vocal learners, suggesting that these structures are universal even in other groups such as mammals.
* [[Motor theory of speech perception|Motor theory]]: This hypothesis suggests that cerebral systems that control vocal learning in distantly related animals evolved as specializations of a pre-existing motor system inherited from a common ancestor. Thus in avian vocal learners, each of the three groups of vocal learning birds evolved cerebral vocal systems independently, but the systems were constrained by a previous genetically determined motor system inherited from the common ancestor that controls learned movement sequencing. Evidence for this hypothesis was provided by Feenders and colleagues in 2008 as they found that [[EGR1]], an [[immediate early gene]] associated with increases in neuronal activity, was expressed in forebrain regions surrounding or directly adjacent to song nuclei when vocal learning birds performed non-vocal movement behaviors such as hopping and flying. In non-learners, comparable areas were activated, but without the adjacent presence of song nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feenders|first=G|author2=Liedvogel, M |author3=Rivas, M |author4=Zapka, M |author5= Horita, H |title=Molecular Mapping of Movement-Associated Areas in the Avian Brain: A Motor Theory for Vocal Learning Origin|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2008|volume=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001768 |pages=e1768 |pmid=18335043 |pmc=2258151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EGR1]] expression patterns were correlated with the amount of movement, just as its expression typically correlates with the amount of singing performed in vocal birds. These finding suggest that vocal learning brain regions developed from the same cell lineages that gave rise to the motor pathway, which then formed a direct projection onto the brainstem vocal motor neurons to provide greater control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

Currently, it remains unclear as to which of these hypotheses is the most accurate.

====Primates====
[[File:Primate Tree.tiff|thumb|500px|Primate phylogenetic tree and complex-vocal learning vs. auditory sequence learning. Shown is a primate phylogenetic tree based on a combination of DNA sequence and fossil age data (Goodman et al., 1998; Page et al., 1999). Humans (Homo) are the only primates classified as “vocal learners.” However, non-human primates might be better at auditory sequence learning than their limited vocal-production learning capabilities would suggest. In blue text and (#) we highlight species for which there is some evidence of Artificial Grammar Learning capabilities for at least adjacent relationships between the elements in a sequence (tamarins: Fitch and Hauser, 2004), (macaques: Wilson et al., 2011). Presuming that the auditory capabilities of guenons and gibbons (or the symbolic learning of signs by apes) would mean that these animals are able to learn at least adjacent relationships in Artificial Grammars we can tentatively mark these species also in blue #. Note however, that for the species labeled in black text, future studies might show them to be capable of some limited-vocal learning or various levels of complexity in learning the structure of auditory sequences. Three not mutually exclusive hypotheses are illustrated for both complex-vocal learning and auditory sequence learning. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
In [[primates]], only [[humans]] are known to be capable of complex vocal learning.  Similar to the first hypothesis relating to birds, one explanation is that vocal learning evolved independently in humans. An alternative hypothesis suggests evolution from a primate common ancestor capable of vocal learning, with the trait subsequently being lost at least eight other times. Considering the most parsimonious analysis, it seems unlikely that the number of independent gains (one in humans) would be exceeded so greatly by the number of independent losses (at least eight), which supports the independent evolution hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Neurobiology==

===Neural pathways in avian vocal learners===

As avian vocal learners are the most amenable to experimental manipulations, the vast majority of work to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of vocal learning has been conducted with [[zebra finch]]es, with a few studies focusing on [[budgerigar]]s and other species. Despite variation in vocal learning phenotype, the [[Song control system|neural circuitry]] necessary for producing learned song is conserved in [[songbird]]s, [[parrot]]s, and [[hummingbird]]s. As opposed to their non-learner avian counterparts such as [[quail]], [[doves]], and [[pigeons]], these avian vocal learners contain seven distinct cerebral song nuclei, or distinct brain areas associated with auditory learning and [[Bird vocalizations|song production]] defined by their gene expression patterns. As current evidence suggests independent evolution of these structures, the names of each equivalent vocal nucleus are different per bird group, as shown in the table below.

Vocal nuclei are found in two separate brain pathways, which will be described in [[songbirds]] as most research has been conducted in this group, yet it should be noted that connections are similar in [[parrots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Mello CV |title=Molecular mapping of brain areas involved in parrot vocal communication|journal=J. Comp. Neurol.|year=2000|volume=419|pages=1–31|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(20000327)419:1&lt;1::aid-cne1&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hummingbirds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Ribeiro, S|author3=Da Silva, ML|author4=Ventura, D|author5=Vielliard, J|author6=Mello, CV|title=Behaviourally driven gene expression reveals song nuclei in hummingbird brain|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=406|pages=628–632|doi=10.1038/35020570|pmid=10949303|pmc=2531203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projections of the anterior vocal pathway in the [[hummingbird]] remain unclear and so are not listed in the table above.

The posterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal motor pathway), involved in the production of learned vocalizations, begins with projections from a nidopallial nucleus, the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] in [[songbirds]]. The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] then projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). The RA connects to the midbrain vocal center DM (dorsal medial nucleus of the [[midbrain]]) and [[Hypoglossal nerve|the brainstem (nXIIts) vocal motor neurons]] that control the muscles of the [[syrinx]], a direct projection similar to the projection from LMC to the [[nucleus ambiguus]] in humans&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Learned birdsong and the neurobiology of human language.|journal=Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.|year=2004|volume=1016|pages=749–777|doi=10.1196/annals.1298.038|pmc=2485240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] is considered the [[syntax]] generator while the RA modulates the acoustic structure of syllables. Vocal non-learners do possess the DM and twelfth motor neurons (nXIIts), but lack the connections to the [[arcopallium]]. As a result, they can produce vocalizations, but not learned vocalizations.

The anterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal learning pathway) is associated with learning, [[syntax]], and social contexts, starting with projections from the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to the striatal nucleus Area X. Area X then projects to the medial nucleus of dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), which ultimately projects back to MAN in a loop&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraff|first=C|author2=Nottebohm F |title=A comparative study of the behavioral deficits following lesions of various parts of the zebra finch song system: implications for vocal learning|journal=J Neurosci|year=1991|volume=11|pages=2896–2913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lateral part of MAN (LMAN) generates variability in song, while Area X is responsible for stereotypy, or the generation of low variability in syllable production and order after song crystallization.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

Despite the similarities in vocal learning neural circuits, there are some major connectivity differences between the posterior and anterior pathways among avian vocal learners. In [[songbirds]], the posterior pathway communicates with the anterior pathway via projections from the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] to Area X; the anterior pathway sends output to the posterior pathway via connections from LMAN to RA and medial MAN (MMAN) to [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]]. [[Parrots]], on the other hand, have projections from the [[ventral]] part of the AAC (AACv), the parallel of the songbird RA, to the NAOc, parallel of the songbird MAN, and the oval nucleus of the mesopallium (MO). The anterior pathway in [[parrots]] connects to the posterior pathway via NAOc projections to the NLC, parallel of the [[songbird]] [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]], and AAC. Thus, [[parrots]] do not send projections to the [[striatum|striatal]] nucleus of the anterior pathway from their posterior pathway as do [[songbirds]]. Another crucial difference is the location of the posterior vocal nuclei among species. Posterior nuclei are located in auditory regions for songbirds, laterally adjacent to auditory regions in hummingbirds, and are physically separate from auditory regions in parrots. Axons must therefore take different routes to connect nuclei in different vocal learning species. Exactly how these connectivity differences affect song production and/or vocal learning ability remains unclear.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wild|first=JM|title=Neural pathways for the control of birdsong production|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1997|volume=33|pages=653–670|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19971105)33:5&lt;653::aid-neu11&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auditory pathway that is used for [[auditory learning]] brings auditory information into the vocal pathway, but the auditory pathway is not unique to vocal learners. Ear [[hair cells]] project to cochlear ganglia neurons to auditory pontine nuclei to [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus|thalamic]] nuclei and to primary and secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas. A descending auditory feedback pathway exists projecting from the dorsal [[nidopallium]] to the intermediate [[arcopallium]] to shell regions around the [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[midbrain]] auditory nuclei. Remaining unclear is the source of auditory input into the vocal pathways described above. It is hypothesized that songs are processed in these areas in a hierarchical manner, with the primary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area responsible for acoustic features (field L2), the secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area (fields L1 and L3 as well as the caudal medial nidopallium or NCM) determining sequencing and discrimination, and the highest station, the caudal mesopallium (CM), modulating fine discrimination of sounds. Secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas including the NCM and CM are also thought to be involved in auditory memory formation of songs used for vocal learning, but more evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

===Critical period===
The development of the sensory modalities necessary for song learning occurs within a “[[critical period]]” of development that varies among avian vocal learners.  Closed-ended learners such as the [[zebra finch]] and aphantochroa [[hummingbird]] can only learn during a limited time period and subsequently produce highly stereotyped or non-variable vocalizations consisting of a single, fixed song which they repeat their entire lives. In contrast, open-ended learners, including [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] and various [[parrot]] species, display significant [[Synaptic plasticity|plasticity]] and continue to learn new songs throughout the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenowitz|first=EA|author2=Beecher MD |title=Song learning in birds: diversity and plasticity, opportunities and challenges|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2005|volume=28|issue=3|pages=127–132|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.01.004|pmid=15749165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the male zebra finch, vocal learning begins with a period of sensory acquisition or [[auditory learning]] where juveniles are exposed to the song of an adult male “tutor” at about posthatch day 30 to 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eales|first=LA|title=Song learning in zebra finches: some effects of song model availability on what is learnt and when|journal=Anim Behav|year=1985|volume=33|pages=1293–1300|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this stage, juveniles listen and memorize the song pattern of their tutor and produce subsong, characterized by the production of highly variable syllables and syllable sequences. Subsong is thought to be analogous to [[babbling]] in human infants. Subsequently during the sensorimotor learning phase at posthatch day 35 to 90, juveniles practice the motor commands required for song production and use auditory feedback to alter [[Bird vocalizations|vocalizations]] to match the song template. Songs during this period are plastic as specific syllables begin to emerge but are frequently in the wrong sequence, errors that are similar to phonological mistakes made by young children when learning a language. As the bird ages, its song becomes more stereotyped until at posthatch day 120 the song syllables and sequence are crystallized or fixed. At this point, the zebra finch can no longer learn new songs and thus sings this single song for the duration of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=AE|author2=Ten-Cate C |author3=Slater PJB |title=Early experience and plasticity of song in adult male zebra finches|journal=J Comp Psychol|year=1996|volume=110|pages=354–369|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.110.4.354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neural mechanisms behind the closing of the [[critical period]] remain unclear, but early deprivation of juveniles from their adult tutors has been shown to extend the [[critical period]] of song acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aamodt|first=SM |author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW|title=Early isolation from conspecic song does not affect the normal developmental decline of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding in an avian song nucleus|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1995|volume=27|pages=76–84|doi=10.1002/neu.480270108}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Synapse selection” theories hypothesize that [[synaptic plasticity]] during the [[critical period]] is gradually reduced as [[dendritic spines]] are pruned through activity-dependent synaptic rearrangement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bischof|first=HJ|author2=Geissler E |author3=Rollenhagen A. |title=Limitations of the sensitive period for sexual imprinting: Neuroanatomical and behavioral experiments in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|year=2002|volume=133|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pruning of [[dendritic spines]] in the LMAN song nucleus was delayed in isolated [[zebra finch]]es with extended [[critical periods]], suggesting that this form of synaptic reorganization may be important in closing the [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallhausser-Franke|first=E |author2=Nixdorf-Bergweiler BE |author3=DeVoogd TJ|title=Song isolation is associated with maintaining high spine fre- quencies on zebra Wnch 1MAN neurons|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1995|volume=64|pages=25–35|doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other studies have shown that birds reared normally as well as isolated juveniles have similar levels of dendritic pruning despite an extended [[critical period]] in the latter group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Nordeen KW |author3=Nordeen EJ |title=Dissociation between extension of the sensitive period for avian vocal learning and dendritic spine loss in the song nucleus lMAN|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=2005|volume=83|pages=143–150|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that this theory does not completely explain [[critical period]] modulation.

Previous research has suggested that the length of the [[critical period]] may be linked to differential gene expression within song nuclei, thought to be caused by [[neurotransmitter]] binding of receptors during neural activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wada|first=K |author2=Sakaguchi H |author3=Jarvis ED |author4=Hagiwara M|title=Differential expression of glutamate receptors in avian neural pathways for learned vocalization|journal=J Comp Neurol|year=2004|volume=476|pages=44–64|doi=10.1002/cne.20201|pmc=2517240}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key area is the LMAN song nucleus, part of the specialized cortical-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in the anterior forebrain pathway, which is essential for vocal plasticity.&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"/&gt; While inducing deafness in songbirds usually disrupts the sensory phase of learning and leads to production of highly abnormal song structures, lesioning of LMAN in [[zebra finch]]es prevents this song deterioration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainard|first=MS|author2=Doupe AJ |title=Postlearning consolidation of birdsong: stabilizing effects of age and anterior forebrain lesions|journal=J Neurosci|year=2001|volume=21|pages=2501–2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the earlier development of stable song. One of the neurotransmitter receptors shown to affect LMAN is the [[NMDA receptor|N- methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor]] (NMDAR), which is required for learning and activity-dependent gene regulation in the post-synaptic neuron. Infusions of the [[NMDAR antagonist]] [[AP5|APV]] (R-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) into the LMAN song nucleus disrupts the [[critical period]] in the [[zebra finch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basham ME|first=ME|author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW |title=Blockade of NMDA receptors in the anterior   forebrain impairs sensory acquisition in the zebra finch (Poephila guttata)|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1996|volume=66|pages=295–304|doi=10.1006/nlme.1996.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[NMDAR]] density and [[mRNA]] levels of the NR1 subunit also decrease in LMAN during early song development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Singh TD|author3=Sohrabji F|author4=Nordeen KW|author5=Nordeen EJ|title=Developmental and hormonal regulation of NR2A mRNA in forebrain regions controlling avian vocal learning|journal=J.

The different subsystems for vocalization and their interconnectivity are illustrated using different colors. (A) Schematic of a songbird brain showing some connectivity of the four major song nuclei (HVC, RA, AreaX, and LMAN). (B) Human brain schematic showing the different proposed vocal subsystems. The learned vocalization subsystem consists of a primary motor cortex pathway (blue arrow) and a cortico-striatal-thalamic loop for learning vocalizations (white). Also shown is the limbic vocal subsystem that is broadly conserved in primates for producing innate vocalizations (black), and the motoneurons that control laryngeal muscles (red). (C) Known connectivity of a brainstem vocal system (not all connections shown) showing absence of forebrain song nuclei in vocal non-learning birds. (D) Known connectivity of limited-vocal learning monkeys (based on data in squirrel monkeys and macaques) showing presence of forebrain regions for innate vocalization (ACC, OFC, and amygdala) and also of a ventral premotor area (Area 6vr) of currently poorly understood function that is indirectly connected to nucleus ambiguous. The LMC in humans is directly connected with motoneurons in the nucleus ambiguus, which orchestrate the production of learned vocalizations. Only the direct pathway through the mammalian basal ganglia (ASt, anterior striatum; GPi, globus palidus, internal) is shown as this is the one most similar to AreaX connectivity in songbirds.

Humans seem to have analogous anterior and posterior vocal pathways which are implicated in speech production and learning. Parallel to the avian posterior vocal pathway mentioned above is the motor cortico-brainstem pathway. Within this pathway, the face motor cortex projects to the nucleus ambiguous of the medulla, which then projects to the muscles of the [[larynx]]. Humans also have a vocal pathway that is analogous to the avian anterior pathway. This pathway is a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortico loop which begins at a strip of the [[premotor cortex]], called the cortical strip, which is responsible for speech learning and syntax production. The cortical strip includes spans across five brain regions: the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[Broca’s area]], the anterior dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior pre-supplementary motor area, and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. This cortical strip has projections to the anterior [[striatum]] which projects to the [[globus pallidus]] to the anterior dorsal [[thalamus]] back to the cortical strip. All of these regions are also involved in [[syntax]] and speech learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Neural systems for vocal learning in birds and humans: a synopsis|journal=Journal of Ornithology|year=2007|volume=148|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1007/s10336-007-0243-0|pmc=2726745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic applications to humans==
In addition to the similarities in the neurobiological circuits necessary for vocalizations between animal vocal learners and humans, there are also a few genetic similarities. The most prominent of these genetic links are the [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] genes, which code for forkhead box (FOX) proteins P1 and P2, respectively. [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are [[transcription factors]] which play a role in the development and maturation of the lungs, heart, and brain,&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pariani|first=MJ|author2=Spenser, A|author3=Graham Jr, JM|author4=Rimoin, DL|title=A 785 kb deletion of 3p14.1p13 including the FOXP1 gene, associated with speech delay, contractures, hypertonia and blepharophimosis|journal=European Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2009|volume=52|issue=2–3|pages=123–127|doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2009.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt; and are also highly expressed in brain regions of the vocal learning pathway, including the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[frontal cortex]]. In these regions (i.e. the basal ganglia and frontal cortex), [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are thought to be essential for brain maturation and development of speech and language.&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargha-Kahadem|first=F |author2=Gadian, DG |author3=Copp, A |author4=Mortimer, M|title=FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=131–138|doi=10.1038/nrn1605|pmid=15685218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthologues]] of [[FOXP2]] are found in a number of vertebrates including [[mice]] and [[songbirds]], and have been implicated in modulating [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of neural circuits. In fact, although mammals and birds are very distant relatives and diverged more than 300 million years ago, the [[FOXP2]] gene in [[zebra finch]]es and [[mice]] differs at only five [[amino acid]] positions, and differs between [[zebra finch]]es and [[humans]] at only eight [[amino acid]] positions. In addition, researchers have found that patterns of expression of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are amazingly similar in the human fetal brain and the [[songbird]].&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt;

These similarities are especially interesting in the context of the aforementioned avian song circuit. [[FOXP2]] is expressed in the avian Area X, and is especially highly expressed in the [[striatum]] during the [[critical period]] of song plasticity in [[songbirds]]. In humans, [[FOXP2]] is highly expressed in the [[basal ganglia]], [[frontal cortex]], and [[insular cortex]], all thought to be important nodes in the human vocal pathway. Thus, mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene are proposed to have detrimental effects on human speech and language, such as grammar, language processing, and impaired movement of the mouth, lips, and tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=K|author2=Liu, F |author3=Hirokawa, K |author4=Takahashi, H |title=Expression of FOXP2, a gene involved in speech and language, in the developing and adult striatum|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research|year=2003|volume=73|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1002/jnr.10638}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potential detrimental effects on song learning in [[songbirds]]. Indeed, [[FOXP2]] was the first gene to be implicated in the cognition of speech and language in a family of individuals with a severe speech and language disorder.

Additionally, it has been suggested that due to the overlap of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] expression in [[songbirds]] and humans, mutations in [[FOXP1]] may also result in speech and language abnormalities seen in individuals with mutations in [[FOXP2]].&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2" /&gt;

These genetic links have important implications for studying the origin of language because [[FOXP2]] is so similar among vocal learners and humans, as well as important implications for understanding the [[etiology]] of certain speech and language disorders in humans.

Currently, no other genes have been linked as compellingly to vocal learning in animals or humans.
