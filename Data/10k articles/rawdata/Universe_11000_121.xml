      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7564">'''Acetylide''' refers to [[chemical compound]]s with the [[chemical formula]]s MC≡CH and MC≡CM, where M is a metal.&lt;ref&gt;https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/A/A00067.html)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used loosely and can refer to [[Substitution reaction#Substituted compounds|substituted]] acetylides having the general structure RC≡CM (where R is an organic [[side chain]]).  Acetylides are [[reagent]]s in [[organic synthesis]].  The calcium acetylide commonly called [[calcium carbide]] is a major compound of commerce.

==Structure and bonding==
[[Alkali metal]] and [[alkaline earth metal]] acetylides of the general formula MC≡CM are salt-like [[Zintl phase]] compounds, containing {{chem|C|2|2−}} ions. Evidence for this ionic character can be seen in the ready hydrolysis of these compounds to form [[acetylene]] and metal oxides, there is also some evidence for the solubility of {{chem|C|2|2−}} ions in liquid ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamberger|first1=Markus|last2=Liebig|first2=Stefan|last3=Friedrich|first3=Ute|last4=Korber|first4=Nikolaus|last5=Ruschewitz|first5=Uwe|title=Evidence of Solubility of the Acetylide Ion {{chem|C|2|2−}}: Syntheses and Crystal Structures of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·7 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=21 December 2012|volume=51|issue=52|pages=13006–13010|doi=10.1002/anie.201206349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{chem|C|2|2−}} ion has a closed [[Electron shell|shell]] [[ground state]] of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{su|b=g|p=+}}, making it [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] to a neutral molecule [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerfeld|first1=T.|last2=Riss|first2=U.|last3=Meyer|first3=H.-D.|last4=Cederbaum|first4=L.|title=Metastable {{chem|C|2|2−}} Dianion|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=August 1997|volume=79|issue=7|pages=1237–1240|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1237|bibcode=1997PhRvL..79.1237S}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may afford it some stability.

Analogous acetylides prepared from other metals, particularly [[transition metals]], show covalent character and are invariably associated with their metal centers. This can be seen in their general stability to water (i.e. [[silver acetylide]], [[copper acetylide]]) and radically different chemical applications.

Acetylides of the general formula RC≡CM (where R = H or alkyl) generally show similar properties to their doubly substituted analogues. In the absence of additional ligands, metal acetylides adopt polymeric structures wherein the acetylide groups are [[bridging ligand]]s.

==Preparation==
Terminal [[alkyne]]s are [[weak acids]]:&lt;ref name=Viehe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Viehe|first1=Heinz Günter|title=Chemistry of Acetylenes|date=1969|publisher=Marcel Dekker, inc.|location=New York|pages=170–179 &amp; 225–241|edition=1st|doi=10.1002/ange.19720840843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To generate acetylides from acetylene and alkynes relies on the use of  [[Superbase#Organometallic|organometallic]]&lt;ref name=Midland1990&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Midland|first1=M. M.|last2=McLoughlin|first2=J.

In early studies [[liquid ammonia]] was employed, but etherial solvents are more common.

[[Lithium amide]],&lt;ref name=Viehe /&gt; [[Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide|LiHMDS]],&lt;ref name="Reich2001"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Addition of a lithium acetylide to an aldehyde; 1-(2-pentyn-4-ol)-cyclopent-2-en-1-ol|last=Reich|first=Melanie|date=Aug 24, 2001|work=ChemSpider Synthetic Pages|page=137|doi=10.1039/SP137}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[organolithium reagent]]s, such as [[butyllithium]],&lt;ref name=Midland1990 /&gt; are frequently used form lithium acetylides:

:&lt;chem&gt;{H-C\!{\equiv}\!C-H} + \overset{butyllithium}{BuLi} -&gt;[\ce{THF}][-78^\circ\ce C] {Li-\!{\equiv}\!-H} + BuH&lt;/chem&gt;

Sodium or potassium acetylides can be prepared from various inorganic reagents (e.g. [[sodium amide]])&lt;ref name=Coffman /&gt; or from their elemental metals, often at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name=Viehe /&gt;

[[Copper(I) acetylide]] can be prepared by passing acetylene through an [[aqueous]] solution of [[copper(I) chloride]] because of a low [[solubility equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=Viehe /&gt; Similarly, [[silver acetylide]]s can be obtained from [[silver nitrate]].

[[Calcium carbide]] is prepared by heating [[carbon]] with [[Lime (material)|lime]] CaO at approximately 2,000&amp;nbsp;°C. A similar process is used to produce [[lithium carbide]].

==Reactions==
Acetylides of the type RC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M are widely used in [[alkynylation]]s in [[organic chemistry]].  They are [[nucleophile]]s that add to a variety of electrophilic and unsaturated substrates. A classic application is the [[Favorskii reaction]].

Illustrative is the sequence shown below, [[ethyl propiolate]] is deprotonated by [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] to give the corresponding acetylide.  This acetylide adds to the carbonyl center of [[cyclopentanone]]. Hydrolytic workup liberate the alkynyl alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Midland|first1=M. Mark|last2=Tramontano|first2=Alfonso|last3=Cable|first3=John R.|title=Synthesis of alkyl 4-hydroxy-2-alkynoates|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|date=1980|volume=45|issue=1|pages=28–29|doi=10.1021/jo01289a006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acetylide carbonyl addition.png|600px|center|Reaction of ethyl propiolate with n-butyllithium to form the lithium acetylide.]]

===Coupling reactions===
Acetylides are sometimes [[Reactive intermediate|intermediates]] in [[coupling reaction]]s. Examples include [[Sonogashira coupling]], [[Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling]], [[Glaser coupling]] and [[Eglinton coupling]].

==Hazards==
Some acetylides are notoriously explosive.&lt;ref name="CataldoCasari2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cataldo|first1=Franco|last2=Casari|first2=Carlo S.|title=Synthesis, Structure and Thermal Properties of Copper and Silver Polyynides and Acetylides|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials|volume=17|issue=4|year=2007|pages=641–651|issn=1574-1443|doi=10.1007/s10904-007-9150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formation of acetylides poses a risk in handling of gaseous acetylene in presence of metals such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]] or [[copper]], or alloys with their high content ([[brass]], [[bronze]], silver [[solder]]).

The '''Adirondack League Club''' is an organization that owns a large piece of [[wilderness]] land in the [[New York State]] [[Adirondack Park]]. The club was founded in the 1890s as a club for [[hunting]] and [[fishing]]. The club was involved in a protracted [[legal dispute]] with the [[Sierra Club]] over the right of public access to streams and other waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prfamerica.org/stats/Stats-AdirondackLeagueClub.html|accessdate=13 October 2011|title=Adirondack League Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Adirondack League Club is known for its socially and politically influential members, including gilded era industrialists and several past Presidents of the United States.

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}
The element [[sulfur]] exists as many [[allotropes]]. In terms of large number of allotropes, sulfur is second only to [[Allotropes of carbon|carbon]].&lt;ref name=g652&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 652&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the allotropes, each allotrope often exists in [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], delineated by Greek prefixes (α, β, etc.).&lt;ref name= t4/&gt;

Furthermore, because elemental sulfur has been an item of commerce for centuries, its various forms are given traditional names. Early workers identified some forms that have later proved to be single or mixtures of allotropes. Some forms have been named for their appearance, e.g. "mother of pearl sulfur", or alternatively named for a chemist who was pre-eminent in identifying them, e.g. "Muthmann's sulfur I" or "Engel's sulfur".&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name = s17&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly encountered form of sulfur is the [[orthorhombic]] polymorph of {{chem|S|8}}, which adopts a puckered ring – or "crown" – structure.  Two other polymorphs are known, also with nearly identical molecular structures.&lt;ref name=g654&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 654&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, sulfur rings of 6, 7, 9–15, 18 and 20 atoms are known.&lt;ref name = g655&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 655&lt;/ref&gt;  At least five allotropes are uniquely formed at high pressures, two of which are metallic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of sulfur allotropes reflects the relatively strong S−S bond of 265 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name = g652/&gt; Furthermore, unlike most elements, the allotropes of sulfur can be manipulated in solutions of organic solvents and is amenable to analysis by HPLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tebbe, F. N. |author2=Wasserman, E. |author3=Peet, W. G. |author4=Vatvars, A. |author5=Hayman, A. C. |title=Composition of Elemental Sulfur in Solution: Equilibrium of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; at Ambient Temperatures|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=18|pages=4971|doi=10.1021/ja00382a050|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase diagram for sulfur==
[[File:Phase diagram of sulfur (1975).png|thumb|400 px|A historic phase diagram of sulfur. A phase diagram from 1975, presenting data through 1970. The [[ordinate]] is pressure in kilobars (kbar). and the [[abscissa]] is [[temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s (K). (The temperatures 200, 400, 600, and 800 K correspond to the approximate temperatures of −73, 127, 327, and 527 °C, respectively.) The Roman numerals I-XII refer to known solid phases identified by "volumetric, optical, and electrical resistance techniques," and letters A-E to putative distinct liquid "phases" identified by [[differential thermal analysis]]. Phase information is based on the work of G. C. Vezzoli, et al., as reviewed by David Young; as Young notes, "The literature on the allotropy of sulfur presents the most complex and confused situation of all the elements."&lt;ref&gt;Young, David A. (1975) [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/4010212 "Phase Diagrams of the Elements,"] pp. 14–16 in ''Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Report UCRL-51902'', Contract No. W-7405-Eng-48, U.S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration, Springfield, VA, USA: U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ic50093a020|title=Ring → Chain high-pressure polymorphic transformation in sulfur and the accompanying change from insulating to modest semiconducting behavior|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2478|year=1970|last1=Vezzoli|first1=Gary C.|last2=Zeto|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase information, while complete to this date, are incomplete as of 2015, since limited to ≤50 kbar and thus omitting metallic phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/37074|year=1997|last1=Hemley|first1=Russell J.|journal=Nature|volume=390|issue=6658|pages=382|last2=Struzhkin|first2=Viktor V.|last3=Mao|first3=Ho-Kwang|last4=Timofeev|first4=Yuri A.|title=Superconductivity at 10–17 K in compressed sulphur|bibcode=1997Natur.390..382S}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram for sulfur is complex (see image). The region labeled I (a solid region), is α-sulfur.&lt;ref name = "Degtyareva"/&gt; See the legend for further identifications and information, and see the section on high pressure forms for information on these phases.

==High pressure solid allotropes==
In a high-pressure study at ambient temperatures, four new solid forms, termed II, III, IV, V have been characterized, where α-sulfur is form I.&lt;ref name = "Degtyareva"/&gt; Solid forms II and III are polymeric, while IV and V are metallic (and are [[superconduction|superconductive]] below 10 K and 17 K, respectively).&lt;ref name = "Gregoryanz"/&gt; Laser irradiation of solid samples produces three sulfur forms below 200–300 kbar (20–30 GPa).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid ''cyclo'' allotrope preparation==
Two methods exist for the preparation of the ''cyclo''-sulfur allotropes. One of the methods, which is most famous for preparing [[hexasulfur]], is to react hydrogen polysulfides  with polysulfur dichloride:

: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;''x+y''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

A second strategy uses [[titanocene pentasulfide]] as a source of the S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; unit. This complex is easily made from polysulfide solutions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaver | first1 = Alan | last2 = Mccall | first2 = James M. | last3 = Marmolejo | first3 = Gabriela | year = 1990 | title = Cyclometallapolysulfanes (and Selanes) of Bis(η5-Cyclopentadienyl) Titanium(IV), Zirconium(IV), Molybdenum(IV), and Tungsten(IV) | url = | journal = Inorganic Syntheses | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 59–65 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132586.ch11 | series = Inorganic Syntheses | isbn = 9780470132586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] + (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl

Then the resulting pentasulfur-titanocene complex is allowed to react with polysulfur dichloride to give the desired ''cyclo''-sulfur in the series:&lt;ref name="InorgChem"&gt;{{cite book | title = Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition | chapter = Chapter 16: The group 16 elements | author1 = Housecroft, Catherine E. | author2 = Sharpe, Alan G. | publisher = Pearson | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-13-175553-6 | page = 498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;''y''+5&lt;/sub&gt; + (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Engel in 1891 by reacting  HCl with [[thiosulfate]], HS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = g655/&gt; Cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is orange-red and forms a [[rhombohedral]] crystal.&lt;ref name = g656&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 656&lt;/ref&gt; It is called ρ-sulfur, ε-sulfur, Engel's sulfur and Aten's sulfur.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt; Another method of preparation involves reacting a [[polysulfane]] with [[sulfur monochloride]]:&lt;ref name = g656/&gt;

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl (dilute solution in [[diethyl ether]])

The sulfur ring in cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has a "chair" [[conformational isomerism|conformation]], reminiscent of the chair form of [[cyclohexane]]. All of the sulfur atoms are equivalent.&lt;ref name = g656/&gt;

===''Cyclo''-heptasulfur, ''cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;===
It is a bright yellow solid. Four (α-, β-, γ-, δ-) forms of cyclo-heptasulfur are known.&lt;ref name = g657&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 657&lt;/ref&gt; Two forms (γ-, δ-)have been characterized. The cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; ring has an unusual range of bond lengths of 199.3–218.1&amp;nbsp;pm. It is said to be the least stable of all of the sulfur allotropes.&lt;ref name=s6&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Cyclo''-octasulfur, ''cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{Main article|Octasulfur}}

====α-Sulfur====
α-Sulfur, see image, is the form most commonly found in nature.&lt;ref name = g654/&gt; When pure it has a greenish-yellow colour (traces of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in commercially available samples make it appear yellower). It is practically insoluble in water and is a good electrical insulator with poor thermal conductivity. It is quite soluble in [[carbon disulfide]]: 35.5 g/100 g solvent at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. It has an orthorhombic crystal structure.&lt;ref name = g654/&gt; This is the predominant form found in "flowers of sulfur", "roll sulfur" and "milk of sulfur".&lt;ref name="s15"/&gt; It contains S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; puckered rings, alternatively called a crown shape. The S-S bond lengths are all 203.7&amp;nbsp;pm and the S-S-S angles are 107.8° with a dihedral angle of 98°.&lt;ref name = g656/&gt; At 95.3&amp;nbsp;°C, α-sulfur converts to β-sulfur.&lt;ref name = g654/&gt;

====β-Sulfur====
This is a yellow solid with a monoclinic crystal form and is less dense than α-sulfur. Like the α- form it contains puckered S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; rings and only differs from it in the way the rings are packed in the crystal. It is unusual because it is only stable above 95.3&amp;nbsp;°C, below this it converts to α-sulfur. It can be prepared by crystallising at 100&amp;nbsp;°C and cooling rapidly to slow down formation of α-sulfur.&lt;ref name = g655/&gt; It has a melting point variously quoted as 119.6&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; and 119.8&amp;nbsp;°C but as it decomposes to other forms at around this temperature the observed melting point can vary from this. The 119&amp;nbsp;°C melting point has been termed the "ideal melting point" and the typical lower value (114.5&amp;nbsp;°C) when decomposition occurs, the "natural melting point".&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

====γ-Sulfur====
This form, first prepared by F.W. Muthmann in 1890, is sometimes called "nacreous sulfur" or "mother of pearl sulfur" because of its appearance. It crystallises in pale yellow monoclinic needles. It contains puckered S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; rings like α-sulfur and β-sulfur and only differs from them in the way that these rings are packed. It is the densest form of the three. It can be prepared by slowly cooling molten sulfur that has been heated above 150&amp;nbsp;°C or by chilling solutions of sulfur in [[carbon disulfide]], [[ethyl alcohol]] or [[hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref name = g655/&gt; It is found in nature as the mineral [[rosickyite]].&lt;ref name=s7&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 9–15, 18, 20)===
[[File:dodecasulfur 3D.png|100px|thumb|Cyclo-dodecasulfur, cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]
These allotropes have been synthesised by various methods for example, reacting [[titanocene pentasulfide]] and a [[dichlorosulfane]] of suitable sulfur chain length, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''−5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name = g657/&gt;

:([[hapticity|η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;]]-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;''n''−5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

or alternatively reacting a [[dichlorosulfane]], S&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''m''&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[polysulfane]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name = g657/&gt;

:S&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''m''&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; can also be prepared from S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; With the exception of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, the rings contain S-S bond lengths and S-S-S bond angle that differ one from another.&lt;ref name = g656/&gt;

Cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the most stable cyclo-allotrope. Its structure can be visualised as having sulfur atoms in three parallel planes, 3 in the top, 6 in the middle and three in the bottom.&lt;ref name = g658&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 658&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms (α-, β-) of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; are known, one of which has been characterized.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; are known where the conformation of the ring is different. To differentiate these structures, rather than using the normal crystallographic convention of α-, β-, etc., which in other cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; compounds refer to different packings of essentially the same [[conformational isomerism|conformer]], these two [[conformational isomerism|conformers]] have been termed endo- and exo-.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 13, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.''cyclo''-S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; adduct===
This is produced from a solution of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It has a density midway between cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. The crystal consists of alternate layers of cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclo-S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. For all the elements this may be the only allotrope which contains molecules of different sizes.&lt;ref name=s9&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid catena allotropes==
[[File:S@CNT.jpg|thumb|Two parallel monatomic sulfur chains grown inside a single-wall [[carbon nanotube]] (CNT, a) Zig-zag (b) and straight (c) S chains inside double-wall CNTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms3162|title=Conducting linear chains of sulphur inside carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=2162|year=2013|last1=Fujimori|first1=Toshihiko|last2=Morelos-Gómez|first2=Aarón|last3=Zhu|first3=Zhen|last4=Muramatsu|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Futamura|first5=Ryusuke|last6=Urita|first6=Koki|last7=Terrones|first7=Mauricio|last8=Hayashi|first8=Takuya|last9=Endo|first9=Morinobu|last10=Young Hong|first10=Sang|last11=Chul Choi|first11=Young|last12=Tománek|first12=David|last13=Kaneko|first13=Katsumi|pmid=23851903|pmc=3717502|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2162F}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The production of pure forms of catena-sulfur has proved to be extremely difficult. Complicating factors include the purity of the starting material and the thermal history of the sample.

===ψ-Sulfur===
This form, also called fibrous sulfur or ω1-sulfur,&lt;ref name = t4/&gt; has been well characterized. It has a density of 2.01 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (α-sulfur 2.069 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and decomposes around its melting point of 104&amp;nbsp;°C. It consists of parallel helical sulfur chains. These chains have both left and right-handed "twists" and a radius of 95&amp;nbsp;pm. The S-S bond length is 206.6&amp;nbsp;pm, the S-S-S bond angle is 106° and the dihedral angle is 85.3°, (comparable figures for α-sulfur are 203.7&amp;nbsp;pm, 107.8° and 98.3°).&lt;ref name = g660&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 660&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamina sulfur===
This has not been well characterized but is believed to consist of criss-crossed helices. It is also called χ-sulfur or ω2-sulfur.&lt;ref name = t4/&gt;

==Catena sulfur forms==
The naming of the different forms is very confusing and care has to be taken to determine what is being described as the same names are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name = t4/&gt;

===Amorphous sulfur===
This is the quenched product of sulfur melts above 160&amp;nbsp;°C (at this point the properties of the liquid melt change remarkably, e.g. large increase in viscosity&lt;ref name = g660/&gt;). Its form changes from an initial plastic form gradually to a glassy form, hence its other names of plastic, glassy or vitreous sulfur. It is also called χ-sulfur.&lt;ref name = t4/&gt; It contains a complex mixture of catena-sulfur forms mixed with cyclo-forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insoluble sulfur===
This is obtained by washing quenched liquid sulfur with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=s3&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called polymeric sulfur, μ-S or ω-S.&lt;ref name = t4/&gt;

===Fibrous (φ-) sulfur===
This is a mixture of the allotropic ψ- form and γ-cycloS&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=s43&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===ω-Sulfur===
This is a commercially available product prepared from amorphous sulfur that has not been stretched prior to extraction of soluble forms with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It sometimes called "white sulfur of Das" or supersublimated sulfur. It is a mixture of ψ-sulfur and lamina sulfur. The composition depends on the exact method of production and the samples history. One well known commercial form is "Crystex". ω-sulfur is used in the [[vulcanization]] of rubber.&lt;ref name=s15&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===λ-Sulfur===
This name is given to the molten sulfur immediately after melting, cooling this gives predominantly β-sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steudel|Steudel]], 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===μ-Sulfur===
This name is applied to solid insoluble sulfur and the melt prior to quenching.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt;

===π-Sulfur===
Dark-coloured liquid formed when λ-sulfur is left to stay molten. Contains mixture of S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; rings.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman" /&gt;

===Biradical catena (S&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;) chains===
This term is applied to biradical catena- chains in sulfur melts or the chains in the solid.&lt;ref name = g662&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], 662&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disulfur, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
{{Main article|Disulfur}}
Disulfur, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is the predominant species in sulfur vapour above 720&amp;nbsp;°C (a temperature above that shown in the phase diagram); at low pressure (1&amp;nbsp;mmHg) at 530&amp;nbsp;°C, it comprises 99% of the vapor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It is a triplet [[diradical]] (like [[dioxygen]] and [[sulfur monoxide]]), with an S-S bond length of 188.7&amp;nbsp;pm.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The blue colour of burning sulfur is due to the emission of light by the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule produced in the flame.&lt;ref name = g661/&gt;

=== Trisulfur, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ===
{{Main article|Trisulfur}}

S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is found in sulfur vapour, comprising 10% of vapour species at 440&amp;nbsp;°C and 10&amp;nbsp;mmHg. It is cherry red in colour, with a bent structure, similar to [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = g661/&gt;

===Tetrasulfur, S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
This has been detected in the vapour phase but has not been fully characterized; various forms, (e.g. chains, branched chains and rings) have been proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} A primary research result based on theoretical calculations suggests that it has a ring structure.&lt;ref name = "wong"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2015}}

'''Areal density''' is a measure of the quantity of information [[bit]]s that can be stored on a given length of [[hard disk|track]], area of [[Surface area|surface]], or in a given [[volume]] of a [[computer storage|computer storage medium]].  Generally, higher density is more desirable, for it allows greater volumes of data to be stored in the same physical space. Density therefore has a direct relationship to storage capacity of a given medium. Density also generally has a fairly direct effect on the performance within a particular medium, as well as price.

== Storage device classes ==

=== Magnetic disk media ===
[[Hard disk drive]]s store data in the magnetic polarization of small patches of the surface coating on a disk. The maximum areal density is defined by the size of the magnetic particles in the surface, as well as the size of the "head" used to read and write the data. The areal density of disk storage devices has increased dramatically since [[IBM]] introduced the [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#IBM 350|IBM&amp;nbsp;350 disk storage]], the first [[hard disk drive]] in 1956 at an areal density of 2,000 [[bit]]/[[square inch|in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. The growth rate has matched [[Moore's Law]] with the density reaching 1&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2014./&lt;ref name="CompHist1T"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/hdd-areal-density-reaches-1-terabit-sq-in/|title=2014: HDD areal density reaches 1 terabit/sq. in. {{!}}  The Storage Engine {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] introduced a hard drive at a density of 1.34&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=tech2015&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seagate.com/www-content/investors/_shared/docs/tech-talk-mark-re-20150825.pdf|title=Tech Talk on HDD Areal Density|last=Re|first=Mark|date=August 25, 2015|website=Seagate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 600 million times that of the first disk drive.  It is expected that current recording technology can be "feasibly" expected to scale to at least 5&amp;nbsp;[[terabit|Tbit]]/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the near future.&lt;ref name=tech2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|date=July 2002|volume=38|issue=4|pages=1719–1724|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1017762&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DOne+terabit+per+square+inch+perpendicular+recording+conceptual+design|accessdate=2 April 2013|author=M.

=== Optical disc media ===
[[Compact disc]]s (CDs) store data in small pits in a plastic surface that is then covered with a thin layer of reflective metal. The standard defines pits that are 0.83 micrometers long and 0.5 micrometers wide, arranged in tracks spaced 1.6 micrometers apart, offering a density of about 0.90&amp;nbsp;Gbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[DVD]] disks are essentially a higher-density CD, using more of the disk surface, smaller pits (0.64 micrometers), and tighter tracks (0.74 micrometers), offering a density of about 2.2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Single-layer [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] disks offer densities around 7.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 12.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

When introduced in 1982 CDs had considerably higher densities than [[Hard disk drive#Future development|hard disk drives]], but hard disk drives have since advanced much more quickly and eclipsed optical media in both areal density and capacity per device.

=== Magnetic tape media ===
The first magnetic tape drive, the [[Univac]] [[UNISERVO|Uniservo]], recorded at the density of 128&amp;nbsp;bit/in on a half-inch magnetic tape, resulting in the areal density of 256&amp;nbsp;bit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Research ==
A number of technologies are attempting to surpass the densities of existing media.

IBM's [[Millipede memory]] was attempting to commercialize a system at 1&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2007 (800&amp;nbsp;Gbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was demonstrated in 2005). This is about the same capacity at which perpendicular hard drives are expected to "top out"; Millipede technology has, so far, been losing the density race with hard drives. Development since mid-2006 appears to be moribund, although the latest demonstrator with 2.7&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seemed promising. A newer IBM technology, [[racetrack memory]], uses an array of many small nanoscopic wires arranged in 3D, each holding numerous bits to improve density. Although exact numbers have not been mentioned, IBM news articles talk of "100&amp;nbsp;times" increases.

Various [[holographic storage]] technologies are also attempting to leapfrog existing systems, but they too have been losing the race, and are estimated to offer 1&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as well, with about 250&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]]/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being the best demonstrated to date- for non-quantum holography systems.

Other experimental technologies offer even higher densities. Molecular polymer storage has been shown to store 10&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141438.htm|title=New Method Of Self-assembling Nanoscale Elements Could Transform Data Storage Industry|work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the densest type of memory storage experimentally to date is [[electronic quantum holography]]. By superimposing images of different wavelengths into the same hologram, a Stanford research team was able to achieve a bit density of 35 bit/electron (approximately 3 [[exabytes]]/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This was demonstrated using electron microscopes and a copper medium as reported in the Stanford Report on January 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2009/january28/small-012809.html|title=Reading the fine print takes on a new meaning|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[DNA]] was successfully used as an experimental data storage medium, but required a DNA synthesizer and DNA microchips for the transcoding. {{As of|2012}}, DNA holds the record for highest-density storage medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1628 Next-Generation Digital Information Storage in DNA] Science, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, scientists at [[Columbia University]] and the [[New York Genome Center]] published a method known as DNA Fountain which allows perfect retrieval of information from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, 85% of the theoretical limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yong|first1=Ed|title=This Speck of DNA Contains a Movie, a Computer Virus, and an Amazon Gift Card|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-speck-of-dna-contains-a-movie-a-computer-virus-and-an-amazon-gift-card/518373/|accessdate=3 March 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erlich|first1=Yaniv|last2=Zielinski|first2=Dina|title=DNA Fountain enables a robust and efficient storage architecture|journal=Science|date=2 March 2017|volume=355|issue=6328|pages=950–954|doi=10.1126/science.aaj2038|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6328/950|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on performance ==
With the notable exception of NAND Flash memory, increasing storage density of a medium is generally associated with improved transfer speed at which that medium can operate. This is most obvious when considering various disk-based media, where the storage elements are spread over the surface of the disk and must be physically rotated under the "head" in order to be read or written. Higher density means more data moves under the head for any given mechanical movement.

Considering the floppy disk as a basic example, we can calculate the effective transfer speed by determining how fast the bits move under the head. A standard 3½-[[inch]] floppy disk spins at 300&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and the innermost track about 66&amp;nbsp;mm long (10.5&amp;nbsp;mm radius). At 300&amp;nbsp;rpm the linear speed of the media under the head is thus about 66&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;× 300&amp;nbsp;rpm = 19800&amp;nbsp;mm/minute, or 330&amp;nbsp;mm/s. Along that track the [[bit]]s are stored at a density of 686&amp;nbsp;bit/mm, which means that the head sees 686&amp;nbsp;bit/mm&amp;nbsp;× 330&amp;nbsp;mm/s = 226,380&amp;nbsp;bit/s (or 28.3&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s).

Now consider an improvement to the design that doubles the density of the bits by reducing sample length and keeping the same track spacing. This would immediately result in a doubling of transfer speed because the bits would be passing under the head twice as fast. Early floppy disk interfaces were originally designed with 250&amp;nbsp;kbit/s transfer speeds in mind, and were already being outperformed with the introduction of the "high density" 1.44&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] (1,440&amp;nbsp;KiB) floppies in the 1980s. The vast majority of PCs included interfaces designed for high density drives that ran at 500&amp;nbsp;kbit/s instead. These too were completely overwhelmed by newer devices like the [[LS-120]], which were forced to use higher-speed interfaces such as [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]].

Although the effect on performance is most obvious on rotating media, similar effects come into play even for solid-state media like [[Flash RAM]] or [[DRAM]]. In this case the performance is generally defined by the time it takes for the electrical signals to travel though the [[computer bus]] to the chips, and then through the chips to the individual "cells" used to store data (each cell holds one bit).

One defining electrical property is the resistance of the wires inside the chips. As the cell size decreases, through the improvements in [[semiconductor fabrication]] that lead to [[Moore's Law]], the resistance is reduced and less power is needed to operate the cells. This, in turn, means that less [[electric current]] is needed for operation, and thus less time is needed to send the required amount of electrical charge into the system. In DRAM in particular the amount of charge that needs to be stored in a cell's [[capacitor]] also directly affects this time.

As fabrication has improved, solid-state memory has improved dramatically in terms of performance. Modern DRAM chips had operational speeds on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;ns or less. A less obvious effect is that as density improves, the number of [[DIMM]]s needed to supply any particular amount of memory decreases, which in turn means less DIMMs overall in any particular computer. This often leads to improved performance as well, as there is less bus traffic. However, this effect is generally not linear.

== Effects on price ==
{{Globalize|date=January 2014}}
Storage density also has a strong effect on the price of memory, although in this case the reasons are not so obvious.

In the case of disk-based media, the primary cost is the moving parts inside the drive. This sets a fixed lower limit, which is why the average selling price for both of the major HDD manufacturers has been $45–75 US since 2007.&lt;ref name="Shilov 2013-10-29"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shilov |first=Anton |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/storage/display/2013102920393933_WD_Continues_to_Widen_Gap_with_Seagate_as_Average_Selling_Prices_of_Hard_Disk_Drives_Continue_to_Fall.html |title=WD Continues to Widen Gap with Seagate as Average Selling Prices of Hard Disk Drives Continue to Fall |work=xbitlabs |publisher=xbitlabs.com |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-08-11 |quote=Average selling prices of hard disk drives in $USD }}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, the price of high-end drives has fallen rapidly, and this is indeed an effect of density. In this case the only way to make a higher capacity drive is to use more platters, essentially individual hard drives within the case. As the density increases the number of platters needed to supply any given amount of storage falls, leading to lower costs due to the reduction of mechanical parts inside. It is worth observing dollars per gigabyte (GB) for hard drives.

The fact that overall price has remained fairly steady has led to the common measure of the [[price/performance ratio]] in terms of cost per bit. In these terms the increase in density of hard drives becomes much more obvious. IBM's RAMAC from 1956 supplied 5&amp;nbsp;MB for $50,000, or $10,000 per megabyte. In 1989, a typical 40&amp;nbsp;MB hard drive from [[Western Digital]] retailed for $1199.00, or $30/MB. Drives broke the $1/MB in 1994, and in early 2000 were about 2¢/MB. By 2004, the 250&amp;nbsp;GB Western Digital Caviar SE listed for $249.99, approaching $1/GB, an improvement of 36 ''thousand'' times since 1989, and 10 million since the RAMAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1758.ca/winch/winchest.html Cost of Hard Drive Storage Space] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728221058/http://ns1758.ca/winch/winchest.html |date=2014-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed-inline|False statement|date=August 2014}} As of 2011, 2&amp;nbsp;TB drives are selling for less than $70, or 3.5¢/GB, an improvement of 1 million times since 1989, and 280 million since the RAMAC. This is all without adjusting for inflation, which adds another factor of about seven times since 1956.

Solid-state storage has seen similar dramatic reductions in cost per bit. In this case the primary determinant of cost is ''yield'', the number of working chips produced in a unit time. Chips are produced in batches printed on the surface of a single large silicon wafer, which is then cut up and non-working examples are discarded. To improve yield, modern fabrication has moved to ever-larger wafers, and made great improvements in the quality of the production environment. Other factors include packaging the resulting wafer, which puts a lower limit on this process of about $1 per completed chip.&lt;ref name=dram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Research/Understanding_the_dynamics_of_/DRAM_3/dram_3.html|title=DRAM 3|work=iiasa.ac.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between information density and cost per bit can be illustrated as follows: a memory chip that is half the physical size means that twice as many units can be produced on the same wafer, thus halving the price of each one. As a comparison, DRAM was first introduced commercially in 1971, a 1&amp;nbsp;kbit part that cost about $50 in large batches, or about 5 cents per bit. 64&amp;nbsp;Mbit parts were common in 1999, which cost about 0.00002 cents per bit (20 microcents/bit).&lt;ref name=dram/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18096">[[Image:Self-winding wristwatch (transparent backside).jpg|thumb|right|Backside view of an automatic watch with an exhibition case back, showing its [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]]. The semicircular rotor which winds the mainspring is plainly visible.]]

An '''automatic''' or '''self-winding watch''' is a [[mechanical watch]] in which the natural motion of the wearer provides energy to run the watch, making [[manual winding]] unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GDIPAQAAMAAJ |author=American Management Association |authorlink=American Management Association |title=AMA Management Report |year=1958 |volume=13 |p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mechanical watch which is neither self-winding nor electrically driven is called a ''manual watch''.

==Operation==
In a [[mechanical watch]] the watch's gears are turned by a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]].  In a ''manual watch'' energy is stored in the mainspring by turning a knob, the ''crown'' on the side of the watch, winding the mainspring.  Then the energy from the mainspring powers the watch movement until it runs down, requiring the spring to be wound again.

A self-winding watch movement has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the natural motions of the wearer's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horologyzone |url=http://horologyzone.com/watch/watch-school/automatic-watch-disassembly.html |title=Automatic Watch Movement Disassembly |publisher=Horologyzone.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watch contains an oscillating weight that turns on a pivot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Popular Science |title=How a Self-Winding Watch Works|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QSYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 |p=96 |date=March 1961 |volume=178 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket or on the user's arm cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which is attached to a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]]ed winding mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_wsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA39 |p=39 |author=Harold C. Kelly |title=Watch Repair for Beginners: An Illustrated How-To Guide for the Beginner Watch Repaire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the mainspring. There are many different designs for modern self-winding mechanisms. Some designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two ratchets and wind the mainspring during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions.

The fully wound mainspring in a typical watch can store enough energy reserve for roughly two days, allowing the watch to keep running through the night while stationary. In many cases automatic wristwatches can also be wound manually by turning the crown, so the watch can be kept running when not worn, and in case the wearer's wrist motions are not sufficient to keep it wound automatically.{{efn|A notable exception is Seiko's wide range of watches based on the company's 7S26 movement, which cannot be hand-wound.}}

===Preventing overwinding===
Self-winding mechanisms continue working even after the mainspring is fully wound up. If a simple mainspring was used, this would put excessive tension on the mainspring. This could break the mainspring, and even if it did not, it can cause a problem called "knocking" or "banking". The excessive drive force applied to the watch movement gear train can make the [[balance wheel]] rotate with excessive [[amplitude]], causing the impulse pin to hit the back of the [[pallet fork]] horns. This will make the watch run fast, and could break the impulse pin. To prevent this, a slipping clutch device is used on the mainspring so it cannot be overwound.

===Slipping spring or "bridle"===
The "slipping mainspring" device was patented by [[Adrien Philippe]], one of the founders of [[Patek Philippe]], on 16 June 1863,&lt;ref&gt;Patent No. 58921&lt;/ref&gt; long before self-winding wristwatches. In an ordinary watch mainspring [[barrel (horology)|barrel]], the outer end of the spiral mainspring is attached to the inside of the barrel. In the slipping barrel, the mainspring is attached to a circular steel expansion spring, often called the 'bridle', which presses against the inside wall of the barrel, which has serrations or notches to hold it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mainspring of an Automatic Watch|work=Glossary|publisher=TimeZone Watch School|url=http://www.timezonewatchschool.com/WatchSchool/Glossary/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20and%20Barr/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20and%20Barr/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20-%20Auto%20S/glossary%20-%20mainspring%20-%20auto%20s.shtml|accessdate=2008-04-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406051750/http://www.timezonewatchschool.com/WatchSchool/Glossary/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20and%20Barr/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20and%20Barr/Glossary%20-%20Mainspring%20-%20Auto%20S/glossary%20-%20mainspring%20-%20auto%20s.shtml| archivedate= 6 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Diagram showing operation of slipping mainspring.&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as the mainspring is less than fully wound, the bridle holds the mainspring by friction to the barrel wall, allowing the mainspring to be wound. When the mainspring reaches full wind, its force is stronger than the bridle spring, and further winding pulls the bridle loose from the notches and it simply slides along the wall, preventing the mainspring from being wound further. The bridle must grip the barrel wall with just the right force to allow the mainspring to wind fully but not overwind. If it grips too loosely, the bridle will begin to slip before the mainspring is fully wound, a defect known as 'mainspring creep' which results in a shortened reserve power time.

A further advantage of this device is that the mainspring cannot be broken by excessive manual winding. This feature is often described in watch company advertising as an "unbreakable mainspring".

==History==
===Pocket watches===
The earliest reference to self-winding watches is at the end of 1773 when a newspaper reported that Joseph Tlustos had invented a watch that did not need to be wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Richard|title=The Origins of Self-Winding Watches, 1773 to 1779|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/Origins.html|accessdate=November 23, 2016}} page 19&lt;/ref&gt; But his idea was probably based on the myth of perpetual motion, and it is unlikely that it was a practical solution to the problem of self-winding watches. In 1776 Joseph Gallmayr also stated that he had made a self-winding watch, but there is no evidence to support this claim.

The earliest credible evidence for a successful design is the watch made by the Swiss watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Perrelet]], who lived in Le Locle. In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a self-winding mechanism for [[pocket watch]]es using an oscillating weight inside the watch that moved up and down.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Geneva Society of Arts, reporting on this watch in 1777, stated that 15 minutes walking was necessary to fully wind the watch. 

In 1777 [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] also became interested in the idea and his first attempts led him to make a self-winding mechanism with a barrel [[remontoire]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although a successful design, it was too complex and expensive for it to be manufactured and sold.

About the end of 1777 or early 1778, Hubert Sarton ([[:fr: Hubert Sarton]]) designed a watch with a rotor mechanism. Towards the end of 1778 he sent a watch to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and a report was written which, together with a drawing, gave a detailed description of the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Sarton's design is similar to those used in modern wrist watches, although there is no evidence linking the 18th-century design to 20th-century developments.

About the beginning of 1779, Abraham-Louis Breguet became aware of Perrelet's watches, probably through [[Louis Recordon]], who travelled from Geneva to London via Le Locle and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 250&lt;/ref&gt; Breguet studied and improved the design, and made many self-winding watches from then to about 1810. 

Although a few self-winding watches and patents for them were made from 1780 on, for more than one hundred years these watches were rare, until the advent of the wrist watch.

[[File:Mazzi-rotor.jpg|thumb|Circa 1778 automatic watch with rotor weight. Signed on the dial "Mazzi à Locarno".]]
During the years 1776 to 1810 four different types of weight were used:
; Side-weight : The weight pivots at the edge of the movement and can oscillate up and down. The movement of the weight is limited to about 40°. This is the most common design produced by many makers including Breguet.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 120&lt;/ref&gt;
: These watches were called ''jerking watches'' because, even with buffers, when the weight hit the case the whole watch would jerk.
; Center-weight : The weight pivots in the center of the movement and rotates clockwise and anti-clockwise. The weight is supported by a bridge that blocks the rotation and it is limited to about 180°.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 139&lt;/ref&gt; A few movements were made by different makers.
; Rotor-weight : Again the weight pivots in the center of the movement and rotates clockwise and anti-clockwise. However there is no bridge and it can rotate 360°.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 64&lt;/ref&gt; Very few of these movements were made.
; Movement-weight : Here the whole movement is pivoted in the case and acts as the weight. Only one example is known, made in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Sabrier, The Self-Winding Watch, (Paris, 2011, Éditions Cercle D'Art), pages 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, some watches used bidirectional winding and others used unidirectional winding. The latter is sufficient and all of Breguet's watches used unidirectional winding. 

Before the invention of the slipping mainspring, automatic watches had a system for locking the weight. Most common, as in the 1780 drawing, when the mainspring was fully wound a lever '''''K''''' was raised that entered a hole '''''N''''' in the weight to prevent it from moving until the mainspring had unwound enough to lower the lever. Different methods were used in side-weight, rotor and center-weight mechanisms.

===Wrist watches===
The advent of the wrist watch after World War I led to renewed interest in self-winding mechanisms, and all four types listed above were used:

:1922: Léon Leroy, a side-weight system. This was almost certainly derived from Breguet's design.

:1923: Harwood, a center-weight system (invented ca 1917). This is discussed below. It is not known if Harwood was influenced by earlier pocket watch designs.

:1930: Léon Hatot, ''Rolls'' watch, where the whole movement moves sideways. This was probably an independent re-invention.

:1931: Rolex, a rotor system with unidirectional winding.

====Harwood "Bumper" wristwatches: 1923====
[[File:Automatic Watch.jpg|thumb|upright|First automatic wristwatch, Harwood, c. 1929 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 47-3543)]]
Invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]], a watch repairer from Bolton, England, who took out a UK patent with his financial backer, Harry Cutts, on 7 July 1923, and obtained a corresponding Swiss patent on 16 October 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | format = [[Portable document format |PDF]] |title=Self-winding wrist watch clocks up 80 year anniversary |url=http://timepieceperfection.com/0406.pdf|publisher= The Patent Office|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Wrist Watch Movement – Harwood, England, 1958|url= http://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/406834 |publisher= Museum Victoria |accessdate=19 October 2015|quote=The self-winding system was invented by John Harwood in 1923. It uses an oscillating weighted arm with two buffer springs.

The ratchet mechanism wound the mainspring only when moving in one direction.  The weight did not rotate a full 360°; spring bumpers limited its swing to about 180°, to encourage a back and forth motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bumper Automatic vs. Full Rotor Automatic | work=FAQ | publisher=FinerTimes | url=http://www.finertimes.com/asp/faqs.asp | accessdate=2008-04-17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034928/http://www.finertimes.com/asp/faqs.asp | archivedate= 19 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early type of self-winding mechanism is now referred to as a 'hammer' or 'bumper'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Wind Me Up, Wind Me Down | format = PDF |url= http://people.timezone.com/msandler/Revolution/comp_history15.pdf |publisher= Complication |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its 18th century counterparts, Harwood's watch also had a problem with jerking because ''"the brass weight hit too sharply against the banking pins as it pivoted"''.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrier, ''The Self-winding Watch'', page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

When fully wound, Harwood's watch would run for 12 hours autonomously.{{citation needed |date= October 2016}} It did not have a conventional stem winder, so the hands were moved manually by rotating a bezel around the face of the watch. The watches were first produced with the help of Swiss watch manufacturer [[Fortis Uhren AG |Fortis]] and went on sale in 1928. 30,000 were made before the Harwood Self-Winding Watch Company collapsed in 1931 in the [[Great Depression]]. 'Bumper' watches were the first commercially successful automatic watches; they were made by several high grade watch manufacturers during the 1930s and 1940s.{{citation needed |date= October 2016}}

====Rolex====
The [[Rolex]] Watch Company improved Harwood's design in 1930 and used it as the basis for the Rolex Oyster Perpetual, in which the centrally mounted semi-circular weight could rotate through a full 360° rather than the about 200° of the 'bumper' winder.  Rolex's version also increased the amount of energy stored in the mainspring, allowing it to run autonomously for up to 35 hours.

Information about 18th century rotor watches was not published until 1949. Although the Oyster Perpetual was probably an original invention, the company may have known of Coviot's 1893 patent that re-invented the 18th century design.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, ''Origins'', page 317&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Eterna ball bearing====
The next development for automatic watches came in 1948 from [[Eterna |Eterna Watch]]. To wind a watch effectively, one of the chief requirements of a rotor is heft.  Until this point, the best bearing used in any watch was a [[jewel bearing]], which perfectly suits the small gears of a watch. A rotor, on the other hand, requires a different solution. In 1948, Eterna introduced the solution that is still in use today: [[ball bearing]]s. Ball bearings provide robust support for a heavy object to rotate smoothly and reliably even under abnormal stress, such as if the watch were dropped.

====Carl F. Bucherer weighted geared ring====
By the 1960s, automatic winding had become standard in quality mechanical watches. Because the rotor weight needed in an automatic watch takes up a lot of space in the case, increasing its thickness, some manufacturers of quality watches, such as [[Patek Philippe]], continue to design manually wound watches, which can be as thin as 1.77 millimeters.

However, in 2007 [[Carl F. Bucherer]] implemented a new approach without a rotor, a peripherally mounted power source,  where a geared ring made of [[tungsten]] encircles the entire mechanism, rotating on carbon rollers whenever the watch moves. A system of clutch wheels captures power. No rotor means thinner watches and an ultradense weight swinging around a greater radius means a better chance of achieving a greater power reserve with same amount of arm movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Design: Evolution of the Self-Winding Wristwatch | url=https://www.wired.com/2009/11/pl_design/| publisher = Wired.com |accessdate = 17 September 2016|date = 11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=17 September 2016 |title=Carl F.

'''Bio-Bus''' is the UK's first [[bus]] powered entirely by human [[faeces]] and food waste.

The bus, which entered service in south west England in 2014, is powered by [[biomethane]]. The gas is made from human sewage and food waste which is processed at a plant in [[Avonmouth]] which is run by GENeco a subsidiary of [[Wessex Water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bio-Bus|url=http://www.geneco.uk.com/Biobug/biobus.aspx|publisher=Geneco|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnov14&gt;{{cite web|title=UK's first 'poo bus' goes into service between Bristol and Bath|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-30115137|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK's first 'poo bus' hits the road|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/20/uks-first-poo-bus-hits-the-road|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=Guardian|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a Scania K270UB chassis and an Enviro300 body with 40 seats. A special registration was issued: YT13YUK.

The bus initially served a {{convert|15|mi}} [[Bath Bus Company]] route between [[Bristol Airport]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&lt;ref name=bbcnov14/&gt; The neighbouring city of [[Bristol]] was [[European Green Capital]] in 2015 and, in connection with this, the bus operated in Bristol on the [[First West of England|First Bristol]] number 2 route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK's first 'poo bus' goes into regular service|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/15/uk-first-poo-bio-bus-bristol-regular-service|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=Guardian|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol's 'Poo bus' prepares to make a splash|url=https://www.bristol2015.co.uk/news/bristols-poo-bus-prepares-make-splash/|publisher=Bristol 2015 European Green Capital|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar buses have operated in Oslo.&lt;ref name=guardianapril15&gt;{{cite news|last1=Niranjan|first1=Ajit|title='It doesn't even smell': a ride on the Bristol bus powered by human poo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/27/bristol-bus-powered-human-poo-smell|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=Guardian|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared with the [[diesel engine]]s normally used to power buses, the Bio bus produces 20-30% less [[carbon dioxide]], 80% fewer [[nitrogen oxides]] and is low in [[particulates]].&lt;ref name=guardianapril15/&gt; One tank of the gas will power the bus for {{convert|300|km}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Jamie|title=Britain's first 'Bio-Bus' running on human waste set to go into service|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/britains-first-biobus-running-on-human-waste-set-to-go-into-service-10109179.html|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this means that the bus has to make a significant journey to refuel, making it less economic to run.&lt;ref name=guardianapril15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK's first human poo bus to operate on Service 2 as part of First West of England's trial of gas technology|url=http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/bristol_bath/travel_news/news_initiatives/?item=26131|publisher=First|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol ‘poo bus’ launched to boost urban air quality|url=http://www.airqualitynews.com/2015/03/20/bristol-poo-bus-launched-to-boost-urban-air-quality/|publisher=Air Quality News|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CIIC 504''' is an [[Ogham inscription]].  It was discovered at [[Ballaqueeney]] (Ballaquine) [[Isle of Man]] in 1874 by Reverend F. B. Grant during the process of excavating dirt for use as railroad ballast. 

The stone was kept in a garden in Ballaqueeney from its discovery until about 1885. This caused the stone surface to deteriorate, due to being exposed to wind and rain. It is known that two characters can no longer be read. 

Archeologists note that "the grooves are finely cut with a V-shaped section'' and ''the scores forming the consonants for the most part are 2 inches in length...there are no traces of divisional points; but there are longer spaces between the words than between the letters."

The stones are now located in the Manx Museum in Douglas, Isle of Man.

"Bivaidonas", a person's name,  is believed to suggest that the person named was related to the [[Conailli Muirtheimne]] of north Louth and south Down.

'''Composite repairs'''. [[Composite material]]s are used in a wide range of applications in aerospace, marine,  automotive, surface transport and sports equipment markets. Damage to composite  components is not always visible to the naked eye and the extent of damage is  best determined for structural components by suitable Non Destructive Test  (NDT) methods. The concept for composite repair of composite or metallic  structures is simple. The bonded repair reduces stresses in the damaged region  and keeps the cracks from opening and therefore from growing.

== Composite structures of interest ==
[[File:Figure-1-composite-structures-a-laminated-and-b-sandwich.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Figure 1: Composite structures (a) laminated and (b) sandwich|Figure 1: Composite structures (a) laminated and (b) sandwich]]
The composite structures of interest are mainly components composed of laminated  plies or sandwich structures as shown in Figure 1. Laminate structures are assembled so that the fibre orientation provides most  of the desired mechanical properties and the matrix largely determines the  environmental performance. In sandwich structures thin, high strength skins are  separated by, and bonded to, lightweight honeycomb cores;  the thicker the core the stiffer the panel with minimal weight increase.

== Typical damage of composite structures ==

[[File:Figure-2-typical-damage-cases-of-laminates-and-sandwich-structures.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 2: Typical damage cases of laminates and sandwich structures|Figure 2: Typical damage cases of laminates and sandwich structures]]
The  most important damage to fibre reinforced composites is the result of impact  incidents. Low velocity and high velocity impact can result in significantly  different damage patterns for a given composite configuration. In metals the  impact energy is dissipated through elastic and plastic deformations and still  the structure retains a good margin of structural integrity. In fibre  reinforced composite materials however, the damage is usually more extensive  than that seen on the surface. Some typical damage cases for composite  structures are shown in Figure  2.

In  monolithic laminates the underlying damage can extend to a much greater extent  than the barely visible evidence on its surface. Other type of damage is  laminate splitting. Here the damage does not extend through the full length of  the part. The effects on the mechanical performance depend on the length of  split relative to the component thickness.

In  sandwich structures, impact results in dents of various sizes and depending on  the energy levels, puncture damage is not unusual. In this case both skins may  be damaged. Other common damage types include heat damage and bolt hole damage.  The heat damage is caused by the exposure at high temperature which causes a  local fracture with separation of surface plies. The bolt hole damage is cause  by the bearing stresses at the contact surfaces of the composite structure with  a bolt or rivet used for joining purposes. This could result in elongation of  the hole causing laminate splitting, or damage to the upper plies. In any case,  the effect on the mechanical performance depends on the thickness of the damaged  part.

Further  implications, apart from the initial impact damage, come from the exposure of  the damaged area to moisture and other degrading factors like chemicals,  lubricants, fuel, hydraulic fluids, etc. The presence of such environments may  result in further deterioration of the mechanical performance.

== Repair flow chart ==
[[File:Figure-3-typical-composite-repair-flowchart.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 3: Typical composite repair flowchart|Figure 3: Typical composite repair flowchart]]
When  performing a composite repair there are certain steps that should be followed.  In Figure  3,  a typical composite repair flowchart is given. The first step in the procedure  should be a careful damage assessment. Some damage to composites is obvious and  easily assessed but in many cases the damage may first appear quite small,  although the real damage is very much greater. Impact damage to a fibre can  appear as a small dent on the reinforced composite surface but the underlying damage can be much more extensive. The decision to repair or scrap is  determined by considering the extent of repair needed to replace the original structural performance of the composite. Other considerations are the repair costs, the position and accessibility of the damage and the availability of  suitable repair materials.

The initial assessment will determine the repair type to be performed. Easy repairs are usually small or do not affect the structural integrity of the component.  These repairs are made by following the simple guidelines indicated for laminate or sandwich panels. Complex repairs are needed when the damage is  extensive and needs to replace the structural performance of the component. The  best choice of materials would be to use the original fibres, fabrics and  matrix resin. Any alternative would need careful consideration of the service environment  of the repaired composite, i.e. hot, wet and mechanical performance. The proposed repair scheme should meet all the original design requirements for the  structure.

Some repairs need the specialist equipment of the workshop and some form of improvised repair is needed to return the component to a suitable repair workshop. A temporary repair, usually in the form of a patch, can be fixed to  the component to ensure safety until the component can be repaired at a later  date. For a permanent repair all the approved general guidelines for laminate and sandwich repairs should be followed. These repair operations should be  carried out in controlled workshop areas to ensure high quality. Operating in a controlled environment and attention to the detail will ensure success.

Before returning to service the quality check is always required. For comprehensive  inspection of repaired parts a number of Non Destructive Tests (NDT) can be  used. Special attention should be given to the quality of the repaired area and more specifically to the interface  between the original part and the repaired area. Usual inspection methods include some form of ultrasonic or X-ray inspection.

A  typical composite repair usually starts after damage detection either by  unarmed eye or various other NDT-techniques. After evaluating the extent of the  damage, the damage zone is prepared for reparation. This is done by removing  the composite material around the damage zone 1. Three techniques are known to be utilised,  being slightly different depending on the nature of the composite, as shown in Figure 4.
[[File:Figure-4-typical-laminate-and-sandwich-repairs.jpg|thumb|center|Figure 4: Typical laminate and sandwich repairs]]

When  a composite repair is applied the proper surface treatment is essential for a  successful result. The above-mentioned repairs can be time consuming and often  require high skills and experience to be performed. This is why current  developments tend to focus on automating this process either by advanced  mechanical milling or alternate technologies like nanosecond-pulsed lasers 2-3. After the damage zone has been completely  excavated, surfaces are cleaned and further prepared for the final repair by  patches. This can be done by plasma burning of surface contaminants, exposing  fibres by removing matrix material through laser radiation or improving the  surface wettability for adhesives by photochemical reactions induced by  UV-laser light 4.

In a  typical repair, the patch is applied under vacuum and at temperatures high  enough for the curing of the adhesive. For these purposes a portable hot bonder  device may be used for in the field repairs. For more complex and higher  quality repairs an autoclave should be used. A hot bonder unit is shown in Figure 5.
[[File:Figure-5-typical-hot-bonder-portable-unit-it-can-apply-vacuum-heat-up-the-repair-area-and-constantly-monitor-and-regulate-temperature.jpg|thumb|center|Figure 5: Typical hot bonder portable unit. It can apply vacuum, heat up the repair area and constantly monitor and regulate temperature]]

In  any case, the application of a vacuum bag is a necessary step for high quality  repairs. Vacuum bag processing is suited to components with thin sections and  large sandwich structures. The vacuum bag technique involves the placing and  sealing of a flexible bag over a composite lay-up and evacuating all the air  from under the bag as schematically shown in Figure 6.
[[File:Figure-6-Left-Details-of-vacuum-bag-lay-up-Right-Vacuum-bag-sealing-and-vacuum-application-results-in-atmospheric-pressure-on-the-repair-region-prepreg.jpg|thumb|center|Figure 6: Left: Details of vacuum bag lay-up. Right: Vacuum bag sealing and vacuum application results in atmospheric pressure on the repair region (prepreg)]]

The  removal of air forces the bag down onto the lay-up with consolidation pressure  of 1 atmosphere (1 bar). The completed assembly, with vacuum still applied, is  heated up to the desired temperature for curing . This can be achieved by using  heating mat or by placing the assembly inside an oven with good air  circulation. For thicker sections and high quality bonding, the use of an autoclave  with regulated temperature and additional overpressure should be sought.

The  most important technical challenges in the implementation of a successful  composite patch repair are: (a) proper design of the repair patch and the  procedures that will be followed, (b) selection of the most suitable materials  and tools for the application, (c) careful surface preparation (d)  implementation of the composite patch repair and careful application of the  cure cycle, (e) non destructive evaluation of the repair by suitable  methodology and (f) monitoring of the structural integrity of the repair either  at specific time intervals either continuously.

A '''copper indium gallium selenide solar cell''' (or '''CIGS cell''', sometimes CI(G)S or CIS cell) is a [[thin-film solar cell]] used to convert sunlight into electric power. It is manufactured by depositing a thin layer of [[copper indium gallium selenide|copper, indium, gallium and selenide]] on glass or plastic backing, along with electrodes on the front and back to collect current. Because the material has a high [[absorption coefficient]] and strongly absorbs sunlight, a much thinner film is required than of other semiconductor materials.

CIGS is one of three mainstream thin-film PV technologies, the other two being [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|cadmium telluride]] and [[amorphous silicon]]. Like these materials, CIGS layers are thin enough to be flexible, allowing them to be deposited on flexible substrates. However, as all of these technologies normally use high-temperature deposition techniques, the best performance normally comes from cells deposited on glass, even though advances in low-temperature deposition of CIGS cells have erased much of this performance difference. CIGS outperforms polysilicon at the cell level, however its module efficiency is still lower, due to a less mature upscaling.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Martin A., et al. "Solar cell efficiency tables (version 50)." Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications 25.7 (2017): 668-676.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin-film market share is stagnated at around 15 percent, leaving the rest of the PV market to conventional [[solar cell]]s made of [[crystalline silicon]]. In 2013, the market share of CIGS alone was about 2 percent and all thin-film technologies combined fell below 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, July 28, 2014, pages 18,19]&lt;/ref&gt; CIGS cells continue being developed, as they promise to reach silicon-like efficiencies, while maintaining their low costs, as is typical for thin-film technology.&lt;ref name=spw-cigs-simplified&gt;

== Properties ==

CIGS is a [[Alkali metal|I]]-[[Group 3 element|III]]-[[Group 6 element|VI]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound [[semiconductor material]] composed of [[copper]], [[indium]], [[gallium]], and [[selenium]]. The material is a [[solid solution]] of copper indium selenide (often abbreviated "CIS") and copper gallium selenide, with a chemical formula of CuIn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;(1-x)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the value of x can vary from 1 (pure copper indium selenide) to 0 (pure copper gallium selenide). It is a [[tetrahedral]]ly [[chemical bond|bond]]ed semiconductor, with the [[chalcopyrite]] crystal structure. The [[bandgap]] varies continuously with ''x'' from about 1.0 eV (for copper indium selenide) to about 1.7 eV (for copper gallium selenide).&lt;ref name=str&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pssa.2211240206|title=Phase Diagram and Optical Energy Gaps for CuInyGa1−ySe2 Alloys|year=1991|last1=Tinoco|first1=T.|last2=Rincón|first2=C.|last3=Quintero|first3=M.|last4=Pérez|first4=G.

== Structure ==

The most common device structure for CIGS solar cells is shown in the diagram ''(see Figure 1: Structure of a CIGS device)''. [[Soda-lime glass]] of about of 1–3&amp;nbsp;[[milimetre]]s thickness is commonly used as a substrate, because the [[glass sheet]]s contains sodium, which has been shown to yield a substantial open-circuit voltage increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hedström J. |author2=Ohlsen H. |author3=Bodegard M. |author4=Kylner A. |author5=Stolt L. |author6=Hariskos D. |author7=Ruckh M. |author8=Schock H.W. |title=ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells with improved performance|journal=Proceedings of 23rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference|year=1993|pages=364–371|doi=10.1109/PVSC.1993.347154|isbn=978-0-7803-1220-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably through surface and grain boundary defects passivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kronik L. |author2=Cahen D. |author3=Schock H.W. |title=Effects of sodium on polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and its solar cell performance|journal=Advanced Materials|year=1998|volume=10|pages=31–36|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(199801)10:1&lt;31::AID-ADMA31&gt;3.0.CO;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many companies are also looking at lighter and more flexible substrates such as [[polyimide]] or metal foils.&lt;ref name="G.

Following molybdenum deposition a [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] CIGS absorber layer is grown by one of several unique methods. A thin [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] buffer layer is added on top of the absorber. The buffer is typically [[cadmium sulfide]] (CdS) deposited via [[chemical bath deposition]]. The buffer is overlaid with a thin, intrinsic [[zinc oxide]] layer (i-ZnO) which is capped by a thicker, [[aluminum]] (Al) doped ZnO layer. The i-ZnO layer is used to protect the CdS and the absorber layer from sputtering damage while depositing the ZnO:Al window layer, since the latter is usually deposited by DC sputtering, known as a damaging process.&lt;ref name=i-ZnO&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cooray N. F.; Kushiya K., Fujimaki A., Sugiyama I., Miura T., Okumura D., Sato M., Ooshita M.  and Yamase O.|title=Large area ZnO films optimized for graded band-gap Cu(InGa)Se2-based thin-film mini-modules|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|year=1997|volume=49|pages=291–297|doi=10.1016/S0927-0248(97)00055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al doped ZnO serves as a transparent conducting oxide to collect and move electrons out of the cell while absorbing as little light as possible.

&lt;!-- to be merged with paragraph above

The [[heterojunction]] is formed between the semiconductors CIGS and [[ZnO]], separated by a thin layer of [[CdS]] and a layer of [[intrinsic]] ZnO. The CIGS is doped [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] from intrinsic defects, while the ZnO is doped [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] to a much larger extent through the incorporation of [[aluminum]] (Al). This asymmetric doping causes the [[space charge region|space-charge region]] to extend much further into the CIGS than into the ZnO. Matched to this are the layer thicknesses and the [[bandgap]]s of the materials: the wide CIGS layer serves as absorber with a bandgap between 1.02 [[Electronvolt|eV]] (CuInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 1.65 eV (CuGaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Absorption is minimized in the upper layers, called [[window]], by the choice of larger bandgaps: E&lt;sub&gt;g,ZnO&lt;/sub&gt;=3.2 eV and E&lt;sub&gt;g,CdS&lt;/sub&gt;=2.4 eV. The doped ZnO also serves as front contact for current collection. [[Laboratory]] scale devices, typically 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size, are provided with a [[Nickel|Ni]]/[[Aluminium|Al]]-grid [[deposition (chemistry)|deposited]] onto the front side to contact the ZnO.&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/44622.pdf|title=Polycrystalline Thin Film Solar Cell Technologies|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory Colorado U.S.A.|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CuInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials that are of interest for photovoltaic applications include several elements from groups I, III and VI in the [[periodic table]]. These semiconductors are especially attractive for solar applications because of their high optical absorption coefficients and versatile optical and electrical characteristics, which can in principle be manipulated and tuned for a specific need in a given device.&lt;ref&gt;"Thin film CuInSe2/Cd(Zn)S Heterojunction Solar Cell : Characterization and Modeling", Murat Nezir Eron, PhD.

=== Conversion efficiency===

CIGS is mainly used in the form of [[polycrystalline]] [[thin film]]s. The best efficiency achieved as of September 2014 was 21.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zsw-bw.de/en/support/press-releases/press-detail/zsw-brings-world-record-back-to-stuttgart.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424014510/http://www.zsw-bw.de/en/support/press-releases/press-detail/zsw-brings-world-record-back-to-stuttgart.html |archivedate=2015-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory achieved 19.9%, a record at the time,&lt;ref name="19.9%"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42539.pdf|title=Characterization of 19.9%-Efficient CIGS Absorbers|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|date= May 2008|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by modifying the CIGS surface and making it look like CIS.&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt; These examples were deposited on glass, which meant the products were not mechanically flexible. In 2013, scientists at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology developed CIGS cells on flexible polymer foils with a new record efficiency of 20.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/3/131438/---/l=2 |title=Empa takes thin film solar cells to a new level – A new world record for solar cell efficiency |website=Empa |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These display both the highest efficiency and greatest flexibility.

Higher efficiencies (around 30%) can be obtained by using optics to [[concentrated photovoltaics|concentrate]] the incident light.

=== Comparison ===

==== Conventional crystalline silicon ====

Unlike conventional [[crystalline silicon]] cells based on a [[homojunction]], the structure of CIGS cells is a more complex [[heterojunction]] system. A [[direct bandgap]] material, CIGS has very strong light absorption and a layer of only 1–2 [[micrometers]] (µm) is enough to absorb most of the sunlight. By comparison, a much greater thickness of about 160–190&amp;nbsp;µm is required for crystalline silicon.

The active CIGS-layer can be deposited in a [[polycrystalline]] form directly onto molybdenum (Mo) [[coating|coated]] on a variety of several different substrates such as glass sheets, steel bands and plastic foils made of polyimide. This uses less energy than smelting large amounts of quartz sand in electric furnaces and growing large crystals, necessary for conventional silicon cells, and thus reduces its [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]] significantly. Also unlike crystalline silicon, these substrates can be [[flexible electronics|flexible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2008/February/FirstSalesForWorldsCheapestSolarCells.asp|title=First sales for 'world's cheapest solar cells'|publisher=Chemistry world February 2008|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the highly [[Thin film solar cell#Production, cost and market|competitive PV industry]], pressure increased on [[List of CIGS companies|CIGS manufacturers]], leading to the bankruptcy of several companies, as prices for conventional silicon cells declined rapidly in recent years. However, CIGS solar cells have become as [[Solar cell efficiency#Comparison|efficient]] as [[multicrystalline silicon]] cells—the most common type of solar cells. CIGS and [[CdTe-PV]] remain the only two commercially successful thin-film technologies in a globally [[Growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing PV market]].

==== Other thin films ====

In photovoltaics "thinness" generally is in reference to so-called "first generation" high-efficiency silicon cells, which are manufactured from bulk wafers hundreds of micrometers thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|20090223551|patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thin films sacrifice some light gathering efficiency but use less material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nurul Amziah Md Yunus |author2=Nik Hasniza Nik Aman |author3=Nima Khoshsirat | title=Comparison between thin-film solar cells and copper–indium–gallium–diselenide in Southeast Asia| journal=IET Renewable Power Generation|volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1079–1086 |year=2015|doi= 10.1049/iet-rpg.2015.0114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CIGS the efficiency tradeoff is less severe than in silicon. The record efficiencies for thin film CIGS cells are slightly lower than that of CIGS for lab-scale top performance cells. In 2008, CIGS efficiency was by far the highest compared with those achieved by other thin film technologies such as [[cadmium telluride photovoltaics]] (CdTe) or [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si).&lt;ref name="19.9%" /&gt; CIS and CGS solar cells offer total area efficiencies of 15.0% and 9.5%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, D. L.|title=Improved performance in ZnO/CdS/CuGaSe2 thin-film solar cells|journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications|volume=11|page=535|year=2003|doi=10.1002/pip.516|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229322/files/article.pdf|last2=Keane|first2=James|last3=Duda|first3=Anna|last4=Abushama|first4=Jehad A.

In 2015, the gap with the other thin film technologies has been closed, with record cell efficiencies in laboratories of 21.5% for CdTe (FirstSolar) and 21.7% for CIGS (ZSW).

All high performance CIGS absorbers in solar cells have similarities independent of production technique. First, they are [[polycrystalline]] α-phase which has the [[chalcopyrite]] crystal structure shown in Figure 3. The second property is an overall [[Copper|Cu]] deficiency.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10408430590918341|title=Thin Film Deposition Methods for CuInSe2 Solar Cells|year=2005|last1=Kemell|first1=Marianna|last2=Ritala|first2=Mikko|last3=Leskelä|first3=Markku|journal=Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences|volume=30|issue=1|page=1|bibcode = 2005CRSSM..30....1K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cu deficiency increases the [[majority carrier]] (hole) concentration by increasing the number of (electron-accepting) Cu vacancies. When CIGS films are In rich (Cu deficient) the film's surface layer forms an ordered defect compound (ODC) with a [[stoichiometry]] of Cu(In,Ga)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The ODC is n-type, forming a p-n homojunction in the film at the interface between the α phase and the ODC. The [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination velocity]] at the CIGS/CdS interface is decreased by the homojunction's presence. The drop in interface recombination attributable to ODC formation is demonstrated by experiments which have shown that recombination in the bulk of the film is the main loss mechanism in Cu deficient films, while in Cu rich films the main loss is at the CIGS/CdS interface.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Ihlal 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tsf.2006.12.136|title=Comparative study of sputtered and electrodeposited CI(S,Se) and CIGSe thin films|year=2007|last1=Ihlal|first1=A|last2=Bouabid|first2=K|last3=Soubane|first3=D|last4=Nya|first4=M|last5=Aittalebali|first5=O|last6=Amira|first6=Y|last7=Outzourhit|first7=A|last8=Nouet|first8=G|journal=Thin Solid Films|volume=515|issue=15|page=5852|bibcode = 2007TSF...515.5852I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium incorporation is necessary for optimal performance. Ideal Na concentration is considered to be approximately 0.1%. Na is commonly supplied by the [[soda-lime glass]] substrate, but in processes that do not use this substrate the Na must be deliberately added. Na's beneficial effects include increases in p-type [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]], and average grain size. Furthermore, Na incorporation allows for performance to be maintained over larger [[stoichiometric]] deviations.&lt;ref name="J. Stanbery 2002"/&gt; Simulations have predicted that Na on an In site creates a shallow acceptor level and that Na serves to remove In on Cu defects (donors), but reasons for these benefits are controversial. Na is also credited with catalyzing [[oxygen]] absorption. Oxygen passivates Se vacancies that act as compensating donors and recombination centers.
	
Alloying CIS (CuInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with CGS (CuGaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increases the bandgap. To reach the ideal bandgap for a single junction solar cell, 1.5 eV, a Ga/(In+Ga) ratio of roughly 0.7 is optimal. However, at ratios above ~0.3, device performance drops off. Industry currently targets the 0.3 Ga/(In+Ga) ratio, resulting in bandgaps between 1.1 and 1.2 eV. The decreasing performance has been postulated to be a result of CGS not forming the ODC, which is necessary for a good interface with CdS.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt;

The highest efficiency devices show substantial texturing, or preferred [[crystallographic]] orientation. A (204) surface orientation is observed in the best quality devices.&lt;ref name="J. Stanbery 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanbery, B. J. |journal= Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Science |volume=27|page= 73 |year=2002|doi=10.1080/20014091104215|title=Copper Indium Selenides and Related Materials for Photovoltaic Devices|issue=2|bibcode = 2002CRSSM..27...73S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A smooth absorber surface is preferred to maximize the ratio of the illuminated area to the area of the interface. The area of the interface increases with roughness while illuminated area remains constant, decreasing [[open circuit voltage]] (V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;). Studies have also linked an increase in defect density to decreased V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;. Recombination in CIGS has been suggested to be dominated by non-radiative processes. Theoretically, recombination can be controlled by engineering the film, and is extrinsic to the material.&lt;ref name="L. Repins 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pip.654|title=Comparison of device performance and measured transport parameters in widely-varying Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) solar cells|year=2006|last1=Repins|first1=I.

== Production ==

=== Film production ===

The most common [[vacuum]]-based process is to co-evaporate or co-sputter copper, gallium, and indium onto a substrate at room temperature, then anneal the resulting film with a selenide vapor. An alternative process is to co-evaporate copper, gallium, indium and selenium onto a heated substrate.

A non-vacuum-based alternative process deposits [[nanoparticle]]s of the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] materials on the [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] and then [[sinters]] them [[in situ]]. [[Electroplating]] is another low cost alternative to apply the CIGS layer.

The following sections outline the various techniques for precursor deposition processing, including sputtering of metallic layers at low temperatures, printing of inks containing [[nanoparticles]], [[electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]], and a technique inspired by wafer-bonding.

==== Selenization ====

The Se supply and selenization environment is important in determining the properties and quality of the film. When Se is supplied in the gas phase (for example as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se or elemental Se) at high temperatures, the Se becomes incorporated into the film by absorption and subsequent diffusion. During this step, called chalcogenization, complex interactions occur to form a [[chalcogenide]]. These interactions include formation of Cu-In-Ga [[intermetallic]] alloys, formation of intermediate metal-selenide binary compounds and phase separation of various stoichiometric CIGS compounds. Because of the variety and complexity of the reactions, the properties of the CIGS film are difficult to control.&lt;ref name="J. Stanbery 2002"/&gt;

The Se source affects the resulting film properties. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se offers the fastest Se incorporation into the absorber; 50 at% Se can be achieved in CIGS films at temperatures as low as 400&amp;nbsp;°C. By comparison, elemental Se only achieves full incorporation with reaction temperatures above 500&amp;nbsp;°C. Films formed at lower temperatures from elemental Se were Se deficient, but had multiple phases including metal selenides and various [[alloys]]. Use of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se provides the best compositional uniformity and the largest grain sizes. However, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is highly toxic and is classified as an [[environmental hazard]].

==== Sputtering of metallic layers followed by selenization ====

In this method a metal film of Cu, In and Ga is sputtered at or near room temperature and reacted in a Se atmosphere at high temperature. This process has higher throughput than coevaporation and compositional uniformity can be more easily achieved.

Sputtering a stacked multilayer of metal – for example a Cu/In/Ga/Cu/In/Ga... structure – produces a smoother surface and better crystallinity in the absorber compared to a simple bilayer (Cu-Ga alloy/In) or trilayer (Cu/In/Ga) sputtering. These attributes result in higher efficiency devices, but forming the multilayer is a more complicated deposition process and did not merit the extra equipment or the added process complexity.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt; Additionally, the reaction rates of Cu/Ga and Cu/In layers with Se are different. If the reaction temperature is not high enough, or not held long enough, CIS and CGS form as separate phases. 
	
Companies currently that used similar processes include Showa Shell, [[Saint-Gobain#Innovative Materials|Avancis]] (now an affiliate of [[Saint-Gobain]] Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avancis.de/en/company/about-avancis/avancis-history/|title=Avancis History|publisher=avancis.de|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Miasolé]], Honda Soltec, and Energy Photovoltaics (EPV).&lt;ref name="S. Ulal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ulal, H. S.  |author2=von Roedern, B. |title=Critical Issues for Commercialization of Thin-Film PV Technologies|journal= Solid State Technology|volume= 51|pages= 52–54|issue=2 |year=2008|url=http://www.electroiq.com/articles/sst/print/volume-51/issue-2/features/thin-film-technology/critical-issues-for-commercialization-of-thin-film-pv-technologies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showa Shell sputtered a Cu-Ga alloy layer and an In layer, followed by selenization in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se and sulfurization in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. The sulfurization step appears to passivate the surface in a way similar to CdS in most other cells. Thus, the buffer layer used is Cd-free, eliminating any environmental impact of Cd. Showa Shell reported a maximum module efficiency of 13.6% with an average of 11.3% for 3600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; substrates.&lt;ref name="G. Dhere 2007"/&gt; Shell Solar uses the same technique as Showa Shell to create the absorber; however, their CdS layer comes from chemical vapor deposition. Modules sold by Shell Solar claim 9.4% module efficiency.
	
Miasole had procured venture capital funds for its process and scale up. However, little is known about their process beyond their stated efficiency of 9 to 10% for modules.
	
EPV uses a hybrid between coevaporation and sputtering in which In and Ga are evaporated in a Se atmosphere. This is followed by Cu sputtering and selenization. Finally, In and Ga are again evaporated in the presence of Se. Based on Hall measurements, these films have a low carrier concentration and relatively high mobility. EPV films have a low defect concentration.

==== Chalcogenization of particulate precursor layers ====

In this method, metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles are used as the precursors for CIGS growth. These nanoparticles are generally suspended in a water based solution and then applied to large areas by various methods, such as printing. The film is then dehydrated and, if the precursors are metal-oxides, reduced in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. Following dehydration, the remaining porous film is [[sintered]] and selenized at temperatures greater than 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L. Repins 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Derbyshire 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Derbyshire, K. |title=Public policy for engineers: solar industry depends on policymakers' goodwill|url=http://www.electroiq.com/articles/sst/print/volume-51/issue-8/features/cover-article/public-policy-for-engineers-solar-industry-depends-on-policymakersrsquo-goodwill.html|journal= Solid State Technology |volume=51|page= 32|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanosolar]] and [[International Solar Electric Technology]] (ISET) unsuccessfully attempted to scale up this process.&lt;ref name="G. Dhere 2007"/&gt; ISET uses oxide particles, while Nanosolar did not discuss its ink. The advantages of this process include uniformity over large areas, non-vacuum or low-vacuum equipment and adaptability to [[roll-to-roll]] manufacturing. When compared to laminar metal precursor layers, sintered nanoparticles selenize more rapidly. The increased rate is a result of the greater surface area associated with [[porosity]]. Porosity produces rougher absorber surfaces. Use of particulate precursors allows for printing on a large variety of substrates with materials utilization of 90% or more. Little research and development supported this technique.
	
Nanosolar reported a cell (not module) efficiency of 14%, however this was not verified by any [[national laboratory]] testing, nor did they allow onsite inspections. In independent testing&lt;ref name="L. Repins 2006"/&gt; ISET's absorber had the 2nd lowest efficiency at 8.6%. However, all the modules that beat ISET's module were coevaporated, a process which has manufacturing disadvantages and higher costs. ISET's sample suffered most from low V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; and low [[fill factor (solar cell)|fill factor]], indicative of a rough surface and/or a high number of defects aiding recombination. Related to these issues, the film had poor transport properties including a low Hall mobility and short carrier lifetime.

==== Electrodeposition followed by selenization ====

Precursors can be deposited by electrodeposition. Two methodologies exist: deposition of elemental layered structures and simultaneous deposition of all elements (including Se). Both methods require thermal treatment in a Se atmosphere to make device quality films. Because electrodeposition requires conductive [[electrodes]], metal foils are a logical substrate. Electrodeposition of elemental layers is similar to the sputtering of elemental layers. 
	
Simultaneous deposition employs a working electrode ([[cathode]]), a counter electrode ([[anode]]), and a reference electrode as in Figure 4. A metal foil substrate is used as the working electrode in industrial processes. An inert material provides the counter electrode, and the reference electrode measures and controls the potential. The reference electrode allows the process to be performed potentiostatically, allowing control of the substrate's potential.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt;
	
[[File:CIGSfigure4.png|right|350px|thumb|Figure 4: CIGS electrodeposition apparatus]]

Simultaneous electrodeposition must overcome the fact that the elements' standard reduction potentials are not equal, causing preferential deposition of a single element. This problem is commonly alleviated by adding countering ions into solution for each ion to be deposited (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Se&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, In&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), thus changing that ion's reduction potential. Further, the Cu-Se system has a complicated behavior and the film's composition depends on the Se&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion flux ratio which can vary over the film surface. This requires the precursor concentrations and deposition potential to be optimized. Even with optimization, reproducibility is low over large areas due to composition variations and potential drops along the substrate.
	
The resulting films have small grains, are Cu-rich, and generally contain Cu&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; phases along with impurities from the solution. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] is required to improve crystallinity. For efficiencies higher than 7%, a stoichiometry correction are required. The correction was originally done via high temperature physical vapor deposition, which is not practical in industry.
	
[[Solopower]] is currently producing cells with &gt;13.7% conversion efficiency as per NREL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solopower.com/our-difference/engineering-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903131139/http://solopower.com/our-difference/engineering-design/ |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Precursor combination by wafer-bonding inspired technique ====
[[File:WikiFig6.jpg|350px|thumb|Figure 5: Schematic of wafer-bonding inspired technique]]

In this process, two different precursor films are deposited separately on a substrate and a superstrate. The films are pressed together and heated to release the film from the reusable superstrate, leaving a CIGS absorber on the substrate (Figure 5). [[Heliovolt]] patented this procedure and named it the FASST process. In principle, the precursors can be deposited at low temperature using low-cost deposition techniques, lowering module cost. However, the first generations of products use higher temperature PVD methods and do not achieve full cost cutting potential. Flexible substrates could eventually be used in this process. 
	
Typical film characteristics are not known outside of the company, as no research has been conducted by independently funded laboratories. However, Heliovolt claimed a top cell efficiency of 12.2%.

=== Coevaporation ===

Coevaporation, or codeposition, is the most prevalent CIGS fabrication technique. [[Boeing]]'s coevaporation process deposits bilayers of CIGS with different stoichiometries onto a heated substrate and allows them to intermix.

NREL developed another process that involves three deposition steps and produced the current CIGS efficiency record holder at 20.3%. The first step in NREL's method is codeposition of In, Ga, and Se. This is followed by Cu and Se deposited at a higher temperature to allow for diffusion and intermixing of the elements. In the final stage In, Ga, and Se are again deposited to make the overall composition Cu deficient.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005" /&gt;
	
[[Würth Solar]] began producing CIGS cells using an inline coevaporation system in 2005 with module efficiencies between 11% and 12%. They opened another production facility and continued to improve efficiency and yield. Other companies scaling up coevaporation processes include [[Global Solar]] and [[Ascent Solar]].&lt;ref name="S. Ulal 2008"/&gt; Global Solar used an inline three stage deposition process. In all of the steps Se is supplied in excess in the vapor phase. In and Ga are first evaporated followed by Cu and then by In and Ga to make the film Cu deficient. These films performed quite favorably in relation to other manufacturers and to absorbers grown at NREL and the Institute for Energy Conversion (IEC).&lt;ref name="L. Repins 2006"/&gt; However, modules of Global Solar’s films did not perform as well. The property in which the module most obviously under-performed was a low V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;, which is characteristic of high defect density and high recombination velocities. Global Solar’s absorber layer outperformed the NREL absorber in carrier lifetime and hall mobility. However, as completed cells the NREL sample performed better. This is evidence of a poor CIGS/CdS interface, possibly due to the lack of an ODC surface layer on the Global Solar film.
	
Disadvantages include uniformity issues over large areas and the related difficulty of coevaporating elements in an inline system. Also, high growth temperatures raise the thermal budget and costs. Additionally, coevaporation is plagued by low material utilization (deposition on chamber walls instead of the substrate, especially for selenium) and expensive vacuum equipment.&lt;ref name="G. Dhere 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Derbyshire 2008"/&gt; A way to enhance Se utilisation is via a thermal or plasma-enhanced selenium-cracking process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ishizuka, S.|title=Large grain CIGS thin film growth using a Se-radical beam source|journal=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells|volume= 93|page=792|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2008.09.043|last2=Yamada|first2=Akimasa|last3=Shibata|first3=Hajime|last4=Fons|first4=Paul|last5=Sakurai|first5=Keiichiro|last6=Matsubara|first6=Koji|last7=Niki|first7=Shigeru|issue=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kawamura, M.|title=CIGS thin-film solar cells grown with cracked selenium|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume= 311|page=753|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.09.091|bibcode = 2009JCrGr.311..753K|last2=Fujita|first2=Toshiyuki|last3=Yamada|first3=Akira|last4=Konagai|first4=Makoto|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be coupled with an [[ion beam|ion beam source]] for [[ion beam assisted deposition]].&lt;ref name="Solarion AG"&gt;Solarion AG (2009-10-07): ''[http://www.solarion.net/assets/files/SOLARION%20Press%20Release%20eng%20world%20record.pdf World record: 13.4% conversion efficiency in solar cells on plastic film].'' (press release)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical vapor deposition ===

[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) has been implemented in multiple ways for the deposition of CIGS. Processes include atmosphere pressure metal organic CVD (AP-[[MOCVD]]), plasma-enhanced CVD ([[PECVD]]), low-pressure MOCVD (LP-MOCVD), and aerosol assisted MOCVD (AA-MOCVD). Research is attempting to switch from dual-source precursors to single-source precursors.&lt;ref name="M. Kemell 2005"/&gt; Multiple source precursors must be homogeneously mixed and the flow rates of the precursors have to be kept at the proper stoichiometry. Single-source precursor methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and should enable better control of film composition.
	
As of 2014 CVD was not used for commercial CIGS synthesis. CVD produced films have low efficiency and a low V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;, partially a result of a high defect concentration. Additionally, film surfaces are generally quite rough which serves to further decrease the V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the requisite Cu deficiency has been achieved using AA-MOCVD along with a (112) crystal orientation.
	
CVD deposition temperatures are lower than those used for other processes such as co-evaporation and selenization of metallic precursors. Therefore, CVD has a lower thermal budget and lower costs. Potential manufacturing problems include difficulties converting CVD to an inline process as well as the expense of handling volatile precursors.

=== Electrospray deposition ===

CIS films can be produced by [[electrospray]] deposition. The technique involves the electric field assisted spraying of ink containing CIS nano-particles onto the substrate directly and then sintering in an inert environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.059|title=CIS layer deposition through electrospray process for solar cell fabrication|year=2011|last1=Muhammad|first1=Nauman Malik|last2=Sundharam|first2=Sridharan|last3=Dang|first3=Hyun-Woo|last4=Lee|first4=Ayoung|last5=Ryu|first5=Beyoung-Hwan|last6=Choi|first6=Kyung-Hyun|journal=Current Applied Physics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=S68|bibcode = 2011CAP....11S..68M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of this technique is that the process takes place at room temperature and it is possible to attach this process with some continuous or mass production system like roll-to-roll production mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3139/146.110581|title=Electrospray deposition of thin copper-indium-diselenide films|year=2011|last1=Choi|first1=Kyung-Hyun|last2=Muhammad|first2=Nauman Malik|last3=Dang|first3=Hyun-Woo|last4=Lee|first4=Ayoung|last5=Hwang|first5=Jin-Soo|last6=Nam|first6=Jong Won|last7=Ryu|first7=Beyoung-Hwan|journal=International Journal of Materials Research|volume=102|issue=10|pages=1252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Double H Pipeline''' is a planned {{convert|462|mi|adj=on}} crude oil pipeline from [[Dore, North Dakota]] to [[Guernsey, Wyoming]]. It is supposed to carry 100,000 barrels (50,000 initially) of crude oil from the North Dakota and [[Bakken formation]] shale plays as well as Wyoming's oil fields.

==Overview==
The project was proposed by Hiland Crude, LLC  a subsidiary of Hiland Partners that is owned by the [[Harold Hamm]] family from [[Enid, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falloncountyextra.com/2013/04/12/pipeline-proposed-to-cross-fallon-county/ Pipeline proposed to cross Fallon County] April 12, 2103 by Lisa Kilsdonk Fallon County Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12-inch line was scheduled to begin operating after completion in January 2015.&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt; It would connect to the [[Pony Express Pipeline]] owned by [[Tallgrass Energy]] to connect with the crude oil hub of [[Cushing, Oklahoma]] and access lucrative oil markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/business/energy/new-m-pipeline-to-carry-bakken-crude-through-wyoming/article_5e7e99af-4785-5eb5-b952-f1382d53ab57.html|title= New $300M pipeline to carry Bakken crude through Wyoming|date=3 April 2013|author= Adam Voge|newspaper= Star-Tribune (Wyoming)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-budget.com/news/article_d204d2c6-a1f5-11e2-9252-0019bb2963f4.html|title= New oil line to be routed length of Converse County|date= April 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013|author= Dave Robatcek|publisher= Douglas Budget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox einsteinium}}
'''Einsteinium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with symbol '''Es''' and [[atomic number]] 99. A member of the [[actinide]] series, it is the seventh [[transuranic element]].

Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the [[Ivy Mike|first hydrogen bomb]] explosion in 1952, and named after [[Albert Einstein]]. Its most common [[isotope]] einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of [[californium]]-253 in a few dedicated high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element [[mendelevium]] in 1955.

Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]]. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]]; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 [[watt]]s per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to [[berkelium]]-249 and then [[californium]]-249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodic.lanl.gov/99.shtml Einsteinium]. periodic.lanl.gov&lt;/ref&gt; Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.&lt;ref name=h1579/&gt;

Like all synthetic [[transuranic element]]s, isotopes of einsteinium are very [[radioactivity|radioactive]] and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|left|Einsteinium was first observed in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
Einsteinium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first identified]] in December 1952 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] and co-workers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in collaboration with the [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] National Laboratories, in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and was the first successful test of a [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt; Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of [[plutonium]], {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}, which could only have formed by the absorption of six [[neutron]]s by a [[uranium-238]] nucleus followed by two [[beta decay]]s.
:&lt;chem&gt;^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+ 6(n,\gamma)}][-2\ \beta^-]{} ^{244}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;
At the time, the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}} indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium nuclei, thereby producing new elements heavier than [[californium]].&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Albert|last = Ghiorso|authorlink = Albert Ghiorso|date = 2003 |title = Einsteinium and Fermium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/einsteiniumfermium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36|doi = 10.1021/cen-v081n036.p174|pages = 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Ghiorso ca 1970.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The element was discovered by a team headed by [[Albert Ghiorso]].]]
Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}).&lt;ref name=s39&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S.&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt; The separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a [[citric acid]]/[[ammonium]] [[buffer solution]] in a weakly acidic medium ([[pH]] ≈ 3.5), using [[ion exchange]] at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end.&lt;ref name=em&gt;John Emsley [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA133 Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements], Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-19-850340-7}} pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy [[alpha decay]] at 6.6&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;ref name = "Ghiorso"/&gt; It was produced by the [[neutron capture|capture]] of 15 [[neutron]]s by [[uranium-238]] nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a [[half-life]] of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the [[mass number]] without changing the [[atomic number]] of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number:&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+15n}][6 \beta^-] ^{253}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{253}_{99}Es
&lt;/chem&gt;

Some &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atoms, however, could absorb two additional neutrons (for a total of 17), resulting in &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es, as well as in the &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Fm isotope of another new element, [[fermium]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es, &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Fm and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Fm would not be produced because of lack of beta decay in &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the new elements and the associated new data on multiple neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military until 1955 due to [[Cold War]] tensions and competition with Soviet Union in nuclear technologies.&lt;ref name="Ghiorso"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ES_FM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Ghiorso|first1 = A.|last2 = Thompson|first2 = S.|last3 = Higgins|first3 = G.|last4 = Seaborg|first4 = G.|last5 = Studier|first5 = M.|last6 = Fields|first6 = P.|last7 = Fried|first7 = S.|last8 = Diamond|first8 = H.|last9 = Mech|first9 = J.|first10 = G. |last10 = Pyle

Meanwhile, isotopes of element 99 (as well as of new element 100, [[fermium]]) were produced in the Berkeley and Argonne laboratories, in a [[nuclear fusion|nuclear reaction]] between [[nitrogen]]-14 and uranium-238,&lt;ref name = "PhysRev.93.257"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Physical Review| volume = 93|issue = 1| date = 1954|title = Reactions of U-238 with Cyclotron-Produced Nitrogen Ions| author = Ghiorso, Albert| author2 = Rossi, G.

[[File:Einstein1921 by F Schmutzer 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The element was named after [[Albert Einstein]].]]
In their discovery of the elements 99 and 100, the American teams had competed with a group at the [[Nobel Institute for Physics]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. In late 1953 – early 1954, the Swedish group succeeded in the synthesis of light isotopes of element 100, in particular &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, by bombarding uranium with oxygen nuclei. These results were also published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atterling|first1=Hugo|last2=Forsling|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Holm|first3=Lennart|last4=Melander|first4=Lars|last5=Åström|first5=Björn|title=Element 100 Produced by Means of Cyclotron-Accelerated Oxygen Ions|journal=Physical Review|volume=95|pages=585–586|date=1954|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.585.2|issue=2|bibcode = 1954PhRv...95..585A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, as its publications preceded the Swedish article, and they were based on the previously undisclosed results of the 1952 thermonuclear explosion; thus the Berkeley team was given the privilege to name the new elements.  As the effort which had led to the design of ''Ivy Mike'' was codenamed Project PANDA,&lt;ref name="underthecloud"&gt;{{cite book |title=Under the cloud: the decades of nuclear testing |author=Richard Lee Miller |page=115 |isbn=1-881043-05-3 |publisher=Two-Sixty Press |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; element 99 had been jokingly nicknamed "Pandamonium"&lt;!-- sic: /not/ pandemonium --&gt;&lt;ref name="mcphee"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curve of Binding Energy |author=John McPhee |author-link=John McPhee |page=116 |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Inc. |isbn=0-374-51598-0 |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the official names suggested by the Berkeley group derived from two prominent scientists, [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]: "We suggest for the name for the element with the atomic number 99, einsteinium (symbol E) after Albert Einstein and for the name for the element with atomic number 100, fermium (symbol Fm), after Enrico Fermi."&lt;ref name = "ES_FM "/&gt; Both Einstein and Fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
[[File:EinsteiniumGlow.JPG|thumb|upright|Glow due to the intense radiation from ~300 µg of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1580&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive metal. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[californium]], to the left of the actinide [[fermium]] and below the lanthanide [[holmium]] with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is lower than that of californium (15.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860&amp;nbsp;°C) is also relatively low – below [[californium]] (900&amp;nbsp;°C), [[fermium]] (1527&amp;nbsp;°C) and holmium (1461&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C. R. "The elements" in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAIRE_1990"&gt;Haire, R. G. (1990) "Properties of the Transplutonium Metals (Am-Fm)", in: Metals Handbook, Vol.&amp;nbsp;2, 10th edition, (ASM International, Materials Park, Ohio), pp.&amp;nbsp;1198–1201.&lt;/ref&gt; Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the [[bulk modulus]] of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-[[alkali metal]]s.&lt;ref name=h1591&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1591&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the lighter actinides [[californium]], [[berkelium]], [[curium]] and [[americium]] which crystallize in a double [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium is believed to have a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry with the space group ''Fm''{{overline|3}}''m'' and the lattice constant ''a'' = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with ''a'' = 398 pm and ''c'' = 650 pm, which converted to the ''fcc'' phase upon heating to 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=ev/&gt;

The self-damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice,&lt;ref name=g1268/&gt; and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es, induces a visible glow.&lt;ref name=h1579&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1579&lt;/ref&gt; These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium.&lt;ref Name="ES_METALL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R.

Apart from the self-destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds, other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity – the most common &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub-milligram amounts – and self-contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about 3.3% per day:&lt;ref name="ES_F3"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="ES2O3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=s55&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus, most einsteinium samples are contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.&lt;ref name=s76&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
Like all actinides, einsteinium is rather reactive. Its trivalent [[oxidation state]] is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induces a pale pink color.&lt;ref name="HOWI_1956"&gt;[[#Holleman|Holleman]], p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in the solid phase; such +2 state is not observed in many other actinides, including [[protactinium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]], plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with [[samarium(II) chloride]].&lt;ref name=s53&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.&lt;ref name=h1578&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1578&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of einsteinium}}
Nineteen [[nuclide]]s and three [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for einsteinium with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258. All are radioactive and the most stable nuclide, &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=I.|title=Half-life of the longest-lived einsteinium isotope-252Es|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=39|pages=1509–1511|date=1977|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(77)80089-4|issue=9|last2=Wagner|first2=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next most stable isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es (half-life 275.7 days),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McHarris|first1=William|last2=Stephens|first2=F.|last3=Asaro|first3=F.|last4=Perlman|first4=I.|title=Decay Scheme of Einsteinium-254|journal=Physical Review|volume=144|pages=1031–1045|date=1966|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.144.1031|issue=3|bibcode = 1966PhRv..144.1031M }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es (39.8 days) and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es (20.47 days). All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, and most of them decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is &lt;sup&gt;254''m''&lt;/sup&gt;Es with half-life of 39.3 hours.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi |first1=G. |doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |date=1997 |pages=1–124 |volume=624 |journal=Nuclear Physics A |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fission===
Einsteinium has a high rate of [[nuclear fission]] that results in a low [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30-centimeter-thick steel [[neutron reflector]], or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20-cm-thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope.&lt;ref name="irsn"&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire, [https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20131018_trm_evaluation.pdf "Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety data and limits for actinides in transport"], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural occurrence===
Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of einsteinium, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] einsteinium — that is,  einsteinium that could possibly have been present on the Earth during its formation —  has long since decayed. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally-occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], and is present only within a few years from the time of the synthesis.&lt;ref name=em/&gt; The [[transuranic element]]s from [[americium]] to [[fermium]], including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] at [[Oklo]], but no longer do so.&lt;ref name="emsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einsteinium was observed in [[Przybylski's Star]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103%2FS0884591308020049 | doi=10.3103/S0884591308020049 | volume=24 | title=Identification of absorption lines of short half-life actinides in the spectrum of Przybylski’s star (HD 101065) | journal=Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies | pages=89–98| bibcode=2008KPCB...24...89G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EsProduction.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Early evolution of einsteinium production in the U.S.&lt;ref name=s51&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Einsteinium is produced in minute quantities by bombarding lighter actinides with neutrons in dedicated high-flux [[nuclear reactor]]s. The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in Tennessee, U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = High Flux Isotope Reactor|url = http://neutrons.ornl.gov/facilities/HFIR/|publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate = 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SM-2 loop reactor at the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] (NIIAR) in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Радионуклидные источники и препараты|url = http://www.niiar.ru/?q=radioisotope_application|publisher = Research Institute of Atomic Reactors|accessdate = 2010-09-26|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium (''Z''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 96) elements. These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements,&lt;ref name=h1582&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1582&lt;/ref&gt; although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not widely reported. In a "typical processing campaign" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of [[curium]] are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of [[californium]], milligram quantities of berkelium (&lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk) and einsteinium and picogram quantities of [[fermium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = C.

The first microscopic sample of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es sample weighing about 10 [[nanogram]]s was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance was designed to estimate its weight.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Darleane C.; Ghiorso, Albert and Seaborg, Glenn Theodore (2000) ''The Transuranium People: The Inside Story'', Imperial College Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;190–191, {{ISBN|978-1-86094-087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978.&lt;ref name=s36&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; These quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold.&lt;ref name=h1582/&gt;

===Laboratory synthesis===
Heavy neutron irradiation of plutonium results in four major isotopes of einsteinium: &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es (α-emitter with half-life of 20.03 days and with a spontaneous fission half-life of 7×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years); &lt;sup&gt;254''m''&lt;/sup&gt;Es (β-emitter with half-life of 38.5 hours), &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es (α-emitter with half-life of about 276 days) and &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es (β-emitter with half-life of 24 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=M.|last2=Schuman|first2=R.|last3=Butler|first3=J.|last4=Cowper|first4=G.|last5=Eastwood|first5=T.|last6=Jackson|first6=H.|title=Isotopes of Einsteinium and Fermium Produced by Neutron Irradiation of Plutonium|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|pages=203–207|date=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.203|bibcode = 1956PhRv..102..203J }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative route involves bombardment of uranium-238 with high-intensity nitrogen or oxygen ion beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guseva|first1=L.|last2=Filippova|first2=K.|last3=Gerlit|first3=Y.|last4=Druin|first4=V.|last5=Myasoedov|first5=B.|last6=Tarantin|first6=N.|title=Experiments on the production of einsteinium and fermium with a cyclotron|journal=Journal of Nuclear Energy (1954)|volume=3|pages=341–346|date=1956|doi=10.1016/0891-3919(56)90064-X|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis in nuclear explosions===
[[File:ActinideExplosionSynthesis.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Estimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt;]]
The analysis of the debris at the 10-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test was a part of long-term project. One of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the [[neutron flux]], and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within a microsecond, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.&lt;ref name=s39/&gt;

The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and [[thorium]] have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.&lt;ref name=s39/&gt;&lt;ref name=s40&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the nine underground tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969,&lt;ref&gt;These were codenamed: "Anacostia" (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), "Kennebec" (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), "Par" (38 kilotons, 1964), "Barbel" (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), "Tweed" (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), "Cyclamen" (13 kilotons, 1966), "Kankakee" (20-200 kilotons, 1966), "Vulcan" (25 kilotons, 1966) and "Hutch" (20-200 kilotons, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000000/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt; However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1{{e|-7}} of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&amp;nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.&lt;ref name=s43&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.&lt;ref name=s44&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.&lt;!-- About 6{{e|9}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. These were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, and in discovery of a new fermium isotope. &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Fm. Also, the rare &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which would have been otherwise very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm – the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very "long" on the timescale of an explosion.--&gt;&lt;ref name=s47&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation===
[[File:Elutionskurven Fm Es Cf Bk Cm Am.png|thumb|[[Elution]] curves: chromatographic separation of Fm(100), Es(99), Cf, Bk, Cm and Am]]
Separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low.&lt;ref name=h1583&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1583&lt;/ref&gt; The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.&lt;ref name=h1584&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], pp. 1584–1585&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) as [[eluant]]. It is usually followed by [[anion-exchange chromatography]] using 6 [[molar concentration|molar]] HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&amp;pg=PA11|pages=9–11|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=0-521-45224-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of the 3+ actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.&lt;ref name=book2/&gt;

===Preparation of the metal===
Einsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds.&lt;ref name=h1588&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1588&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic [[lithium]]:
:EsF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Li → Es + 3 LiF

However, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has high vapor pressure, which is higher than that of lithium fluoride. This makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient. It was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium(III) oxide with [[lanthanum]] metal:&lt;ref name=ev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R.|title=Preparation, properties, and some recent studies of the actinide metals|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=5235830|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90554-0|date=1986|pages=379–398|volume=121|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES_METALL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=h1590&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1590&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organoeinsteinium compounds===
The high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in [[radiation therapy]], and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium [[citrate]] (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs.&lt;ref name=h1579/&gt; Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone [[Chelation|chelate]] complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited [[luminescence]] among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nugent|first1=Leonard J.|last2=Burnett|first2=J. L.|last3=Baybarz|first3=R.

Luminescence of Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid. It shows a broad peak at about 1064 nanometers (half-width about 100&amp;nbsp;nm) which can be resonantly excited by green light (ca. 495&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength). The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%. The relatively high, compared to lanthanides, non-radiative decay rates in Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; were associated with the stronger interaction of f-electrons with the inner Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beitz|first1=J.|last2=Wester|first2=D.|last3=Williams|first3=C.|title=5f state interaction with inner coordination sphere ligands: Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion fluorescence in aqueous and organic phases|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=93|pages=331–338|date=1983|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(83)90178-9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare isotope [[einsteinium-254]] is favored for production of [[superheavy element|ultraheavy elements]] because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schadel|first1=M.|last2=Bruchle|first2=W.|last3=Brugger|first3=M.|last4=Gaggeler |first4=H.|last5=Moody|first5=K.|last6=Schardt|first6=D.|last7=Summerer|first7=K.|last8=Hulet|first8=E.|last9=Dougan|first9=A.|first10=R. |last10=Dougan|first11=J. |last11=Landrum|first12=R. |last12=Lougheed|first13=J. |last13=Wild|first14=G. |last14=O'Kelley|first15=R. |last15=Hahn

Einsteinium-254 was used as the calibration marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer ("[[Surveyor 5#Alpha-scattering surface analyzer|alpha-scattering surface analyzer]]") of the [[Surveyor 5]] lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between signals from the marker and the studied lighter elements of the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.158.3801.635|title=Chemical Analysis of the Moon at the Surveyor V Landing Site|date=1967|last1=Turkevich|first1=A.

==Safety==
Most of the available einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and is similar to that of plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=International Commission on Radiological Protection|title=Limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, Part 4|issue=4|volume=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTxcCV4w0VEC&amp;pg=PA18|isbn=0-08-036886-7|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|date=1988|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric vehicles are those using electric motors as their main drive unit, with rechargeable batteries onboard and charged by external source. The benefits of using EVs include low noise pollution, guarantee of energy security, zero roadside emission and high energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="CLP"&gt;CLP. (2012). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=127018&amp;con_type=3 CLP Extends Free Vehicle Charging through 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; There are mainly three kinds of EVs in the market: pure electric, petrol/diesel hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric. The Hong Kong government recognizes all three kinds of EVs to be environmentally friendly and eligible for concessions. As at end of October 2017, there are 11,039 EVs in Hong Kong, up from less than 100 in 2010. At present, 73 EV models from 8 countries have been approved by the Transport Department. These include 51 models for private cars and motorcycles, 22 models for public transport and commercial vehicles.

==Current Hong Kong’s Electric Vehicle Policy==
In March 1994, the government has waived the First Registration Tax for EVs. It has been extended several times, and the latest one lasts until end of March 2017. However, EVs are yet to be popular in Hong Kong. Since 2009-10 Policy Address, a series of schemes and policies have been implemented by the government to actively promote and encourage the use of EVs. In order to coordinate the work in promoting EVs, the Steering Committee on the Promotion of Electric Vehicles was set up in April 2012. The committee is chaired by the Financial Secretary with 2-year terms, along with 16 other members from professionals or government departments.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;Legislative Council. (2012). [http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr11-12/english/panels/tp/papers/tp0206cb1-961-4-e.pdf Information note on the use of electric vehicles].&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate objective of the Government is to have zero emission buses running across the territory. The HK Government allocated $180 million to purchase 36 single-deck electric buses, which includes 28 battery-electric buses and 8 supercapacitor buses. 18 battery-electric buses and 2 supercapacitor buses have commenced operation. Most of the remaining electric buses are expected to be put into service progressively in later 2017 or early 2018.&lt;ref name="promo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Promotion of Electric Vehicles in Hong Kong|url=http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/air/prob_solutions/promotion_ev.html|website=EPD, Government of HK|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the Promotion of Electric Vehicles==

=== 1.1 Environmental Aspect ===

The 2014 Hong Kong Emission Inventory Report indicates that the road transport sector is the largest local air pollution source, especially 60% of carbon monoxide emission comes from transportation.&lt;ref name="promo"/&gt; Through replacing burning gasoline with using electricity among the EVs, the roadside air quality is improved after reducing carbon emissions from exhausted gases. Besides minimising various pollution problems and lowering the risk of respiratory illnesses, noises and vibrations are also eliminated when no chemical combustion is involved as in the traditional engines.&lt;ref&gt;Rinkesh.

Retrieved November 6, 2016, from Energy Articles, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.conserve-energy-&lt;/nowiki&gt; future.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-electric-cars.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;用家讚 Tesla 反應快夠寧靜. Retrieved November 6, 2016, from http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20150529/19164677&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption of annual mileage as 20,000&amp;nbsp;km and consideration over the emissions from generations, the estimated carbon dioxide emitted is around 1,880&amp;nbsp;kg, 33% and 47% less than that of the hybrid cars and the petrol vehicles respectively.&lt;ref name="developing"&gt;Chan, Edmond, CLP Hong Kong. [http://www.aesnet.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/EdmondChan_CLP.pdf 發展電動車充電設施及推動電動車普及化 Developing EV Charging Infrastructure &amp; Facilitate Wider Adoption of EV in HK]. n.p., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ultimate objective of the Government is to have zero emission buses running across the territory. To this end, the Government allocated $180 million for franchised bus companies to purchase 36 single-deck electric buses, include 28 battery-electric buses and 8 supercapacitor buses, for trial runs to assess their operational efficiency and performance under the local conditions. 18 battery-electric buses and 2 supercapacitor buses have commenced operation. Most of the remaining electric buses are expected to be put into service progressively in later 2017 or early next year.

=== 1.2 Economic Aspect ===

EVs have a higher energy efficiency than traditional petrol vehicles, allowing an 80% conversion of input energy into usable power, as a 15%-20% improvement than the latter. With technological advancements, EVs have higher battery capacity that allows 100&amp;nbsp;km travelling distance after a single charge, far higher than the original 40&amp;nbsp;km at the early development. By comparing EVs with petrol vehicles over the energy cost, the price of the latter is around 13.6 times higher in the case from Tuen Mun to Mong Kok (30&amp;nbsp;km; HKD4.7:HKD36.7).&lt;ref&gt;Walden, V.

==Current Figures of Electric Vehicles==
Compared to 28 local EVs in 2009, 5,042 registered EVs with 4,899 as private vehicles are recorded for road use as at April 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="LCQ18"&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201606/22/P201606220411.htm LCQ18: Charging Facilities for Electric Vehicles].

Over 1,300 public chargers are spread throughout all 18 local districts, whereas 1 public charger is available for usage by 4 EVs on average. Among them, 921 are standard chargers, 239 are medium chargers, 15 are CHAdeMO quick chargers and 145 are quick chargers with transferrable charging standards (top up the batteries of EVs within 30 minutes when compared to 8 hours previously). The Government and other stakeholders are determined in enhancing the charging efficiency of these public charging infrastructures through various ongoing infrastructure-led collaborations. For example, Charge Hong Kong, a non-profit organization, is working to increase charging facilities in public areas and upgrade the existing public standard chargers to the medium or multi-standard quick type.&lt;ref name="LCQ18"/&gt;

Under Pilot Green Transport Fund, 92 EVs are included for trial under a total subsidy of around $96 million in total.&lt;ref name="discuss"&gt;[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr14-15/english/panels/ea/papers/ea20150721cb1-1113-1-e.pdf For discussion on 21 July 2015 Legislative Council Panel On Environmental Affairs progress report on the pilot green transport fund].

Retrieved November 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The 2 models of electric vans as interim trial reflected that 50% to 80% of the fuel costs are saved with no negative and uncertain outcomes in terms of their batteries and performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkgsa.org/index.php/download_file/view/73/81/] Accessed October 31, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; These reflected that EVs are compatible with local operating conditions with huge green innovative development potentials in the future.&lt;ref name="discuss"/&gt;

== Promotion ==
The government is committed to promoting the use of EVs within different sectors in the society. Hence, a number of favourable measures are adopted to boost the use of EVs.

=== Economic Incentives ===
Giving economic incentives is regarded as a favourable policy that encourages the use of EVs as it lowers the costs. Exemption of the first registration tax on EVs was first introduced in 1997 to promote the use of greener vehicles.&lt;ref name="Analysing"&gt;Kwan, W. S. (2011). Analysing the potential of electric vehicles in improving the air quality of Hong Kong. HKU Theses Online (HKUTO).&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Secretary extended the waiver of the first registration tax on purchasing EVs in 2009 Budget until the end of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, C. W. J. (25 February 2009). The 2009-10 Budget. Budget Speech. Hong Kong Financial Secretary’s Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, enterprises purchasing EVs will enjoy another tax deduction, which is a full “profits tax reduction for the capital expenditure on the EVs in the first year of procurement”.&lt;ref name="promo"/&gt;

=== Financial Support ===
To encourage the public transport sector to use EVs, the government offers the industry some financial assistance programs, for example, “Pilot Green Transport Fund”&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to the above section Development Progress of Electric Vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;(See the above section). Such a fund targets public transport service providers and attracts them to use innovative and green technologies for trial.&lt;ref name="promo"/&gt; Furthermore, other financial assistances are put in place like the one-off grant to PLB owners and the allocation of $180 million HKD for franchised bus runners to purchase electric buses. The former aims to upgrade PLB emission standard to that of EV&lt;ref name="Analysing"/&gt; while the latter serves to test the use of EVs and promote the use of EVs among the community.&lt;ref name="promo"/&gt;

=== Infrastructure and Technical Support ===
With regard to the insufficient charging facilities and immature charging technologies, not only does the government devote to increasing the number of charging sockets while some of them are free,&lt;ref name="CLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="developing"/&gt; but also to collaborate with EV manufacturing firms for the advancement of charging facilities.&lt;ref name="info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promo"/&gt; Apart from infrastructure support, the government also issues a set of guidelines on the safe use of EV chargers and provides hotline service for information and technical support.&lt;ref name="techguide"&gt;Electrical and Mechanical Services Department. (2015). [http://www.emsd.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_444/Charging_Facilities_Electric_Vehicles Technical Guidelines on Charging Facilities for Electric Vehicles].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotional Activity ===
The government takes the lead to use EVs by giving priority to replace government vehicles with EVs. It is estimated that over 200 government vehicles are EVs.&lt;ref&gt;Press Releases. (27 November 2013). [http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201311/27/P201311270370.htm LCQ 14: Electric Vehicles].&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the government take the lead to use EVs, it also helps organize an event that arouses the public interest to use EVs, namely the “FIA Formula E Championship”.&lt;ref&gt;News Government. (9 October 2016). [http://www.news.gov.hk/en/record/html/2016/10/20161009_175602.shtml HK ePrix showcases Asia’s world city].&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that the government is determined to provide comprehensive support, ranging from introducing preferential policies to holding promotional activity, in an effort to promote the use of EV in Hong Kong.

== Criticism ==

=== Chargers ===
As at April 2016, there are 1320 public chargers in Hong Kong, distributed unequally in different territories, for example, there are nearly 500 public chargers in Hong Kong Island, whereas only less than 400 are located in New Territories and Island Districts, which cover the most area of Hong Kong (see Diagram 1 below). Therefore, the insufficiency of chargers in rural areas is a great concern to some EV drivers.&lt;ref name="analysis265"&gt;Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre. (October 20, 2014). [http://www.bauhinia.org/index.php/zh-HK/analyses/265 電動車普及的障礙].

Another criticism is the formidability for individuals to install chargers in private car parks. The installation of chargers in private buildings has to undergo an array of procedures. According to the guidelines from the government,&lt;ref name="techguide"/&gt; individual owners of EVs have to consult the owner of the car park space, the dealer of the EV, the property management company and the registered electrical contractor.&lt;ref&gt;裝電動車充電設施 邱騰華籲法團配合 - 香港文匯報 (2011, November 24).

=== Batteries ===
The battery in an EV has to be replaced every three to four years, and the price could amount to 1/3 of the EV itself. Report says that this might place a high recurrent expenditure on EV drivers.&lt;ref name="analysis265"/&gt; It is also uncertain on how would the abandoned batteries be processed.

=== Indirect Increase in Carbon Dioxide Emission ===
Using EV is not necessarily reducing carbon dioxide emission. It depends on the carbon intensity of electricity generation.&lt;ref name="teslas"&gt;Guo, A. (2016, April 14).

== Lessons Learnt from Overseas EV Policies ==

=== Singapore ===
The emphasis of Singaporean government’s EVs policy is placed on the cooperation with vehicle manufacturers and technology companies. By launching EV test-bed and forming agreement with Chinese companies to introduce EV into their public transportation, the determination of the government to utilize EVs as environmental policy to combat air pollution is clearly shown. However, surprisingly, as opposed to Hong Kong, the most popular EV model in Singapore is not Tesla. One may suggest the biggest obstacles come from the international oil company, which considers Singapore as the hub of oil refinement and trading center, hence acting as the tripping stone for the government to continuously promote the use of EVs.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Eddie. (17 May 2016) 全球電動車未來 還看今天香港. Mingpao. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20160517/s00004/1463421218056&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Plug-in electric vehicles in the United Kingdom}}
The British government took initiative and launched “green car revolution” programme introducing EVs into the market. This program included a range of incentives, government support, legislation and education programs, together suggesting by 2020 all new cars sold in the UK should be either hybrid or EVs. Apart from large scale subsidy and tax reduction to enhance incentive in purchasing EVs, the government has launched “Plugged-in-Places” scheme to increase vehicle recharging points and convenience, as well as 100% discount for London Congestion Charge. A comprehensive policy planning encouraged people to switch to EVs, resulting in over 20-folds increase of EVs registration in UK from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, K. (2013) Policy drivers for electrifying public transport vehicles in Hong Kong : stakeholder responses. HKU Thesis Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Development ==
In response to progress in promoting EVs, Hong Kong Productivity Council listed out 13 suggested measures for the government to increase its utility rate.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong Productivity Council. Accessed on 1 Nov 2016. “13 項建議 促進電動車普 及 發 展 ” Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.hkpc.org/zh-HK/industry-support-services/latest-&lt;/nowiki&gt; information/5800-electric-vehicle-study&lt;/ref&gt; The first step the government shall take is to lay out a comprehensive EVs development plan, together with stages and its corresponding goals. The government is also advised to explore possibilities in promoting EVs by improving their chargers, for instance replace the speed of the EVs charger from normal standard to medium/high standard, introduce a central information bank containing all EVs charging station in Hong Kong, as well as adopt commercial mode of running EVs charging station by increasing its coverage in private housing estate and commercial building. Apart from hardware development, the government is urged to devote resources in cultivating technicians and engineers specialized in EVs to prepare for the upcoming demand in human resources. The Environmental Bureau is now organising a competition to invite public to brainstorm some innovative idea of alternative use of disposed EV battery,&lt;ref&gt;HKSAR Environmental Bureau. Assessed on 3 Dec 2016. “International Competition on Second Life for Retired Batteries from Electric Vehicles” &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/misc/2ndEVbattery/en/competition.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on one hand engaging the public in policy formation so as supporting the EV battery recycling industry. As evidenced by the world trend, it is believed EV will continue to be in Hong Kong government’s agenda to combat air pollution.

The '''Energy Policy and Conservation Act''' of 1975 ('''EPCA''') ({{USStatute|94|163|89|871|1975|12|22}}) is a [[United States]] [[Act of Congress]] that responded to the [[1973 oil crisis]] by creating a comprehensive approach to federal energy policy. The primary goals of EPCA are to increase energy production and supply, reduce energy demand, provide energy efficiency, and give the executive branch additional powers to respond to disruptions in energy supply.&lt;ref name=wmlr&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (P.L. 94-163, 42 U.S.C. 6201)|journal=William &amp; Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review|date=1976|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1488&amp;context=wmelpr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably, EPCA established the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], the [[Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products]], and [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] regulations.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
The need for a national oil storage reserve had been recognized for at least three decades. Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]] advocated the stockpiling of emergency crude oil in 1944. President [[Harry S Truman]]'s Minerals Policy Commission proposed a strategic oil supply in 1952. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] suggested an oil reserve after the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. The Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Control recommended a similar reserve in 1970.

But few events so dramatically underscored the need for a strategic oil reserve as the [[1973 oil crisis|1973-74 oil embargo]]. The cutoff of oil flowing into the United States from [[OPEC]] sent economic shockwaves throughout the nation. In the aftermath of the oil crises, the United States established the SPR.

== Strategic Petroleum Reserve ==
{{Main article|Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
The EPCA declared it to be U.S. policy to establish a reserve of petroleum, setting the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] (SPR) into motion, and extended the [[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]] of 1973 (EPAA). A number of existing storage sites were acquired in 1977.  Construction of the first surface facilities began in June 1977. On July 21, 1977, the first oil—approximately {{convert|412000|oilbbl|m3}} of Saudi Arabian light crude—was delivered to the SPR. Fill was suspended in FY 1995 to devote budget resources to refurbishing the SPR equipment and extending the life of the complex. The current SPR sites are expected to be usable until around 2025. Fill was resumed in 1999.

== Energy Efficiency ==

=== Corporate Average Fuel Economy ===
{{Main article|Corporate Average Fuel Economy}}
Part A of Title III of the EPCA established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for automobiles. The average fuel economy for model years, 1978, 1979, and 1980 were set at 18, 19, and 20 miles per gallon, respectively, and by 1985 the average economy was required to be 27.5 mpg Furthermore, automobiles were required to be labeled with their fuel economies, estimated fuel costs, and the range of fuel economy for comparable vehicles after the 1976 model year.&lt;ref name=wmlr /&gt; The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] was given the authority to regulate fuel economies for automobiles and light trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yacobucci|first=B.|title=Automobile and Light Truck Fuel Economy:  The CAFE Standards|year=2007|publisher=Congressional Research Service|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/82504.pdf|author2=Bamberger, R.|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products ===
{{Main article|Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products}}
Part B of Title III of the EPCA established the Energy Conservation Program, which gives the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] the "authority to develop, revise, and implement minimum energy conservation standards for appliances and equipment."&lt;ref name="stat authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory Authorities and Rules|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/statutory_authorities_and_rules.html|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As currently implemented, the Department of Energy currently enforces test procedures and minimum standards for more than 50 products covering residential, commercial and industrial, lighting, and plumbing applications.&lt;ref name=standards&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards and Test Procedures|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/standards_test_procedures.html|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crude oil export ban, 1977-2015==
The law has banned crude oil exports, with the U.S. [[Commerce Department]] able to grant exceptions for certain types of oil. In 1980, crude oil exports peaked at 104 million barrels, dropping to 43.8 million barrels in 2013. 
The exceptional export licenses were for oil from [[Cook Inlet]], oil flowing through the [[Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System]], oil exported to Canada, heavy oil from California, certain trades with Mexico, and some exceptions for re-exporting foreign oil.&lt;ref&gt;Meagan Clark.

In June 2015, the  Obama administration had permitted the export of sweet, light oil for the import of heavy, sour oil from Mexico.

On December 18, 2015 Congress lifted the 41 year old ban. Republicans favored lifting the ban and in return agreed to not block a $500m payment to the UN Green Climate Fund and tax breaks for solar and wind power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35136831 US spending bill lifts 40-year ban on crude oil exports] BBC.uk, 18 December 2015, retrieved 21 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other provisions ==
The EPCA contained several policies to encourage the production of domestic energy sources. It authorized a program to promote coal production that would guarantee qualifying underground coal mining operations up to $30 million per project. The qualifying requirements are tailored to promote more environmentally friendly development and smaller coal producers. Recipients of the loan guarantees are required to have a contract with a customer who is certified by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] to operate their plant in compliance with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. At least 80% of the total guarantee amount must finance low-sulfur coal development. Finally, large coal or oil companies are prohibited from receiving loan guarantees.&lt;ref name=wmlr /&gt;

Complementary to the increased coal production goals of the legislation, the EPCA also provided mechanisms to allow the government to ensure that natural gas and petroleum based fuels are available to consumers in times of fuel shortages or crises. The [[Federal Energy Administration]]'s authority to require power plants to burn coal instead of natural gas or petroleum based fuels was extended through 1977. This mechanism would reduce the use of these fuels for power generation and free them for use by other consumers. Furthermore, the President was given authority to order maximum domestic oil and gas production, and the President was directed to submit plans for energy conservation and energy rationing in case of a fuel shortage.&lt;ref name=wmlr /&gt;

[[File:Uranium enrichment proportions.svg|thumb|Proportions of uranium-238 (blue) and uranium-235 (red) found naturally versus enriched grades]]

'''Enriched uranium''' is a type of [[uranium]] in which the percent composition of [[uranium-235]] has been increased through the process of [[isotope separation]]. [[Natural uranium]] is 99.284% [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]] [[isotope]], with &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U only constituting about 0.711% of its mass. &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U is the only [[primordial nuclide|nuclide existing in nature]] (in any appreciable amount) that is [[fissile]] with [[thermal neutron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD Nuclear Energy Agency|title=Nuclear Energy Today|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2003|isbn=9789264103283|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvL7twdmK9sC&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enriched uranium is a critical component for both civil [[Nuclear power|nuclear power generation]] and military [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] attempts to monitor and control enriched uranium supplies and processes in its efforts to ensure nuclear power generation safety and curb [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]].

During the [[Manhattan Project]] enriched uranium was given the codename '''oralloy''', a shortened version of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] [[alloy]], after the location of the plants where the uranium was enriched. The term oralloy is still occasionally used to refer to enriched uranium. There are about 2,000 [[tonne]]s (t, Mg) of highly enriched uranium in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_06129701a_185.pdf | title=Safeguarding Nuclear Weapon-Usable Materials in Russia | author=Thomas B. Cochran ([[Natural Resources Defense Council]]) | publisher=Proceedings of international forum on illegal nuclear traffic | date=12 June 1997 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722184311/http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_06129701a_185.pdf | archivedate=22 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; produced mostly for [[nuclear power]], nuclear weapons, [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval propulsion]], and smaller quantities for [[research reactor]]s.

The &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U remaining after enrichment is known as [[depleted uranium]] (DU), and is considerably less [[radioactive]] than even natural uranium, though still very dense and extremely hazardous in granulated form – such granules are a natural by-product of the shearing action that makes it useful for [[Vehicle armor|armor]]-[[Staballoy|penetrating weapons]] and [[radiation shielding]]. At present, 95 percent of the world's stocks of depleted uranium remain in secure storage.

==Grades==
Uranium as it is taken directly from the Earth is not suitable as fuel for most nuclear reactors and requires additional processes to make it usable. Uranium is mined either underground or in an open pit depending on the depth at which it is found. After the uranium ore is mined, it must go through a milling process to extract the uranium from the ore. This is accomplished by a combination of chemical processes with the end product being concentrated uranium oxide, which is known as "[[yellowcake]]", contains roughly 60% uranium whereas the ore typically contains less than 1% uranium and as little as 0.1% uranium (Henderson 2000). After the milling process is complete, the uranium must next undergo a process of conversion, "to either uranium dioxide, which can be used as the fuel for those types of reactors that do not require enriched uranium, or into uranium hexafluoride, which can be enriched to produce fuel for the majority of types of reactors". Naturally-occurring uranium is made of a mixture of U-235 and U-238. The U-235 is fissile meaning it is easily split with neutrons while the remainder is U-238, but in nature, more than 99% of the extracted ore is U-238.  Most nuclear reactors require enriched uranium, which is uranium with higher concentrations of U-235 ranging between 3.5% and 4.5%. There are two commercial enrichment processes: gaseous diffusion and gas centrifugation. Both enrichment processes involve the use of uranium hexafluoride and produce enriched uranium oxide.

===Reprocessed uranium (RepU)===
{{Main|Reprocessed uranium}}

''Reprocessed uranium'' (RepU) is a product of [[nuclear fuel cycle]]s involving [[nuclear reprocessing]] of [[spent fuel]]. RepU recovered from [[light water reactor]] (LWR) spent fuel typically contains slightly more U-235 than [[natural uranium]], and therefore could be used to fuel reactors that customarily use natural uranium as fuel, such as [[CANDU reactor]]s. It also contains the undesirable isotope [[uranium-236]], which undergoes [[neutron capture]], wasting neutrons (and requiring higher U-235 enrichment) and creating [[neptunium-237]], which would be one of the more mobile and troublesome radionuclides in [[deep geological repository]] disposal of nuclear waste.

===Low enriched uranium (LEU)===
''Low enriched uranium'' (LEU) has a lower than 20% concentration of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U; for instance, in commercial [[light water reactor]]s (LWR), the most prevalent power reactors in the world, uranium is enriched to 3 to 5% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Fresh LEU used in [[research reactor]]s is usually enriched 12% to 19.75% U-235, the latter concentration being used to replace HEU fuels when converting to LEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~aglaser/2005aglaser_why20percent.pdf |title=About the Enrichment Limit for Research Reactor Conversion : Why 20%? |author=Alexander Glaser |publisher=Princeton University |date=6 November 2005 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highly enriched uranium (HEU)===
[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|A [[billet (bar stock)|billet]] of highly enriched uranium metal]]

''Highly enriched uranium'' (HEU) has a 20% or higher concentration of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. The fissile uranium in [[nuclear weapon]] primaries usually contains 85% or more of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U known as [[weapons-grade]], though theoretically for an [[nuclear weapon design|implosion design]], a minimum of 20% could be sufficient (called weapon(s)-usable) although it would require hundreds of kilograms of material and "would not be practical to design";&lt;ref name="DefWpnsUsable"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1998/3445606060721.pdf |title= Definition of Weapons-Usable Uranium-233 |last1= Forsberg |first1= C.

The very first uranium bomb, [[Little Boy]], dropped by the [[United States]] on [[Hiroshima]] in 1945, used 64 kilograms of 80% enriched uranium. Wrapping the weapon's fissile core in a [[neutron reflector]] (which is standard on all nuclear explosives) can dramatically reduce the [[critical mass]]. Because the core was surrounded by a good neutron reflector, at explosion it comprised almost 2.5 critical masses. Neutron reflectors, compressing the fissile core via implosion, fusion boosting, and "tamping", which slows the expansion of the fissioning core with inertia, allow [[nuclear weapon design]]s that use less than what would be one bare-sphere critical mass at normal density. The presence of too much of the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope inhibits the runaway [[nuclear chain reaction]] that is responsible for the weapon's power. The critical mass for 85% highly enriched uranium is about {{convert|50|kg}}, which at normal density would be a sphere about {{convert|17|cm}} in diameter.

Later US nuclear weapons usually use [[plutonium-239]] in the primary stage, but the jacket or tamper secondary stage, which is compressed by the primary nuclear explosion often uses HEU with enrichment between 40% and 80%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html#nfaq6.2 |title=Nuclear Weapons FAQ |publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] fuel [[lithium deuteride]]. For the secondary of a large nuclear weapon, the higher critical mass of less-enriched uranium can be an advantage as it allows the core at explosion time to contain a larger amount of fuel. The &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U is not [[fissile]] but still fissionable by [[fusion neutron]]s.

HEU is also used in [[fast neutron reactor]]s, whose cores require about 20% or more of fissile material, as well as in [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]], where it often contains at least 50% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, but typically does not exceed 90%. The Fermi-1 commercial fast reactor prototype used HEU with 26.5% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Significant quantities of HEU are used in the production of [[medical isotopes]], for example [[molybdenum-99]] for [[technetium-99m generator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769414426~db=all |title=Feasibility of Eliminating the Use of Highly Enriched Uranium in the Production of Medical Radioisotopes |author1=Frank N.

==Enrichment methods==
[[Isotope separation]] is difficult because two isotopes of the same element have very nearly identical chemical properties, and can only be separated gradually using small mass differences. (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U is only 1.26% lighter than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U.) This problem is compounded by the fact that uranium is rarely separated in its atomic form, but instead as a compound (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is only 0.852% lighter than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.)
A [[cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade]] of identical stages produces successively higher concentrations of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Each stage passes a slightly more concentrated product to the next stage and returns a slightly less concentrated residue to the previous stage.

There are currently two generic commercial methods employed internationally for enrichment: [[gaseous diffusion]] (referred to as ''first'' generation) and [[gas centrifuge]] (''second'' generation), which consumes only 2% to 2.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/#.UWrver-IRAs|title=Uranium Enrichment|work=world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as much energy as gaseous diffusion (at least a "factor of 20" more efficient).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00416663.pdf |quote=The throughput per centrifuge unit is very small compared to that of a diffusion unit so small, in fact, that it is not compensated by the higher enrichment per unit. To produce the same amount of reactor-grade fuel requires a considerably larger number (approximately 50,000 to 500,000] of centrifuge units than diffusion units. This disadvantage, however, is outweighed by '''the considerably lower (by a factor of 20) energy consumption per SWU''' for the gas centrifuge|title=Economic Perspective for Uranium Enrichment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some work is being done that would use [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear resonance]]; however there is no reliable evidence that any nuclear resonance processes have been scaled up to production.

===Diffusion techniques===

====Gaseous diffusion====
{{Main|Gaseous diffusion}}

Gaseous diffusion is a technology used to produce enriched uranium by forcing gaseous [[uranium hexafluoride]] (''hex'') through [[semi-permeable membrane]]s. This produces a slight separation between the molecules containing &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U. Throughout the [[Cold War]], gaseous diffusion played a major role as a uranium enrichment technique, and as of 2008 accounted for about 33% of enriched uranium production,&lt;ref name="Lodge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20080410/pdf/318j6y3ctrzwqf.pdf | title=Lodge Partners Mid-Cap Conference 11&amp;nbsp;April 2008 | publisher=Silex Ltd | date = 11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 was deemed an obsolete technology that is steadily being replaced by the later generations of technology as the diffusion plants reach their ends-of-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rod Adams |url=http://atomicinsights.com/2011/05/mcconnell-asks-doe-to-keep-using-60-year-old-enrichment-plant-to-save-jobs.html |title=McConnell asks DOE to keep using 60 year old enrichment plant to save jobs |publisher=Atomic Insights |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130128020737/http://atomicinsights.com/2011/05/mcconnell-asks-doe-to-keep-using-60-year-old-enrichment-plant-to-save-jobs.html |archivedate=28 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant|Paducah]] facility in the US ceased operating, it was the last commercial &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U gaseous diffusion plant in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF_Paducah_enrichment_plant_to_be_closed_2805132.html |title=Paducah enrichment plant to be closed. ''The 1950s facility is the last remaining gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment plant in the world.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermal diffusion====
Thermal diffusion utilizes the transfer of heat across a thin liquid or gas to accomplish isotope separation. The process exploits the fact that the lighter &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U gas molecules will diffuse toward a hot surface, and the heavier &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U gas molecules will diffuse toward a cold surface. The [[S-50 (Manhattan Project)|S-50]] plant at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was used during [[World War II]] to prepare feed material for the [[#Electromagnetic isotope separation|EMIS]] process. It was abandoned in favor of gaseous diffusion.

===Centrifuge techniques===

====Gas centrifuge====
{{Main|Gas centrifuge}}

[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|A cascade of gas centrifuges at a U.S. enrichment plant]]
The gas centrifuge process uses a large number of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong [[centripetal force]] so that the heavier gas molecules containing &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed ''second generation''. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005,&lt;ref name="Lodge" /&gt; which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce close to 100% of the world's enriched uranium.

====Zippe centrifuge====
[[File:Zippe-type gas centrifuge.svg|left|thumb|upright|Diagram of the principles of a Zippe-type gas centrifuge with U-238 represented in dark blue and U-235 represented in light blue]]

The [[Zippe centrifuge]] is an improvement on the standard gas centrifuge, the primary difference being the use of heat. The bottom of the rotating cylinder is heated, producing convection currents that move the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U up the cylinder, where it can be collected by scoops. This improved centrifuge design is used commercially by [[Urenco Group|Urenco]] to produce nuclear fuel and was used by [[Pakistan]] in their nuclear weapons program.

===Laser techniques===
Laser processes promise lower energy inputs, lower capital costs and lower tails assays, hence significant economic advantages. Several laser processes have been investigated or are under development. Separation of Isotopes by Laser Excitation ([[SILEX]]) is well advanced and licensed for commercial operation in 2012.

====Atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS)====
''[[AVLIS|Atomic vapor laser isotope separation]]'' employs specially tuned lasers&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]] and L.W. Hillman (Eds.), ''Dye Laser Principles'' (Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; to separate isotopes of uranium using selective ionization of [[hyperfine transitions]]. The technique uses [[laser]]s tuned to frequencies that ionize &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U atoms and no others. The positively charged &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U ions are then attracted to a negatively charged plate and collected.

====Molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS)====
''[[Molecular laser isotope separation]]'' uses an infrared laser directed at [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], exciting molecules that contain a &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U atom. A second laser frees a [[fluorine]] atom, leaving [[uranium pentafluoride]], which then precipitates out of the gas.

====Separation of Isotopes by Laser Excitation (SILEX)====
''[[SILEX|Separation of isotopes by laser excitation]]'' is an Australian development that also uses [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]. After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company [[USEC]] acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization rights to the technology, [[GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy]] (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with [[Silex Systems]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge-energy.com/about/press/en/2006_press/052206b.htm ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230840/http://www.ge-energy.com/about/press/en/2006_press/052206b.htm |date=23 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GEH has since built a demonstration test loop and announced plans to build an initial commercial facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Selects Wilmington, N.C. as Site for Potential Commercial Uranium Enrichment Facility|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/ge/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;ndmConfigId=1004554&amp;newsId=20080430006101&amp;newsLang=en&amp;vnsId=681|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=30 September 2012|date=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the process are classified and restricted by intergovernmental agreements between United States, Australia, and the commercial entities. SILEX has been projected to be an order of magnitude more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified.&lt;ref name="Lodge" /&gt; In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) for a permit to build a commercial plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Laser Advances in Nuclear Fuel Stir Terror Fear |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/science/earth/21laser.html |accessdate=21 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial SILEX enrichment plant, although the company had not yet decided whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/business/energy-environment/uranium-plant-using-laser-technology-wins-us-approval.html?ref=science |work=New York Times |title=Uranium Plant Using Laser Technology Wins U.S. Approval |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===

====Aerodynamic processes====
[[File:Aerodynamic enrichment nozzle.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of an aerodynamic nozzle. Many thousands of these small foils would be combined in an enrichment unit.]]
[[File:LIGA-Doppelumlenksystem.jpg|right|thumb| The X-ray based [[LIGA]] manufacturing process was originally developed at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany, to produce nozzles for isotope enrichment.&lt;ref name=Becker-1982&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Becker, E. W. | last2=Ehrfeld | first2=W. | last3=M&amp;uuml;nchmeyer | first3=D. | last4=Betz | first4=H. | last5=Heuberger | first5=A. | last6=Pongratz | first6=S. | last7=Glashauser | first7=W. | last8=Michel | first8=H. J. | last9=Siemens | first9=R. | title=Production of Separation-Nozzle Systems for Uranium Enrichment by a Combination of X-Ray Lithography and Galvanoplastics | journal=Naturwissenschaften | volume=69 | pages=520–523 | year=1982 | doi=10.1007/BF00463495 | issue=11 | bibcode=1982NW.....69..520B }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Aerodynamic enrichment processes include the Becker jet nozzle techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the [[LIGA]] process and the [[vortex tube]] separation process. These [[aerodynamic]] separation processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes can be considered as non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of [[Uranium hexafluoride|UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] with [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]] as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The [[NECSA|Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa]] (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant.&lt;ref name="The Pelsakon Cascade for Uranium Enrichment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|author2=Jackson A G M|title=Dr|journal=South African Institution of Chemical Engineers – Conference 2000|year=2000|pages=280–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstration plant was built in [[Brazil]] by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the separation nozzle process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.

====Electromagnetic isotope separation====
{{Main|Calutron}}
[[File:Electromagnetic separation.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of uranium isotope separation in a [[calutron]] shows how a strong magnetic field is used to redirect a stream of uranium ions to a target, resulting in a higher concentration of uranium-235 (represented here in dark blue) in the inner fringes of the stream.]]

In the [[electromagnetic isotope separation]] process (EMIS), metallic uranium is first vaporized, and then ionized to positively charged ions. The cations are then accelerated and subsequently deflected by magnetic fields onto their respective collection targets. A production-scale [[mass spectrometer]] named the [[Calutron]] was developed during World War II that provided some of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U used for the [[Little Boy]] nuclear bomb, which was dropped over [[Hiroshima]] in 1945. Properly the term 'Calutron' applies to a multistage device arranged in a large oval around a powerful electromagnet. Electromagnetic isotope separation has been largely abandoned in favour of more effective methods.

====Chemical methods====
One chemical process has been demonstrated to pilot plant stage but not used for production. The French CHEMEX process exploited a very slight difference in the two isotopes' propensity to change [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]] in [[redox|oxidation/reduction]], utilising immiscible aqueous and organic phases. An ion-exchange process was developed by the [[Asahi Chemical Company]] in [[Japan]] that applies similar chemistry but effects separation on a proprietary resin [[ion-exchange]] column.

====Plasma separation====
Plasma separation process (PSP) describes a technique that makes use of [[superconducting magnet]]s and [[plasma physics]]. In this process, the principle of [[ion cyclotron resonance]] is used to selectively energize the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] containing a mix of [[ion]]s. The French developed their own version of PSP, which they called RCI. Funding for RCI was drastically reduced in 1986, and the program was suspended around 1990, although RCI is still used for stable isotope separation.

==Separative work unit==
"Separative work" – the amount of separation done by an enrichment process – is a function of the concentrations of the feedstock, the enriched output, and the depleted tailings; and is expressed in units that are so calculated as to be proportional to the total input (energy / machine operation time) and to the mass processed. Separative work is ''not'' energy. The same amount of separative work will require different amounts of energy depending on the efficiency of the separation technology. Separative work is measured in ''Separative work units'' SWU, kg SW, or kg UTA (from the German ''Urantrennarbeit'' – literally ''uranium separation work'')
* 1 SWU = 1&amp;nbsp;kg SW = 1&amp;nbsp;kg UTA
* 1 kSWU = 1 tSW = 1 t UTA
* 1 MSWU = 1 ktSW = 1 kt UTA
{{further|Separative work units}}

==Cost issues==

In addition to the separative work units provided by an enrichment facility, the other important parameter to be considered is the mass of natural uranium (NU) that is needed to yield a desired mass of enriched uranium. As with the number of SWUs, the amount of feed material required will also depend on the level of enrichment desired and upon the amount of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U that ends up in the depleted uranium. However, unlike the number of SWUs required during enrichment, which increases with decreasing levels of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U in the depleted stream, the amount of NU needed will decrease with decreasing levels of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U that end up in the DU.

For example, in the enrichment of LEU for use in a light water reactor it is typical for the enriched stream to contain 3.6% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (as compared to 0.7% in NU) while the depleted stream contains 0.2% to 0.3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. In order to produce one kilogram of this LEU it would require approximately 8 kilograms of NU and 4.5 SWU if the DU stream was allowed to have 0.3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. On the other hand, if the depleted stream had only 0.2% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, then it would require just 6.7 kilograms of NU, but nearly 5.7 SWU of enrichment. Because the amount of NU required and the number of SWUs required during enrichment change in opposite directions, if NU is cheap and enrichment services are more expensive, then the operators will typically choose to allow more &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U to be left in the DU stream whereas if NU is more expensive and enrichment is less so, then they would choose the opposite.

==Downblending==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Radioactive waste]] --&gt;
The opposite of enriching is downblending; surplus HEU can be downblended to LEU to make it suitable for use in commercial nuclear fuel.

The HEU feedstock can contain unwanted uranium isotopes: [[Uranium-234|&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U]] is a minor isotope contained in [[natural uranium]]; during the enrichment process, its concentration increases but remains well below 1%. High concentrations of [[Uranium-236|&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U]] are a byproduct from irradiation in a reactor and may be contained in the HEU, depending on its manufacturing history. HEU reprocessed from nuclear weapons material production reactors (with an &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U assay of approx. 50%) may contain &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U concentrations as high as 25%, resulting in concentrations of approximately 1.5% in the blended LEU product. [[Uranium-236|&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U]] is a [[neutron poison]]; therefore the actual &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U concentration in the LEU product must be raised accordingly to compensate for the presence of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U.

The blendstock can be NU, or DU, however depending on feedstock quality, SEU at typically 1.5 wt% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U may used as a blendstock to dilute the unwanted byproducts that may be contained in the HEU feed. Concentrations of these isotopes in the LEU product in some cases could exceed [[ASTM]] specifications for nuclear fuel, if NU, or DU were used. So, the HEU downblending generally cannot contribute to the waste management problem posed by the existing large stockpiles of depleted uranium.

A major downblending undertaking called the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] converts ex-Soviet weapons-grade HEU to fuel for U.S. commercial power reactors. From 1995 through mid-2005, 250 tonnes of high-enriched uranium (enough for 10,000 warheads) was recycled into low-enriched-uranium. The goal is to recycle 500 tonnes by 2013. The decommissioning programme of Russian nuclear warheads accounted for about 13% of total world requirement for enriched uranium leading up to 2008.&lt;ref name="Lodge" /&gt;

The [[United States Enrichment Corporation]] has been involved in the disposition of a portion of the 174.3 tonnes of highly enriched uranium (HEU) that the U.S. government declared as surplus military material in 1996. Through the U.S. HEU Downblending Program, this HEU material, taken primarily from dismantled U.S. nuclear warheads, was recycled into low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, used by [[nuclear power plants]] to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usec.com/v2001_02/HTML/Megatons_DOEstatus.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010406102039/http://www.usec.com/v2001_02/HTML/Megatons_DOEstatus.asp |date=6 April 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">The article '''Ferromagnetic material properties''' is intended to contain a glossary of terms used to describe (mainly quantitatively) [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, and [[magnetic core]]s.

==Terms==
;[[Magnetic hysteresis|Hysteresis loop]]: Induction B as function of field strength H for H varying between H&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;; for ferromagnetic material the B has different values for H going up and down, therefore a plot of the function forms a loop instead of a curve joining two points; for perminvar type materials, the loop is a "rectangle" (''Domain Structure of Perminvar Having a Rectangular Hysteresis Loop'', Williams, Goertz, ''Journal of Applied Physics'' '''23''', 316 (1952); in fact it is rectangle if B-µ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;H is used instead B on the plot);
;[[Remanence]], B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;; "induction which remains": After magnetization to saturation, a value of induction B in the material in a closed magnetic circuit without external field H; the point where hysteresis loop crosses B axis;&lt;ref name="ramsden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsden|first1=Edward|title=Hall-effect sensors : theory and applications|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier/Newnes|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-7506-7934-3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}}
;[[Coercivity]], H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;: After magnetization to saturation, a value of field strength H at which induction B in the material becomes 0; the point where hysteresis loop crosses H axis;
;(Maximum) energy product, (BH)&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;: Largest possible field of a rectangle on the hysteresis loop plot, which has two edges on the B and H axes, and a vertex on the hysteresis loop in the second quadrant (B positive, H negative); range from below 1{{nbsp}}J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for some soft materials (permalloy, 3E4 ferrite), to above 400{{nbsp}}kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for hard ones ([[neodymium magnet]]s);
;Magnetic viscosity: When an external field H is changed, and then kept at a new value, the induction B first changes almost at once, then some smaller change of B follows in a time; for a permanent magnet typically the time dependence is B(t) = B(t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − S·ln(t/t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where t is time since H change, t{{sub|0}} is some reference time, and S is a constant of the process (but not of the material, as it varies with magnitude of the H and its change); a theory describing this kind of time dependency was developed by [[Louis Néel]] (''J. de Phys. et Radium'', '''11''', 49 (1950)) and by Street and Wooley (A Study of Magnetic Viscosity, ''Proc. Phys. Soc.'' '''A62'''. 562 (1949)).

==Formulae==
To describe a soft [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material for technical use, the following parameters are specified:

;(Relative) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]: Ratio of induction B in the material caused by some field H to an induction in a vacuum in the same field; it is a dimensionless value, as it is ''relative'' to a vacuum permeability;
:;Initial permeability, &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;: The ratio for small magnetization of initially demagnetized material: &lt;math&gt;\mu_i = \frac{B}{\mu_0 H}&lt;/math&gt; for very small H;
:;Incremental permeability, &lt;math&gt;\mu_\Delta&lt;/math&gt;: The ratio of change of induction in the material to a change of induction in a vacuum due to the same field change, when the change is superimposed to some constant field: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\Delta = \frac{\Delta B}{\mu_0 \Delta H}&lt;/math&gt;;
:;Amplitude permeability, &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt;: The ratio of induction in the material to an induction in a vacuum for larger magnetization: just &lt;math&gt;\mu_a = \frac{B}{\mu_0 H}&lt;/math&gt;;
:;Maximum incremental/amplitude permeability: The maximal value of the incremental/amplitude permeability on the hysteresis curve;
;[[Saturation (magnetic)|Saturation induction]]: Induction B for large (enough for &lt;math&gt;\mu_\Delta&lt;/math&gt; to become small), but reasonable H;
;[[Resistivity]], &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: Specific resistance, as for usual resistive materials, important because of eddy currents; SI units, ohm-metres (Ω·m);
;[[Mass density]]: Mass per unit volume, as for usual materials;
;Temperature factor of the permeability, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_F&lt;/math&gt;: Defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_F = \frac{\mu_\theta - \mu_\text{ref}}{\mu_\text{ref}^2 \left(\theta - \theta_\text{ref}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; by IEC133, and as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_F = \frac{\mu_\theta - \mu_\text{ref}}{\mu_\theta \mu_\text{ref} \left(\theta - \theta_\text{ref}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; by IEC367-1;
;[[Curie point]] (or Curie temperature): A temperature, above which the ferromagnetic material becomes a paramagnet; more in [[ferromagnetism]];
;[[Loss tangent|Tangent of loss angle]]: Ratio of a resistance (R) to a reactance (&lt;math&gt;2 \pi fL&lt;/math&gt;) of a coil on a core without a gap (&lt;math&gt;\mu_e = \mu_i&lt;/math&gt; - otherwise it must be scaled), assuming the resistance is result of losses in the magnetic material; the angle describes a delay between B in the material versus H; measured for sinusoidal magnetic field of frequency f; usually specified as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu_i}\tan(\delta) \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;
;Disaccomodation factor, &lt;math&gt;D_F&lt;/math&gt;: It is a measure of material permeability variation after demagnetization, given by a formula &lt;math&gt;D_F = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\mu_1^2 \log\left(\frac{t_2}{t_1}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_1, \mu_2&lt;/math&gt; are permeability values, and t{{sub|1}}, t{{sub|2}} are time from demagnetization; usually determined for t{{sub|1}} = 10{{nbsp}}min, t{{sub|2}} = 100{{nbsp}}min; range from 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 12×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for typical MnZn and NiZn ferrites;
;Hysteresis constant, &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt;
;DC sensitivity constant, &lt;math&gt;\beta_F&lt;/math&gt;

==Magnetic core parameters==
;Core constant, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: Sum of l/A along magnetic path; l is length of a part of the path, A is its cross-section. The summation of the [[magnetic path length]]s of each section of the magnetic circuit divided by the square of the corresponding magnetic area of the same section;
;Core constant, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Sum of l/A{{sup|2}} along magnetic path;
;Effective length of a magnetic path, l&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;;
;Effective cross-section, A&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;;
;Effective volume: &lt;math&gt;V_e = \frac{{C_1}^3}{{C_2}^2}&lt;/math&gt;;
;Effective permeability: &lt;math&gt;\mu_e = \frac{C_1}{\sum_i{\frac{l_i}{\mu_i A_i}}}&lt;/math&gt;{{paragraph}} For a magnetic circuit constructed with an air gap or air gaps, the permeability of a hypothetical homogeneous material which would provide the same reluctance; 

(these "effective" above are sizes of a toroid core made from the same material which has the same magnetic properties as the core);

;Minimum cross-section, A&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;;
;Inductance factor, A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;: Inductance of one-turn coil, in nH (note inductance L = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n is number of turns) Inductance of a coil on a specified core divided by the square of the number of turns. (Unless otherwise specified the inductance test conditions for inductance factor are at a flux density ~10 gauss);
;Turns factor, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;: Number of turns for 1{{nbsp}}mH (note &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 A_L = 1000000&lt;/math&gt;);

These parameters used e.g. in Philips' handbook &lt;ref&gt;Philips' handbook ''Components and materials'', Part 4a, Nov 1978, said in accordance with IEC401 and IEC125&lt;/ref&gt; and Magnetic Materials Producers Association "Soft Ferrites, A Users Guide".&lt;ref&gt;Magnetic Materials Producers Association "Soft Ferrites, A Users Guide", MMPA SFG-98, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the world's second favorite [[semiconductor]], [[GaAs]], and as such is readily compatible with existing [[semiconductor]] technologies. Differently from other [[Magnetic semiconductor|dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs)]], such as the majority of those based on [[II-VI semiconductors]], it is not [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]]&lt;ref name=furdyna_diluted_1988&gt;

but [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], and hence exhibits [[hysteretic]] magnetization behavior. This memory effect is of importance for the creation of persistent devices. In (Ga,Mn)As, the manganese atoms provide a magnetic moment, and each also acts as an [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptor]], making it a ''p''-type material. The presence of [[Charge carrier|carriers]] allows the material to be used for [[Spin polarization|spin-polarized]] currents. In contrast, many other [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMSs]] are strongly insulating&lt;ref name=ohno_magnetotransport_1992&gt;

and so do not possess [[Charge carrier|free carriers]]. (Ga,Mn)As is therefore a candidate as a [[spintronic]] material.

==Growth==

Like other [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMSs]], (Ga,Mn)As is formed by [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] a standard [[semiconductor]] with magnetic elements. This is done using the growth technique [[Molecular-beam epitaxy|molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)]], whereby crystal structures can be grown with atom layer precision. In (Ga,Mn)As the manganese substitute into gallium sites in the [[GaAs]] crystal and provide a magnetic moment. Because manganese has a low solubility in [[GaAs]], incorporating a sufficiently high concentration for [[ferromagnetism]] to be achieved proves challenging. In standard [[Molecular-beam epitaxy|MBE]] growth, to ensure that a good structural quality is obtained, the temperature the substrate is heated to, known as the growth temperature, is normally high, typically ~600&amp;nbsp;°C. However, if a large flux of manganese is used in these conditions, instead of being incorporated, segregation occurs where the manganese accumulate on the surface and form complexes with elemental arsenic atoms.&lt;ref name=desimone_manganese_1982&gt;

In addition to the substitutional incorporation of manganese, low-temperature [[Molecular-beam epitaxy|MBE]] also causes the inclusion of other impurities. The two other common impurities are interstitial manganese&lt;ref name=yu_effect_2002&gt;

The former is where the manganese atom sits between the other atoms in the zinc-blende lattice structure and the latter is where an arsenic atom occupies a gallium site. Both impurities act as double donors, removing the [[Electron hole|holes]] provided by the substitutional manganese, and as such they are known as compensating defects. The interstitial manganese also bond [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetically]] to substitutional manganese, removing the magnetic moment. Both these defects are detrimental to the [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of the (Ga,Mn)As, and so are undesired.&lt;ref name=sadowski_influence_2004&gt;

The temperature below which the transition from [[paramagnetism]] to [[ferromagnetism]] occurs is known as the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''. Theoretical predictions based on the Zener model suggest that the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]] scales with the quantity of manganese, so ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' above 300 K is possible if manganese [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] levels as high as 10% can be achieved.&lt;ref name=dietl_zener_2000&gt;

After its discovery by Ohno ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="ohno_(gamn)as_1996"/&gt; the highest reported [[Curie point|Curie temperatures]] in (Ga,Mn)As rose from 60 K to 110 K.&lt;ref name=ohno_making_1998 /&gt; However, despite the predictions of room-temperature [[ferromagnetism]], no improvements in ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' were made for several years.

As a result of this lack of progress, predictions started to be made that 110 K was in fact a fundamental limit for (Ga,Mn)As. The self-compensating nature of the defects would limit the possible [[Electron hole|hole]] concentrations, preventing further gains in ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=yu_curie_2003&gt;

The major breakthrough came from improvements in post-growth annealing. By using annealing temperatures comparable to the growth temperature it was possible to pass the 110 K barrier.&lt;ref name=edmonds_high-curie-temperature_2002&gt;

In addition to this, as [[Molecular-beam epitaxy|MBE]] techniques and equipment are refined and improved it is hoped that greater control over growth conditions will allow further incremental advances in the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]] of (Ga,Mn)As.

==Properties==

Regardless of the fact that room-temperature [[ferromagnetism]] has not yet been achieved, [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMS]] materials such as (Ga,Mn)As, have shown considerable success. Thanks to the rich interplay of physics inherent to [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMSs]] a variety of novel phenomena and device structures have been demonstrated. It is therefore instructive to make a critical review of these main developments.

A key result in [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMS]] technology is [[Field-effect transistor|gateable]] [[ferromagnetism]], where an electric field is used to control the [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties. This was achieved by Ohno ''et al.''&lt;ref name=ohno_electric-field_2000&gt;

using an insulating-gate [[field-effect transistor]] with (In,Mn)As as the magnetic channel. The magnetic properties were inferred from magnetization dependent [[Hall effect|Hall measurements]] of the channel. Using the [[Field-effect transistor|gate]] action to either deplete or accumulate [[Electron hole|holes]] in the channel it was possible to change the characteristic of the [[Hall effect|Hall]] response to be either that of a [[Paramagnetism|paramagnet]] or of a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]. When the temperature of the sample was close to its ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' it was possible to turn the [[ferromagnetism]] on or off by applying a [[Field-effect transistor|gate]] voltage which could change the ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ±1 K.

A similar (In,Mn)As transistor device was used to provide further examples of [[Field-effect transistor|gateable]] [[ferromagnetism]].&lt;ref name=chiba_electrical_2003&gt;

In this experiment the electric field was used to modify the coercive field at which magnetization reversal occurs. As a result of the dependence of the magnetic [[hysteresis]] on the [[Field-effect transistor|gate bias]] the electric field could be used to assist magnetization reversal or even demagnetize the [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material.
The combining of magnetic and electronic functionality demonstrated by this experiment is one of the goals of [[spintronics]] and may be expected to have a great technological impact.

Another important [[spintronic]] functionality that has been demonstrated in [[Magnetic semiconductor|DMSs]] is that of [[Spin (physics)|spin injection]]. This is where the high [[spin polarization]] inherent to these magnetic materials is used to transfer [[Spin polarization|spin polarized]] [[Charge carrier|carriers]] into a non-magnetic material.&lt;ref name=ohno_electrical_1999&gt;

In this example, a fully [[epitaxial]] [[heterostructure]] was used where [[Spin polarization|spin polarized]] [[Electron hole|holes]] were injected from a (Ga,Mn)As layer to an (In,Ga)As [[quantum well]] where they combine with unpolarized electrons from an ''n''-type substrate. A polarization of 8% was measured in the resulting [[electroluminescence]]. This is again of potential technological interest as it shows the possibility that the [[Spin (physics)|spin states]] in non-magnetic [[semiconductors]] can be manipulated without the application of a magnetic field.

(Ga,Mn)As offers an excellent material to study [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] mechanics because the domains can have a size of the order of 100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name=fukumura_magnetic_2001&gt;

This experiment consisted of a [[Nanolithography|lithographically]] defined narrow island connected to the leads via a pair of nanoconstrictions. While the device operated in a diffusive regime the constrictions would pin [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s, resulting in a [[giant magnetoresistance|giant magnetoresistance (GMR)]] signal. When the device operates in a tunnelling regime another [[magnetoresistance|magnetoresistance (MR)]] effect is observed, discussed below.

A furtherproperty of [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s is that of current induced [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] motion. This reversal is believed to occur as a result of the [[Spin torque transfer|spin-transfer torque]] exerted by a [[Spin polarization|spin polarized]] current.&lt;ref name=slonczewski_current-driven_1996&gt;

using a lateral (Ga,Mn)As device containing three regions which had been patterned to have different coercive fields, allowing the easy formation of a [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]. The central region was designed to have the lowest coercivity so that the application of current pulses could cause the orientation of the magnetization to be switched. This experiment showed that the current required to achieve this reversal in (Ga,Mn)As was two orders of magnitude lower than that of metal systems. It has also been demonstrated that current-induced magnetization reversal can occur across a (Ga,Mn)As/GaAs/(Ga,Mn)As vertical tunnel junction.&lt;ref name=chiba_current-driven_2004&gt;

Another novel [[spintronic]] effect, which was first observed in (Ga,Mn)As based tunnel devices, is tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). This effect arises from the intricate dependence of the tunnelling density of states on the magnetization, and can result in [[magnetoresistance|MRs]] of several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated first in vertical tunnelling structures&lt;ref name=ruster_very_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould_tunneling_2004&gt;

This has established TAMR as a generic property of ferromagmetic tunnel structures. Similarly, the dependence of the single electron charging energy on the magnetization has resulted in the obersvation of another dramatic [[magnetoresistance|MR]] effect in a (Ga,Mn)As device, the so-called [[Coulomb blockade]] anisotropic magnetoresistance (CBAMR).

The '''Groundhog Day gale''' was a severe winter storm that hit the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada on February 2 ([[Groundhog Day]]), 1976.

==Meteorologist synopsis==
An [[Cold-core low|upper-level low]] was stationary across the Desert Southwest of the United States, on January 28.&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service. [http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/1976/19760126-19760201.djvu Daily Weather Maps: January 26 February 1, 1976.]  Retrieved on 2006-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  A system in the northern branch of the Westerlies known as a Saskatchewan Screamer, similar to an [[Alberta clipper]] but originating as a frontal wave in the next Canadian province to the east, moved east-southeast across Canada beginning on January 30, luring the system in the United States eastward. The cyclones merged by February 2, becoming a significant storm over [[New England]] before lifting northward through [[Quebec]] into the [[Davis Strait]]. At this time, maximum sustained winds reached 164&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (102&amp;nbsp;mph) in coastal areas (equal to a Category&amp;nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]]), with wind gusts of up to 188&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (116&amp;nbsp;mph). By February 6, this extratropical cyclone was absorbed by another system in the northern Canadian [[archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service.

==Effects in the United States==

===Maine===
[[Caribou, Maine]], recorded one of its lowest pressures on record, with much of New England recording its lowest values for the month of February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/FebruaryWhenRecordLowSLPswhite.gif|title=Occurrence of February Record Low SLPs|author=David M.

Blizzard conditions were experienced for a few hours as the [[cyclone]] moved up into Canada. The storm caused extensive damage in many areas. Although many trees were blown down by the storm, many more were killed after large amounts of seawater were blown inland. Coastal flooding was seen from Brunswick to Eastport. A tidal surge went up the [[Penobscot River]], flooding [[Bangor, Maine]], for three hours around midday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher= Maine State Climate Office |journal= THE MAINE CLIMATE |date= March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 11:15 am, waters began rising on the river and within 15 minutes had risen a total of {{convert|3.7|m|ft}} flooding downtown. About 200 cars were submerged and office workers were stranded until waters receded. There were no reported deaths during this unusual [[flash flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gyx/bangor_flood.htm |accessdate= 2015-02-10 |title= The Great Bangor Storm Surge Flash Flood |publisher= National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HYDROSOL''' (short for '''Solar hydrogen via water splitting in advanced monolithic reactors for future solar power plants''') is a series of [[European Union]] funded projects for the promotion of [[renewable energy]]. Its aim is the production of hydrogen using  [[concentrating solar power|concentrated solar power]] with a specific [[thermochemical cycle]].

== History ==
The [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP5)]] project HYDROSOL started in December 2002 with a budget of €2.6&amp;nbsp;million.  A pilot-scale solar reactor was designed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.03.019 |title=On mathematical modeling of solar hydrogen production in monolithic reactors |journal=[[Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering]] |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1915 |year=2011 |last1=Kostoglou |first1=M. |last2=Lekkos |first2=C.P. |last3=Konstandopoulos |first3=A.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; built and operated at the [[German Aerospace Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/sf/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7159/11923_read-28158/ |title=Solar Energy for Chemical Processes |publisher=Institute of Solar Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a solar furnace facility in [[Cologne]] (Germany), continuously producing "solar hydrogen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.03.025 |title=Prospects of solar thermal hydrogen production processes |journal=[[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]] |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=4256 |year=2009 |last1=Pregger |first1=Thomas |last2=Graf |first2=Daniela |last3=Krewitt |first3=Wolfram |last4=Sattler |first4=Christian |last5=Roeb |first5=Martin |last6=Möller |first6=Stephan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FP6 HYDROSOL II is a pilot reactor of 100&amp;nbsp;kW scale for solar [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] [[hydrogen production]] at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]], which started in November 2005 and has been in operation since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP6_PROJ&amp;ACTION=D&amp;RCN=75098&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=1161712766968 |title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects and Results : Solar Hydrogen via Water Splitting in Advanced Monolithic Reactors for Future Solar Power plants |work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/ |title=DLR Portal - DLR|work=dlr.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Hydrosol project was awarded the [[Descartes Prize]]  by the European Commission for Collaborative Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stobbe.com/research/hydrogen/EU_ducument.pdf Descartes Prize for Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, the Synlight project at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) created an artificial sun in the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newatlas.com/dlr-artificial-sun/48579/ |title=World's largest artificial Sun rises in Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/23/worlds-largest-artificial-sun-german-scientists-activate-synlight |title=Let there be light: Germans switch on 'largest artificial sun'|first=Hannah |last=Devlin |date=23 March 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-thermochemical-water-splitting |title=Hydrogen Production: Thermochemical Water Splitting |publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to better optimise solar hydrogen production at scale, the electrically powered 'sun' is able to provide focussed temperatures approaching 3,000°C, far above the temperatures currently reached by commercial concentrated solar power stations.

[[File:North Seattle Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility 01.jpg|thumb|A household hazardous waste collection center in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], U.S.]]

'''Household hazardous waste''' (HHW), sometimes called '''retail hazardous waste''' or "home generated special materials', is [[post-consumer waste]] which qualifies as [[hazardous waste]] when discarded. It includes household chemicals and other substances for which the owner no longer has a use, such as consumer products sold for [[Housekeeping|home care]], [[personal care]], [[Automobile|automotive]] care, [[pest control]] and other purposes.  These products exhibit many of the same dangerous characteristics as fully regulated [[hazardous waste]] due to their potential for [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], ignitability, [[corrosive|corrosivity]], [[toxicity]], or [[persistent organic pollutant|persistence]]. Examples include [[drain cleaner]]s, [[oil paint]], [[motor oil]], [[antifreeze]], [[fuel]], [[poison]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[rodenticide]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, lamp ballasts, [[smoke detector]]s, [[medical waste]], some types of cleaning chemicals, and [[consumer electronics]] (such as televisions, [[computer]]s, and [[mobile phone|cell phone]]s).

Certain items such as batteries and fluorescent lamps can be returned to retail stores for disposal.  The [[Call2Recycle|Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation]] (RBRC) maintains a list of battery recycling locations and your local environmental organization should have list of fluorescent lamp recycling locations. The classification "household hazardous waste" has been used for decades and does not accurately reflect the larger group of materials that during the past several years have become known as "household hazardous wastes".  These include items such as latex paint, non-hazardous household products and other items that do not generally exhibit hazardous characteristics which are routinely included in "household hazardous waste" disposal programs.  The term "home generated special materials" more accurately identifies a broader range of items that public agencies are targeting as recyclable and/or should not be disposed of into a landfill.

==United States==

{{Main|Hazardous waste in the United States}}

HHW is not regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. Many states and local solid waste management departments have created and funded Household Hazardous Waste collection programs to offer safe disposal options. These programs may include home collection service, permanent facilities and one day collection events. 

Although most [[U.S. states]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] regulations continue to permit homeowner disposal of some household hazardous waste into the solid waste stream, state agencies are becoming more stringent in enforcing existing hazardous waste regulations at the retail level.

The most extensive overview of this topic including history, policy and technical issues is contained in the 2008 book Handbook on Household Hazardous Waste, Amy Cabaniss, Editor.&lt;ref&gt;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780865871632&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional HHW overview resource is in Chapter 10 of the Handbook of Solid Waste Management, [[George Tchobanoglous]] and [[Frank Kreith]], Editors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Solid-Waste-Management-Kreith/dp/0071356231&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional organization most focused on HHW issues is the North American Hazardous Materials Management Association, NAHMMA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nahmma.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=1&lt;/ref&gt;  NAHMMA has chapters in many states,&lt;ref&gt;http://nahmma.affiniscape.com/associations/6211/chaptermap/&lt;/ref&gt; holds an annual conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nahmma.org&lt;/ref&gt; provides training and offers professional publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://nahmma.affiniscape.com/storeindex.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  In collaboration with the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) NAHMMA offers certification to HHW collection professionals.

===State regulation===

In [[Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/hazardous/pages/laws.htm Summary of Hazardous Waste Regulations » Waste Management » Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and in other [[United States]] states, responsibility for proper disposal of retail hazardous waste falls upon the generator. Depending on the state, "proper disposal" either encourage, or in some states require, that small business hazardous waste not be disposed of through the solid waste stream, but must only be transported in accordance with [[Department of Transportation|DOT]]licensed carriers and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] ([[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|RCRA]]) regulations to a properly permitted hazardous waste TSDRF (Treatment Storage Disposal and/or  Recycling Facility).

Some states allow collection of small business hazardous wastes at the same location as household hazardous wastes.  However, it is more common for public collection facilities to limit hazardous waste collection to households. In 1992 the US EPA issued a policy that allowed states the option to collect and mix household hazardous wastes with conditionally exempt hazardous wastes from small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/swfa/mrw/epaguides/CESQGmixingHHW.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This has encouraged a trend of local collection programs evolving from household hazardous waste only to also include small business hazardous waste collection.

[[California]] has introduced an [[California Electronic Waste Recycling Act|Electronic Waste Recycling Act]]. While most states recognize the exemption for home generated hazardous waste in 40 CFR, California has established Section 25218 of the Health and Safety Code to regulate all aspects of home generated special materials (HHW).  25218 details the types of programs e.g. Door-to-Door, Permanent HHWCF, Curbside, Mobile etc.  Public agencies must sponsor (as the generator) all HHW programs as their EPA ID number is used.  All HHW programs are monitored by DTSC and/or the local CUPA organization.  A Permit-by-Rule must be obtained from DTSC or the CUPA before implementing most HHW collection activities.

Pennsylvania has introduced the [http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/electronics_recycling_management_program/20342 Covered Device Recycling Act].

==European Union==

Similar regulations, such as the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] are being introduced in the countries of the [[European Union]].

==Methods and tools==

Multiple methods are available for the isolation and study of human viruses:

* [[Deep sequencing]] is a rapid DNA sequencing technique that is useful for characterizing virome richness, stability, gene function and the association with disease phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Emerging View of the human virome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Translational research in infectious disease: current paradigms and challenges ahead" /&gt; This technology creates large amounts of sequence information and is capable of detecting rare components of a microbial community. Current methods combining the removal of human and bacterial DNA from samples, large scale sequencing, and bioinformatics are very efficient in the identification of unknown viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thurber|first=Rebecca V|last2=Haynes|first2=Matthew|last3=Breitbart|first3=Mya|last4=Wegley|first4=Linda|last5=Rohwer|first5=Forest|title=Laboratory procedures to generate viral metagenomes|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nprot.2009.10|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=4|issue=4|pages=470–483|doi=10.1038/nprot.2009.10|pmid=19300441|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other discovery methods, viruses do not need to be grown in cell cultures. Without any prior knowledge of genome sequence or growth methods, novel viruses can be discovered. Therefore, deep sequencing is well suited for rapid identification of an unknown or unexpected viruses involved in a disease outbreak or associated with conditions not thought to be caused by viruses. Deep sequencing also allows for large scale screenings with minimal hands on effort.&lt;ref name="Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allander|first=T.|title=From The Cover: Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=6 September 2005|volume=102|issue=36|pages=12891–12896|doi=10.1073/pnas.0504666102|pmid=16118271|pmc=1200281}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic exploration of the viruses that infect humans (the human virome) is important and feasible with these methods.
* [[Polymerase chain reaction]] is a tool to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences. It can be used to help characterize the virome, but it is limited by the need for at least partial DNA sequence information.
* The human [[Metagenomics|metagenome]] includes all organisms that live on or in us. Viruses contribute to the metagenome and establish chronic infection that infest chromosomes; this method will formulate new estimate of the number of genes that confer susceptibility to a given virus and specify alleles for some viruses.&lt;ref name="Redefining Chronic Viral Infection"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Virgin|first=Herbert W.|author2=Wherry, E.

Each individual had a distinct viral profile, demonstrating the high interpersonal diversity of the virome. One to 15 viral genera (average 5.5) were detected  in 92% of the 102 individuals sampled ('''Figure 2''').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Figure 3 illustrates the viromes of the 102 individuals defined by sampling up to five major body habitats, showing that a broad range of viruses was detected in healthy people (Figure 3).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 102 individuals carried seven distinct families of human DNA viruses ('''Figure 4A''').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sequences were detected predominantly in the nose and skin, similarity to 17 papillomavirus genera(Figure 4B).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Roseolovirus]]es, predominantly [[Human herpesvirus 7|HHV-7]] and to a lesser extent [[Human herpesvirus 6|HHV-6]], were present among 98% of the individuals who provided mouth samples.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition, the same viruses were prevalent in multiple body habitats within individuals. For instance, the beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses were the viruses most commonly found in the skin and the nose (anterior nares; see '''Figure 4A,B'''), which may reflect proximity and similarities in microenvironments that support infection with these viruses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===The human blood virome===

Whole-genome sequencing data of blood from 8,240 individuals without any clear infectious disease revealed 94 different viruses in 42% of the study participants. The sequences included 19 human DNA viruses, proviruses and RNA viruses ([[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]], [[Anelloviridae|anelloviruses]], [[Papillomaviridae|papillomaviruses]], three [[Polyomaviridae|polyomaviruses]], [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]], [[HIV]], [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV]], [[Hepatitis B virus|hepatitis B]], [[Hepatitis C virus|hepatitis C]], [[parvovirus B19]], and [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Ahmed|last2=Xie|first2=Chao|last3=Kirkness|first3=Ewen|last4=Biggs|first4=William|last5=Wong|first5=Emily|last6=Turpaz|first6=Yaron|last7=Bloom|first7=Kenneth|last8=Delwart|first8=Eric|last9=Nelson|first9=Karen E.|date=2017-03-22|title=The blood DNA virome in 8,000 humans|url=http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006292|journal=PLOS Pathogens|volume=13|issue=3|pages=e1006292|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006292|issn=1553-7374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of possible relevance to transfusion medicine, this study  identified [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]] in 49 individuals, papillomavirus in blood of 13 individuals, parvovirus B19 in 6 individuals, and the presence of [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|herpesvirus 8]] in 3 individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Impact on human health==

The human virome is a part of our bodies and will not always cause harm. Many latent and asymptomatic viruses are present in the human body all the time. Viruses infect all life forms; therefore the bacterial, plant, and animal cells and material in our gut also carry viruses.&lt;ref name="Your Inner Lions: Get to Know Your Virome" /&gt; When viruses cause harm by infecting the cells in the body, a symptomatic disease may develop. Contrary to common belief, harmful viruses may be in the minority compared to benign viruses in the human body. It is much harder to identify viruses than it is to identify bacteria, therefore our understanding of benign viruses in the human body is very rudimentary.&lt;ref name="The other microbiome" /&gt;

The health effects of viruses on an individual are dependent on the individual's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Emerging View of the human virome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genome–virome interactions: examining the role of common viral infections in complex disease"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foxman|first=Ellen F.|author2=Iwasaki, Akiko|title=Genome–virome interactions: examining the role of common viral infections in complex disease|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=1 April 2011|volume=9|issue=4|pages=254–264|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2541|pmid=21407242|pmc=3678363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The hygiene hypothesis===

Recent research has linked the emerging idea of the [[hygiene hypothesis]] to viruses. This hypothesis attempts to explain and justify some of the high incidences of diseases such as asthma&lt;ref name=Butler2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Christopher C |title=Asthma prevalence and humoral immune response in Somali immigrants in the US: implications for the hygiene hypothesis.|journal=Primary Care Respiratory Journal: Journal of the General Practice Airways Group|date=September 2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=262–264|doi=10.4104/pcrj.2013.00081}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eczema&lt;ref name=Strachan2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strachan|first=David P |title=Siblings, Asthma, Rhinoconjunctivitis And Eczema: A Worldwide Perspective From The International Study Of Asthma And Allergies In Childhood.|journal=Clinical and Experimental Allergy|date=June 10, 2014|doi=10.1111/cea.12349|volume=45|pages=126–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Western world to Western society's overuse of antibiotic and antiviral agents. This overuse potentially disrupts not only the bacteria of the gut but also the viruses that have long lived in harmony with the human body and now play a role in regulation of human health. This hypothesis generally refers to microorganisms but is now being extended to include airborne viruses and common viral infections of childhood that are becoming increasingly less common.&lt;ref name=Daley2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daley|first=D |title=The evolution of the hygiene hypothesis: the role of early-life exposures to viruses and microbes and their relationship to asthma and allergic diseases.|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=390–396|doi=10.1097/ACI.0000000000000101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of diet===

Many studies have demonstrated that the bacteria and viruses in the human gut (the gut microbiome) can be altered by changes in diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Focà|first=Alfredo|last2=Liberto|first2=Maria Carla|last3=Quirino|first3=Angela|last4=Marascio|first4=Nadia|last5=Zicca|first5=Emilia|last6=Pavia|first6=Grazia|date=2015-01-01|title=Gut Inflammation and Immunity: What Is the Role of the Human Gut Virome?|journal=Mediators of Inflammation|volume=2015|doi=10.1155/2015/326032|issn=0962-9351|pmc=4405218|pmid=25944980|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study that focused on bacterial viruses, called [[bacteriophage]]s, in the gut found a significant relationship between diet and the type of bacteriophages present.&lt;ref name=Minot2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minot|first=S.|author2=Sinha, R. |author3=Chen, J. |author4=Li, H. |author5=Keilbaugh, S.

The results were that the distance between the bacteriophage gut communities of individuals on the same diet was significantly smaller at the end of their dietary treatment than it was at the start, while there was no increase in community similarity for individuals on different diets over time.

== History ==

The glue was developed in a collaboration between [[Boston Children's Hospital]], [[MIT]] and [[Harvard]]-affiliated [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]. It was inspired by the viscous, water-repellant fluids secreted by animals such as [[slug|slugs]], [[sandcastle worm|sandcastle worms]] and insect footpads.&lt;ref name=giz1401/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=new-glue-could-seal-heart-surgeries-14-01-13|title=New Glue Could Seal Heart Surgeries: Scientific American Podcast|publisher=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heart repair ==

HLAA has been used experimentally to repair holes in pig hearts. It provides a [[hemostatic]] seal that adheres to the heart tissue despite immersion in liquid blood. It is not rejected by the body and is sufficiently adhesive and elastic that it is not pulled loose or damaged by the contractions of the [[heart muscle]]. It harmlessly biodegrades over time. The lack of stitching or stapling implies that procedures for applying glue-treated patches are potentially considerably less invasive than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=giz1401/&gt; The [[polymer]] becomes physically entangled with [[collagen]] and other [[protein|proteins]] on the tissue surface rather than adhering via a [[chemical reaction]].&lt;ref name="tr1401"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/523356/surgical-glue-to-mend-broken-hearts/|title=Mending Damaged Hearts with Surgical Glue – MIT Technology Review|publisher=technologyreview.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternatives ===

[[Surgical suture|Sutures]] can damage heart tissue and take too long to apply. [[Staple (fastener)|Staples]] can also damage heart tissue. Existing surgical adhesives can be toxic, and they can become unstuck in wet, dynamic environments such as the heart. As a result, infants often require subsequent operations to "replug" the hole.&lt;ref name=giz1401/&gt; One other [[surgical adhesive]] cures when exposed to water.&lt;ref name=tr1401/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">'''''Infinite Energy''''' is a bi-monthly magazine published in [[New Hampshire]] that details theories and experiments concerning [[alternative energy]], new science and new physics. The magazine was founded by the late [[Eugene Mallove]], and is owned by the non-profit [[New Energy Foundation]].&lt;ref name=iemission&gt;[http://www.infinite-energy.com/whoarewe/whoarewe.html Infinite Energy: What is the New Energy Foundation?]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1994 as ''Cold Fusion'' magazine &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/csp/cms/sites/Telegraph/granitegeek/archive2010/index.csp Before 'Infinite Energy' it was 'Cold Fusion']&lt;/ref&gt; and changed its name in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/aboutthemagazine.html About the magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics of interest include "new hydrogen physics," also called [[cold fusion]]; vacuum energy, or [[zero point energy]]; and so-called "environmental energy" which they define as the attempt to violate the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinite-energy.com/resources/faq.html#Q34 Infinite Energy FAQ: Environmental energy]&lt;/ref&gt; for example with a [http://www.infinite-energy.com/resources/faq.html#Q40 perpetual motion machine].  This is done in pursuit of the founder's commitment to "unearthing new sources of energy and new paradigms in science."&lt;ref name=iemission /&gt;  The magazine has also published articles and book reviews that are critical of the [[big bang]] theory that describes the [[Physical cosmology|origin of the universe]].

The magazine has a [[print run]] of 3,000, and is available on U.S. newsstands.  The issues range in size from 48 to 100 pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">The '''inversion temperature''' in [[thermodynamics]] and [[cryogenics]] is the critical temperature below which a non-[[ideal gas]] (all gases in reality) that is expanding at constant enthalpy will experience a temperature decrease, and above which will experience a temperature increase. This temperature change is known as the [[Joule-Thomson effect]], and is exploited in the [[liquefaction of gases]]. Inversion temperature depends on the nature of the gas. 



For a [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] we can calculate the [[enthalpy]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; using [[statistical mechanics]] as

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{5}{2} N k_\mathrm B T + \frac{N^2}{V} (b k_\mathrm B T - 2a)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature (in the [[Kelvin scale]]), &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are constants depending on intermolecular forces and molecular volume, respectively.

From this equation, we note that if we keep enthalpy constant and increase volume, temperature must change depending on the sign of &lt;math&gt;b k_\mathrm B T - 2a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, our inversion temperature is given where the sign flips at zero, or

:&lt;math&gt; T_\text{inv} = \frac{2a}{b k_\mathrm B} = \frac{27}{4} T_\mathrm c &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[critical temperature]] of the substance. So for &lt;math&gt;T &gt; T_\text{inv}&lt;/math&gt;, an expansion at constant enthalpy increases temperature as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the repulsive interactions of the gas is dominant, and so the change in [[energy]] is negative. But for &lt;math&gt;T &lt; T_\text{inv}&lt;/math&gt;, expansion causes temperature to decrease because the work of attractive intermolecular forces dominates, giving a positive change in energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Kittel and Herbert Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics|edition=2nd|publisher=W.H. Freeman|year=1980|isbn=0-7167-1088-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marinisation''' (also '''marinization''') is design, redesign, or testing of products specifically for use and long-term survival in the harsh [[Marine (ocean)|marine environment]]. This is done by many manufacturing industries worldwide including many military organisations (especially navies).
The main challenge is for the engineers who design the product from the scratch. Every part needs to be designed in order to fit to the marine environment and then to resist its "natural attacks".

There are three main factors that need to be considered for a product to be truly marinised.
* [[Corrosion]]
* [[Vibration]]
* A constantly changing attitude of the vessel, similar to [[aircraft attitude]] 

These three factors are a constant in the marine environment, and are present even on a dead calm day. These factors apply also in fresh water. 

==Examples==

===Electronics===
Marinised [[electronics]] use one or more of the following protection methods. In most cases more than one method is used:

* Coating by a spray or dipping to protect from salt air and water
* Full encapsulation in some form of resin or gel
* Specialised mounting of internal parts for vibration protection
* Use of specialised corrosion resistant solder and corrosion resistant metals

===Metals===
Marinised [[metals]] include some of the following examples:

* Metals made up of alloys that do not corrode or resist corrosion, e.g. 316 marine grade [[stainless steel]]
* Metals electroplated or dipped in a corrosion-resistant material, e.g. [[galvanised steel]]
* Metals painted with special anti rust or anti corrosion coatings
* Naturally resistant metals such as brass are considered marinised if manufactured to a high quality without impurities that corrode.
* Plastic coated metals

===Batteries ===
Marinised batteries are usually [[Gel battery|gel batteries]] or sealed maintenance-free batteries. Not using marinised batteries in salt water can be deadly in an enclosed environment for many reasons:

# [[Sulfuric acid]] and salt water react to generate dangerous [[hydrogen chloride]] gas, necessitating the use of valve-regulated maintenance-free sealed batteries.
# The battery must have stronger plates and separators to withstand constant vibrations and impacts caused by large waves striking the hull. Plate collapse can cause short-circuits and electrical fires or explosions.
# A marine battery must function at any angle due to the changing attitude of the vessel it is mounted in. Gel VRLA batteries are best for this purpose.

The '''Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center''' (MAREC) was a facility located in [[Muskegon, Michigan]] that promoted research, education and business development in [[alternative energy|alternative]] and [[renewable energy]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutemichigan.com/search/?linkid=7189 |title=The Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC) |publisher=Absolute Michigan |work= |accessdate=July 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129015932/http://absolutemichigan.com/search/?linkid=7189 |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the Center was renamed the Muskegon Innovation Center and the organization refocused on supporting innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mibiz.com/item/23649-gvsu%25E2%2580%2599s-marec-relaunches-under-new-name,-co-working-space-in-muskegon|title=GVSU’s MAREC relaunches with new name, co-working space in Muskegon|last=Wiegand|first=John|website=mibiz.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
Development and planning for the center began in 1999 when a group of [[Grand Valley State University]] faculty and Muskegon business people proposed a research and development facility focused on alternative energy. Subsequent partnerships between the business, community, and the private sector resulted in groundbreaking for the center in late 2002, and its completion in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==The building==
The {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} facility was powered, in part, by a fuel cell and a micro turbine, which turned natural gas into electricity. In addition, the building's photovoltaic solar roof tiles harnessed the solar power generated by the sun to create useful energy. MAREC then used a nickel metal hydride battery system to store some of the energy produced by these sources for use during peak energy consumption periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/3702.htm |title=Michigan Alternative &amp; Renewable Energy Center |publisher=The Chief Engineer |work= |accessdate=July 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was also constructed using many alternative and renewable building materials including flooring surfaces produced from fast-growing bamboo and recycled tires, and rigid wall surfaces made from pressed wheat. These materials were used to conserve and recycle valuable natural resources.

==Economic development==
MAREC was part of the Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone, a joint venture with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the city of [[Muskegon]], and [[Grand Valley State University]]. The Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone is intended to promote and attract high technology business development in Muskegon and the region.

MAREC had {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space devoted to incubating businesses that would research and develop alternative energy sources and uses. The focus on alternative energy was expected to be a catalyst for economic development and job growth in the area. Research and development initiatives was also intended to fuel business expansion at Edison Landing, the {{convert|32|acre|m2|adj=on}} SmartZone being transformed into a multi-use office, retail, and residential center. Overall SmartZone development was expected to complement the array of human, physical, and capital investments made at MAREC.

'''Minera San Xavier''' is a subsidiary of the Canadian company [[New Gold Inc.]] that operates a gold and silver mine near [[Cerro de San Pedro]], a municipality of [[San Luis Potosí]] just 12 kilometers away from the capital city of the state.  The city of San Luis Potosí was founded after gold was discovered in the hills near Cerro de San Pedro in the 15th century.

Continuous internal and external monitoring of mining activities has not produced any evidence of contamination to date.

'''''Outlook On Renewable Energy In America''''' is a comprehensive two volume report, published in 2007 by The [[American Council on Renewable Energy]] (ACORE), about the future of [[renewable energy]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/OutlookonRenewableEnergy2007.pdf ''The Outlook On Renewable Energy In America'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been said that this report exposes a "new reality for renewable energy in America".&lt;ref name="renewableenergyaccess.com"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story;jsessionid=2F57B1E1F590ED73E48AB7313C1639D7?id=48344 635 GW Possible with U.S. Political Shift]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume One of the report presents background information on government research conducted by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]], [[Energy Information Administration]], [[Electric Power Research Institute]] and other institutions.  It also collates information from industry associations such as the [[American Wind Energy Association]], Solar Energy Industries Association, National Hydropower Association, as well as some non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uaelp.pennnet.com/display_article/291571/22/ARTCL/none/none/Energy-leaders-call-for-long-term-commitments-to-renewable-resources/ Energy leaders call for long-term commitments to renewable resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America'' is the second volume of the report which presents a scenario compiled by the American renewable energy community.  ACORE makes it clear that this report is not a forecast—it is a scenario of what is achievable if the country wants renewables to reach their full potential, and is willing to embrace the public policies to make that happen.&lt;ref name=joint&gt;[http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/JointOutlookReport20071.pdf ''Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America''] Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORE released an update of the report in March 2014, which assesses the marketplace and forecasts the future of each renewable energy technology sector from the perspectives of U.S. renewable energy trade associations. Each sector forecast is accompanied by a list of the trade association’s specific policy recommendations that they believe might encourage continued industry growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acore-releases-outlook-renewable-energy-144116103.html ACORE Releases Outlook for Renewable Energy in America: 2014, Jointly Authored by U.S. Renewable Energy Trade Associations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenario==

According to experts, renewable energy could provide up to 635 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity generating capacity by 2025 – a substantial contribution and potentially more than the nation’s need for new capacity.  According to this scenario, this capacity could come from a wide array of new technologies utilizing the full range of our renewable resources:&lt;ref name=joint&gt;[http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/JointOutlookReport20071.pdf ''Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America''] page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

*Wind power could provide 248 GW by 2025
*Solar energy and power could provide 164 GW
*Geothermal energy and power 100 GW
*Biomass energy, power, and fuels 100 GW
*Water power 23 GW&lt;ref name=joint/&gt;

In addition, the scenario shows that renewable fuels could meet a large portion of U.S. liquid fuel needs. Recent studies show that biofuels could supply 30% to 40% of U.S. petroleum products by 2030.  Ethanol fuel alone could reach {{convert|11.5|e9USgal|m3}} per year by the end of the first quarter of 2009, a significant contribution to the approximately {{convert|135|e9USgal|m3}} of gasoline consumed annually.&lt;ref name=joint/&gt;

==Public policy principles==

To make the transition to the renewable energy future that is outlined in the scenario, the report argues that the [[energy policy of the United States]] needs to be built on a range of principles, which include:

*Building a comprehensive national renewable energy strategy that addresses the full range of technological and market issues.
*Creating energy policies that address both the challenges of oil dependence and global warming in an integrated way.
*Recognizing that energy efficiency and renewable energy work together.
*Providing long-term incentives for renewable power investments, modernizing our transmission and distribution systems, and investing in the next generation of biofuel facilities infrastructure.
*Scaling up an accelerated national R&amp;D program to return the U.S. to global leadership.
*Implementing long-term and stable policy commitments that allow industry, the financial sector, and consumers to make longer-term decisions.&lt;ref name=joint/&gt;

==Rationale for renewables==

The report argues that America needs renewable energy, for many reasons:

{{quote|America needs energy that is secure, reliable, improves public health, protects the environment, addresses climate change, creates jobs, and provides technological leadership. America needs renewable energy. If renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential, America will need coordinated, sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable [[energy market]]s; promote and deploy new technology; and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors: wholesale and distributed electricity generation, thermal energy applications, and transportation.&lt;ref name=joint/&gt;}}

The report quotes President Bush on the need to diversify America's energy supply:

{{quote|It’s in our vital interest to diversify America’s energy supply – the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of&amp;nbsp;… solar and wind energy. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes.|President [[George W. Bush]], State of the Union, 1-23-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/JointOutlookReport20071.pdf ''Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America''] page 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

ACORE suggests that these reports dispel the commonly held notion that renewable energy cannot supply the energy needs of a growing American economy. But for this to happen, the government would have to commit to long term policies that promote renewable energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Park &amp; Charge'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.park-charge.net Park &amp; Charge website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a European infrastructure for charging  [[electric car|electric vehicles]].

At reserved parking spaces for electric vehicles a simple, locked [[charging station]] with all necessary sockets and safety facilities is installed to which only "Park &amp; Charge" users have access. [[Electric car|Electric vehicles]] are in generally energy efficient, and therefore at a "Park &amp; Charge" chargers requires relatively small quantities of electricity. By not having complicated metering technology and with the simplest organizational measures such as a ([[flat rate]]) cost, the administrative costs are kept low.

Park &amp; Charge runs an open database ''LEMnet'' since 1998 that lists its own charging stations as well as that of other infrastructure providers in Europe.

[[File:Tankst 3ph 180.gif|thumb|Traditional charging station of the existing Park&amp;Charge charge station system (left to right): &lt;br /&gt;- small Domestic socket-outlet (10–16 A, 250 V) &lt;br /&gt;- [[IEC 60309|CEE 16 A, 250 V]] &lt;br /&gt;- [[IEC 60309|CEE 16 A,400 V]] ]]

== History ==
In 1992, the first four locations of Park &amp; Charge were established under the "pilot and demonstration project P &amp; D" of the [[Federal Office of Energy]] in [[Bern]]. After a three-year experimental phase, the project went into regular operation. The [[Electromobile]] Club of  [[Switzerland]] (ECS), which has accompanied the project, took over the financial and legal responsibility for Park &amp; Charge. In the subsequent period Park &amp; Charge became so popular that it needed to be legally formalised. At the end of 1997 Park &amp; Charge was founded as an independent association (President: Wilfried Blum, Managing Director: Eduard Stolz).

Park&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Charge stations became available beyond the borders as well. The [[German Solar Mobility Association]] founded an organization for the operation in Germany in 1997.  Since 1999 there are Park &amp; Charge stations in Italy and Austria. As for Austria VLOTTE has taken over the operations since 2010 which is a project by the "Vorarlberger Elektroautomobil Planungs- und Beratungs GmbH" in cooperation with the VKW Utility Company [[Vorarlberg]] (Vorarlberger Kraftwerke AG). More charging points became available in Liechtenstein, France and the Netherlands.

In the [[Canton Ticino]] the federal "P &amp; D" project was continued with studies for „Veicoli Elettrici Leggeri“ (light electric vehicles) running from 1995 to 2001 (VEL1) and from 2001 to 2005 (VEL2). With the help of those projects an electric vehicle network of charging stations was deployed which is operated by RiParTI (Ricariche e Parcheggi in Ticino – Charging and Parking in Ticino).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infovel.ch/deu/interna.asp?idarticolo=15324|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907230008/http://www.infovel.ch/deu/interna.asp?idarticolo=15324|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-07|title=Laden und Tanken RiParTI|publisher=InfoVEL Mendrisio|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniform logo for the whole of Europe and is used by law enforcement bodies for the simple identification of electric vehicles, and is dated 1 December of the previous year contribution period to 31 January the following year. Entitles the owners of Electric vehicles to use the specially marked and for reserved parking spaces.

The yearly subscription entitles the user use of all the Park &amp; Charge Charging points in Europe at a ([[flat rate]]). The prices of the subscription is set by the respective national organizations.

== Charging Stations ==
Today allows Park &amp; Charge is at nearly 500 locations in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Italy, for drivers of electric vehicles, it is a safe and easy way to charge their car's battery.

=== LEMnet ===
The locations of the charging stations of Park &amp; Charge were assembled in a list for its members. The list did also include charging sports of third parties as far as they were usable by the vehicle owners.

After the reorganization the new association created an internet database in 1998 to publish the list of available charging stations. The name '''LEMnet''' is derived from the main vehicle type of Park &amp; Charge members at the time being light electric vehicles (LEV - in German ''Leichtelektromobile'' LEM) being [[Motorised quadricycle|electric quadricycle]]s that are often summarized in English in the [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]] class. Those only need an electrical outlet to be charged overnight so that LEMnet did also list inns that cooperate with electric vehicle owners.

With the [[History of the electric vehicle#1990s to present: Revival of mass interest|revival and mass production]] of electric vehicles the LEMnet database served as a central overview mapping the available charging stations across Europe. The providers of commercial charging station networks began to provide their data to LEMnet - in 2012 more than 30 providers cooperated with LEMnet. On 26 March 2012 it was decided form a new association to run the LEMnet database - the ''LEMnet Europe e.V.''' is supported by Park &amp; Charge and the E-Mobility Cluster, [[Central Germany (geography)|Mitteldeutschland]].&lt;ref name="lemnet-ev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemnet.org/images/LEMnet_Europe_Medienmitteilung_20120327.pdf|title=LEMnet Europe e.V. gegründet.|at=Medienmitteilung|date=2012-03-27|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pennyweight''' (abbreviated '''dwt''', from '''''d'''''enarius '''''w'''''eigh'''''t''''') is a unit of [[mass]] that is equal to 24 [[Grain (measure)|grains]], {{frac|20}} of a [[troy ounce]], {{frac|240}} of a [[Troy weight|troy]] pound, approximately 0.054857 [[ounce|avoirdupois ounce]] &lt;ref&gt;Calculated using the relationships:&lt;br/&gt;
:1 avoirdupois ounce = 437.50grains
:1 troy ounce = 480 grains&lt;/ref&gt; and exactly 1.55517384 [[gram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated using the relationship:
:1 troy grain = 0.06479891 gram (exact by definition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the Middle Ages, a [[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|British penny]]'s weight was literally, as well as monetarily, '''{{frac|20}}''' of an ounce and {{frac|240}} of a pound of [[sterling silver]].  At that time, the pound in use was the [[Pound (mass)#Tower pound|Tower pound]], equal to 7,680 Tower grains (also known as wheat grains).  The medieval English pennyweight was thus equal to 32 Tower grains.  When Troy weights replaced Tower weights in 1527, the Troy weights were defined in such a way that the old Tower pound came out to exactly 5400 Troy grains (also known as barleycorns), the Tower pennyweight {{frac|22|1|2}} Troy grains (and thus approximately 1.46 grams).  After 1527, the English pennyweight was the Troy pennyweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Zupko| first = Ronald Edward| authorlink = Ronald Edward Zupko| title = A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles| publisher = American Philosophical Society| year = 1985| pages = 280–84| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0l_k-XMIiQIC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=pennyweight#v=onepage&amp;q=pennyweight&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-87169-168-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 24 Troy grains.  Thus the Troy pound, ounce, and pennyweight, with their definitions given in terms of the Troy grain instead of in terms of the Tower grain, were 1/15 or 6.667% more than the Tower equivalents.

==Usage==
The Troy pound and the pennyweight lost their official status in the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878; only the Troy ounce and its decimal subdivisions remained official. The Troy ounce enjoys a specific legal exemption from [[metrication]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pennyweight is the common weight used in the valuation and measurement of precious metals. Jewellers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of precious metals used in fabricating or casting jewellery. Similarly, dentists and dental labs still use the pennyweight as the measure of precious metals in dental crowns and inlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Pennyweight and grains are still used to weigh gooseberries in competitions in Cheshire, northwest UK. Over the Pennines in Yorkshire the alternative [[Dram (unit)|drams]] and grains measurement has been used since a new set of scales was purchased by the [https://www.egtongooseberryshow.org.uk/index.htm Egton Bridge Old Gooseberry Society] in 1937. As of 2018, the world record for the heaviest gooseberry of 41 dwt 11 gr was held by Kelvin Archer of Cheshire.

The most common abbreviation for pennyweight is ''dwt''; ''d'', for the Roman ''[[denarius]]'', was the abbreviation for ''penny'' before [[Decimal Day|Decimalization of the British monetary system]]. Alternate abbreviations are ''pwt'' and ''PW''.

==Uses unrelated to weight==

Although the abbreviations are the same, the pennyweight bears no relation to the weight of the American [[Penny (unit)|penny nail]]. That name is derived from the price for a hundred nails in 15th century [[England]]: the larger the nail, the higher the cost per hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | title = Penny | url = http://ed2.oed.com/cgi/display_main/00174661#00174661-mB.V.10 | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | edition = 2nd | format = subscription required | quote = Applied to nails, such adjectives denote the original price (in 15th c.) per hundred; as fivepenny nail, a nail which cost 5d. a hundred, tenpenny nail, a nail costing 10d. a hundred.

A '''polar orbit''' is one in which a [[satellite]] [[pass (spaceflight)|pass]]es above or nearly above both [[Poles of astronomical bodies|poles]] of the body being [[orbit]]ed (usually a planet such as the [[Earth]], but possibly another body such as the [[Moon]] or [[Sun]]) on each revolution. It therefore has an [[inclination]] of (or very close to) 90 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s to the body's [[equator]]. A satellite in a polar orbit will pass over the equator at a different [[longitude]] on each of its orbits.

==Earth orbits==
Polar orbits are often used for earth-mapping, [[earth observation satellite|earth observation]], capturing the earth as time passes from one point, [[reconnaissance satellite]]s, as well as for some [[weather satellite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Science Focus 2nd Edition 2, pg. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iridium satellite constellation]] also uses a polar orbit to provide telecommunications services. The disadvantage to this orbit is that no one spot on the Earth's surface can be sensed continuously from a satellite in a polar orbit.

==Sun orbits==
Near-polar orbiting satellites commonly choose a [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], meaning that each successive orbital [[pass (spaceflight)|pass]] occurs at the same local time of day. This can be particularly important for applications such as remote sensing atmospheric temperature, where the most important thing to see may well be ''changes'' over time which are not aliased onto changes in local time. To keep the same local time on a given pass, the [[frequency|time period]] of the orbit must be kept as short as possible, this is achieved by keeping the orbit lower around Earth. However, very low orbits of a few hundred kilometers rapidly [[orbital decay|decay]] due to [[drag (physics)|drag]] from the atmosphere. Commonly used [[altitude]]s are between 700 and 800&amp;nbsp;km, producing an [[orbital period]] of about 100 minutes.&lt;ref name="phy6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phy6.org/Education/wlopolar.html |title=Polar Orbiting Satellites |first=David P. |last=Stern |date=2001-11-25 |access-date=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-orbit on the Sun side then takes only 50 minutes, during which local time of day does not vary greatly.

To retain the Sun-synchronous orbit as [[Earth's orbit|Earth revolves]] around the Sun during the year, the orbit of the satellite must [[Nodal precession|precess]] at the same rate, which is not possible if the satellite were to pass directly over the pole. Because of Earth's [[equatorial bulge]], an orbit [[orbital inclination|inclined]] at a slight angle is subject to a [[torque]], which causes [[precession]]. An angle of about 8° from the pole produces the desired precession in a 100-minute orbit.&lt;ref name="phy6" /&gt;

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Quasiparticles}}

A '''polaron''' is a [[quasiparticle]] used in [[condensed matter physics]] to understand the interactions between [[electrons]] and [[atoms]] in a solid material. The polaron concept was first proposed by [[Lev Landau]] in 1933 to describe an electron moving in a [[dielectric]] [[crystal]] where the [[ions|atoms]] move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a [[phonon]] cloud. This lowers the [[electron mobility]] and increases the electron's [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].

The general concept of a polaron has been extended to describe other interactions between the electrons and ions in metals that result in a [[bound state]], or a lowering of energy compared to the non-interacting system. Major theoretical work has focused on solving Fröhlich and Holstein [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]]. This is still an active field of research to find exact numerical solutions to the case of one or two electrons in a large [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]], and to study the case of many interacting electrons.

Experimentally, polarons are important to the understanding of a wide variety of materials. The electron mobility in [[semiconductors|semiconductor]]s can be greatly decreased by the formation of polarons. [[Organic semiconductors]] are also sensitive to polaronic effects, which is particularly relevant in the design of [[organic solar cells]] that effectively transport charge. The electron phonon interaction that forms [[Cooper pairs]] in low-T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors  ([[type-I superconductors]]) can also be modeled as a polaron, and two opposite [[spin (physics)|spin]] electrons may form a bipolaron sharing a phonon cloud. This has been suggested as a mechanism for [[Cooper pair]] formation in high-T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors  ([[type-II superconductors]]). Polarons are also important for interpreting the [[optical conductivity]] of these types of materials.

The polaron, a [[fermionic]] [[quasiparticle]], should not be confused with the [[polariton]], a [[bosonic]] [[quasiparticle]] analogous to a hybridized state between a photon and an optical phonon.

== Polaron theory==

The energy spectrum of an electron moving in a periodical potential of rigid [[crystal lattice]] is called the [[Bloch spectrum]], which consists of allowed bands and forbidden bands. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of [[phonons]]. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by [[Lev Landau]], which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an [[F-center]] and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by [[Solomon Isaakovich Pekar|Solomon Pekar]] that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass.&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Landau and S. I. Pekar, Effective mass of a polaron, Zh. Eksp.

&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis of polaron theory. A charge placed in a polarizable medium will be screened. [[Dielectric]] theory describes the phenomenon by the induction of a polarization around the charge carrier. The induced polarization will follow the charge carrier when it is moving through the medium. The carrier together with the induced polarization is considered as one entity, which is called a polaron (see Fig. 1).

While polaron theory was originally developed for electrons as dressed charges in a crystal field, there is no fundamental reason held against any other charged particle which might interact with phonons. Therefore, also other charged particles such as (electron) holes and ions should generally follow the polaron theory.

Recently, the proton polaron was identified in experimental work on ceramic electrolytes after hypothesis of its existence.

A conduction electron in an ionic crystal or a polar semiconductor is the prototype of a polaron. [[Herbert Fröhlich]] proposed a model [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for this polaron through which its dynamics are treated quantum mechanically (Fröhlich Hamiltonian).&lt;ref name="Fröhlich1950"&gt;

This model assumes that electron wavefunction is spread out over many ions which are all somewhat displaced from their equilibrium positions, or the continuum approximation. The strength of the electron-phonon interaction is expressed by a dimensionless coupling constant α introduced by Fröhlich.&lt;ref name="Fröhlich1954"/&gt; In Table 1 the Fröhlich coupling constant is given for a few solids. The Fröhlich Hamiltonian for a single electron in a crystal using [[second quantization]] notation is: 
: &lt;math&gt;
H = H_e + H_{ph} + H_{e-ph} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
 H_e = \sum_{k,s} \xi(k,s) c_{k,s}^\dagger c_{k,s}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
 H_{ph} = \sum_{q,v} \omega_{q,v} a_{q,v}^\dagger a_{q,v}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
H_{e-ph} = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2N} } \sum_{k,s,q,v} \gamma(\alpha , q , k , v ) \omega_{qv} ( c_{k ,s}^\dagger c_{k-q , s} a_{q,v} + c_{k-q ,s}^\dagger c_{k , s} a^\dagger_{q,v}  )
&lt;/math&gt;

The exact form of γ depends on the material and the type of phonon being used in the model. A detailed advanced discussion of the variations of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian can be found in J. T. Devreese and A. S. Alexandrov &lt;ref name="Devreese2009"&gt;

Despite the lack of an exact solution, some approximations of the polaron properties are known.

The physical properties of a polaron differ from those of a band-carrier. A polaron is characterized by its ''self-energy'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;, an ''effective mass'' &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; and by its characteristic ''response'' to external electric and magnetic fields (e. g. dc mobility and optical absorption coefficient).

When the coupling is weak (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; small), the self-energy of the polaron can be approximated as:&lt;ref name="Smondyrev1986"&gt;

|bibcode = 1986TMP....68..653S }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar\omega } \approx -\alpha -0.015919622\alpha^2, \qquad \qquad \qquad (1)\, &lt;/math&gt;

and the polaron mass &lt;math&gt;m*&lt;/math&gt;, which can be measured by cyclotron resonance experiments, is larger than the band mass m of the charge carrier without self-induced polarization:&lt;ref name="Röseler1968"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\frac{m^*}{m} \approx 1+\frac{\alpha}{6}+0.0236\alpha^2. \qquad \qquad \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

When the coupling is strong (α large), a variational approach due to Landau and Pekar indicates that the self-energy is proportional to α² and the polaron mass scales as ''α''⁴. The Landau–Pekar variational calculation 
&lt;ref name="Pekar1951"/&gt;
yields an upper bound to the polaron self-energy &lt;math&gt;E &lt; -C_{PL} \alpha^2 &lt;/math&gt;, valid
for ''all'' ''α'', where &lt;math&gt;C_{PL}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant determined by solving an integro-differential equation. It was an open question for many years whether this
expression was asymptotically exact as α tends to infinity. Finally,

"Asymptotics for the Polaron", ''Commun. Pure Appl. Math.'' '''36''', 505–528.&lt;/ref&gt; applying [[large deviation theory]] to Feynman's
path integral formulation for the self-energy, showed the large α exactitude 
of this Landau–Pekar formula. Later, Lieb and Thomas

In the strong coupling limit, &lt;math&gt;\alpha \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, the spectrum of excited states of a polaron begins with polaron-phonon bound states with energies less than &lt;math&gt;\hbar\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of optical phonons.&lt;ref&gt;V.

== Polaron optical absorption ==
The expression for the magnetooptical absorption of a polaron is:&lt;ref name="Peeters1986"&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\Gamma(\Omega) \propto -\frac{\operatorname{Im} \Sigma(\Omega)}{\left[\Omega-\omega_{\mathrm{c}}-\operatorname{Re} \Sigma(\Omega)\right]^2 + \left[\operatorname{Im}\Sigma(\Omega)\right]^2}. \qquad\qquad\qquad (3)
 &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cyclotron frequency]] for a rigid-band electron. The magnetooptical absorption Γ(Ω) at the frequency Ω takes the form Σ(Ω) is the so-called "memory function", which describes the dynamics of the polaron. Σ(Ω) depends also on α, β&lt;sub&gt; what is beta?&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the absence of an external magnetic field (&lt;math&gt;\omega_{c}=0&lt;/math&gt;) the optical absorption spectrum (3) of the polaron at weak coupling is determined by the absorption of radiation energy, which is reemitted in the form of LO phonons. At larger coupling, &lt;math&gt;\alpha \ge 5.9&lt;/math&gt;, the polaron can undergo transitions toward a relatively stable internal excited state called the "relaxed excited state" (RES) (see Fig. 2). The RES peak in the spectrum also has a phonon sideband, which is related to a Franck–Condon-type transition.

The application of a sufficiently strong external magnetic field allows one to satisfy the resonance condition &lt;math&gt;\Omega =\omega_{\mathrm{c}} + \operatorname{Re} \Sigma (\Omega )&lt;/math&gt;, which {(for &lt;math&gt;\omega_c &lt; \omega&lt;/math&gt;)} determines the polaron cyclotron resonance frequency. From this condition also the polaron cyclotron mass can be derived. Using the most accurate theoretical polaron models to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\Sigma (\Omega )&lt;/math&gt;, the experimental cyclotron data can be well accounted for.

Evidence for the polaron character of charge carriers in AgBr and AgCl was obtained through high-precision cyclotron resonance experiments in external magnetic fields up to 16 T.&lt;ref name="Hodby1987"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A simple model for the 2D polaron system consists of an electron confined to a plane, interacting via the Fröhlich interaction with the LO phonons of a 3D surrounding medium. The self-energy and the mass of such a 2D polaron are no longer described by the expressions valid in 3D; for weak coupling they can be approximated as:&lt;ref name="Sak1972"&gt;

\frac{\Delta E}{\hbar \omega} \approx -\frac{\pi}{2}\alpha\ - 0.06397\alpha^2;  \qquad \qquad \qquad (4)\,&lt;/math&gt;

\frac{m^*}{m} \approx 1+\frac{\pi}{8}\alpha\ + 0.1272348\alpha^2. \qquad \qquad \qquad (5)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It has been shown that simple scaling relations exist, connecting the physical properties of polarons in 2D with those in 3D. An example of such a scaling relation is:&lt;ref name="Peeters1987"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{m^{*}_{2D}(\alpha)}{m_{2D}}=\frac{m^{*}_{3D}(\frac{3}{4}\pi\alpha)}{m_{3D}}, \qquad \qquad \qquad (6)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{2D}^*&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{3D}^*&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{2D}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{3D}&lt;/math&gt;) are, respectively, the polaron and the electron-band masses in 2D (3D).

The effect of the confinement of a Fröhlich polaron is to enhance the ''effective'' polaron coupling. However, many-particle effects tend to counterbalance this effect because of screening.&lt;ref name="Devreese1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DasSarma1985"&gt;

Also in 2D systems [[cyclotron resonance]] is a convenient tool to study polaron effects. Although several other effects have to be taken into account (nonparabolicity of the electron bands, [[many-body]] effects, the nature of the confining potential, etc.), the polaron effect is clearly revealed in the cyclotron mass. An interesting 2D system consists of electrons on films of liquid He.&lt;ref name="Shikin1973"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the electrons couple to the ripplons of the liquid He, forming "ripplopolarons". The effective coupling can be relatively large and, for some values of the parameters, self-trapping can result. The acoustic nature of the ripplon dispersion at long wavelengths is a key aspect of the trapping.
 
For GaAs/Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;As quantum wells and superlattices, the polaron effect is found to decrease the energy of the shallow donor states at low magnetic fields and leads to a resonant splitting of the energies at high magnetic fields. The energy spectra of such polaronic systems as shallow donors ("bound polarons"), e. g., the D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centres, constitute the most complete and detailed polaron spectroscopy realised in the literature.&lt;ref name="Shi1993"&gt;

In GaAs/AlAs quantum wells with sufficiently high electron density, anticrossing of the cyclotron-resonance spectra has been observed near the GaAs transverse optical (TO) phonon frequency rather than near the GaAs LO-phonon frequency.&lt;ref name="PoulterZeman2001"&gt;

== Extensions of the polaron concept ==

Significant are also the extensions of the polaron concept: acoustic polaron, [[piezoelectric]] polaron, electronic polaron, bound polaron, trapped polaron, [[Spin (physics)|spin]] polaron, molecular polaron, solvated polarons, polaronic exciton, Jahn-Teller polaron, small polaron, [[bipolaron]]s and many-polaron systems.&lt;ref name="Devreese2005"/&gt; These extensions of the concept are invoked, e. g., to study the properties of conjugated polymers, colossal magnetoresistance perovskites,  high-&lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; superconductors, layered MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors, fullerenes, quasi-1D conductors, semiconductor nanostructures.

The possibility that polarons and bipolarons play a role in high-&lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; [[superconductors]] has renewed interest in the physical properties of many-polaron systems and, in particular, in their optical properties. Theoretical treatments have been extended from one-polaron to many-polaron systems.&lt;ref name="Devreese2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bassani2003"&gt;

A new aspect of the polaron concept has been investigated for semiconductor [[nanostructures]]: the exciton-phonon states are not factorizable into an adiabatic product Ansatz, so that a ''non-adiabatic'' treatment is needed.&lt;ref name="Fomin1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The ''non-adiabaticity'' of the exciton-phonon systems leads to a strong enhancement of the phonon-assisted transition probabilities (as compared to those treated adiabatically) and to multiphonon optical spectra that are considerably different from the [[Franck–Condon]] progression even for small values of the electron-phonon coupling constant as is the case for typical semiconductor nanostructures.&lt;ref name="Fomin1998"/&gt;

In biophysics [[Davydov soliton]] is a propagating along the [[protein]] [[α-helix]] self-trapped amide I excitation that is a solution of the Davydov Hamiltonian. The mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov's soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory. In this context the [[Davydov soliton]] corresponds to a ''polaron'' that is (i) ''large'' so the continuum limit approximation in justified, (ii) ''acoustic'' because the self-localization arises from interactions with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) ''weakly coupled'' because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the hitherto inaccessible strong coupling regime to be studied, since the interaction strengths can be externally tuned through the use of a [[Feshbach resonance]]. This was recently realized experimentally by two research groups.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen2016"&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Spectralon's reflectance is generally &gt;99% over a range from 400 to 1500&amp;nbsp;nm and &gt;95% from 250 to 2500&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Georgiev/&gt; However, grades are available with added carbon to achieve various gray levels.&lt;ref&gt;''Techniques and Applications of Hyperspectral Image Analysis By Paul Geladi - John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. 2007 Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; Surface or subsurface contamination may lower the reflectance at the extreme upper and lower ends of the spectral range. The material is also highly [[Lambertian_reflectance|lambertian]] at wavelengths from 257&amp;nbsp;nm to 10600&amp;nbsp;nm, although reflectivity decreases at wavelengths beyond the near infrared. Spectralon exhibits absorbances at 2800&amp;nbsp;nm, then absorbs strongly (&lt;20% reflectance) from 5400 to 8000&amp;nbsp;nm. Although the diffused reflectance has been shown to increase overall laser efficiency, the material has a fairly low damage threshold of 4 [[joules]] per square centimeter, limiting its use to lower powered applications.&lt;ref name="photonicsonline"&gt;http://www.photonicsonline.com/download.mvc/Optimization-Of-Spectralon-Through-Numerical-0002&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lambertian reflectance]] arises from the material's surface and immediate subsurface structure. The porous network of thermoplastic produces multiple reflections in the first few tenths of a millimeter. Spectralon can partially depolarize the light it reflects, but this effect decreases at high incidence angles.&lt;ref&gt;''Optical system design'' By Robert Edward Fischer, Biljana Tadic-Galeb, Paul R. Yoder - McGraw-Hill 2008 Page 534&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is extremely hydrophobic, this open structure readily absorbs non-polar solvents, greases and oils. Impurities are difficult to remove from Spectralon; thus, the material should be kept free from contaminants to maintain its reflectance properties.

The material has a hardness roughly equal to that of [[high-density polyethylene]] and is thermally stable to &gt;&amp;nbsp;350&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Georgiev/&gt; It is chemically inert to all but the most powerful bases such as [[sodium amide]] and organo-sodium or lithium compounds. The material is extremely [[hydrophobic]].&lt;ref name=Georgiev/&gt; Gross contamination of the material or marring of the optical surface can be remedied by sanding under a stream of running water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systems-eng.co.jp/products/refrector/img/spectralon_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This surface refinishing both restores the original topography of the surface and returns the material to its original reflectance. Weathering tests on the material show no damage upon exposure to atmospheric UV flux. The material shows no sign of optical or physical degradation after long-term immersion testing in sea water.

== Applications ==

Three grades of Spectralon reflectance material are available: optical grade, laser grade and space grade. Optical-grade Spectralon is characterized by a high reflectance and Lambertian behavior and is primarily used as a reference standard or target for calibration of spectrophotometers. Laser-grade Spectralon offers the same physical characteristics as optical-grade material but is a different formulation of resin that gives enhanced performance when used in laser pump cavities. Spectralon is used in a variety of "side pumped" lasers.&lt;ref name="photonicsonline" /&gt; Space-grade Spectralon combines high reflectance with an extremely lambertian reflectance profile and is used for terrestrial [[remote sensing]] applications.

Spectralon's optical properties make it ideal as a reference surface in remote sensing and spectroscopy. For instance, it is used to obtain [[leaf reflectance]] and [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) in the laboratory. It can also be applied to obtain [[vegetation fluorescence]] using the [[Fraunhofer lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Evain S, Flexas J, Moya I | title=A new instrument for passive remote sensing: 2. Measurement of leaf and canopy reflectance changes at 531&amp;nbsp;nm and their relationship with photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence | journal=Remote Sensing of Environment | year=2004 | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=175–185 | doi=10.1016/j.rse.2004.03.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Basically Spectralon allows removing the contributions in the emitted light that are not directly linked to the surface (leaf) properties but to geometrical factors.

The '''Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing''' is a major [[Electric power transmission|electrical power line]] built across the [[Suez Canal]] in 1998, located near [[Suez]], [[Egypt]]. It is designed for two 500 kV circuits.

Because the required clearance over the Suez Canal is {{convert|152|m|ft}}, the overhead line has two {{convert|221|m|ft}} high [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s (one on either side of the crossing) in spite of its small span width of {{convert|600|m|ft}}.  The pylons each have four crossarms: three for the [[conductor (material)|conductor]]s and one for catching the conductors in case of an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] string failure.

==Significant developments in the region==
The crossing was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the [[Suez Canal]], including other projects such as the [[Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel]] under the Suez Canal (completed in 1981), the [[El Ferdan Railway Bridge]], and the [[Suez Canal Bridge]] (completed in 2001).

It was constructed by a consortium between STFA Enerkom and [[Siemens]].&lt;ref&gt;http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=83301&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">A '''tapered element oscillating microbalance''' ('''TEOM''') is an instrument used for real-time [[Particle counter|detection of aerosol particles]] by measuring their mass concentration. It makes use of a small vibrating glass tube whose oscillation frequency changes when aerosol particles are deposited on it increasing its [[inertia]]. TEOM-based devices have been approved by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for environmental air quality monitoring, and by the U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] for monitoring [[coal dust]] exposure for miners to prevent several respiratory diseases.

== Operation ==
[[File:Tapered element oscillating microbalance diagram static.gif|alt=An diagram showing the airflow through the machine. The air flows from a sampling inlet to a flow splitter, where some of the flow goes to a heated sensor unit containing a tapered element mass transducer connected to an amplifier and frequency counter, while the rest goes to a bypass flowline. Both lines then goe in parallel to in-line filters and mass flow controllers, before rejoining at a vacuum pump leading to exhaust.|thumb|A diagram showing the operation of a tapered element oscillating microbalance instrument.]]

The TEOM uses a hollow glass tube as a [[microbalance]]. Incoming particles are deposited on a filter at the tip of the tube, and the added mass causes a change in its oscillation frequency which is detected electronically. The element is periodically cycled to return it to its natural frequency. The inlet to the device only allows particles of the desired size range to enter. TEOM devices operate continuously and do not need filter changes as frequently as high-volume air samplers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/monitoring/air-pollution/oscillating-microbalance/|title=Tapered element oscillating microbalance|last=|first=|date=2017-03-27|website=[[Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (Queensland)|Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection]]|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical noise and dramatic temperature fluctuations can interfere with the operation of a TEOM device.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, water droplets cannot be distinguished from particle mass, so the device must adjust the incoming air temperature to cause water droplets to evaporate,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet74.html|title=Machine-Mounted Continuous Respirable Dust Monitor|last=|first=|date=July 1997|website=NIOSH Technology News|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or contain a dryer or humidity sensor to adjust the readings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under ideal conditions, TEOM is just as accurate as the standard reference method, but its sensitivity presents complications for use for environmental monitoring in urban areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A filter dynamic measurement system (FDMS) can be used to adjust for the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] component of the mass. TEOM has poor sensitivity to semi-volatile particles due to the temperature and humidity conditions used. TEOM instruments with FDMS alternate between a base cycle and a reference cycle, the latter of which measures the mass loss of the filter when clean air is passed through it, allowing the mass loss during the base cycle to be estimated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=John Alexander|last2=Loughlin|first2=Susan C.|last3=Font|first3=Anna|last4=Fuller|first4=Gary W.|last5=MacLeod|first5=Alison|last6=Oliver|first6=Ian W.|last7=Jackson|first7=Ben|last8=Horwell|first8=Claire J.|last9=Thordarson|first9=Thor|date=2013-05-24|title=UK monitoring and deposition of tephra from the May 2011 eruption of Grímsvötn, Iceland|url=https://appliedvolc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2191-5040-2-3|journal=Journal of Applied Volcanology|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=|at=[https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2F2191-5040-2-3/MediaObjects/13617_2012_8_MOESM3_ESM.pdf Additional file 3: Detailed air quality monitoring methodology.]|doi=10.1186/2191-5040-2-3|issn=2191-5040|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the air conditioning system not cycle over the same period as the TEOM instrument, because this can cause [[aliasing]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/pm25/sop_project/905505_TEOM_SOP_Draft_Final_Sept09.pdf|title=Standard Operating Procedure for the Continuous Measurement of Particulate Matter|last=Ray|first=Alison E.|last2=Vaughn|first2=David L.|date=2009-09-01|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|at=pp. 1–1, 3-1–3-2, 6-1–6-2|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEOM is the basis for a continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) for [[coal dust]] in mines, to protect workers from exposure to coal mine dust which leads to [[black lung disease]] and [[progressive massive fibrosis]]. Prior to the introduction of CPDMs, dust particles collected on a filter needed to be analyzed in a laboratory, leading to a delay of weeks in obtaining results. Continuous monitoring allows miners to take corrective action such as moving to another area or changing their activities if dust levels exceed exposure limits. In one study this led to a 90% reduction in samples exceeding the dust exposure limit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/02/03/pdm/|title=Continuous Personal Dust Monitor|last=Mischler|first=Steven|last2=Coughanour|first2=Valerie|date=2017-02-03|website=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/features/CPDMhelpsminersavoiddust.html|title=CPDM Helps Coal Miners Avoid Hazardous Dust|last=|first=|date=2016-12-30|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) mandated the use of CPDMs on working sections of underground coal mines, and for workers who have evidence of the development of [[pneumoconiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/training/programs-courses/cpdm/|title=Continuous Personal Dust Monitor (CPDM) Training|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the only CPDM instrument approved by MSHA uses a TEOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/training/programs-courses/cpdm/certified-person-sampling-cpdm-exam-pool.pdf|title=Continuous Personal Dust Monitors (CPDM) Certification Examination Question Pool|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.thermofisher.com/press-release/thermo-scientific/new-personal-dust-monitor-designed-help-reduce-miners-exposure-coal-|title=New Personal Dust Monitor Designed to Help Reduce Miners’ Exposure to Coal Dust|last=|first=|date=2015-03-06|website=Thermo Fisher Scientific eNews|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Teltron-Diffraction-Tube-with-Helmholtz-Coils-and-Stand.jpg|thumb|275px|Teltron deflection tube with [[Helmholtz coils]] and stand]]
A '''teltron tube''' (named for Teltron Inc., which is now owned by 3B Scientific Ltd.) is a type of [[cathode ray tube]] used to demonstrate the properties of [[electrons]].  There were several different types made by Teltron including a diode, a triode, a Maltese Cross tube, a simple deflection tube with a fluorescent screen, and one which could be used to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edulab.com/prod/teltron-electron-deflection-tube-d#body|title=Teltron Electron Deflection Tube D|website=Edulab|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two contained an electron gun with deflecting plates.  The beams can be bent by applying voltages to various electrodes in the tube or by holding a magnet  close by.  The electron beams are visible as fine bluish lines.  This is accomplished by filling the tube with low pressure [[helium]] (He) or [[Hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas.  A few of the electrons in the beam collide with the helium atoms, causing them to [[fluoresce]] and emit light.

They are usually used to teach electromagnetic effects because they show how an electron beam is affected by [[electric field]]s and by [[magnetic field]]s like the [[Lorentz force]].

==Motions in fields==
Charged particles in a uniform electric field follow a [[parabolic trajectory]], since the [[electric field]] term (of the [[Lorentz force]] which acts on the particle) is the product of the particle's charge and the magnitude of the electric field, (oriented in the direction of the electric field).  In a uniform magnetic field however, charged particles follow a circular trajectory due to the [[cross product]] in the [[magnetic field]] term of the Lorentz force. (That is, the force from the magnetic field acts on the particle in a direction perpendicular to the particle's direction of motion. See: [[Lorentz force]] for more details.)

==Apparatus==
The 'teltron' apparatus consists of a Teltron type electron deflection tube, a Teltron stand, [[High voltage|EHT]] power supply ({{nowrap|0 - 5000 V DC}}, variable).

==Experimental setup==
[[Image:Fadenstrahlrohr Versuchsaufbau.svg|thumb|220px|Experimental sketch fine beam]]
In an evacuated glass bulb some [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is filled, so that the tube has a hydrogen atmosphere at low pressure of about {{nowrap|1 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]}} is formed. The pressure is such that the electrons are decelerated by collisions as little as possible (change in kinetic energy), the number of collisions are few but sufficient to emit visible light. Inside the bulb there is an [[electron gun]]. This consists of a heating spiral, a cathode and an anode hole. From the [[cathode]] ('''-''') electrons are emitted and accelerated by the electric field towards the positively charged anode ('''+'''). Through a hole in the anode, the electrons leave the beam forming system and the [[Wehnelt cylinder]] bundles.

==Results==
[[Image:Cyclotron motion wider view.jpg|thumb|Another experimental setup showing the electron beam orbit]]
When the heater is energized, the heating coil will cause electrons to emerge from it due to [[thermionic emission]]. In the [[electric field]] between anode and cathode, the electric field acts on the electrons, which accelerate to a high velocity, such that the electrons leave through a small opening in the anode as an electron beam. Only when the coil current is turned on will a force act on the beam and change its direction. Otherwise it will retain its velocity. If, however, the [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] current is switched on, the [[Lorentz force]] will direct the electrons into a circular orbit.

==Determination of the specific electron charge==
[[Image:Fadenstrahlrohr-Versuch.png|thumb|500px|Derivation of the formula to determine the specific charge of the electron with the help of the filament&lt;!--xx--&gt; beam-test]]
The higher the coil current, the stronger magnetic field and thus smaller radius of the circular path of the electrons. The strength of the magnetic field and the [[Lorentz force]] are proportional to each other, such that when the Lorentz force increases. A larger Lorentz force will deflect the electrons more strongly, so the orbit will be smaller. The Lorentz force &lt;math&gt;F_L&lt;/math&gt; is always perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of movement and allows a centripetal &lt;math&gt;F_Z&lt;/math&gt; circular motion. The magnitude of the velocity and hence the kinetic energy can not change:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} F_L &amp;= F_Z\\
e\cdot v\cdot B &amp;= m\cdot\frac{v^2}{r}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we get the amount of specific electron charge

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{m} = \frac{v}{B\cdot r}&lt;/math&gt;

The determination of the velocity is performed using the [[Conservation of energy|energy conservation law]]

:&lt;math&gt;e\cdot U = \frac{1}{2}\cdot m\cdot v^2&lt;/math&gt;

This is finally followed by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{m} = \frac{2 \, U}{r^2\cdot B^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The specific electron charge has the value

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-e}{m} \approx -1{.}7588202 \cdot 10^{11} \, \mathrm{\frac{C}{kg}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[Elementary charge|charge of an electron]] is available from the [[Oil drop experiment|Millikan experiment]], the study of electrons in an magnetic field is the determination of its [[mass]] in accordance with:

:&lt;math&gt;\ m = \frac{e \cdot r^2 \cdot B^2}{2 \, U} \approx 9{.}1094 \cdot 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} &lt;/math&gt;

Similar concepts for the weighing of charged particles can be found in the [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]].

'''Thiocyanate''' (also known as '''rhodanide''') is the anion [SCN]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is the [[conjugate base]] of [[thiocyanic acid]].  Common derivatives include the colourless salts [[potassium thiocyanate]] and [[sodium thiocyanate]].  [[Organic compound]]s containing the [[functional group]] SCN are also called thiocyanates.  [[Mercury(II) thiocyanate]] was formerly used in pyrotechnics.

Thiocyanate is analogous to the [[cyanate]] ion, [OCN]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, wherein [[oxygen]] is replaced by [[sulfur]]. [SCN]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is one of the [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalide]]s, due to the similarity of its reactions to that of [[halide]] ions. Thiocyanate used to be known as rhodanide (from a [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[rose]]) because of the red colour of its complexes with [[iron]].  Thiocyanate is produced by the reaction of elemental sulfur or [[thiosulfate]] with [[cyanide]]:
: 8 CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;  →  8 SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
: CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  {{chem|S|2|O|3|2−}}  →  SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  {{chem|SO|3|2−}}
The second reaction is catalyzed by [[thiosulfate sulfurtransferase]], a hepatic mitochondrial enzyme, and by other sulfur transferases, which together are responsible for around 80% of cyanide metabolism in the body&lt;ref name="Abraham_al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=Klaus|last2=Buhrke|first2=Thorsten|last3=Lampen|first3=Alfonso|title=Bioavailability of cyanide after consumption of a single meal of foods containing high levels of cyanogenic glycosides: a crossover study in humans|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=24 February 2015|volume=90|issue=3|pages=559–574|doi=10.1007/s00204-015-1479-8|pmid=25708890|pmc=4754328}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Organic and transition metal derivatives of the thiocyanate ion can exist as "[[linkage isomer]]s".  In thiocyanates, the organic group (or metal ion) is attached to sulfur:  R−S−C≡N has a S–C single bond and a C≡N triple bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Guy | first = R.

Thiocyanate shares its negative charge approximately equally between [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]]. As a consequence, thiocyanate can act as a [[nucleophile]] at either sulfur or nitrogen&amp;nbsp;— it is an [[Ligand#Ambidentate ligand|ambidentate ligand]]. [SCN]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; can also bridge two (M−SCN−M) or even three metals (&gt;SCN− or −SCN&lt;). Experimental evidence leads to the general conclusion that [[Classes of metals|class A metals]] ([[HSAB theory|hard acids]]) tend to form ''N''-bonded thiocyanate complexes, whereas [[Classes of metals|class B metals]] ([[HSAB theory|soft acids]]) tend to form ''S''-bonded thiocyanate complexes. Other factors, e.g. kinetics and solubility, are sometimes involved, and linkage isomerism can occur, for example [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(NCS)]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(SCN)]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="G&amp;E"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw | page = 326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [SCN]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is added to a solution containing [[ferric|iron(III) ions]] (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), a blood red solution is formed due to the formation of [[thiocyanatoiron| [Fe(SCN)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]].

Similarly, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gives a blue complex with thiocyanate. Both the iron and cobalt complexes can be extracted into organic solvents like diethyl ether or amyl alcohol. This allows the determination of these ions even in strongly coloured solutions. The determination of Co(II) in the presence of Fe(III) is possible by adding KF to the solution, which forms uncoloured, very stable complexes with Fe(III), which no longer react with SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Phospholipids or some detergents aid the transfer of thiocyanatoiron into chlorinated solvents like chloroform and can be determined in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=J.C.|title=Colorimetric determination of phospholipids with ammonium ferrothiocyanate|journal=Anal.

{{hatnote|Not to be confused with the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan]], a Chinese tourist site.}}
The location of the '''tomb of [[Genghis Khan]]''' (died August 18th, 1227) has been the object of much speculation and research. The site remains undiscovered.

== Historical accounts ==

Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings or any sign. After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in the [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]]. According to one legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything that crossed their path, in order to conceal where he was finally buried.&lt;ref&gt;This legend is frequently recounted. {{Cite book|author=Weatherford, Jack|year=2005|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|location=New York|publisher=Crown Publishing|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=A8Y9B5uHQcAC&amp;pg=PR21 ''xxi'']|isbn=978-0-609-61062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tomb was completed, the slaves who built it were massacred, and then the soldiers who killed them were also killed.&lt;ref name="lost"&gt;''Lost Histories'' by Joel Levy. Published by Vision Paperbacks, London: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-7394-8013-7}}. pages 172-179.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] is his memorial, but not his burial site. Folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find (echoing the manner of burial of the Sumerian King [[Gilgamesh]] of Uruk or of the Visigoth leader [[Alaric I|Alaric]]).&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, that trees were then planted over the site, and that the permafrost also played its part in the hiding of the burial site.&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; The ''[[Erdeni Tobchi]]'' (1662) claims that Genghis Khan's coffin may have been empty when it arrived in Mongolia. Similarly, the ''[[Altan Tobchi]]'' (1604) maintains that only his shirt, tent and boots were buried in the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] (Ratchnevsky, p.&amp;nbsp;143f.).
Turnbull (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24) tells another legend in which the grave was re-discovered 30 years after Genghis Khan's death. According to this tale, a young camel was buried with the Khan, and the camel's mother was later found weeping at the grave of its young.

[[Marco Polo]] wrote that, even by the late 13th century, the Mongols did not know the location of the tomb. ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' has the year of Genghis Khan's death but no information concerning his burial.  In the "Travels of Marco Polo" he writes that "It has been an invariable custom, that all the grand khans, and chiefs of the race of Genghis-khan, should be carried for interment to a certain lofty mountain named Altaï, and in whatever place they may happen to die, although it should be at the distance of a hundred days' journey, they are nevertheless conveyed thither."

Marco Polo writes of Genghis Khan's death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Travels of Marco Polo Book 1 Chapter 50|author=Marco Polo|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|text=But at the end of those six years he went against a certain castle that was called CAAJU, and there he was shot with an arrow in the knee, so that he died. A great pity it was, for he was a valiant man and very wise.|sign=[[Marco Polo]]|source=''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', Book 1, Chapter 50}}

Other sources name the area of the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain as his burial site (roughly {{coord|48.5|N|108.7|E|}}). The area near the Burkhan Khaldun was called the [[Ikh Khorig]], or Great Taboo. This 240 square-kilometre area was sealed off by the Mongols, with trespassing being punishable by death. Only within the last 20 years has the area been open to Western [[archaeologists]]. 

According to the tradition of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the part of the [[Mongol empire]] that ruled over China, all the great khans of Mongols are buried around the area of Genghis Khan's tomb. The site's name in Chinese was Qinian valley ({{lang|zh|起輦谷}}). However, the concrete location of the valley is never mentioned in any documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Yuan|last=Song|first=Lian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search ==
There were rumours concerning a standard containing clues to the site that had been removed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery in 1937, and rumours concerning a curse leading to the death of two French archaeologists (comparable to the curse of the tomb of [[Tamerlane]], [[Gur-e Amir]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On 6 October 2004, Genghis Khan's palace was discovered, which may make it possible to find his burial site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6189531/|title=Remains of Genghis Khan palace unearthed|date=2004-10-06|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur archaeologist Maury Kravitz dedicated 40 years to his search for the tomb. In a 15th-century account of a French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], he found a reference to an early battle where Genghis Khan, at the time still known as Temüjin, won a decisive victory.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} According to this source, he selected the confluence of the [[Kherlen]] and "Bruchi" rivers, with Burkhan Khaldun over his right shoulder, and after his victory, Temüjin said that this place would be forever his favourite. Kravitz, convinced that Temüjin's grave would be near that battlefield, attempted to find the "Bruchi" river, which turned out to be unknown to cartographers. He did, however, discover a [[toponym]]; "Baruun Bruch" ("West ''Bruch''") in the area in question and as of 2006 was conducting excavations there, roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km east of the Burkhan Khaldun ({{coord|48|N|110|E|}}, the wider area of [[Bayanbulag]]). Maury Kravitz died in 2012, without finding the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-05/news/ct-met-kravitz-obit-20120805_1_maury-kravitz-grave-site-mongolian-empire |title=Maury Kravitz, led Mongolian expeditions in search of Genghis Khan's grave site, dies |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their protection of a region of Mongolia through investigation earned him the ''[[National Geographic Adventure (magazine)|National Geographic Adventure]]'' magazine’s “2010 Readers Choice Adventurer of the Year.”

In January 2015 the University of California, San Diego set up a project asking anyone interested to tag potential sites of the burial through images taken from space. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/searching-genghis-khans-lost-tomb-space-1482370/|title=Searching for Genghis Khan's lost tomb from space | date=2015-01-07 | author=Hannah Osborne | publisher=International Business Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New searches are being conducted by using drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.yahoo.com/news/genghis-khan-tomb-mysterious-gruesome-145408461.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!]] News|title=Genghis Khan’s Tomb: The mysterious and gruesome story behind infamous leader’s ‘missing’ grave }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, two expeditions led by French archeologist [[Pierre-Henri Giscard]]&lt;ref&gt;http://institutdesdeserts.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, a specialist in Mongolian archeology, and Raphaël Hautefort, a specialist in scientific imaging, around the [[Khentii mountains]] (North East of Mongolia) support the theory of a tumulus at the top of the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain. Their non-invasive analysis, carried out with drones&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bienpublic.com/edition-dijon-ville/2018/09/13/dijon-des-drones-pour-localiser-la-tombe-de-gengis-khan&lt;/ref&gt;, shows that the 250m-long tumulus is of human origin and probably built on the model of the Chinese imperial tombs present in Xi'an. In addition, the expedition notes that this mound is still the subject of religious rites and pilgrimages of the surrounding population.{{Sfn|Robion|2016|id=Robion2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://television.telerama.fr/tele/programmes-tv/la-tombe-de-gengis-khan-le-secret-devoile,109777961.php| title=La Tombe de Gengis Khan, le secret dévoilé (critique)|date=10 December 2016|author=Yohav Oremiatzki|work=television.telerama.fr|access-date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition did not give rise to any scientific publication by Pierre-Henri Giscard because it was made without authorization, and without informing local authorities. Indeed, besides the fact that the access to the area around Burkhan Khaldun is strictly controlled, the sacredness of the tomb for the Mongolian government and the population makes it impossible to explore&lt;ref&gt;https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/la-tete-au-carre/la-tete-au-carre-13-septembre-2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.france.tv/documentaires/histoire/690017-la-tombe-de-gengis-khan-le-secret-devoile.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Asbestos garage.jpg|thumb|right|An example of cement-asbestos corrugated and board products, possibly transite.]]
'''Transite''' originated as a [[brand]] that [[Johns-Manville]] created in 1929 for a line of [[asbestos]]-[[cement]] products, including boards and pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbestos.net/exposure/products/construction/transite#top|title=Asbestos in Transite|work=Asbestos.net|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar asbestos-cement products, and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof [[composite material]], [[fibre cement]] boards, typically used in wall construction. It can also be found in insulation, [[siding]], roof gutters, and cement wallboard. The more prevalent transite found in wall construction and roofing tiles for example, will last anywhere from 50 years to over 100 years.

The use of asbestos to manufacture transite was phased out in the 1980s. Previously transite was made of cement, with varying amounts (12-50%) of asbestos fiber to provide [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] (similar to the [[steel]] in [[reinforced concrete]]), and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://retrofitmagazine.com/transite/|title = Transite Roofing: Friend or Foe? - retrofit|date = 2013-04-30|website = retrofit|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, [[soffit]] and [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]] panels, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s.  Other uses included roof drain piping, water piping, sanitary sewer drain piping, laboratory fume hood panels, ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases [[carcinogen]]ic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor. Despite asbestos-containing transite being phased out, it is still not banned in the United States; some 230,000 deaths have been attributed to it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public.

The transite that is produced today is made without asbestos. Transite HT and Transite 1000 are currently available fiber cement boards that contain no asbestos. Instead they contain [[Silicon dioxide|crystalline silica]], which the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] has classified as being carcinogenic to humans (Class 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/crystalline-factsheet.pdf|title = Crystalline Silica Exposure Health Hazard Information|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystalline silica is also known to cause [[silicosis]], a non-cancerous lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.silica-safe.org/ask-a-question/faq|title = Frequently Asked Questions - Silica Safe|website = www.silica-safe.org|access-date = 2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4531">The '''United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot''' (UNHRD) is an international network of six humanitarian support hubs located strategically around the world, that provide supply chain solutions to the international humanitarian community. The hubs are located in [[Brindisi]] (Italy), [[Dubai]] (UAE), [[Accra]] (Ghana), [[Panama City]] (Panama), [[Kuala Lumpur]] (Malaysia) and [[Las Palmas]] (Spain).

It is managed by the [[World Food Programme]] and currently serves 86 partners, such us UN organizations, Government agencies and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It enables these partners to assist people affected by natural disasters or other complex emergencies by prepositioning vital relief items and allowing them to be dispatched rapidly to critical areas. In addition, the UNHRD network offers services and knowledge that allow various humanitarian partners to fulfill their missions rapidly and effectively.

==Background==

Today’s UNHRD Network dates back to an initiative by the Italian government in the mid-80s: to pre-position relief items and support equipment for humanitarian operations at its military airport facilities. Expanding on the success of this method and envisioning a global network, WFP transformed the humanitarian depot into a logistic hub for emergency preparedness and response. In line with the [[Reform of the United Nations|United Nations Reforms]] for better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures, UNHRD enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance, with the specific mandate to ‘assist the population living in countries affected by natural disasters or complex emergencies, through a prepositioning of relief and survival items and their rapid demobilization to the affected countries.’

== History ==
The original UNHRD depot was inaugurated in Brindisi in the year 2000 to replace the United Nations Supply Depot (UNSD) in Pisa, then managed by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA). Upon decision of the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) the mandate to provide rapid and accessible stockpiling and demobilisation services to partners inside and outside the United Nations was transferred from OCHA to WFP. Subsequently, the hub was moved to the [[Brindisi Airport|military airport at Brindisi]] in an effort to set up a new and robust logistics platform, available to all partners as a “shared resource”.

In 2006, based on its own requirements and that of its partners, WFP replicated the successful Brindisi model by setting up further emergency response facilities in strategic locations worldwide, creating a network of HRDs in Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and Latin America. Each of these locations has been selected to provide easy access to an airport, port and road systems, making access to a wide range of transportation methods available and allowing for consistently low response times of 24-48 hours.

==Functions==

When Governments, UN agencies and NGOs look to respond quickly and efficiently to a disaster, they call on emergency supplies that are immediately available in UNHRD warehouses. By prepositioning relief items, the humanitarian community can support affected people at the very beginning of an emergency, often saving lives within the first 24 – 48 hours.
UNHRD offers a range of supply chain solutions to relief organizations around the globe, acting as a ‘one-stop shop’ to its partners for storage, procurement, transport, handling, stock borrowing, technical field assistance and training centre facilities.

==Figures==

Originally, five humanitarian organisations relied on the UNHRD Network, including WFP itself. This number has since grown to 86 in 2017. Partner organisations that join the network are diverse, spanning UN agencies, governmental and non-governmental organisations.

In 2017, the UNHRD Network managed 575 shipments in 95 countries supporting 36 partners in responding to humanitarian emergencies, including [[Hurricane Irma]], [[Rohingya refugee crisis|Rohingya Refugees Crisis]] in Bangladesh and South Sudanes Refugee Crisis in Uganda.
