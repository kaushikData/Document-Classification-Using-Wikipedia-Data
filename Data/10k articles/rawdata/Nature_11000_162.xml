This example discusses the general principle using [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] as a specific example.  A white beam [[light source|source]] – emitting light of multiple [[wavelength]]s – is focused on a sample (the [[complementary color]] pairs are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, [[photons]] that match the energy gap of the [[molecule]]s present (green light in this example) are ''absorbed'' in order to excite the molecule.  Other photons transmit unaffected and, if the radiation is in the visible region (400-700nm), the sample color is the complementary color of the absorbed light.  By comparing the [[attenuation]] of the transmitted light with the incident, an absorption spectrum can be obtained.]]

'''Absorption spectroscopy''' refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]], as a function of [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[Absorption spectroscopy#Absorption spectrum|absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Absorption spectroscopy is employed as an [[chemical analysis|analytical chemistry]] tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and, in many cases, to quantify the amount of the substance present. [[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared]] and [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]] are particularly common in analytical applications. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in studies of molecular and atomic physics, astronomical spectroscopy and remote sensing.

There are a wide range of experimental approaches for measuring absorption spectra. The most common arrangement is to direct a generated beam of radiation at a sample and detect the intensity of the radiation that passes through it. The transmitted energy can be used to calculate the absorption. The source, sample arrangement and detection technique vary significantly depending on the frequency range and the purpose of the experiment.

A material's absorption spectrum is the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the material over a range of frequencies. The absorption spectrum is primarily determined&lt;ref&gt;Modern Spectroscopy (Paperback)
by J. Michael Hollas {{ISBN|978-0-470-84416-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmetry and Spectroscopy: An Introduction to Vibrational and Electronic Spectroscopy (Paperback)
by Daniel C. Harris, Michael D. Bertolucci {{ISBN|978-0-486-66144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spectra of Atoms and Molecules by Peter F. Bernath {{ISBN|978-0-19-517759-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition of the material. Radiation is more likely to be absorbed at frequencies that match the energy difference between two [[quantum state|quantum mechanical states]] of the molecules. The absorption that occurs due to a transition between two states is referred to as an [[spectral line|absorption line]] and a spectrum is typically composed of many lines.

The frequencies where absorption lines occur, as well as their relative intensities, primarily depend on the [[electronic structure|electronic]] and [[molecular structure]] of the sample. The frequencies will also depend on the interactions between molecules in the sample, the [[crystal|crystal structure]] in solids, and on several environmental factors (e.g., [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[electric field|electromagnetic field]]). The lines will also have a [[spectral linewidth|width]] and [[spectral line#Spectral line broadening and shift|shape]] that are primarily determined by the [[spectral density]] or the [[density of states]] of the system.

===Theory===
Absorption lines are typically classified by the nature of the quantum mechanical change induced in the molecule or atom. [[Rotational spectroscopy|Rotational lines]], for instance, occur when the rotational state of a molecule is changed. Rotational lines are typically found in the microwave spectral region. [[Vibrational spectroscopy|Vibrational lines]] correspond to changes in the vibrational state of the molecule and are typically found in the infrared region. Electronic lines correspond to a change in the electronic state of an atom or molecule and are typically found in the visible and ultraviolet region. X-ray absorptions are associated with the excitation of [[Electronic structure#Shells and subshells|inner shell]] electrons in atoms. These changes can also be combined (e.g. [[rovibrational coupling|rotation-vibration transitions]]), leading to new absorption lines at the combined energy of the two changes.

The energy associated with the quantum mechanical change primarily determines the frequency of the absorption line but the frequency can be shifted by several types of interactions. Electric and magnetic fields can cause a shift. Interactions with neighboring molecules can cause shifts. For instance, absorption lines of the gas phase molecule can shift significantly when that molecule is in a liquid or solid phase and interacting more strongly with neighboring molecules.

The width and shape of absorption lines are determined by the instrument used for the observation, the material absorbing the radiation and the physical environment of that material. It is common for lines to have the shape of a [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] or [[Lorentzian distribution|Lorentzian]] distribution. It is also common for a line to be described solely by its intensity and [[spectral linewidth|width]] instead of the entire shape being characterized.

The integrated intensity—obtained by [[integral|integrating]] the area under the absorption line—is proportional to the amount of the absorbing substance present. The intensity is also related to the temperature of the substance and the quantum mechanical interaction between the radiation and the absorber. This interaction is quantified by the [[transition moment]] and depends on the particular lower state the transition starts from, and the upper state it is connected to.

The width of absorption lines may be determined by the [[spectrometer]] used to record it. A spectrometer has an inherent limit on how narrow a line it can [[spectral resolution|resolve]] and so the observed width may be at this limit. If the width is larger than the resolution limit, then it is primarily determined by the environment of the absorber. A liquid or solid absorber, in which neighboring molecules strongly interact with one another, tends to have broader absorption lines than a gas. Increasing the temperature or pressure of the absorbing material will also tend to increase the line width. It is also common for several neighboring transitions to be close enough to one another that their lines overlap and the resulting overall line is therefore broader yet.

===Relation to transmission spectrum===
Absorption and transmission spectra represent equivalent information and one can be calculated from the other through a mathematical transformation. A transmission spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is weakest because more light is transmitted through the sample. An absorption spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is strongest.

===Relation to emission spectrum===
[[Image:Emission spectrum-Fe.png|thumb|400px|&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Emission spectrum of [[iron]]&lt;/span&gt;]]

[[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] is a process by which a substance releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Emission can occur at any frequency at which absorption can occur, and this allows the absorption lines to be determined from an emission spectrum. The [[emission spectrum]] will typically have a quite different intensity pattern from the absorption spectrum, though, so the two are not equivalent. The absorption spectrum can be calculated from the emission spectrum using appropriate theoretical models and additional information about the quantum mechanical states of the substance. {{citation_needed|date=August 2016}}

===Relation to scattering and reflection spectra===
The scattering and reflection spectra of a material are influenced by both its [[index of refraction]] and its absorption spectrum. In an optical context, the absorption spectrum is typically quantified by the [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], and the extinction and index coefficients are quantitatively related through the [[Kramers-Kronig relation]]. Therefore, the absorption spectrum can be derived from a scattering or reflection spectrum. This typically requires simplifying assumptions or models, and so the derived absorption spectrum is an approximation.

==Applications==
[[Image:Identification of Ices in the Solar System.jpg|thumb|300px|The infrared absorption spectrum of NASA laboratory [[sulfur dioxide]] ice is compared with the infrared absorption spectra of ices on [[Jupiter]]'s moon, '''[[Io (moon)|Io]]''' credit NASA, Bernard Schmitt, and [[UKIRT]].]]

Absorption spectroscopy is useful in chemical analysis&lt;ref&gt;James D. Ingle, Jr. and Stanley R. Crouch, ''Spectrochemical Analysis'', Prentice Hall, 1988, {{ISBN|0-13-826876-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its specificity and its quantitative nature. The specificity of absorption spectra allows compounds to be distinguished from one another in a mixture, making absorption spectroscopy useful in wide variety of applications. For instance, [[Infrared gas analyzer]]s can be used to identify the presence of pollutants in the air, distinguishing the pollutant from nitrogen, oxygen, water and other expected constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/apti/course422/ce4b4.html |title=Gaseous Pollutants – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy |accessdate=2009-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023233506/http://www.epa.gov/apti/course422/ce4b4.html |archivedate=2012-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specificity also allows unknown samples to be identified by comparing a measured spectrum with a library of reference spectra. In many cases, it is possible to determine qualitative information about a sample even if it is not in a library. Infrared spectra, for instance, have characteristics absorption bands that indicate if carbon-hydrogen or carbon-oxygen bonds are present.

An absorption spectrum can be quantitatively related to the amount of material present using the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. Determining the absolute concentration of a compound requires knowledge of the compound's [[absorption coefficient]]. The absorption coefficient for some compounds is available from reference sources, and it can also be determined by measuring the spectrum of a calibration standard with a known concentration of the target.

===Remote sensing===

One of the unique advantages of spectroscopy as an analytical technique is that measurements can be made without bringing the instrument and sample into contact. Radiation that travels between a sample and an instrument will contain the spectral information, so the measurement can be made [[remote sensing|remotely]]. Remote spectral sensing is valuable in many situations. For example, measurements can be made in toxic or hazardous environments without placing an operator or instrument at risk. Also, sample material does not have to be brought into contact with the instrument—preventing possible cross contamination.

Remote spectral measurements present several challenges compared to laboratory measurements. The space in between the sample of interest and the instrument may also have spectral absorptions. These absorptions can mask or confound the absorption spectrum of the sample. These background interferences may also vary over time. The source of radiation in remote measurements is often an environmental source, such as sunlight or the thermal radiation from a warm object, and this makes it necessary to distinguish spectral absorption from changes in the source spectrum.

To simplify these challenges, [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy]] has gained some popularity, as it focusses on differential absorption features and omits broad-band absorption such as aerosol extinction and extinction due to rayleigh scattering. This method is applied to ground-based, air-borne and satellite based measurements. Some ground-based methods provide the possibility to retrieve tropospheric and stratospheric trace gas profiles.

===Astronomy===

[[Image:Cumulative-absorption-spectrum-hubble-telescope.jpg|thumb|Absorption spectrum observed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]|400px|right]]

[[Astronomical spectroscopy]] is a particularly significant type of remote spectral sensing. In this case, the objects and samples of interest are so distant from earth that electromagnetic radiation is the only means available to measure them. Astronomical spectra contain both absorption and emission spectral information. Absorption spectroscopy has been particularly important for understanding [[interstellar clouds]] and determining that some of them contain [[molecular cloud|molecules]]. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in the study of [[extrasolar planets]]. Detection of extrasolar planets by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]] also measures their absorption spectrum and allows for the determination of the planet's atmospheric composition,&lt;ref name="Khd"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khalafinejad |first=S. |last2=Essen |first2=C. von |last3=Hoeijmakers |first3=H.

===Atomic and molecular physics===

Theoretical models, principally [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] models, allow for the absorption spectra of atoms and molecules to be related to other physical properties such as [[electronic structure]], [[atomic mass|atomic]] or [[molecular mass]], and [[molecular geometry]]. Therefore, measurements of the absorption spectrum are used to determine these other properties. [[Microwave spectroscopy]], for example, allows for the determination of bond lengths and angles with high precision.

In addition, spectral measurements can be used to determine the accuracy of theoretical predictions. For example, the [[Lamb shift]] measured in the [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen]] atomic absorption spectrum was not expected to exist at the time it was measured. Its discovery spurred and guided the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]], and measurements of the Lamb shift are now used to determine the [[fine-structure constant]].

==Experimental methods==

===Basic approach===

The most straightforward approach to absorption spectroscopy is to generate radiation with a source, measure a reference spectrum of that radiation with a [[photodetector|detector]] and then re-measure the sample spectrum after placing the material of interest in between the source and detector. The two measured spectra can then be combined to determine the material's absorption spectrum. The sample spectrum alone is not sufficient to determine the absorption spectrum because it will be affected by the experimental conditions—the spectrum of the source, the absorption spectra of other materials in between the source and detector and the wavelength dependent characteristics of the detector. The reference spectrum will be affected in the same way, though, by these experimental conditions and therefore the combination yields the absorption spectrum of the material alone.

A wide variety of radiation sources are employed in order to cover the electromagnetic spectrum. For spectroscopy, it is generally desirable for a source to cover a broad swath of wavelengths in order to measure a broad region of the absorption spectrum. Some sources inherently emit a broad spectrum. Examples of these include [[globar]]s or other [[black body]] sources in the infrared, [[mercury lamp]]s in the visible and ultraviolet and [[x-ray tube]]s. One recently developed, novel source of broad spectrum radiation is [[synchrotron radiation]] which covers all of these spectral regions. Other radiation sources generate a narrow spectrum but the emission wavelength can be tuned to cover a spectral range. Examples of these include [[klystron]]s in the microwave region and [[laser]]s across the infrared, visible and ultraviolet region (though not all lasers have tunable wavelengths).

The detector employed to measure the radiation power will also depend on the wavelength range of interest. Most detectors are sensitive to a fairly broad spectral range and the sensor selected will often depend more on the sensitivity and noise requirements of a given measurement. Examples of detectors common in spectroscopy include [[heterodyne receiver]]s in the microwave, [[bolometer]]s in the millimeter-wave and infrared, [[mercury cadmium telluride]] and other cooled [[semiconductor]] detectors in the infrared, and [[photodiode]]s and [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] in the visible and ultraviolet.

If both the source and the detector cover a broad spectral region, then it is also necessary to introduce a means of [[spectral resolution|resolving]] the wavelength of the radiation in order to determine the spectrum. Often a [[spectrometer#Spectrographs|spectrograph]] is used to spatially separate the wavelengths of radiation so that the power at each wavelength can be measured independently. It is also common to employ [[interferometer|interferometry]] to determine the spectrum—[[Infrared spectroscopy#FTIR|Fourier transform infrared]] spectroscopy is a widely used implementation of this technique.

Two other issues that must be considered in setting up an absorption spectroscopy experiment include the [[optics]] used to direct the radiation and the means of holding or containing the sample material (called a [[cuvette]] or cell). For most UV, visible, and NIR measurements the use of precision quartz cuvettes are necessary. In both cases, it is important to select materials that have relatively little absorption of their own in the wavelength range of interest. The absorption of other materials could interfere with or mask the absorption from the sample. For instance, in several wavelength ranges it is necessary to measure the sample under [[vacuum]] or in a [[rare gas]] environment because gases in the [[earth's atmosphere#Composition|atmosphere]] have interfering absorption features.

If you should find yourself with a monkey or ape on your hands and no knowledge of what to do with it, Buck tells co-author [[Carol Weld]], just treat it like a child. And the elephant, like a man in the tropics, needs a sheltered siesta in mid-afternoon because he is susceptible to sunstroke. Monkeys pick up human ways and copy them. But you should never, never trust a tiger, any more than you should trust a crocodile.&lt;ref&gt;But Never, Never Trust a Tiger. New York Times. Feb 4, 1940, p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
"Buck describes the animals in their native haunts, the capture of some of them, their characteristics, and their reactions in captivity...filled with adventure and odd bits of animal lore." Booklist 36:170 Jan 1, 1940&lt;br&gt;
"The vast legion of Frank Buck's followers will find ''Animals Are Like That'' thoroughly
enjoyable and instructive reading. When the author doesn't know the answer to some more intangible animal trait he frankly admits his deficiency; but this happens infrequently. Mr. Buck has selected a large number of excellent illustrations..."
Springfield Republican p10 Nov 29, 1939&lt;br&gt;

A '''Bloch wave''' (also called '''Bloch state''' or '''Bloch function''' or '''Bloch [[wavefunction]]'''), named after Swiss [[physicist]] [[Felix Bloch]], is a type of [[wavefunction]] for a particle in a periodically-repeating environment, most commonly an [[electron]] in a [[crystal]]. A wavefunction ψ is a Bloch wave if it has the form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kittel| title=Introduction to Solid State Physics|publisher=Wiley|location= New York|year=1996| first1=Charles|isbn= 0-471-14286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} u(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is position, ψ is the Bloch wave, ''u'' is a [[periodic function]] with the same periodicity as the crystal, '''k''' is a vector of real numbers called the [[crystal momentum|crystal wave vector]], ''e'' is [[E (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]], and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. In other words, if we multiply a [[plane wave]] by a periodic function, we get a Bloch wave.

Bloch waves are important because of [[#Proof of Bloch's theorem|'''Bloch's theorem''']], which states that the [[energy eigenstate]]s for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the electron wave functions in a crystal have a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] consisting entirely of Bloch wave energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of [[electronic band structure]]s.

These Bloch wave energy eigenstates are written with subscripts as ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n'' '''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is a discrete index, called the ''[[energy band|band]] index'', which is present because there are many different Bloch waves with the same '''k''' (each has a different periodic component ''u''). Within a band (i.e., for fixed ''n''), ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n'' '''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; varies continuously with '''k''', as does its energy. Also, for any [[reciprocal lattice]] vector '''K''', ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n'' '''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n'',('''k'''+'''K''')&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for '''k'''-values within the first [[Brillouin zone]] of the reciprocal lattice.

==Applications and consequences==

===Applicability===
The most common example of Bloch's theorem is describing electrons in a crystal. However, a Bloch-wave description applies more generally to any wave-like phenomenon in a periodic medium.  For example, a periodic [[dielectric]] in [[electromagnetism]] leads to [[photonic crystal]]s, and a periodic acoustic medium leads to [[phononic crystal]]s. It is generally treated in the various forms of the [[dynamical theory of diffraction]].

===Meaning and non-uniqueness of the parameter k===
[[File:BlochWaves1D.svg|thumb|right|400px|A Bloch wave (bottom) can be broken up into the product of a periodic function (top) and a plane-wave (center). The left side and right side represent the same Bloch wave broken up in two different ways, involving the wave vector ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (left) or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right). The difference (''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[reciprocal lattice]] vector. In all plots, blue is real part and red is imaginary part.]]

Suppose an electron is in a Bloch state
:&lt;math&gt;\psi ( \mathbf{r} ) = \mathrm{e}^{ \mathrm{i} \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} } u ( \mathbf{r} ) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is periodic with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice. The actual quantum state of the electron is entirely determined by ψ, not '''k''' or ''u'' directly. This is important because '''k''' and ''u'' are ''not'' unique. Specifically, if ψ can be written as above using '''k''', it can ''also'' be written using ('''k''' + '''K'''), where '''K''' is any [[reciprocal lattice|reciprocal lattice vector]] (see figure at right). Therefore, wave vectors that differ by a reciprocal lattice vector are equivalent, in the sense that they characterize the same set of Bloch states.

The [[first Brillouin zone]] is a restricted set of values of '''k''' with the property that no two of them are equivalent, yet every possible '''k''' is equivalent to one (and only one) vector in the first Brillouin zone. Therefore, if we restrict '''k''' to the first Brillouin zone, then every Bloch state has a unique '''k'''. Therefore, the first Brillouin zone is often used to depict all of the Bloch states without redundancy, for example in a [[electronic band structure|band structure]], and it is used for the same reason in many calculations.

When '''k''' is multiplied by the [[reduced Planck's constant]], it equals the electron's [[crystal momentum]]. Related to this, the [[group velocity]] of an electron can be calculated based on how the energy of a Bloch state varies with '''k'''; for more details see [[crystal momentum]].

===Detailed example===
For a detailed example in which the consequences of Bloch's theorem are worked out in a specific situation, see the article: [[Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential)]].

==Proof of Bloch's theorem==
Next, we prove Bloch's theorem:
::''For electrons in a perfect crystal, there is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of wavefunctions with the properties:''
::* ''Each of these wavefunctions is an energy eigenstate''
::* ''Each of these wavefunctions is a Bloch wave, meaning that this wavefunction &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form''
::::&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} u(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;
:::''where u has the same periodicity as the atomic structure of the crystal.''

===Preliminaries: Crystal symmetries, lattice, and reciprocal lattice===

The defining property of a crystal is translational symmetry, which means that if the crystal is shifted an appropriate amount, it winds up with all its atoms in the same places. (A finite-size crystal cannot have perfect translational symmetry, but it is a useful approximation.)

A three-dimensional crystal has three ''primitive lattice vectors'' '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If the crystal is shifted by any of these three vectors, or a combination of them of the form
:&lt;math&gt;n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \mathbf{a}_3&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are three integers, then the atoms end up in the same set of locations as they started.

Another helpful ingredient in the proof is the ''[[reciprocal lattice vector]]s''. These are three vectors '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (with units of inverse length), with the property that '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; · '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2π, but '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; · '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 when ''i'' ≠ ''j''. (For the formula for '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, see [[reciprocal lattice vector]].)

===Lemma about translation operators===

Let &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \!&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|translation operator]] that shifts every wave function by the amount {{nowrap|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} (as above, ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are integers). The following fact is helpful for the proof of Bloch's theorem:

::'''Lemma: If a wavefunction ''ψ'' is an [[eigenfunction|eigenstate]] of all of the translation operators (simultaneously), then ''ψ'' is a Bloch wave.'''

'''Proof:''' Assume that we have a wavefunction ''ψ'' which is an eigenstate of all the translation operators. As a special case of this, 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{a}_j) = C_j \psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; 
for ''j'' = 1, 2, 3, where ''C&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are three numbers (the [[eigenvalue]]s) which do not depend on '''r'''. It is helpful to write the numbers ''C&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' in a different form, by choosing three numbers ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with {{nowrap|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''πiθ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''C&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{a}_j) = \mathrm{e}^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} \theta_j} \psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; 
Again, the ''θ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are three numbers which do not depend on '''r'''. Define {{nowrap|'''k''' {{=}} ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[reciprocal lattice vector]]s (see above). Finally, define 
:&lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{r}) = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \psi(\mathbf{r})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt; u(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{a}_j) = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\mathbf{k} \cdot (\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{a}_j)} \psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{a}_j) = \big( \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{a}_j} \big) \big( \mathrm{e}^{2\pi \mathrm{i} \theta_j} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \big) = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} \mathrm{e}^{-2\pi \mathrm{i} \theta_j} \mathrm{e}^{2\pi \mathrm{i} \theta_j} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = u(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.

This proves that ''u'' has the periodicity of the lattice. Since ''ψ''('''r''') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i'' '''k''' · '''r'''&lt;/sup&gt;''u''('''r'''), that proves that the state is a Bloch wave.

===Proof===

Finally, we are ready for the main proof of Bloch's theorem.

As above, let &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \!&lt;/math&gt; denote a ''translation operator'' that shifts every wave function by the amount {{nowrap|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are integers. Because the crystal has translational symmetry, this operator commutes with the [[Hamiltonian operator]]. Moreover, every such translation operator commutes with every other. Therefore, there is a [[Commuting matrices|simultaneous eigenbasis]] of the Hamiltonian operator and every possible &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \!&lt;/math&gt; operator. This basis is what we are looking for. The wavefunctions in this basis are energy eigenstates (because they are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian), and they are also Bloch waves (because they are eigenstates of the translation operators; see Lemma above).

==History and related equations==

The concept of the Bloch state was developed by [[Felix Bloch]] in 1928, to describe the conduction of electrons in crystalline solids.  The same underlying mathematics, however, was also discovered independently several times: by [[George William Hill]] (1877), [[Gaston Floquet]] (1883), and [[Alexander Lyapunov]] (1892).  As a result, a variety of nomenclatures are common: applied to [[ordinary differential equations]], it is called [[Floquet theory]] (or occasionally the ''Lyapunov–Floquet theorem''). The general form of a one-dimensional periodic potential equation is [[Hill differential equation|Hill's equation]]:&lt;ref name=Magnus_Winkler&gt;

where ''f(t)'' is a periodic potential. Specific periodic one-dimensional equations include the [[Kronig–Penney model]] and [[Mathieu function|Mathieu's equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9100">[[File:Waimakariri01 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Waimakariri River]] in the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]] is braided over most of its course]]

A '''braided river''', or '''braided channel''', consists of a network of river [[channel (geography)|channel]]s separated by small, and often temporary, [[island]]s called braid [[Bar (river morphology)|bars]] or, in British usage, ''[[ait]]s'' or ''eyots''. Braided streams occur in rivers with low slope and/or large [[sediment]] load.&lt;ref name=Schumm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schumm|first=S|author2=Kahn, H|title=Experimental Study of Channel Patterns|journal=Bulletin of the Geological Society of America|year=1972|volume=83|issue=6|pages=1755–1770|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[1755:esocp]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braided channels are also typical of environments that dramatically decrease channel depth, and consequently channel velocity, such as  [[river delta]]s, [[alluvial fan]]s, and [[peneplain]]s.

==Formation==
[[File:White River 5965.JPG|thumb|right|The [[White River (Washington)|White River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] transports a large sediment load from the [[Emmons Glacier]] of [[Mount Rainier]], a young, rapidly eroding volcano]]

Braided rivers, as distinct from [[meander]]ing rivers, occur when a threshold level of [[sediment]] load or slope is reached while a steep gradient is also maintained. Geologically speaking, an increase in sediment load over time will increase the slope of the river, so these two conditions may be considered synonymous; and, consequently, a variation of slope can model a variation in sediment load. A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 (ft/ft) for a {{convert|0.15|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} stream with poorly sorted coarse sand.&lt;ref name=Schumm /&gt; Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream, while any slope under the threshold created a [[meander]]ing stream or—for very low slopes—a straight channel. So the main controlling factor on river development is the amount of sediment that the river carries; once a given system crosses a threshold value for sediment load, it will convert from a [[meander]]ing system to a braided system. Also important to channel development is the proportion of [[suspended load]] sediment to [[bed load]]. An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine [[erosion]]-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances, caused a river to shift from a braided to a [[meander]]ing profile.&lt;ref name=Schumm /&gt;
The channels and braid bars are usually highly mobile, with the river layout often changing significantly during [[flood]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hickin |first=E |author2=Sichingabula, H |title=The geomorphic impact of the catastrophic October 1984 flood on the planform of the Squamish River, southwestern British Columbia |journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|year=1988|volume=25|issue=7 |pages=1078–1087|doi=10.1139/e88-105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channels move sideways via differential velocity: On the outside of a curve, deeper, swift water picks up sediment (usually [[gravel]] or larger stones), which is re-deposited in slow-moving water on the inside of a bend.

The braided channels may flow within an area defined by relatively stable banks or may occupy an entire [[valley]] floor. The [[Rakaia River]] in [[Canterbury, New Zealand]] has cut a channel 100 metres wide into the surrounding [[plain]]s; this river transports sediment to a [[lagoon]] located on the river-coast interface.

Conditions associated with braided channel formation include:
* an abundant supply of [[sediment]]&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=D|author2=Harding JS|title=Braided river ecology: a literature review of physical habitats and aquatic invertebrate communities|journal=Science for Conservation|year=2007|issue=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* rapid and frequent variations in water discharge&lt;ref name=Leopold /&gt;
* erodible banks
* a steep channel gradient

However, the critical factor that determines whether a stream will meander or braid is bank [[erodibility]]. A stream with cohesive banks that are resistant to erosion will form narrow, deep, meandering channels, whereas a stream with highly erodible banks will form wide, shallow channels, sustaining helical flow and resulting in the formation of braided channels.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook, Don J. 1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Surface Processes and Landforms|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|author=Easterbrook, Don J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Extensive braided river systems are found in [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]], and the [[Himalayas]], which all contain young, rapidly eroding mountains.

* The enormous [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]-[[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] River in Asia is a classic example of a braided river.&lt;ref name="Catling1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-971-22-0005-2|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Braided rivers vs anastomosing rivers==

[[Anastomosis#Geography|Anastomosing]] rivers or streams are similar to braided rivers in that they consist of multiple interweaving channels. However, anastomosing rivers typically consist of a network of low-gradient, narrow, deep channels with stable banks,&lt;ref name="Easterbrook, Don J. 1999"/&gt; in contrast to braided rivers, which form on steeper gradients and display less bank stability.

== History ==

=== Roman Saturnalia ===

[[Saturnalia]] was an [[Roman festival|ancient Roman festival]] in honor of the [[List of Roman deities|deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], held on December 17 of the [[Julian calendar]] and later expanded with festivities through December 23. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the [[Temple of Saturn]], in the [[Roman Forum]], and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a [[carnival]] atmosphere that overturned [[Ancient Roman culture|Roman social norms]]: [[Dice#History|gambling]] was permitted, and masters provided table service for their [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Miller, "Roman Festivals," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Catullus]] called it "the best of days."&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 14.15 ''(optimo dierum)'', as cited by Hans-Friedrich Mueller, "Saturn," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating December 25 as the date of birth of [[Jesus]] was [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (170–236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible |last=Mills |first=Watson E. |authorlink= |author2=Edgar V.

In the [[Christian]] tradition the [[Christmastide|Christmas season]] is a period ''beginning'' on [[Christmas Day]] (December 25). In some churches (e.g. the [[Anglican Communion]]) the season continues until the day before the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], which is celebrated either on January 6 or on the Sunday between January 2 and 8. In other churches (e.g. the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) it continues until the feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]], which falls on the Sunday following the Epiphany, or on the Monday following the Epiphany if the Epiphany is moved to January 7 or 8. If the Epiphany is kept on January 6, the [[Church of England]]'s use of the term ''Christmas season'' corresponds to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], and ends on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].

This short Christmas season is preceded by [[Advent]], which begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day: the majority of the secularized Christmas and holiday season falls during Advent. The [[Anglican Communion]] and some Protestant churches follow the Christmas season with an [[Epiphany season]] which lasts until [[Shrove Tuesday]] which is also known as [[Mardi Gras]] or 'Fat Tuesday'. Other European cultures have their own carnival festivities between new year and Lent.

According to Yanovski et al.,&lt;ref name=weight /&gt; in the United States the holiday season "is generally considered to begin with the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and end after [[New Year's Day]]". According to Axelrad,&lt;ref name=coopers /&gt; the season in the United States encompasses at least Christmas and New Year's Day, and also includes [[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicholas Day]].

According to Chen et al.,&lt;ref name=diabetes&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Diabetes Care|date=February 2004|volume=27|issue=2|pages=326–330|title=A Prospective Study of Glycemic Control During Holiday Time in Type 2 Diabetic Patients|author1=Harn-Shen Chen |author2=Tjin-Shing Jap |author3=Ru-Lin Chen |author4=Hong-Da Lin |pmid=14747208|doi=10.2337/diacare.27.2.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; in China the Christmas and holiday season "is generally considered to begin with the [[winter solstice]] and end after the [[Lantern Festival]]". Some stores and shopping malls advertise their Christmas merchandise beginning after [[Halloween]] or even in late October, alongside Halloween items. In the UK and Ireland, Christmas food generally appears on supermarket shelves as early as September or even August, while the Christmas shopping season itself starts from mid November when the high street [[Christmas lights]] are switched on.&lt;ref name=vil/&gt;&lt;ref name=gar/&gt;

The precise definition of feasts and festival days that are encompassed by the Christmas and holiday season has become controversial in the United States over recent decades. While in other countries the only holidays included in the "season" are [[Christmas Eve]], Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day/[[Boxing Day]], [[New Year's Eve]], New Year's Day and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], in recent times, this definition in the U.S. has begun to expand to include [[Yule]], [[Hanukkah]], [[Kwanzaa]], [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Cyber Monday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lights of Winter: Winter Celebrations Around the World|author1=Heather Conrad |author2=Deforest Walker |publisher=Lightport Books|date=October 1, 2001|isbn=0-9712425-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the holiday season in the U.S. to encompass Thanksgiving is believed to have begun in the 1920s, when major department stores [[Macy's]] and [[Gimbels]] launched [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|dueling Thanksgiving]] [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade|Day parades]] to promote Christmas sales.&lt;ref name="NewsworksPodcast"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/component/flexicontent/item/30352-pilgrims-and-parades-a-brief-history-of-thanksgiving |title=Pilgrims and parades: A brief history of Thanksgiving |publisher=Newsworks.org (WHYY) |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516160520/http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/component/flexicontent/item/30352-pilgrims-and-parades-a-brief-history-of-thanksgiving |archivedate=May 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the phenomenon of [[Christmas creep]] and the informal inclusion of Thanksgiving, the Christmas and holiday season has begun to extend earlier into the year, overlapping [[Veterans Day|Veterans]]/[[Remembrance Day|Remembrance]]/[[Armistice Day]], Halloween and [[Guy Fawkes Night]].

The exchange of gifts is central to the Christmas and holiday season, and the season thus also incorporates a "holiday shopping season". This comprises a peak time for the [[retail]] [[Tertiary sector of industry|sector]] at the start of the holiday season (the "Christmas shopping season") and a period of sales at the end of the season, the "January sales".

During the 2014 holiday shopping season, retail sales in the United States increased to a total of over $616 billion, and in 2015, retail sales in the United States increased to a total of over $630 billion, up from 2014's $616 billion.

This is widely reputed to be the busiest shopping day of the entire calendar year.

In 2005, the kick-off to the Christmas and holiday season for [[online shopping]], the first Monday after US Thanksgiving, was named [[Cyber Monday]]. Although it was a peak, that was not the busiest on-line shopping day of that year. The busiest on-line shopping days were December 12 and 13, almost two weeks later; the second Monday in December has since become known as [[Green Monday]]. Another notable day is Free Shipping Day, a promotional day that serves as the last day in which a person can order a good online and have it arrive via standard shipping (the price of which the sender pays) prior to Christmas Eve; this day is usually on or near December 16.&lt;ref name=tc2011&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/18/green-monday-and-free-shipping-day-help-boost-online-holiday-sales-by-15-percent-to-31b/ Green Monday And Free Shipping Day Help Boost Online Holiday Sales By 15 Percent To $31B].

On the basis of the growing popularity of gift certificates, he states that "To get a true picture of holiday sales, one may consider measuring October, November, December and January sales combined as opposed to just November and December sales.", because with "a hefty amount of that spending not hitting the books until January, extending the length of the season makes sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Extended holiday shopping season bodes well|work=East Bay Business Times|date=November 17, 2006|author=Dave Goll|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2006/11/20/story3.html?page=1&amp;b=1163998800^1378052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, holiday shoppers are planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give gift cards because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.

Some stores in Canada hold [[Boxing Week]] sales (before the end of the year) for [[income tax]] purposes.

==== Christmas creep ====
{{Main article|Christmas creep}}
What has become known as "Christmas creep" refers to a [[merchandising]] phenomenon in which merchants and retailers exploit the commercialized status of [[Christmas]] by moving up the start of the holiday shopping season.&lt;ref name="titleChicago Sun-Times:: Search"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB36D9911BB108A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=He's well-suited to enjoying life of Santa | first = Alf | last = Siewers |accessdate=December 26, 2007 | date = November 25, 1987 |format= |work=Chicago Sun-Times| quote =  And so does the culture, with a commercializing of himself that Santa deplores even as he has watched the holiday season creep back to Labor Day.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060918-Christmas-creep.htm |title=Macmillan English Dictionary Word of the Week Archive&amp;nbsp;– "Christmas creep" |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |date=September 18, 2006 |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |first=Kerry |last=Maxwell |work=New Words |quote=The term Christmas creep was first used in the mid-eighties, though gained wider recognition more recently, possibly due to subsequent coinage of the expression mission creep. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320172802/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060918-Christmas-creep.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in the United States and before [[Halloween]] in Canada.

The term is not used in the UK and Ireland, where retailers call Christmas the "golden quarter", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;Zoe Wood (Tuesday December 21, 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/21/uk-snow-chaos-christmas-dinners Snow chaos raises fears for Christmas dinners minus the trimmings] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It can apply for other holidays as well, notably [[Valentine's Day]], Easter and [[Mother's Day]].

The Netherlands and Belgium have a double holiday. The first one, the arrival of the Bishop Saint Nicholas and Black Peter, starts about mid November, with presents being given on December 5 or 6. This is a separate holiday from Christmas, Bishop Saint Nick (Sinterklaas) and Santa Claus (Kerstman) being different people. Netherlands and Belgium often do not start the Christmas season until December 6 or 7, i.e. after [[Sinterklaas]] has finished.

In France, the January sales are restricted by legislation to no more than four weeks in [[Paris]], and no more than six weeks for the rest of the country, usually beginning on the first Wednesday in January, and are one of only two periods of the year when retailers are permitted to hold sales.&lt;ref name=Times2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,10290-1900656_2,00.html|work=The Sunday Times Online | location=London|date=December 4, 2005|title=An international guide to the January sales|first1=Joanna|last1=Sugden|first2=Adam|last2=Fresco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/French-store-sales-rise-in-January|date=February 7, 2003|title=French store sales rise in January|work=Food and Drink Europe|publisher=Decision News Media SAS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807170107/http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/French-store-sales-rise-in-January|archivedate=August 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the ''Winterschlussverkauf'' (winter sale before the season ends) was one of two official sales periods (the other being the ''Sommerschlussverkauf'', the summer sales). It begins on the last Monday in January and lasts for 12 days, selling left-over goods from the holiday shopping season, as well as the winter collections. However, unofficially, goods are sold at reduced prices by many stores throughout the whole of January. By the time the sales officially begin the only goods left on sale are low-quality ones, often specially manufactured for the sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fulbright Primer|publisher=Fulbright Commission in Berlin|format=PDF|url=http://www.fulbright.de/togermany/resources/primer.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831075103/http://www.fulbright.de/togermany/resources/primer.pdf|archivedate=August 31, 2006|date=March 20, 2002|chapter=Shopping|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Going Shopping|chapter=Opening hours in German-speaking countries|work=Exeter University Beginners' German|author=Paul Joyce|year=2005|url=http://userweb.port.ac.uk/~joyce1/abinitio/chap9-16.html|publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223050550/http://userweb.port.ac.uk/~joyce1/abinitio/chap9-16.html|archivedate=December 23, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a legislative reform to the corresponding law in 2004,&lt;ref name="nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis"&gt;{{cite web | title=UWG | website=nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/uwg_2004/index.html | language=de | access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; season sales are now allowed over the whole year and are no longer restricted to season-related goods.

In Sweden, where the week of the [[Advent Sunday|first Advent Sunday]] marks the official start of the Christmas and holiday season, continuing with [[Saint Lucy's Day]] on December 13, followed up by [[Christmas]] before the ''Mellandagsrea'' (between days sell off) traditionally begins on December 27 (nowadays often December 26 or even December 25) and lasts during the rest of the Christmas holiday. It is similar to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], but lasts longer. They last 34–35 days. Black Friday itself has also gained publicity in Sweden since the early-2010s.

== Greetings ==
{{redirect|Happy New Year}}
{{Redirect|Christmas Greetings|the Bing Crosby album|Christmas Greetings (album)}}

A selection of goodwill greetings are often used around the world to address strangers, family, colleagues or friends during the season. Some greetings are more prevalent than others, depending on culture and location. Traditionally, the predominant greetings of the season have been "Merry Christmas", "Happy Christmas", and "Happy New Year". In the mid-to-late 20th century in the United States, more generic greetings such as "Happy Holidays" and "Season's Greetings" began to rise in cultural prominence, and this would later spread to other Western countries including Canada, Australia and to a lesser extent some European countries. A 2012 poll by [[Rasmussen Reports]] indicated that 68% of Americans prefer the use of "Merry Christmas", while 23% preferred "Happy Holidays".&lt;ref name="RRpoll" /&gt; A similarly-timed Canadian poll conducted by [[Ipsos-Reid]] indicated that 72% of Canadians preferred "Merry Christmas".&lt;ref name="Canadapoll" /&gt;

=== Merry Christmas and Happy Christmas ===
{{redirect-multi|2|Merry Christmas|Happy Christmas}}

The greetings and farewells "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Christmas" are traditionally used in English-speaking countries, starting a few weeks before Christmas (December 25) each year.

Variations are:
* "Merry Christmas", the traditional English greeting, composed of [[wikt:merry|merry]] (''jolly, happy'') and Christmas ([[Old English]]: ''Cristes mæsse,'' for ''Christ's Mass'').
* "Happy Christmas", an equivalent greeting that is common in Great Britain and Ireland.
* "Merry Xmas", with the "X" replacing "Christ" (''see [[Xmas]]'') is sometimes used in writing, but very rarely in speech. This is in line with the traditional use of the Greek letter [[chi (letter)|chi]] ([[uppercase]] Χ, [[lowercase]] χ), the initial letter of the word [[wikt:Χριστός|Χριστός]] (Christ), to refer to Christ.

[[File:Christmas cake, Boxing Day 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[Christmas cake]] with a "Merry Christmas" greeting]]
These greetings and their equivalents in other languages are popular not only in countries with large Christian populations but also in the largely non-Christian nations of China and Japan, where Christmas is celebrated primarily due to cultural influences of predominantly Christian countries. They have somewhat decreased in popularity in the United States and Canada in recent decades, but polls in 2005 indicated that they remained more popular than "Happy Holidays" or other alternatives.&lt;ref name="preferMC"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://businessknowledgesource.com/blog/merry_christmas_beats_happy_holidays_in_actual_2005_consumer_usage_021216.html | title = Merry Christmas beats "Happy Holidays" In 2005 Usage | work =  | publisher = BusinessKnowledgeSource.com | accessdate = June 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History of the phrase ====
[[Image:Firstchristmascard.jpg|thumb|left|"Merry Christmas" appears on the world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by [[John Callcott Horsley]] for [[Henry Cole]] in 1843]]
"Merry," derived from the [[Old English]] ''myrige'', originally meant merely "pleasant, agreeable" rather than joyous or jolly (as in the phrase "merry month of May").&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;
Christmas has been celebrated since the 4th century AD, the first known usage of any Christmas greeting dates was in 1534.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merry|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116864?redirectedFrom=Merry+Christmas#eid37352934|website=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=January 15, 2017}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year''" (thus incorporating two greetings) was in an informal letter written by an English admiral in 1699. The same phrase is contained in the title of the English [[carol (music)|carol]] "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]," and also appears in the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Henry Cole]] in England in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm "Christmas card sold for record price"]. BBC News. Retrieved December 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1843, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' was published, during the mid Victorian revival of the holiday. The word Merry was then beginning to take on its current meaning of "jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing".&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite web | year = 2004 |author=Gary Martin | url = http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/merry-christmas.html| title = Holiday Greetings, Merry Christmas | publisher = The Phrase Finder | accessdate = June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Merry Christmas''" in this new context figured prominently in ''A Christmas Carol''. The cynical [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] rudely deflects the friendly greeting: "If I could work my will … every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own [[Christmas pudding|pudding]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dickens' classic 'Christmas Carol' still sings to us| url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-12-17-dickens-main_N.htm| publisher = ''[[USA Today]]''| accessdate =May 4, 2010| first=Bob| last=Minzesheimer| date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas effects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; "I am as merry as a school-boy.

The alternative "Happy Christmas" gained usage in the late 19th century, and in the UK and Ireland is a common spoken greeting, along with "Merry Christmas". One reason may be the Victorian middle class influence in attempting to separate wholesome celebration of the Christmas season from public insobriety and associated asocial behaviour, at a time when ''merry'' also meant "intoxicated" – [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is said to prefer "Happy Christmas" for this reason.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; In her annual [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas message]]s to the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth has used "happy Christmas" far more often than "merry Christmas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueensChristmasBroadcasts/ChristmasBroadcasts/ChristmasBroadcast1952.aspx |title=The Queen's First Christmas Broadcast 1952 |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=December 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117103730/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueensChristmasBroadcasts/ChristmasBroadcasts/ChristmasBroadcast1952.aspx |archivedate=January 17, 2016 }} Note: [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;num=100&amp;q=site%3Awww.royal.gov.uk%2FImagesandBroadcasts%2FTheQueensChristmasBroadcasts%2FChristmasBroadcasts%2F+%22merry+Christmas%22 "Merry Christmas"] has been used only four times: in 1962, 1967, 1970 and 1999.

In the American poet [[Clement Moore]]'s "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]" (1823), the final line, originally written as "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night", has been changed in many later editions to "Merry Christmas to all", perhaps indicating the relative popularity of the phrases in the US.

===Happy Holidays===
{{redirect|Happy Holidays|other meanings of "Happy Holidays"|Happy Holidays (disambiguation)}}

In the United States, "Happy Holidays" (along with the similarly generalized "Season's Greetings") has become a common holiday greeting in the public sphere of department stores, public schools and greeting cards. Its use is generally confined to the period between [[Thanksgiving (United States)|United States Thanksgiving]] and New Year's Day.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The phrase "Happy Holidays" has been used as a Christmas greeting in the United States for more than 100 years.&lt;ref name="Stack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Liam|title=How the ‘War on Christmas’ Controversy Was Created|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/us/war-on-christmas-controversy.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing usage of "Happy Holidays" has been the subject of some [[Christmas controversy|controversy in the United States]]. Advocates claim that "Happy Holidays" is an inclusive greeting that is not intended as an attack on Christianity or other religions, but is rather a response to what they say is the reality of a growing non-Christian population.

Critics of "Happy Holidays" generally claim it is a secular [[neologism]]. The greeting may be deemed materialistic, consumerist, atheistic, indifferentist, agnostic, [[politically correct]] and/or [[anti-Christianity]]. Critics of the phrase have associated it with a larger cultural clash termed the "[[War on Christmas]]".&lt;ref name="Stack"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year = 2004 |url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/32013.html |title = Why "Happy Holidays"? |work = |publisher = Reason Magazine |accessdate = June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season's Greetings===
{{redirect|Season's Greetings|other meanings of "Season's Greetings"|Season's Greetings (disambiguation)}}

"Season's Greetings" is a greeting more commonly used as a motto on winter season [[greeting card]]s, and in commercial advertisements, than as a spoken phrase. In addition to "Merry Christmas", Victorian Christmas cards bore a variety of salutations, including "Compliments of the Season" and "Christmas Greetings." By the late 19th century, "With the Season's Greetings" or simply "The Season's Greetings" began appearing. By the 1920s it had been shortened to "Season's Greetings",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/TT-2005-11-15-12-06-16p1.htm | title = Maryland Historical Society Library Devotes Exhibit To Holiday Cards | publisher = Antiques and the Arts Online | accessdate = June 29, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418094137/http://antiquesandthearts.com/TT-2005-11-15-12-06-16p1.htm | archivedate = April 18, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a greeting card fixture ever since. Several [[White House]] Christmas cards, including U.S. President [[Dwight D.

== Medical analyses ==
Various studies have been performed on the effects of the Christmas and holiday season, which encompasses several [[feast day]]s, on health. They have concluded that the health changes that occur during the Christmas and holiday season are not reversed during the rest of the year and have a long-term cumulative effect over a person's life, and that the risks of several medical problems increase during the Christmas and holiday season.

=== Nutrition ===
Yanovski et al.&lt;ref name=weight /&gt; investigated the assertion that the average American gains weight over the season. They found that average weight gain over the Christmas and holiday season is around {{convert|0.48|kg}}. They also found that this weight gain is not reversed over the rest of the year, and concluded that this "probably contributes to the increase in body weight that frequently occurs during adulthood" (cf [[Lent]]).

Chan et al.&lt;ref name=diabetes /&gt; investigated the increases in A1C and fasting plasma glucose in [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetic patients]], to see whether these increases were steady throughout the year or varied seasonally. They concluded that the winter holidays did influence the glycemic control of the patients, with the largest increases being during that period, increases that "might not be reversed during the summer and autumn months".

The Christmas and holiday season, according to a survey by the ADA, is the second most popular reason, after birthdays, for sharing food in the workplace. The [[British Columbia Safety Council]] states that if proper food safety procedures are not followed, food set out for sharing in the workplace can serve as a breeding ground for bacteria, and recommends that perishable foods (for which it gives pizza, cold cuts, dips, salads, and sandwiches as examples) should not sit out for more than 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|publisher=British Columbia Safety Council|title=Safety First|date=Spring 2006|url=http://www.safetycouncil.bc.ca/newsletter/2006/spring/pdfs/givebacteriathepinkslip.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227124307/http://www.safetycouncil.bc.ca/newsletter/2006/spring/pdfs/givebacteriathepinkslip.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere, the Christmas and holiday season (as well as the second half of winter) is a time of increased use of fuel for domestic heating.  This has prompted concerns in the United Kingdom about the possibility of a shortage in the domestic [[natural gas|gas]] supply.  However, in the event of an exceptionally long cold season, it is industrial users, signed on to interruptible supply contracts, who would find themselves without gas supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Times | location=London|date=December 29, 2005|title=Thousands shiver as gas boiler failures double|author=Peter Klinger|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9558-1961817,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
In 2002, for the Christmas and holiday season, [[Moscow]] mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]] ordered all stores, restaurants, cafés and markets to display seasonal decorations and lights in their windows and interiors from December 1 onwards. Banks, post offices and public institutions were to do the same from December 15, with violators liable for fines of up to 200 rubles. Every business was ordered to have illuminated windows during the hours of 16:30 until 01:00.

A '''cold-energy battery''' utilizes the properties of an advanced [[phase-change material]] (PCM) to maintain temperature as [[battery thermal management]]. As with a standard [[Battery (electricity)|electrical battery]], a cold energy battery stores energy and releases depending on the energy demand on it. It can then be recharged by placing in a temperature environment conducive to the phase change properties of the PCM.

[[File:Imf-advanced-un-least-developed-2008.svg|thumb|300px|Developed countries are shown in blue (according to the [[International Monetary Fund]], as of 2008)]]
In [[world systems theory]], the '''core countries''' are the [[industrialized]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries on which [[periphery countries]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] depend. Core countries control and benefit from the global market. They are usually recognized as wealthy nations with a wide variety of resources and are in a favorable location compared to other states. They have strong state institutions, a powerful military and powerful global political alliances.

Core countries do not always stay core permanently. Throughout history, core nations have been changing and new ones have been added to the core list. The most influential countries in the past have been what would be considered core. These were the [[Asia]]n, [[India]]n and [[Middle Eastern]] empires in the ages up to the 16th century, prominently India and [[China]] were the richest regions in the world until the 15th century, when the [[Europe]]an powers took the lead, although the major Asian powers such as China were still very influential in the region. Europe remained ahead of the pack until the 20th century, when the two [[World Wars]] turned disastrous for the European economies. It is then that the victorious [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]], up to late 1980s, became the two [[hegemons]], creating a bipolar [[New world order (politics)|world order]].
The heart of civilisation consists of [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] and [[Japan]]. The population of the core is by far the wealthiest and best educated on the planet.

== Definition ==
Core countries control and profit the most from the world system, and thus they are the "core" of the world system. These countries possess the ability to exercise control over other countries or groups of countries with several kinds of power such as military, economic, and political power.

The [[United States]], [[Canada]], the countries of the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are examples of present core countries that have the most power in the world economic system.&lt;ref name=essentials&gt;Margaret L.

Before the 13th century, many empires were considered to be "core" nations, such as the Persian, Indian, and Roman empires, the Muslim Caliphates, the Chinese and Egyptian dynasties, the various Mesopotamian kingdoms, and so on.

In Asia, the Chinese Empire was considered the middle kingdom and controlled the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sLxL3FkqCpIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=PbWzWwh343&amp;dq=chinese%20empire&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Steele, P.

[[India]] until the 13th century, often referred to as [[Greater India]], extended its religious, cultural, and trading influence on vast Asian regions from [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] to [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTw-nwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=India and Malaysia: Intertwined Strands|first=Veena|last=Sikri|date=16 December 2017|publisher=Manohar Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Buddhism and Hinduism, two of the most followed religions in Asia and the World as a whole, having originated there, India's cultural impact spread throughout Asia.

[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|left|alt=Expansion Of The Mongol Empire.|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]]]]

====Mongol Empire====
[[Pax Mongolica]] is a particularly important period which started in 1206 and ended, according to contradicting sources, between late 14th and early 15th centuries. The trade during this period took on a truly multi-continental dimension, efficient and safe trade routes were established, and many of the modern rules of trade were emerging. The [[Mongol Empire]] was the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. It stretched from as far east as China all the way to Europe, taking up large parts of Central Asia, [[Middle East]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=mongolian+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fKkJTKvxC8X_lgewqZ3cDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false O'Brien, P.K. ''Atlas of World History'' p.98]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|see list of territories]])]]
Many trade routes went through the Mongol Empire territory, even though they were not the easiest ones to travel, due to the rough Asian terrain. Yet, they attracted many merchants, because these routes were relatively cheap and safe to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Abu—Lughod, J.L. ''Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250—1350'' p.154 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rYlgGU2SLiQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=before%20european%20hegemony&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongols]] controlled their territories through military force and taxation. In many regions of the Mongol territory, Mongol rule is remembered as brutal and destructive. Yet, some argue that many economic and cultural improvements were made during the Mongol Empire's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml|title=Pax Mongolica|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|last=Lee|website=www.silk-road.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire====
The [[Ottoman Empire]], which emerged in 1299, quickly became a power to be reckoned with. By 1450, the Ottoman Empire took up the connecting territory between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Mediterranean seas]]. Despite lasting three times longer than the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire never came to be anywhere near as expansive.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, C. ''Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300—1923'' p.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=maT_XL3mgxwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ottoman%20empire&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th–18th century===
Prior to the 16th century, [[feudalism]] took over Western European society and pushed Western Europe on a road to capitalist development. Population and commerce grew rapidly within the feudal system during the years of 1150–1300. Through the years 1300–1450, an economic downfall came about.  The feudalism growth had come to an end.&lt;ref name=modernhistory&gt;Paul Halsall.
[http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf Modern History Sourcebook: Wallerstein on World Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021951/http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf |date=2012-03-08 }}.Aug 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein|Wallerstein]], "the feudal crisis was most likely brought on by the involvement of the three following factors below:
# [[Agricultural production]] fell or remained stagnant. This meant that the burden of peasant producers increased as the ruling class expanded.
# The economic cycle of the feudal economy had reached its optimum level; afterward, the economy began to shrink. [[File:Western Europe 1700.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=A Map of Western Europe|A map of Western Europe]]
# A shift of [[Climatological|climatological conditions]] decreased agricultural productivity and contributed to an increase in epidemics within the population."&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

The feudal crisis lead to the development of the world economic system. The world economic system came about during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The most dominant of Northwestern Europe were [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] (see map of Western Europe on the right). These countries took on the definition of a core country. They developed a strong central government, bureaucracies, and grew their military power. These countries were then able to control the international commerce and create a profit for themselves. All of western Europe attempted bureaucratization, [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] of the local population, development of a stronger military, and involvement of the country in a vast number of different economic activities.  After these attempts to gain the "core" status, north-western European states locked in their positions as core states by 1640.  England dominated the pack, as [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] fell to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

One factor that helped the core countries dominate over the other countries is long-distance trade with the Americas and the East.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This trade produced profits of 200–300%. In order to enter this trade market, countries needed a great amount of capital and state help.  The smaller countries could not make this happen, and this widened the gap between the "core" and "semi-periphery" countries. These core positions held strong up and throughout the 18th century, even as the core regions started to produce a mixture of agricultural and industrial goods. At the beginning of 1700, manufacture of goods in industrial productions started to take off. Industrial production soon took over the agricultural production up to the year 1900.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

Thus, the global society was united through this force.&lt;ref&gt;Rosow, Stephen J. "Nature, Need, and the Human World; "Commercial Society" and the Construction of the World Economy."

====Rise and eventual European hegemony====
At the beginning of the 18th century, Europe had not yet dominated in the world economy on account of the fact that its military did not match that of Asia or of the Middle East. However, through organizing its economics and improving technology in industry, European countries took the lead as the most powerful nations in the late 18th century and remained in this position until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''445''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Asia was making and distributing goods that were valued by other areas, namely [[cotton]], [[silk]] and [[tea]]. Europe on the other hand, was not producing products of interest to the other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''447''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, although Europe was wealthy, this dynamic shows that there may be a reversal of power because it was consistently expanding money, yet hardly bringing in currency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} America's crops were not initially appealing to Europeans. Tobacco's demand had to be advertised, and eventually Europe became interested in this particular plant. In time, there was rather regular [[wikt:transatlantic|trans-Atlantic]] trade between the Americas and Europe for such crops as tobacco, cotton, and also goods available in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"/&gt;

====Slave trade====
The 18th century was profoundly marked by the [[slave trade]]. [[History of slavery|Slavery was present]] in [[civilization]]s on all continents throughout post-hunter-gatherer history.  The importation of slaves from the Old World started on continental [[North America]] in August 1619 as a form of [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]], and continued in the next centuries. Slavery also occurred in [[Africa]] previous to Europeans capitalizing on selling slaves. Africans were sometimes hired to collect others off the coast, and bring them back to European ships.&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this trade, the dependent nations remained dependent as their [[populations]] were suffering from the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Inikori"&gt;Inikori, J.E. "Africa in World History: the Export Slave Trade From Africa and the Emergence of the Altlantic Economic Order." ''General History of Africa V; Africa from the sixteenth to eighteenth century.'' p.92.

This trade of humans was incredibly profitable for the Europeans, perpetuating their success and "rule" of the seas. Immediately following the early 19th century, the southern U.S. population consisted of 37.5% slaves.&lt;ref name="Inikori"/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
The [[World Systems Theory]] argues that a nation's future is decided by their stance in the global economy. A global capitalistic market demands the needs for wealthy (core) states and poor (periphery) states. Core states benefit from the hierarchical structure of international trade and labor. World systems theory follows the logic that international wars or multinational financial disputes can be explained as attempts to change a location within the global market for a specific state or groups of states; these changes can have the objective to gain more control over the global market (to become a core country), while causing another nation to lose control over the world market. As the two groups grew apart in power, world systems theorists to established another group, the semi-periphery, to act as the middle group.&lt;ref name="theory"&gt;Ross, Robert J. S. and Kent C. Trachte. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrFzvcrvOxMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=global+capitalism+the+new+leviathan&amp;ei=UoMJTIakC5WWyQTbjfSyBw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world%20systems%20theory%22&amp;f=false Global Capitalism: the New Leviathan'']] (p.51-54). Albany: State University of New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7914-0339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

[[Semi-periphery countries]] usually surround the core countries both in a physical and fundamental sense. The semi-periphery countries act as the middle men between the core and the periphery countries - by giving the wealthy countries what they receive from the poor countries. The [[periphery countries]] are the poorer countries usually specializing in farming and have access natural resources - which the core countries use to profit from.&lt;ref name="diversesociety"&gt;Anderson, Margaret L. and Howard F. Taylor. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA254 Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society]'' (p.254). Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 2007. {{ISBN|0-495-10236-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

==Key qualifiers==
In order for a country to remain a core or to become a core, possible investors must be kept in mind when nation's policies are planned. Core countries change with time due to many different factors including changes in geographic favoritism and regional affluence. Alterations in financing plans by companies will also play a part as they change to react to the continuously evolving [[world economy|world market]].&lt;ref name=strategy&gt;Michalet, Charles Albert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPof5lBFnsC&amp;pg=PA22 Strategies of Multinationals and Competition for Foreign Direct Investment]'' (p.22-25). Washington D.C.: World Bank, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8213-4161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a country to be considered a core country nominee, the country must possess an independent, stable government and potential for growth in the global market and advances in technology. Although these three factors will not completely decide where a company chooses to invest – they do play extremely large roles in such decisions. A main key to becoming or remaining a core is determined by the country's government policies to encourage funding from outside.&lt;ref name=strategy/&gt;

==Main functions==
The main function of the core countries is to command and financially benefit from the world system better than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=diversesociety/&gt;  Core countries could also be viewed as the capitalist class while the periphery countries could be viewed as a disordered working class.&lt;ref name=revolution&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btfwl-tX5r8C Revolution, a Sociological Interpretation]'' (p.100). Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-87722-736-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a capitalism-driven market, core countries exchange goods with the poor nations at an unequal rate greatly in favor of the core countries.&lt;ref name=enpolitical&gt;O’Hara, Phillip Anthony. ''[https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;id=ncgV5-fvEkoC Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2'']. London: T &amp; F Books, 2009. {{ISBN|0-203-44321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periphery countries’ purpose is to provide agricultural and natural resources along with the lower [[division of labor]] for larger corporations of semi-periphery and core countries. As a result of the lower priced division of labor and natural resources available, the core nations’ companies buy these products for a relatively low cost and then sell them for much higher. The periphery countries only receive low amounts of money for what they sell and must pay higher prices for anything they buy from outside their own region. Because of this continuous order, periphery countries can never earn enough to cover the costs of their imports while setting aside money to invest in better technologies. Core countries support this pattern by giving loans to the poor regions for specific investments in a raw material or type of agriculture, rather than help such regions establish themselves and balance out the world market.&lt;ref name=worldsystem&gt;Shannon, Thomas R. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U39evXuC41kC&amp;pg=PA16  An Introduction to the World-System Perspective]'' (p.16). Boulder: Westview Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-2452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A disadvantage to core nations is to remain a member of the core grouping, the government must retain or create new policies that encourage investments to keep in their country and not relocate.&lt;ref name=worldsystem/&gt; This can make it difficult for governments to change national standards that may sacrifice high profits.

An example of a change that capitalism does not favor is the abolition of slavery. During the early [[industrialization]] and growth of America, exports produced by slaves played a huge role in making [[businesses]] the most profit.&lt;ref name=slavery&gt;Leiman, Melvin M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-0SshE2MWREC&amp;pg=PA25 Political Economy of Racism''] (p.25-26). London: Pluto Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7453-0487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such movements to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery]] and spread equality caused an internal [[American Civil War|war]] within the United States.

A '''displacement receiver''' is a device that responds to or is sensitive to directed distance (displacement).

Examples of displacement receivers include [[carbon microphone]]s, [[strain gauge]]s, and [[pressure sensor]]s or force sensors, which, to within an appropriate scale factor, respond to distance.

In music, certain music keyboards can be considered displacement receivers in the sense that they respond to displacement, rather than velocity (as is more commonly the case).

Examples of displacement-responding sensors include the mechanical action of [[Tracker action|tracker]] [[Pipe organ|organs]], as well as the force-sensing resistors found in [[Musical keyboard|music keyboards]] that had [[polyphonic]] aftertouch capability.  Polyphonic aftertouch is no longer a feature of presently manufactured keyboards, but certain older models such as the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] A50 featured a pressure sensing resistor, similar in principle-of-operation to a carbon microphone, in each key.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">'''Emmert's law''' states that objects that generate [[retina|retinal]] images of the same size will look different in physical size (linear size) if they appear to be located at different distances. Specifically, the ''perceived linear size'' of an object increases as its ''perceived'' distance from the observer increases.  This makes intuitive sense: an object of constant size will project progressively smaller retinal images as its distance from the observer increases. Similarly, if the retinal images of two ''different'' objects at different distances are the same, the physical size of the object that is farther away must be larger than the one that is closer.

[[Emil Emmert]] (1844–1911) first described the law in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Emmert E. (1881) Größenverhältnisse der Nachbilder. ''Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde und für augenärztliche Fortbildung'', 19: 443-450.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that an afterimage appeared to increase in size when projected to a greater distance. It is unclear whether he intended this to mean physical distance or perceived distance, but most authors assume the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein W, Park J, Casey A. (1961) The current status of the size-distance hypotheses. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 58: 491-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of viewing distance on perceived size can be observed by first obtaining an afterimage, which can be achieved by viewing a bright light for a short time, or staring at a figure for a longer time.  It appears to grow in size when projected to a further distance. However, the increase in perceived size is much less than would be predicted by geometry, which casts some doubt on the geometrical interpretation given above.&lt;ref&gt;Lou L. (2007) Apparent afterimage size, Emmert’s law, and oculomotor adjustment. ''Perception'',36:1214-1228.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emmert's law is closely related to [[size constancy]], and has been used to investigate the [[moon illusion]] (the apparent enlargement of the moon or sun near the horizon compared with higher in the sky).&lt;ref&gt;Ross H E, Plug C. (2002) ''The mystery of the moon illusion: Exploring size perception''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory R L. (2008) Emmert’s Law and the moon illusion. ''Spatial Vision'', 21: 407-420.&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent neuroimaging study that examined brain activation when participants viewed afterimages on surfaces placed at different distances found evidence supporting Emmert's Law and thus size constancy played out in [[primary visual cortex]] (V1); i.e.  the larger the perceived size of the afterimage, the larger the retinotopic activation in V1.&lt;ref name=Goodale2012&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nat. Neurosci.|year=2012 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=540–2 |title=Retinotopic activity in V1 reflects the perceived and not the retinal size of an afterimage. |vauthors=Sperandio I, Chouinard PA, Goodale MA |doi=10.1038/nn.3069 |pmid=22406550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in [[Burkina Faso]]''' is a growing [[industry]] with tremendous potential.

==Oil and gas==
All [[petroleum]] products are imported since the country has no known crude oil reserves or refining capacity {{as of | 2003}}. Imports and consumption of petroleum in 2002 amounted to 8,870&amp;nbsp;barrels per day. As for natural gas, Burkina Faso is known to have no natural gas production, consumption, or reserves.

==Electricity==
Electricity accounts for all energy production. Total installed electrical capacity in 2001 was 121&amp;nbsp;MW. Production rose from 42&amp;nbsp;GWh in 1973 to 280&amp;nbsp;GWh in 2001, of which 73.6% was thermal and 26.4% hydroelectric. Consumption of electricity was 0.26&amp;nbsp;billion kWh in 2001. Construction of a 15&amp;nbsp;MW hydroelectric facility at [[Kompienga]] was finished in 1989. In 1999, with a grant from the [[Government of Denmark|government]] of [[Denmark]], Burkina Faso built a new power station, completing it in just five months to meet the country's emergency energy needs. Production and distribution of electricity and water are controlled by the state-owned [[Société Nationale d'électricité du Burkina Faso]] (SONABEL), established in [[Ouagadougou]] in 1968.

As of 2008, it is estimated 7% of Burkina Faso have access to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/rankings/electrification_by_country_2007_2008.html Electrification by Country 2007/2008 - Country Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eroding rill in field in eastern Germany.jpg|thumb|right|An actively eroding [[rill]] on an [[Intensive farming|intensively-farmed]] field in [[new states of Germany|eastern]] Germany]]

In [[earth science]], '''erosion''' is the action of surface processes (such as [[Surface runoff|water flow]] or [[wind]]) that removes [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]], or dissolved material from one location on the [[Earth's crust#Crust|Earth's crust]], and then [[sediment transport|transports]] it to another location&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/science/erosion-geology | title=Erosion | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | date=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with [[weathering]] which involves no movement). This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents, that is, water, ice (glaciers), snow, air (wind), plants, animals, and humans. In accordance with these agents, erosion is sometimes divided into water erosion, glacial erosion, snow erosion, wind (aeolic) erosion, zoogenic erosion, and anthropogenic erosion&lt;ref name="Apollo 10 (4)"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Apollo, M., Andreychouk, V., Bhattarai, S.S. | title=Short-Term Impacts of Livestock Grazing on Vegetation and Track Formation in a High Mountain Environment: A Case Study from the Himalayan Miyar Valley (India) | journal=Sustainability | volume=10 | issue=4 | date=2018-03-24 | issn=2071-1050 | doi=10.3390/su10040951 | pages=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into [[clastic]] [[sediment]] is referred to as ''physical'' or ''mechanical'' erosion; this contrasts with ''chemical'' erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution.

===Rainfall and surface runoff===
[[File:Water and soil splashed by the impact of a single raindrop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soil]] and water being [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splashed]] by the impact of a single [[raindrop]]]]
[[Rainfall]], and the [[surface runoff]] which may result from rainfall, produces four main types of [[soil erosion]]: ''splash erosion'', ''sheet erosion'', ''rill erosion'', and ''gully erosion''. Splash erosion is generally seen as the first and least severe stage in the soil erosion process, which is followed by sheet erosion, then rill erosion and finally gully erosion (the most severe of the four).&lt;ref name="toy-2002-p1"/&gt;{{rp|60–61}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Zachar, Dušan|chapter=Classification of soil erosion|title=Soil Erosion|volume=Vol. 10|publisher=Elsevier|year=1982|isbn=978-0-444-99725-8|page=48|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ny2dUkpM8C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rill]] erosion'' refers to the development of small, [[ephemeral]] concentrated flow paths which function as both sediment source and [[sediment]] delivery systems for erosion on hillslopes. Generally, where water erosion rates on disturbed upland areas are greatest, rills are active. Flow depths in rills are typically of the order of a few centimetres (about an inch) or less and along-channel slopes may be quite steep. This means that rills exhibit [[hydraulic]] physics very different from water flowing through the deeper, wider channels of streams and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nearing | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Norton | first2 = L.D. | last3 = Bulgakov | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Larionov | first4 = G.A. | last5 = West | first5 = L.T. | last6 = Dontsova | first6 = K.M. | year = 1997 | title = Hydraulics and erosion in eroding rills | url = | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 865–876 | doi=10.1029/97wr00013|bibcode = 1997WRR....33..865N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivers and streams===

{{details|topic=water's erosive ability|Hydraulic action}}
[[File: Dobbingstone Burn - geograph.org.uk - 1291882.jpg|thumb|Dobbingstone [[Burn (landform)|Burn]], Scotland, showing two different types of erosion affecting the same place. Valley erosion is occurring due to the flow of the stream, and the boulders and stones (and much of the soil) that are lying on the stream's banks are [[glacial till]] that was left behind as ice age glaciers flowed over the terrain.]]
[[File:Erosion.jpg|thumb|Soil erosion from a stream]]
''Valley'' or ''stream erosion'' occurs with continued water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both [[Downcutting|downward]], deepening the [[valley]], and [[headward erosion|headward]], extending the valley into the hillside, creating [[Head Cut (stream geomorphology)|head cuts]] and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical '''V''' cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some [[base level]] is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream [[meander]]s across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, [[pebble]]s, and [[boulder]]s can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as ''traction''.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, Michael E. (2006) [http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/fluvial_systems/geologic_work_of_streams.html "Geologic Work of Streams"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506040721/http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/fluvial_systems/geologic_work_of_streams.html |date=2012-05-06 }} ''The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography'' University of Wisconsin, {{OCLC|79006225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bank erosion]]'' is the wearing away of the banks of a stream or river. This is distinguished from changes on the bed of the watercourse, which is referred to as ''scour''. Erosion and [[River bank failure|changes in the form of river banks]] may be measured by inserting metal rods into the bank and marking the position of the bank surface along the rods at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=_PJHw-hSKGgC&amp;pg=PA113 |title=Stream hydrology: an introduction for ecologists |author=Nancy D.

''Thermal erosion'' is the result of melting and weakening [[permafrost]] due to moving water.&lt;ref name="nsidc_thermal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/word.pl?thermal%20erosion |title=Thermal Erosion |work=NSIDC Glossary |publisher=[[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] |accessdate=21 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uLakeCcx?url=http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/word.pl?thermal%20erosion |archivedate=2010-11-19 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid [[river channel migration]] observed in the [[Lena River]] of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented non-cohesive materials.&lt;ref name="lena"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/esp.592|title=Fluvial thermal erosion investigations along a rapidly eroding river bank: application to the Lena River (central Siberia)|year=2003|last1=Costard|first1=F.|last2=Dupeyrat|first2=L.|last3=Gautier|first3=E.|last4=Carey-Gailhardis|first4=E.|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|volume=28|pages=1349–1359|bibcode = 2003ESPL...28.1349C|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this erosion occurs as the weakened banks fail in large slumps. Thermal erosion also affects the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic coast]], where wave action and near-shore temperatures combine to undercut permafrost bluffs along the shoreline and cause them to fail. Annual erosion rates along a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=on}} segment of the [[Beaufort Sea]] shoreline averaged {{convert|5.6|m|ft|abbr=off}} per year from 1955 to 2002.&lt;ref name="jones_arctic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.M.|author2=Hinkel, K.M.|author3=Arp, C.D.|author4=Eisner, W.R.|year=2008|title=Modern Erosion Rates and Loss of Coastal Features and Sites, Beaufort Sea Coastline, Alaska|journal=Arctic|volume=61|issue=4|pages=361–372|url=http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/44/115|doi=10.14430/arctic44|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517101602/http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/44/115|archivedate=2013-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most river erosion happens nearer to the mouth of a river.  On a river bend, the longest least sharp side has slower moving water.  Here deposits build up.  On the narrowest sharpest side of the bend, there is faster moving water so this side tends to erode away mostly.

===Coastal erosion===

Shoreline erosion, which occurs on both exposed and sheltered coasts, primarily occurs through the action of currents and [[ocean surface wave|waves]] but sea level (tidal) change can also play a role.

''[[Hydraulic action]]'' takes place when the air in a joint is suddenly compressed by a wave closing the entrance of the joint. This then cracks it. ''[[Wave pounding]]'' is when the sheer energy of the wave hitting the cliff or rock breaks pieces off. ''[[abrasion (geology)|Abrasion]]'' or ''corrasion'' is caused by waves launching sea load at the cliff. It is the most effective and rapid form of shoreline erosion (not to be confused with ''corrosion''). ''[[Corrosion]]'' is the dissolving of rock by [[carbonic acid]] in sea water.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, Ian. “Lithosphere.” Higher geography for cfe: physical and human environments, Hodder Education, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Limestone]] cliffs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of erosion. ''Attrition'' is where particles/sea load carried by the waves are worn down as they hit each other and the cliffs. This then makes the material easier to wash away. The material ends up as [[shingle beach|shingle]] and sand. Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed ''[[bioerosion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, Peter W. "Bioerosion and coral-reef growth: a dynamic balance." Life and death of coral reefs (1997): 68-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sediment]] is transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing current ([[longshore drift]]). When the upcurrent amount of sediment is less than the amount being carried away, erosion occurs. When the upcurrent amount of sediment is greater, sand or gravel banks will tend to form as a result of [[deposition (geology)|deposition]]. These banks may slowly migrate along the coast in the direction of the longshore drift, alternately protecting and exposing parts of the coastline. Where there is a bend in the coastline, quite often a buildup of eroded material occurs forming a long narrow bank (a [[spit (landform)|spit]]). [[Armor (hydrology)|Armoured]] beaches and submerged offshore [[shoal|sandbanks]] may also protect parts of a coastline from erosion. Over the years, as the shoals gradually shift, the erosion may be redirected to attack different parts of the shore.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Frederic Gladstone. “Marine action and control.” Geological hazards: their assessment, avoidance, and mitigation, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, pp. 302–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical erosion===
&lt;!--why is chemical erosion listed here as a physical (mechanical) process?--&gt;
Chemical erosion is the loss of matter in a landscape in the form of [[solution|solute]]s. Chemical erosion is usually calculated from the solutes found in streams. [[Anders Rapp]] pioneered the study of chemical erosion in his work about [[Kärkevagge]] published in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixon |first=John C. |last2=Thorn |first2=Colin E. |date=2005 |title=Chemical weathering and landscape development in mid-latitude alpine environments |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X04002764 |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue=1–2 |pages=127–145 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.07.009|access-date=22 November 2015|bibcode = 2005Geomo..67..127D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Glacial [[moraines]] above [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], in [[Alberta, Canada]]]]
[[Glacier]]s erode predominantly by three different processes: abrasion/scouring, [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]], and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, in addition to the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations.  In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross-section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide a numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped [[U-shaped valley]] - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of over deepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harbor|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Hallet|first2=Bernard|last3=Raymond|first3=Charles F.|date=1988-05-26|title=A numerical model of landform development by glacial erosion|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v333/n6171/abs/333347a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=333|issue=6171|pages=347–349|doi=10.1038/333347a0|bibcode=1988Natur.333..347H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glaciers can also cause pieces of bedrock to crack off in the process of plucking. In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. This method produced some of the many thousands of lake basins that dot the edge of the [[Canadian Shield]]. Differences in the height of mountain ranges are not only being the result tectonic forces, such as rock uplift, but also local climate variations. Scientists use global analysis of topography to show that glacial erosion controls the maximum height of mountains, as the relief between mountain peaks and the snow line are generally confined to altitudes less than 1500&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egholm|first=D.

Ongoing research is showing that while glaciers tend to decrease mountain size, in some areas, glaciers can actually reduce the rate of erosion, acting as a ''glacial armor''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Stuart N. | last2 = Brandon | first2 = Mark T. | last3 = Tomkin | first3 = Jonathan H. | last4 = Reiners | first4 = Peter W. | last5 = Vásquez | first5 = Cristián | last6 = Wilson | first6 = Nathaniel J. | year = 2010 | title = Glaciation as a destructive and constructive control on mountain building | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 467 | issue = 7313| pages = 313–317 | doi = 10.1038/nature09365 | pmid = 20844534 |bibcode = 2010Natur.467..313T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice can not only erode mountains but also protect them from erosion. Depending on glacier regime, even steep alpine lands can be preserved through time with the help of ice. Scientists have proved this theory by sampling eight summits of northwestern Svalbard using Be10 and Al26, showing that northwestern Svalbard transformed from a glacier-erosion state under relatively mild glacial maxima temperature, to a glacier-armor state occupied by cold-based, protective ice during much colder glacial maxima temperatures as the Quaternary ice age progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gjermundsen|first=Endre F.|last2=Briner|first2=Jason P.|last3=Akçar|first3=Naki|last4=Foros|first4=Jørn|last5=Kubik|first5=Peter W.|last6=Salvigsen|first6=Otto|last7=Hormes|first7=Anne|title=Minimal erosion of Arctic alpine topography during late Quaternary glaciation|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=8|issue=10|pages=789|doi=10.1038/ngeo2524|bibcode=2015NatGe...8..789G|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes, combined with erosion and transport by the water network beneath the glacier, leave behind [[glacial landform]]s such as [[moraine]]s, [[drumlin]]s, ground moraine (till), kames, kame deltas, moulins, and [[glacial erratic]]s in their wake, typically at the terminus or during [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, A.

The best-developed glacial valley morphology appears to be restricted to landscapes with low rock uplift rates (less than or equal to 2&amp;nbsp;mm per year) and high relief, leading to long-turnover times. Where rock uplift rates exceed 2&amp;nbsp;mm per year, glacial valley morphology has generally been significantly modified in postglacial time. Interplay of glacial erosion and tectonic forcing governs the morphologic impact of glaciations on active orogens, by both influencing their height, and by altering the patterns of erosion during subsequent glacial periods via a link between rock uplift and valley cross-sectional shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prasicek|first=Günther|last2=Larsen|first2=Isaac J.|last3=Montgomery|first3=David R.|date=2015-08-14|title=Tectonic control on the persistence of glacially sculpted topography|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms9028|issn=2041-1723| pmc=4557346 |pmid=26271245|page=8028|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8028P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===

At extremely high flows, [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]]s, or [[vortex|vortices]] are formed by large volumes of rapidly rushing water. Kolks cause extreme local erosion, plucking bedrock and creating pothole-type geographical features called [[Rock-cut basin]]s. Examples can be seen in the flood regions result from glacial [[Lake Missoula]], which created the [[channeled scablands]] in the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] region of eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|author=Alt, David|title=Glacial Lake Missoula &amp; its Humongous Floods

===Wind erosion===
[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|[[Árbol de Piedra]], a rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]] sculpted by wind erosion]]
{{main article|Aeolian processes}}
Wind erosion is a major [[geomorphological]] force, especially in [[arid region|arid]] and [[semi-arid region|semi-arid]] regions. It is also a major source of land degradation, evaporation, desertification, harmful airborne dust, and crop damage—especially after being increased far above natural rates by human activities such as [[deforestation]], [[urbanization]], and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Zheng, Xiaojing &amp; Huang, Ning|title=Mechanics of Wind-Blown Sand Movements|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-88253-4|pages=7–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6kYrbA3XSAC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelis, Wim S.|chapter=Hydroclimatology of wind erosion in arid and semi-arid environments|editors=D'Odorico, Paolo &amp; Porporato, Amilcare|title=Dryland Ecohydrology|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4261-4|page=141|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUsUPZbFHK8C&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind erosion is of two primary varieties: ''[[Aeolian processes#Wind erosion|deflation]]'', where the wind picks up and carries away loose particles; and ''[[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]'', where surfaces are worn down as they are struck by airborne particles carried by wind. Deflation is divided into three categories: (1) ''[[Downhill creep|surface creep]]'', where larger, heavier particles slide or roll along the ground; (2) ''[[Saltation (geology)|saltation]]'', where particles are lifted a short height into the air, and bounce and saltate across the surface of the soil; and (3) ''[[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]'', where very small and light particles are lifted into the air by the wind, and are often carried for long distances. Saltation is responsible for the majority (50-70%) of wind erosion, followed by suspension (30-40%), and then surface creep (5-25%).&lt;ref name=BlancoWind&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blanco-Canqui|first1=Humberto|last2=Rattan|first2=Lal|chapter=Wind erosion|title=Principles of soil conservation and management|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402087097|pages=54&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Balba, A.

Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the [[Great Plains]], it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiggs, Giles F.S.|chapter=Geomorphological hazards in drylands|editor=Thomas, David S.G.|title=Arid Zone Geomorphology: Process, Form and Change in Drylands|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-71076-0|page=588|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swz4rh4KaLYC&amp;pg=PA588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass movement===
[[File:NegevWadi2009.JPG|thumb|A [[wadi]] in [[Makhtesh Ramon]], Israel, showing gravity collapse erosion on its banks]]
''[[Mass wasting|Mass movement]]'' is the downward and outward movement of rock and sediments on a sloped surface, mainly due to the force of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Van Beek, Rens|chapter=Hillside processes: mass wasting, slope stability, and erosion|editors=Norris, Joanne E. et al|title=Slope Stability and Erosion Control: Ecotechnological Solutions|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6675-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWPcffxM_A0C&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gray, Donald H. &amp; Sotir, Robbin B.|chapter=Surficial erosion and mass movement|title=Biotechnical and Soil Bioengineering Slope Stabilization: A Practical Guide for Erosion Control|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1996|isbn=978-0-471-04978-4|page=20|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCbp6IvFHrAC&amp;pg=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass movement is an important part of the erosional process and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{cite book|author=Nichols, Gary|title=Sedimentology and Stratigraphy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-9379-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|93}} It moves material from higher elevations to lower elevations where other eroding agents such as streams and [[glacier]]s can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations. Mass-movement processes are always occurring continuously on all slopes; some mass-movement processes act very slowly; others occur very suddenly, often with disastrous results. Any perceptible down-slope movement of rock or sediment is often referred to in general terms as a [[landslide]]. However, landslides can be classified in a much more detailed way that reflects the mechanisms responsible for the movement and the velocity at which the movement occurs. One of the visible topographical manifestations of a very slow form of such activity is a [[scree]] slope.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

''[[Slump (geology)|Slumping]]'' happens on steep hillsides, occurring along distinct fracture zones, often within materials like [[clay]] that, once released, may move quite rapidly downhill. They will often show a spoon-shaped [[isostatic depression]], in which the material has begun to slide downhill. In some cases, the slump is caused by water beneath the slope weakening it. In many cases it is simply the result of poor engineering along [[highway]]s where it is a regular occurrence.&lt;ref name="P.2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivashanmugam, P.|title=Basics of Environmental Science and Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJ31ycKQeEC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2007|publisher=New India Publishing|isbn=978-81-89422-28-8|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surface creep'' is the slow movement of soil and rock debris by gravity which is usually not perceptible except through extended observation. However, the term can also describe the rolling of dislodged soil particles {{convert|0.5|to|1.0|mm|abbr=on|2}} in diameter by wind along the soil surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.eb.com/levels/referencecenter/article/27828|title=Britannica Library|website=library.eb.com|language=English|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting erosion rates==

===Climate===
{{see also|Climatic geomorphology}}
The amount and intensity of [[rainfall|precipitation]] is the main [[Climate|climatic factor]] governing soil erosion by water. The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by [[vegetation]]. This might be during periods when [[agriculture|agricultural activities]] leave the soil bare, or in [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.

In some areas of the world (e.g. the [[Midwestern United States|mid-western USA]]), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity (for a definition of ''erosivity'' check,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Natural Hazards|last=Zorn|first=Matija|last2=Komac|first2=Blaž|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048186990|editor-last=Bobrowsky|editor-first=Peter T.|series=Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series|pages=289–290|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4399-4_121}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of [[rain drop]]s is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater [[kinetic energy]], and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.&lt;ref name=BlancoWater&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blanco-Canqui|first1=Humberto|last2=Rattan|first2=Lal|chapter=Water erosion|title=Principles of soil conservation and management|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402087097|pages=21&amp;ndash;53}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

In other regions of the world (e.g. [[Western europe|western Europe]]), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of [[Precipitation types#Stratiform|stratiform rainfall]] falling onto the previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water.&lt;ref name=Boardman/&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], where typhoon frequency increased significantly in the 21st century, a strong link has been drawn between the increase in storm frequency with an increase in sediment load in rivers and reservoirs, highlighting the impacts [[climate change]] can have on erosion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=David R.|last2=Huang|first2=Michelle Y.-F.|last3=Huang|first3=Alice Y.-L.|date=2014-01-01|title=Regional soil erosion in response to land use and increased typhoon frequency and intensity, Taiwan|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/div-classtitleregional-soil-erosion-in-response-to-land-use-and-increased-typhoon-frequency-and-intensity-taiwandiv/377D2EDD04D595F781FC81F2D064D37A|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–20|doi=10.1016/j.yqres.2013.10.005|issn=0033-5894|bibcode=2014QuRes..81...15M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetative cover===
{{See also|Vegetation and slope stability}}
Vegetation acts as an interface between the atmosphere and the soil. It increases the [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the soil to rainwater, thus decreasing runoff. It shelters the soil from winds, which results in decreased wind erosion, as well as advantageous changes in microclimate. The roots of the plants bind the soil together, and interweave with other roots, forming a more solid mass that is less susceptible to both water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyssels|first=G.|last2=Poesen|first2=J.|last3=Bochet|first3=E.|last4=Li|first4=Y.|date=2005-06-01|title=Impact of plant roots on the resistance of soils to erosion by water: a review|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=189–217|doi=10.1191/0309133305pp443ra|issn=0309-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wind erosion. The removal of vegetation increases the rate of surface erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Styczen, M.E. &amp; Morgan, R.P.C.|chapter=Engineering properties of vegetation|editors=Morgan, R.P.C. &amp; Rickson, R.

===Topography===
The topography of the land determines the velocity at which [[surface runoff]] will flow, which in turn determines the erosivity of the runoff. Longer, steeper slopes (especially those without adequate vegetative cover) are more susceptible to very high rates of erosion during heavy rains than shorter, less steep slopes. Steeper terrain is also more prone to mudslides, landslides, and other forms of gravitational erosion processes.&lt;ref name=BlancoWater/&gt;{{rp|28–30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whisenant, Steve G.|chapter=Terrestrial systems|editors=Perrow Michael R. &amp; Davy, Anthony J.|title=Handbook of Ecological Restoration: Principles of Restoration|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-04983-2|page=89|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moJHjZ9qW_8C&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Wainwright, John &amp; Brazier, Richard E.|chapter=Slope systems|editor=Thomas, David S.G.|title=Arid Zone Geomorphology: Process, Form and Change in Drylands|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-71076-0|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swz4rh4KaLYC&amp;pg=PA209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tectonics===
{{Main article|Erosion and tectonics}}
Tectonic processes control rates and distributions of erosion at the Earth's surface. If the tectonic action causes part of the Earth's surface (e.g., a mountain range) to be raised or lowered relative to surrounding areas, this must necessarily change the gradient of the land surface. Because erosion rates are almost always sensitive to the local slope (see above), this will change the rates of erosion in the uplifted area. Active tectonics also brings fresh, unweathered rock towards the surface, where it is exposed to the action of erosion.

However, erosion can also affect tectonic processes. The removal by erosion of large amounts of rock from a particular region, and its deposition elsewhere, can result in a lightening of the load on the [[crust (geology)|lower crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Because tectonic processes are driven by gradients in the stress field developed in the crust, this unloading can in turn cause [[tectonic uplift|tectonic]] or [[isostasy|isostatic uplift]] in the region.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;{{rp|99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Burbank, Douglas W.  |author2=Anderson, Robert S.|chapter=Tectonic and surface uplift rates|title=Tectonic Geomorphology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4443-4504-9|pages=270–271|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83FuAvtSwE4C&amp;pg=PT270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it has been hypothesised that these twin feedbacks can act to localize and enhance zones of very rapid exhumation of deep crustal rocks beneath places on the Earth's surface with extremely high erosion rates, for example, beneath the extremely steep terrain of [[Nanga Parbat]] in the western [[Himalaya]]s. Such a place has been called a "[[River anticlines#Tectonic aneurysms|tectonic aneurysm]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zeitler, P. K. et al. (2001), Erosion, Himalayan Geodynamics, and the Geomorphology of Metamorphism, GSA Today, 11, 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Human land development, in forms including agricultural and urban development, is considered a significant factor in erosion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jie|date=2007-01-16|title=Rapid urbanization in China: A real challenge to soil protection and food security|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816206000920|journal=CATENA|series=Influences of rapid urbanization and industrialization on soil resource and its quality in China|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1016/j.catena.2006.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sediment transport]]. In Taiwan, increases in sediment load in the northern, central, and southern regions of the island can be tracked with the timeline of development for each region throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Erosion at various scales==

===Mountain ranges===
{{see also|denudation|planation}}
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
[[Mountain range]]s are known to take many millions of years to erode to the degree they effectively cease to exist. Scholars Pitman and Golovchenko estimate that it takes probably more than 450 million years to erode a mountain mass similar to the [[Himalaya]] into an almost-flat [[peneplain]] if there are no major [[Sea level#Change|sea-level change]]s.&lt;ref name="PitmanGolovchenko1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitman|first1=W.

Examples of heavily eroded mountain ranges include the [[Timanide Orogen|Timanides]] of Northern Russia. Erosion of this [[orogeny|orogen]] has produced [[sediment]]s that are now found in the [[East European Platform]], including the Cambrian [[Sablya Formation]] near [[Lake Ladoga]]. Studies of these sediments indicate that it is likely that the erosion of the orogen began in the Cambrian and then intensified in the [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref name=Orlovetal2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orlov |first=S.Yu. |last2=Kuznetsov |first2=N.B.|last3=Miller |first3=E.D.|last4=Soboleva |first4=A.A.|last5=Udoratina |first5=O.V. |date=2011 |title=Age Constraints for the Pre–Uralide–Timanide Orogenic Event Inferred from the Study of Detrital Zircons |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236585203 |journal=Doklady Earth Sciences |volume=440 |issue=1 |pages=1216–1221 |doi= 10.1134/s1028334x11090078|access-date=22 September 2015|bibcode = 2011DokES.440.1216O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
{{further information|soil erosion|pedogenesis}}
If the rate of erosion is higher than the rate of soil formation the soils are being destroyed by erosion.&lt;ref name=Migon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Lupia-Palmieri|first=Elvidio|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Erosion|year=2004|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where soil is not destroyed by erosion, erosion can in some cases prevent the formation of soil features that form slowly. [[Inceptisol]]s are common soils that form in areas of fast erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Earl B. |date=2014 |title=Soils in natural landscapes |url= |location= |publisher=CRC Press |page=108 |isbn=978-1-4665-9436-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While erosion of soils is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both "on-site" and "off-site" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in [[agricultural productivity]] and (on [[natural landscape]]s) [[ecological collapse]], both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper [[soil horizon|soil layers]]. In some cases, the eventual end result is [[desertification]]. Off-site effects include [[Sediment#Erosion and agricultural sediment delivery to rivers|sedimentation of waterways]] and [[eutrophication]] of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of [[land degradation]]; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant [[environmental problems]].&lt;ref name="toy-2002-p1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Soil and water conservation|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|page=2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13268">In transportation, an '''exhaust heat recovery system''' turns [[thermal loss]]es in the [[exhaust pipe]] into energy. This technology seems to be more and more of interest by car and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers as an efficient way to save fuel and reduce vehicles’ CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
This technology can be used either on a [[hybrid vehicle]] or a conventional one: it produces either electric energy for batteries or mechanical energy reintroduced on the [[crankshaft]].

== Principle ==
=== Thermal losses of an internal combustion engine ===
Even if current engines consume less fuel than they used to, the [[thermal efficiency]] of an [[internal combustion engine]] has not really increased since its creation. The peak efficiency reached by a 4-cycle [[Otto cycle]] engine is around 35%, which means that 65% of the energy contained in the fuel is lost as heat. High speed [[Diesel cycle]] engines fare better with around 45% peak efficiency, but are still far from their [[Carnot efficiency]], and hence 55% of the fuel energy content is lost.

== Exhaust heat recovery technologies ==

=== EGHR===

The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid car features an [[Exhaust gas]] Heat Recovery (EGHR) system to accelerate coolant heat up time. This gives faster heat up of the engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less fuel is used giving reduced emissions. This will also quicken cabin heating warm up for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can warm the battery pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system. When the engine is warmed up the exhaust gas is diverted to a by-pass pipe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-exhaust-gas-heat-recovery-feature-spotlight/ "2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery: Feature Spotlight"] By Aaron Brzozowski, GM Authority, April 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rankine ===
[[Rankine cycle]] systems vaporize pressurised water using a steam generator located in the exhaust pipe. As a result of the heating by exhaust gases, the fluid is turned into steam. The steam then drives the expander of the Rankine engine, either a turbine or pistons. This expander can be directly tied to the crankshaft of the thermal engine or linked to an [[alternator]] to generate electricity.

Researchers at Loughborough University and the University of Sussex, both in the UK, also have concluded that using [[waste heat]] from light-duty vehicle engines in a steam power cycle could deliver fuel economy advantages of between 6.3% and 31.7%, depending upon drive cycle, and that high efficiencies can be achieved at practical operating pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/bmw-rankine-20090503.html |title=BMW Study on Rankine Cycle for Waste Heat Recovery Shows Potential Additional 10% Power Output at Highway Speeds |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TEG ===
[[Thermoelectric generator]] are another option to recover heat from the exhaust pipe to reduce vehicles fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Birch |url=http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/10647 |title=Temperatures rise in BMW's work to recover engine waste heat |publisher=Sae.org |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.

* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

== Exhaust Heat Recovery on internal combustion engines with Rankine Cycle Systems ==
=== Passenger cars ===
Facing the new American, European, Japanese or Chinese regulation, more and more stringent concerning CO2 emissions, exhaust heat recovery sounds like one of the most efficient ways to recover a free energy, since heat is generated in many ways by the engine. Numerous companies develop system based upon a Rankine Cycle:

==== BMW ====
The German company has been one of the first major to study exhaust heat recovery with a Rankine system called [[Turbosteamer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/2005/12/11/bmw-turbosteamer/ |title=BMW TurboSteamer |publisher=Paultan.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Honda ====
[[Honda]] also develops a module based on a Rankine Cycle to improve overall efficiency of hybrid vehicles, by recovering the heat of the engine and turning it into electricity for the battery pack.
In the US highway cycle, the Rankine cycle system regenerated three times as much energy as the vehicle’s regenerative braking system.

==== Exoès ====
A French company, Exoès is specialized in designing and manufacturing exhaust heat recovery systems based on Rankine Cycles. The system EVE, Energy Via Exhaust, leads to fuel savings from 5 up to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoes.com/EN/exhaust-heat-recovery.html |title=EVE - Energy Via Exhaust - Exoès |publisher=Exoes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barber Nichols ====
Barber-Nichols Inc. develops Rankine technologies for vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barber-nichols.com/products/heat-engines/rankine-cycles |title=Organic Rankine Cycles |publisher=Barber Nichols |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== FVV ====
The German consortium unites the majority of internal combustion engine manufacturers across the world. Two task forces are currently studying exhaust heat recovery systems on passenger cars.

=== Trucks ===
Renault Trucks: As a part of the All For Fuel Eco Initiative, Renault Trucks studies a Rankine system for long distance vehicles that could lead to 10% fuel savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.renault-trucks.com/en/press-releases/the-renoter-project-reducing-consumption-by-recovering-heat-from-exhaust-gases.html |title=Renault Trucks Corporate : Press releases |publisher=Corporate.renault-trucks.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to produce enough energy to feed the components and electronic auxiliaries with electricity and reduce the fuel consumption by reducing the load on the alternator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinchallengebibendum.com/en/NEWS-AND-PUBLICATIONS/News/RENAULT-TRUCKS-Reducing-consumption-by-recovering-heat-from-exhaust-gases |title=Welcome on the Michelin Challenge Bibendum website |publisher=Michelinchallengebibendum.com |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double Arrow Engineering===
Double Arrow Engineering's WildFire Heat Recovery System (WFHRS) is underdevelopment and utilizes wasted heat from both coolant and exhaust. This system mechanically adds power back to the drive-line, utilizing a Rankine engine as the energy conversion method. The WFHRS is designed for a verity of different applications, both fixed and variable RPM, aftermarket and OEM applications, but generally geared toward larger equipment such as large on-highway trucks, diesel generators, large buses and motor-homes, marine vessels, medium duty trucks, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublearroweng.com/ |title=WFHRS |publisher=doublearroweng.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trains ===
IFPEN, Enogia and Alstom are developing a system called Trenergy dedicated to improve train [[fuel efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/actualites/communiques-de-presse/ifp-energies-nouvelles-pilote-le-nouveau-projet-anr-trenergy |title=Harnessing the Rankine cycle to recover exhaust gas heat and boost train energy efficiency |publisher=Ifpenergiesnouvelles.com |date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhaust heat recovery in sport ===
Fuel efficiency, reduction of CO2 emissions, reliability and costs are necessary parts of Formula 1 manufacturers’ strategies.
Automobile sport competitions is a good place to try and assess technologies that, once reliable, are adapted to private cars. As much as kinetic energy recovery system, Formula 1 constructors have produced one of the first exhaust heat recovery systems. Nowadays these devices are essential parts of embedded technologies on F1. Besides, heat recovery will be mandatory for the first time in 2014’s F1 Championship. Manufacturers, like Renault (ERS-H),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1technical.net/news/18188 |title=Renault takes lid off of 2014 F1 turbo engine |publisher=F1technical.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; test their systems, which also drives the turbo to improve its reactivity –and the torque at low regime- after braking.

A '''{{lang-it|Fata Morgana|italics=no|label=none}}''' ({{IPA-it|ˈfaːta morˈɡaːna|lang}}) is a complex form of [[Mirage#Superior mirage|superior mirage]] that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an Italian term named after the Arthurian sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]], from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the [[Strait of Messina]], were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths. Although the term Fata Morgana sometimes is applied to other more common kinds of mirages, true Fata Morgana is different from both an ordinary superior mirage and an [[inferior mirage]].

Fata Morgana mirages significantly distort the object or objects on which they are based, often such that the object is completely unrecognizable. A Fata Morgana may be seen on land or at sea, in polar regions, or in deserts. It may involve almost any kind of distant object, including boats, islands, and the coastline.

Often, a Fata Morgana changes rapidly. The mirage comprises several inverted (upside down) and erect (right side up) images that are stacked on top of one another. Fata Morgana mirages also show alternating compressed and stretched zones.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html An Introduction to Mirages] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[optical phenomenon]] occurs because rays of light are bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep [[temperature inversion|thermal inversion]] where an [[atmospheric duct]] has formed.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; (A thermal inversion is an atmospheric condition where warmer air exists in a well-defined layer above a layer of significantly cooler air. This temperature inversion is the opposite of what is normally the case; air is usually warmer close to the surface, and cooler higher up.)

In calm weather, a layer of significantly warmer air may rest over colder dense air, forming an atmospheric duct that acts like a refracting [[lens (optics)|lens]], producing a series of both inverted and erect images. A Fata Morgana requires a duct to be present; thermal inversion alone is not enough to produce this kind of mirage. While a thermal inversion often takes place without there being an atmospheric duct, an atmospheric duct cannot exist without there first being a thermal inversion.

==Observing a Fata Morgana==
[[File:Fada morgana graphnn.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Schematic diagram explaining the Fata Morgana mirage]]
A Fata Morgana is most commonly seen in [[polar region]]s, especially over large sheets of ice that have a uniform low temperature. It may, however, be observed in almost any area. In polar regions the Fata Morgana phenomenon is observed on relatively cold days. In deserts, over oceans, and over lakes, however, a Fata Morgana may be observed on hot days.

To generate the Fata Morgana phenomenon, the [[temperature inversion|thermal inversion]] has to be strong enough that the curvature of the light rays within the inversion layer is stronger than the curvature of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; Under these conditions, the rays bend and create [[arc (geometry)|arc]]s. An observer needs to be within or below an [[atmospheric duct]] in order to be able to see a Fata Morgana.&lt;ref name="Atmospheric Optics Glossary"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/glossary.html#duct Atmospheric Optics Glossary] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;

A Fata Morgana may be observed from any altitude within the [[Earth's atmosphere]], from sea level up to mountaintops, and even including the view from airplanes.&lt;ref name=" `SUPERIOR MIRAGE of cumulus cloudtop from airplane"&gt;{{cite book|title=Met. Mag. 85| last= Durst and Bull|year=1956| pages=237–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc."&gt;{{cite book|title=Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc.| last= Andrew| first=Young| url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/bibliog.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Farallons islands miragep.jpg|A sequence of a Fata Morgana of the [[Farallon Islands]] as seen from San Francisco|thumb|250px]]A Fata Morgana may be described as a very complex superior [[mirage]] with more than three distorted erect and inverted images.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; Because of the constantly changing conditions of the atmosphere, a Fata Morgana may change in various ways within just a few seconds of time, including changing to become a straightforward superior mirage.

The sequential image here shows sixteen photographic frames of a mirage of the [[Farallon Islands]] as seen from San Francisco; the images were all taken on the same day.

In the first fourteen frames, elements of the Fata Morgana mirage display alternations of compressed and stretched zones.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; The last two frames were photographed a few hours later, around sunset time. At that point in time, the air was cooler while the ocean was probably a little bit warmer, which caused the [[temperature inversion|thermal inversion]] to be not as extreme as it was few hours before. A mirage was still present at that point, but it was not so complex as a few hours before sunset: the mirage was no longer a Fata Morgana, but instead had become a simple superior mirage.

Fata Morgana mirages are visible to the naked eye, but in order to be able to see the detail within them, it is best to view them through [[binoculars]], a [[telescope]], or as is the case in the images here, through a [[telephoto lens]].

[[Gabriel Gruber]] (1740–1805) and {{ill|Tobias Gruber|sl|Tobija Gruber}} (1744–1806), who observed Fata Morgana above [[Lake Cerknica]], were the first to study it in a laboratory setting.

==Etymology==
[[File:Sandown Bay in fair weather, 18 June 2017.jpg|thumb|A Fata Morgana at [[Sandown Bay]]; the freighter in the distance appears to be floating above the horizon as a result of the mirage]]
"La Fata Morgana" ("The Fairy Morgana") is the name of [[Morgan le Fay]] in Italian. Morgan le Fay, also known as Morgane, Morgain, Morgana, and other variants, was described as a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] and [[antagonist]] of [[King Arthur]] and [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]] in the [[Arthurian legend]].

As her name indicates, the figure of Morgan appears to have been originally a [[fairy]] (Fata, Le Fay) rather than a human woman. The early works featuring Morgan do not elaborate on her nature, other than describing her role as that of a fairy or [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]. Later, she was described as a woman, King Arthur's half-sister, and an enchantress.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1978). "Morgan le Fay." In ''Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', p. 303. New York: Pantheon. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After King Arthur's final battle at [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]], Morgan le Fay takes her half-brother Arthur to [[Avalon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 274–75&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval times, suggestions for the location of Avalon included the other side of the Earth at the [[antipodes]], Sicily, and other locations in the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="Lacy"&gt;Avalon in Norris J. Lacy, Editor, The Arthurian Encyclopedia (1986 Peter Bedrick Books, New York).&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends claimed that [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s in the waters around [[Sicily]] lured the unwary to their death. Morgan le Fay is associated not only with [[Mount Etna|Etna]], but also with sirens. In a medieval French Arthurian Romance, ''Floriant et Florete'', she is called "mistress of the fairies of the salt sea" (''La mestresse [des] fées de la mer salée''.)&lt;ref name="Vanishing Tricks of a Goddess "&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/magnorth_writing/ournonfictionimogen.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:06:09 Vanishing Tricks of a Goddess] by [[Imogen Rhia Herrad]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since that time, Fata Morgana has been associated with Sicily.&lt;ref name="The Sea-side Companion, Or, Marine Natural History "&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=djfKO-3WoYcC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=The+sun+had+just+surmounted+the+hill+behind+Reggio+fata+morgana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8h8z-YGv0&amp;sig=mCgbxJlcMs-_eV40kIr2cb8iEF8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1 The Sea-side Companion, Or, Marine Natural History] p. 33 by Mary Roberts''&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:The Fata Morgana, As Observed In The Harbour Of Messina.png|An 1844 drawing entitled ''The Fata Morgana, As Observed in the Harbour of Messina''|250px|thumb]]

{{Quotation|It was summer, early in July, the morning calm and delightful; the winds were hushed and the face of the bay remarkably smooth—the tide at its full height, and the waters elevated in the middle of the channel. The sun had just surmounted the hill behind Reggio, and formed an angle of forty-five degrees on the noble expanse of water which extends before the city. Suddenly the sea that washes the Sicilian shores presented the aspect of a range of dark mountains while that on the Calabrian coast appeared like a clear polished mirror, which reflected and multiplied every object existing or moving at Reggio, with the addition of a range of more than a thousand giant pilasters, equal in altitude, distance, and degree of light and shade. In a moment they lost half their height, and bent into arcades, like those of a Roman aqueduct. A long cornice was then formed on the top, and above it rose innumerable castles, which presently divided into towers, and shortly afterwords into magnificent colonnades. To these succeeded a sweep of windows; then came pines and cypresses, and innumerable shrubs and trees: in shadier places,

:"Pan or Sylvanus never slept;
:nor nymph Nor Faunus haunted."

This glorious vision continued in full beauty till the sun was considerably advanced in the heavens; it then vanished in the twinkling of an eye; and instead of pilasters, groves, and colonnades, nothing was to be seen but the mountains of Reggio, Messina, and a beautiful expanse of water, reflecting its cultivated shores, and the cattle that were grazing on its banks.}}

[[Walter Charleton]], in his 1654 treatise "Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana", devotes several pages to the description of the Morgana of Rhegium, in the Strait of Messina (Book III, Chap. II, Sect. II). He records that a similar phenomenon was reported in Africa by [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Greek historian writing in the first century BC, and that the Rhegium Fata Morgana was described by [[Damascius]], a Greek Philosopher of the sixth century AD. In addition, Charleton tells us that [[Athanasius Kircher]] described the Rhegium mirage in his book of travels.

An early mention of the term ''Fata Morgana'' in English, in 1818, referred to such a mirage noticed in the [[Strait of Messina]], between [[Calabria]] and Sicily.&lt;ref name="The Stanford Dictionary of Anglicised Words and Phrases"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4sSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=fata+morgana+in+English,+in+1818&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BrbVysn5q-&amp;sig=FETxiZFoatvgQUdIqhYWsoKmWKo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result The Stanford Dictionary of Anglicised Words and Phrases]'', page 388, by Charles Augustus Maude Fennell, [[John Frederick Stanford]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Famous legends and observations==

===The Flying Dutchman===
{{Main|Flying Dutchman}}
The [[Flying Dutchman]], according to [[folklore]], is a [[List of ghost ships|ghost ship]] that can never go home, and is doomed to sail the [[seven seas|oceans]] forever. The Flying Dutchman is usually spotted from afar, sometimes seen to be glowing with ghostly light. One of the possible explanations of the origin of the Flying Dutchman legend is a Fata Morgana mirage seen at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011).

[[File:Superior mirage of the boats painting.jpg|thumb|250px|A nineteenth-century book illustration, showing enlarged superior mirages; mirages can never be so far above the horizon, and a superior mirage can never increase the length of an object as shown on the right]]

A Fata Morgana superior mirage of a ship can take many different forms. Even when the boat in the mirage does not seem to be suspended in the air, it still looks ghostly, and unusual, and what is even more important, it is ever-changing in its appearance. Sometimes a Fata Morgana causes a ship to appear to float inside the waves, at other times an inverted ship appears to sail above its real companion.

In fact, with a Fata Morgana it can be hard to say which individual segment of the mirage is real and which is not real: when a real ship is out of sight because it is below the horizon line, a Fata Morgana can cause the image of it to be elevated, and then everything which is seen by the observer is a mirage. On the other hand, if the real ship is still above the horizon, the image of it can be duplicated many times and elaborately distorted by a Fata Morgana.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fata Morgana mirages may have played a role in a number of unrelated "discoveries" of [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] land masses which were later shown not to exist. [[Iceberg]]s frozen into the [[sea ice|pack ice]], or the uneven surface of the ice itself, may have contributed to the illusion of distant land features.

====Sannikov Land====
{{Main|Sannikov Land}}
[[Yakov Sannikov]] and [[Matvei Gedenschtrom]] claimed to have seen a land mass north of [[Kotelny Island]] during their 1809–1810 cartographic expedition to the [[New Siberian Islands]]. Sannikov reported this sighting of a "new land" in 1811, and the supposed island was named after him.&lt;ref name=Mills1&gt;Mills, W. J., 2003, ''Exploring polar frontiers: a historical encyclopedia.'' ABC CLIO Publishers, Oxford, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; Three-quarters of a century later, in 1886, Baron [[Eduard Toll]], a [[Baltic German]] explorer in Russian service, reported observing Sannikov Land during another expedition to the New Siberian Islands. In 1900, he would lead [[Russian polar expedition of 1900–02|still another expedition to the region]], which had among its objectives the location and exploration of Sannikov Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=Zyryanov| author = Zyryanov P.N.|title = Адмирал Колчак, верховный правитель России|trans-title=Admiral Kolchak, the supreme ruler of Russia|edition = 4th| place = Moscow|publisher = Molodaya Guardia|year = 2012|volume=1356|pages=41–42|isbn = 978-5-235-03375-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was unsuccessful in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=Zyryanov| author = Zyryanov P.N.|title = Адмирал Колчак, верховный правитель России|trans-title=Admiral Kolchak, the supreme ruler of Russia|edition = 4th| place = Moscow|publisher = Molodaya Guardia|year = 2012|volume=1356|page=60|isbn = 978-5-235-03375-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toll and three others were lost after they departed their ship, which was stuck in ice for the winter, and embarked on a risky expedition by dog sled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=Zyryanov| author = Zyryanov P.N.|title = Адмирал Колчак, верховный правитель России|trans-title=Admiral Kolchak, the supreme ruler of Russia|edition = 4th| place = Moscow|publisher = Molodaya Guardia|year = 2012|volume=1356|pages=77–78|isbn = 978-5-235-03375-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the Soviet [[icebreaker Sadko|icebreaker ''Sadko'']] also tried and failed to find Sannikov Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=Indiana Progress |date=19 Aug 1936 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S.S.R.

====Croker Mountains====
In 1818, [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] led an expedition to discover the long-sought-after [[Northwest Passage]]. When he reached [[Lancaster Sound]] in Canada, he sighted, in the distance, a land mass with mountains, directly ahead in the ship's course. He named the mountain range the Croker Mountains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/northwest-passage/croker-mountains.htm|title=Croker Mountains|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Secretary to the Admiralty|First Secretary to the Admiralty]] [[John Wilson Croker]], and ordered the ship to turn around and return to England. Several of his officers protested, including First Mate [[William Edward Parry]] and [[Edward Sabine]], but they could not dissuade him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/2/24/h24-1810-e.html John Ross – The Arctic and More – 19th century – Pathfinders and Passageways] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214071623/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/2/24/h24-1810-e.html |date=14 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The account of Ross's voyage, published a year later, brought to light this disagreement, and the ensuing controversy over the existence of the Croker Mountains ruined Ross's reputation. The year after Ross's expedition, in 1819, Parry was given command of his own Arctic expedition, and proved Ross wrong by continuing west beyond where Ross had turned back, and sailing through the supposed location of the Croker Mountains. The mountain range that had caused Ross to abandon his mission had been a mirage. 

Ross made two errors. First, he refused to listen to the counsel of his officers, who must have been more familiar with mirages than he was. Second, his attempt to honour Croker by naming a mountain range after him backfired when the mountains turned out to be non-existent. Ross could not obtain ships, or funds, from the government for his subsequent expeditions, and was forced to rely on private backers instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athropolis.com/arctic-facts/fact-mirage.htm|title=Superior Mirage|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Greenland====
{{Main|New South Greenland}}
[[Benjamin Morrell]] reported that, in March 1823, while on a voyage to the Antarctic and southern Pacific Ocean, he had explored what he thought was the east coast of New South Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Morrell|first= Benjamin|title= A Narrative of Four Voyages ... etc|url= https://books.google.com/?id=g0AGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Benjamin+Morrell&amp;printsec=frontcover|publisher= J &amp; J Harper|location= New York|year= 1832|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The west coast of New South Greenland had been explored two years earlier by Robert Johnson, who had given the land its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Mills|first=William James|title= Exploring Polar Frontiers|url= https://books.google.com/?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq=Morrell+Land|publisher= ABC-CLIO|location= Santa Barbara|year= 2003|isbn= 1-57607-422-6|pages= 434–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was not adopted, however, and the area, which is the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, is now known as [[Graham Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Hugh Robert Mill|last= Mill|first= Hugh Robert|title= The Siege of the South Pole|publisher= [[Alston Rivers]]|location= London|year= 1905|pages= 161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell's reported position was actually far to the east of Graham Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Hugh Robert Mill|last= Mill|first= Hugh Robert|title= The Siege of the South Pole|publisher= [[Alston Rivers]]|location= London|year= 1905|page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches for the land that Morrell claimed to have explored would continue into the early 20th century before New South Greenland's existence was conclusively disproven.

====Crocker Land====
{{Main|Crocker Land Expedition}}
[[Robert Peary]] claimed to have seen, while on a 1906 Arctic expedition, a land mass in the distance. He said that it was north-west from the highest point of [[Cape Thomas Hubbard]], which is situated in what is now the northern Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]], and he estimated it to be 130 miles away, at about 83 degrees N, longitude 100 degrees W. He named it Crocker Land, after George Crocker of the Peary Arctic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiaa.org/urbana/illinoisalumni/0108_b.html|title=UI Alumni Association – Welcome|publisher= Alumni &amp; Friends!|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Peary's diary contradicts his public claim that he had sighted land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#crck |title=Contributions |author=Rawlins, Dennis |accessdate=2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now believed that Crocker Land was a fraudulent invention of Peary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Wretched and Precarious Situation: In Search of the Last Arctic Frontier |publisher= |author=David Welky |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created in an unsuccessful attempt to secure further funding from Crocker.

In 1913, unaware that Crocker Land was merely an invention, [[Donald Baxter MacMillan]] organised the Crocker Land Expedition, which set out to reach and explore the supposed land mass. On 21 April the members of the expedition did, in fact, see what appeared to be a huge island on the north-western horizon. As MacMillan later said, "Hills, valleys, snow-capped peaks extending through at least one hundred and twenty degrees of the horizon.”

Piugaattoq, a member of the expedition and an Inuit hunter with 20 years of experience of the area, explained that it was just an illusion. He called it ''poo-jok'', which means '[[mist]]'. However, MacMillan insisted that they press on, even though it was late in the season and the sea ice was breaking up. For five days they went on, following the mirage. Finally, on 27 April, after they had covered some {{convert|125|mi|km}} of dangerous sea ice, MacMillan was forced to admit that Piugaattoq was right—the land that they had sighted was in fact a mirage (probably a Fata Morgana).  

Later MacMillan wrote:

{{Quotation|The day was exceptionally clear, not a cloud or trace of mist; if land could be seen, now was our time. Yes, there it was! It could even be seen without a glass, extending from southwest true to north-northeast. Our powerful glasses, however, brought out more clearly the dark background in contrast with the white, the whole resembling hills, valleys and snow-capped peaks to such a degree that, had we not been out on the frozen sea for 150 miles, we would have staked our lives upon its reality. Our judgment then, as now, is that this was a mirage or loom of the sea ice.|title=from ''Four Years in the White North''&lt;ref name="Four Years in the White North"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacMillan|first1=Donald Baxter|last2=Ekblaw|first2=Walter Elmer|title=Four Years in the White North|date=1918|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|pages=87–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkUNAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=FOUR+YEARS+WHITE+NORTH+MACMILLAN&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz9aP9nIfaAhVEKWMKHUmJBiEQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=MIRAGE%20LOOM&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The expedition collected interesting samples, but is still considered to be a failure and a very expensive mistake.

In July 1866, mirages of boats and islands were seen from [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Mirage "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/19115/data|title=Daily News (Kingston, ON), July 9, 1866: Maritime History of the Great Lakes|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|A Mirage – The atmospheric phenomenon known as "mirage" might have been observed on Sunday evening between 6 and 7 o'clock, by looking towards the lake. The line beyond which this phenomenon was observable seemed to strike from about the middle portion of Amherst Island across to the southeast, for while the lower half of the island presented its usual appearance, the upper half was unnaturally distorted and thrown upward in columnar shape with an apparent height of two to three hundred feet. The upper line or cloud from this elevation stretched southward, upon which was thrown the image of objects. A barque sailing in front of this cloud presented a double appearance. While she appeared slightly distorted on the surface of the water, her image was inverted upon the background of the cloud referred to, and both blending together produced a curious sight. At the same time the ship and its shadow were again repeated in a more shadowy form, but distinct, in the foreground, the base being a line of smooth water. Another bark whose hull was entirely below the horizon, the topsails alone being visible, had its hull shadowed on this foreground, but no inversion in this case could be observed. It may be added that these optical phenomena in regard to the vessels could only be seen with the aid of a telescope, for the nearest vessel was at the time fully sixteen miles distant. The phenomena lasted over an hour, the illusion changing every moment in its character.
}}
Here the described mirages of vessels "could only be seen with the aid of a [[telescope]]". It is often the case when observing a Fata Morgana that one needs to use a [[telescope]] or [[binoculars]] to really make out the mirage. The "cloud" that the article mentions a few times probably refers to a [[Atmospheric duct|duct]].

{{Quotation|The people of Buffalo, N.Y., were treated to a remarkable mirage, between ten and eleven o'clock, on the morning of August 16, [1894]. It was the city of Toronto with its harbor and small island to the south of the city. Toronto is fifty–six miles from Buffalo, but the church spires could be counted with the greatest ease. The mirage took in the whole breadth of Lake Ontario, Charlotte, the suburbs of Rochester, being recognized as a projection east of Toronto. A side–wheel steamer could be seen traveling in a line from Charlotte to Toronto Bay. Two dark objects were at last found to be the steamers of the New York Central plying between Lewiston and Toronto. A sail-boat was also visible and disappeared suddenly. Slowly the mirage began to fade away, to the disappointment of thousands who crowded the roofs of houses and office buildings. A bank of clouds was the cause of the disappearance of the mirage. A close examination of the map showed the mirage did not cause the slightest distortion, the gradual rise of the city from the water being rendered perfectly. It is estimated that at least 20,000 spectators saw the novel spectacle.
This mirage is what is known as that of the third order; that is, the object looms up far above the level and not inverted, as with mirages of the first and second orders, but appearing like a perfect landscape far away in the sky.|source=''Scientific American'', August 25, 1894.

A Fata Morgana can display an object that is located below the astronomical [[horizon]] as an apparent object hovering in the sky. A Fata Morgana can also magnify such an object vertically and make it look absolutely unrecognizable.

Some UFOs which are seen on [[radar]] may also be due to Fata Morgana mirages.

{{Quotation|
As is well known, atmospheric ducting is the explanation for certain optical mirages, and in particular the arctic illusion called "fata morgana" where distant ocean or surface ice, which is essentially flat, appears to the viewer in the form of vertical columns and spires, or "castles in the air." 

People often assume that mirages occur only rarely. This may be true of optical mirages, but conditions for radar mirages are more common, due to the role played by water vapor which strongly affects the atmospheric refractivity in relation to radio waves. Since clouds are closely associated with high levels of water vapor, optical mirages due to water vapor are often rendered undetectable by the accompanying opaque cloud. On the other hand, radar propagation is essentially unaffected by the water droplets of the cloud so that changes in water vapor content with altitude are very effective in producing atmospheric ducting and radar mirages.}}

{{Quotation|FATA MORGANA &lt;br /&gt;published in 1873 by&lt;br /&gt;[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O sweet illusions of song&lt;br /&gt;That tempt me everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;In the lonely fields, and the throng&lt;br /&gt;Of the crowded thoroughfare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approach and ye vanish away,&lt;br /&gt;I grasp you, and ye are gone;&lt;br /&gt;But ever by night and by day,&lt;br /&gt;The melody soundeth on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weary traveler sees&lt;br /&gt;In desert or prairie vast,&lt;br /&gt;Blue lakes, overhung with trees&lt;br /&gt;That a pleasant shadow cast;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair towns with turrets high,&lt;br /&gt;And shining roofs of gold,&lt;br /&gt;That vanish as he draws nigh,&lt;br /&gt;Like mists together rolled—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wander and wander along,&lt;br /&gt;And forever before me gleams&lt;br /&gt;The shining city of song,&lt;br /&gt;In the beautiful land of dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I would enter the gate&lt;br /&gt;Of that golden atmosphere,&lt;br /&gt;It is gone, and I wonder and wait&lt;br /&gt;For the vision to reappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwlongfellow.org/poems_poem.php?pid=147|title=Longfellow: Fata Morgana, Birds of Passage|date=17 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the lines, "the weary traveller sees / In desert or prairie vast, / Blue lakes, overhung with trees / That a pleasant shadow cast", because of the mention of blue lakes, it is clear that the author is actually describing not a Fata Morgana, but rather a common inferior or [[desert]] mirage. The 1886 drawing shown here of a "Fata Morgana" in a desert might have been an imaginative illustration for the poem, but in reality no mirage ever looks like this. Andy Young writes, "They're always confined to a narrow strip of sky—less than a finger's width at arm's length—at the horizon."&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt;

The 18th-century poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] wrote about "Fata Morgana's castles in the air". The idea of castles in the air was probably so irresistible that many languages still use the phrase Fata Morgana to describe a mirage.&lt;ref name="Vanishing Tricks of a Goddess "/&gt;

In the book ''Thunder Below!'' about the submarine [[USS Barb (SS-220)|USS ''Barb'']], the crew sees a Fata Morgana (called an "arctic mirage" in the book) of four ships trapped in the ice. As they try to approach the ships the mirage vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thunder Below!: The USS ''Barb'' Revolutionizes Submarine Warfare in World War II|last=Fluckey|first=Eugene B.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0252066702|location=|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fata Morgana is briefly mentioned in the [[HP Lovecraft]] horror novel ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', in which the narrator states: "On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid mirage—the first I had ever seen—in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= At The Mountains of Madness|last= |first= |date= |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Genesis I''''' is an experimental [[space habitat]] designed and built by the private American firm [[Bigelow Aerospace]] and launched in 2006. It was the first module to be sent into orbit by the company, and is testing various systems, materials and techniques related to determining the viability of long-term [[inflatable space habitat|inflatable space structures]]. Such structures, including this module and others built by Bigelow Aerospace, are based on the [[NASA]] [[TransHab]] design, which provides increased interior volume at a reduced launch diameter and potentially reduced mass compared to traditional rigid structures.

The on-board systems transmitted data for 2.5 years. The spacecraft remains in orbit, which allows researchers to continue testing the long-term viability of expandable space structures.

== Spacecraft history ==
&lt;!--This section will require new content as additional flight events are made public. Compile a list on the talk page before directly adding events, so as to determine exactly what is notable enough to go here. When adding new material, please place in a timeline sequence.--&gt;

''Genesis I'' was launched on 12 July 2006 at 14:53:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] aboard an [[ISC Kosmotras]] [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]], launched from [[Dombarovsky (air base)|Dombarovskiy missile base]] near [[Yasny, Orenburg Oblast|Yasniy]], Russia. Spacecraft control was transferred to Bigelow Aerospace at 15:08 UTC after a successful orbital insertion.&lt;ref name="RSWdnepr1" /&gt; Designed as a one-third scale model of the full size ''[[BA 330]]'', when in orbit the main body of the craft measures {{convert|4.4|m|ft|1|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2.54|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter, with an interior habitable volume of {{convert|11.5|m3|1|sp=us}}. As part of the expandable design, however, the module launched with a diameter of only {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}}, inflating to its full size after entering orbit.&lt;ref name="BAnews070628-1" /&gt; The expansion process took approximately ten minutes.&lt;ref name="space060721" /&gt;

''Genesis I'' suffered a major radiation event in December 2006 as a result of a "[[Geomagnetic storm|solar storm]]". Mission controllers were able to restart the system in time, though the situation was described as being "one fault away from the spacecraft being dead." Despite this, no lasting damage appears to have occurred and the spacecraft was operating in "excellent shape" {{as of|2007|03|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="space070326" /&gt;

The spacecraft completed its 10,000th orbit on 8 May 2008, some 660 days after launch. By that time, ''Genesis I'' had traveled more than 430 million kilometers (270 million miles), the equivalent of going to the Moon and back 1,154 times, and had taken more than 14,000 images, including images of all seven continents. Its electrical equipment had been continuously powered since it first became operational.&lt;ref name="space080509" /&gt;

Although the design life of the spacecraft avionics was only six months, the avionics systems worked flawlessly for "over two and a half years" before failure. The data received after the first six months was a re-verification of the validation test suite that was accomplished during the design life period.&lt;ref name="mab20111201"/&gt;

In February 2011, Bigelow reported that the vehicle had "performed flawlessly in terms of pressure maintenance and thermal control-environmental containment."&lt;ref name="8nn20110204"/&gt;

The orbital life was originally estimated to be 12 years, with a gradually decaying orbit resulting in [[Atmospheric entry|re-entry]] into [[Earth]]'s atmosphere and burn-up expected. Its operations lasted approximately 2.5 years, significantly longer than its expected 6-month mission duration. {{As of|June 2018}}, the vehicle remains in orbit.&lt;ref name="2_5y"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heavens-above"/&gt;

== Systems ==
''Genesis I'' is outfitted with eight [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] [[Photovoltaic system|solar panel arrays]], four on each end of the craft, which produce one [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] total power&lt;ref name="SQgen" /&gt; and maintain a 26 [[volt]] battery charge.&lt;ref name="LS060712" /&gt; It carries thirteen cameras, seven externally to monitor the physical condition of the spacecraft, such as the outer shell and solar arrays, and six internally to photograph the various objects and experiments.&lt;ref name="BAaboutG1" /&gt; Internal systems established an atmospheric pressure of {{convert|7.5|psi|1|abbr=on|lk=on}}&lt;ref name="LS060713" /&gt; and use passive thermal control to keep temperatures at an average of {{convert|26|°C}},&lt;ref name="LS060712" /&gt; with observed limits of approximately {{convert|4.5|°C}} and {{convert|32|°C}}.&lt;ref name="BAperfG1" /&gt; ''Genesis I'' uses a single gas tank for its inflation system, and [[Attitude control (spacecraft)|guidance]]/stabilization control is performed using a network of torque rods, sun sensors, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and a [[magnetometer]].&lt;ref name="BAdiffII" /&gt;

== Payload ==
Aside from the various systems and monitoring equipment, ''Genesis I'' is orbiting with a wide variety of cargo. Bigelow employees contributed numerous photographs, toys, cards and other items, which can be seen in still images floating around the cabin. Bigelow also placed a life sciences experiment on board, which contains four [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]]es (''Gromphadorhina portentosa'') and approximately 20 so-called [[Mexican jumping bean]]s, which are seeds containing the live larva of the moth ''[[Cydia deshaisiana]]''.&lt;ref name="nature20060808" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space070628" /&gt; In addition, the company allowed NASA to include a prototype for the GeneSat series of [[Miniaturized satellite#Nanosatellite|nanosatellites]]. This device, called GeneBox, tested the systems and procedures that will be used on future GeneSat missions. While GeneBox carries no living organisms, future flights will use sensors and optics to measure how weightlessness affects [[gene]]s and the genetic activity of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[microorganism|microscopic life]].&lt;ref name="nasa52ar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SR1147" /&gt;

The '''''Gewässerkennzahl''''' ('''GKZ''', rarely '''GWK''' or '''GEWKZ''') or "waterbody index number/[[waterbody number]]" is an [[identifier]] with which all [[watercourse]]s in [[Germany]] are numbered, together with their [[drainage basin|catchments]] and [[precipitation]] areas. It is also referred to as a '''''Gebietskennzahl''''' or "basin number". A Gewässerkennzahl may have up to 13 figures (theoretically even 19). Basins normally are only defined up to seven figures. For a more detailed subdivision, the Gewässerkennzahl may be enlarged by ten more figures. Only that enlarged version is called ''Fließgewässerkenn'''ziffer'''.'' The Gewässerkennzahlen are defined by the environment offices of the [[States of Germany|states]].

== History ==
In order to have comparable values and usable data across the state of Germany, the Federal and State Water Authorities agreed in December 1970 to create a unified system for hydrological work on certain important rivers and their above-ground catchment areas and to issue them with index numbers. Linked to that was the establishment of the size and boundaries of their catchment areas.

== Principle ==
Every waterbody ([[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[canal]]s and [[ditch]]es, but also [[lake]]s and even some [[bay (waterbody)|bays]]) and its catchment area was given a waterbody number in such a way that it could be clearly identified. The waterbody numbers are built in hierarchical fashion so that, based on the number, the next [[river system]] of the waterbody can be deduced.

=== Scheme ===
At first the course of water has to be defined from source to mouth. Then the four major tributaries (or 'affluents') are identified. They are marked by even figures in downstream sequence, "-2, -4, -6, -8". This way, the (main) course is divided into five sections, which are marked by odd figures, "-1, -3, -5, -7, -9".  A number with an even end-digit is the number of a whole watercourse, while a number with an odd end-digit is the number of a section. Lowest sections are always given a nine, even if not all figures between one and nine have been used. In the next step of numbering, each section defined by the first step is dealt in the same way, selecting four major tributaries and marking five sections.

=== Lakes ===
Lakes are integrated as a part of the watercourse formed by their main tributary and their outlet.

=== Coastal regions ===
For coastal regions, the scheme of numbering was altered in different ways by different states:
* [[Lower Saxony]] left the rule of using only odd numbers for sections. Nevertheless, bay as dependent waterbodies got even numbers.
* [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] stuck to using even numbers for important rivers and odd numbers for – here coastal – sections in between. But the course of the coast was defined in a way, that in two straits different third figures were used for their two banks.

=== Waterbodies without a Gewässserkennzahl ===
Some waterbodies indexed under this classification system have un-indexed headstreams or lateral tributaries in the form of very small streams or ditches. If such an unclassified waterbody is relevant for the water management of the region, it may be given a number by within the local classification system of the regional [[Wasser- und Bodenverband]] (association for water and ground management).

=== Catchment areas ===
The numbers for a watercourse and its catchment area are thus identical. If a river has subsidiary watercourses, an additional figure is allocated to its index number for each further branch. So in theory even a rivulet could be allocated its own catchment. In practice, catchment numbering for water sources below the level of streams are not used.

Catchment areas are thus distinguished by a number with up to a maximum of seven digits. Watercourse index numbers, by contrast, may have up to 13 digits in order to be able to classify all their tributaries and headstreams; although in practice only 10 digits are used.

=== Main river systems ===
The first digit of the number indicates which [[main stem|major river]] basin the waterbody belongs to, as follows:
* 1 [[Danube]]
* 2 [[Rhine]]
* 3 [[Ems (river)|Ems]]
* 4 [[Weser]]
* 5 [[Elbe]]
* 6 [[Oder]]
* 9 [[Coast]]al region

The second and subsequent digits of the index number represent further subdivisions of the river and its catchment area.

=== Example ===
The [[Heusiepen]] stream in [[Remscheid]] has waterbody number 27366462. This can be decoded as follows:

: Main stem system / catchment area [[Rhine]] (2)
:: → [[River system]] / catchment area [[Wupper]] (2-736)
::: → River system / catchment area [[Morsbach (Wupper)|Morsbach]] (2-736-6)
:::: → River system / catchment area [[Gelpe]] (2-736-6-4)
::::: → River system / catchment area [[Saalbach (Gelpe)|Saalbach]] (2-736-6-4-6)
:::::: → Stream without defined catchment area [[Heusiepen]] (2-736-6-4-6-2)

== Waterbody index numbers ==
Listed below are all the rivers with up to a three-figure index number, and some rivers with four-figure numbers above a length of 50&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Glycon''' ({{lang-grc|Γλύκων}} ''Glýkon'', {{smallcaps|gen}}: {{lang|grc|Γλύκωνος}} ''Glýkonos''), also spelled '''Glykon''', was an ancient [[snake worship|snake god]]. Having a large and influential cult within the [[Roman Empire]] in the [[2nd century]]; Glycon had been mentioned earlier by [[Horace]]. However contemporary satirist [[Lucian]] provides the primary literary reference to the deity. Lucian claimed Glycon was created in the mid-2nd century by the Greek prophet [[Alexander of Abonoteichos]]. Lucian was ill-disposed toward the cult, calling Alexander a false prophet and accusing the whole enterprise of being a hoax: Glycon himself was supposedly a [[hand puppet]].&lt;ref&gt;{Λουκιανοῦ Ἀλέξανδρος ἢ Ψευδομάντις}, Lucian's "Alexander or the False Prophet", 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macedonian cultural roots==
The cult possibly originated in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], where similar snake cults had existed for centuries. The Macedonians believed snakes had magical powers [[Fertility rite|relating to fertility]] and had a rich mythology on this subject, for example the story of [[Olympias]]'s impregnation by [[Zeus]] disguised as a serpent. In 20 BC Glycon was referred to by the Roman poet [[Horace]], in his Epistle 1 to Maecenas in his [[Epistles (Horace)|First Book of Epistles]];  "... you despair of the muscles of the invincible Glycon...").

==Early years==
At least initially, the cult did not worship an abstraction or a spirit of a snake but an actual, physical serpent that was said to embody the god. According to the cult's mythology, the snake appeared after Alexander had foretold the coming of a new incarnation of [[Asclepius]]. When the people gathered in the marketplace of Abonutichus at noon, when the incarnation was supposed to occur, Alexander produced a goose egg and sliced it open, revealing the god within. Within a week it grew to the size of a man with the features of a man on its face, including long blond hair. At this point the figure resembling this description was apparently a puppet that appeared in the temple. In some references Glycon was a trained snake with a puppet head.

As with previous Macedonian snake cults, the focus of worship at the temple was on fertility. Barren women would bring offerings to Glycon in hopes of becoming pregnant. According to Lucian, Alexander had less magical ways of causing pregnancy among his flock as well.

==Spread and influence==
By 160, the worship of Glycon had undoubtedly spread beyond the Aegean. An inscription from [[Antioch]] of that date records a slogan, "Glycon protect us from the plague-cloud" that is consistent with the description we have from Lucian. Also in that year the [[Consul suffectus|governor]] of Asia, [[List of state leaders in 146#Europe|Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus]], declared himself protector of Glycon's oracle. The governor later married Alexander's daughter. According to Lucian, another Roman governor, of [[Cappadocia]], was led by Glycon's oracle to his death in [[Armenia]], and even the Emperor himself was not immune to the cult: [[Marcus Aurelius]] sought prophesies from Alexander and his snake god.

Meanwhile, [[Abonoteichos]], a small fishing village before the arrival of the cult, became an important town and accepted another name, '''Ionopolis'''. It is uncertain what role the popularity of Glycon played in the rise of the city. 

In short order Glycon worship was found throughout the vast area between the [[Danube]] and [[Euphrates]]. Beginning late in the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] and continuing into the 3rd century, official Roman coins were struck in honor of Glycon, attesting his popularity. While the cult gradually lost followers after the death of its leader in c.170, it survived for at least a hundred years thereafter, with Alexander being incorporated into its mythology as a grandson of [[Asclepius]]. Some evidence indicates the cult survived into the 4th century.

==Modern times==

Residual superstitions originating with Glycon were reported by some researchers to continue even into modern times. A [[Turkish people|Turkish]] friend of Dutch scholar [[Jona Lendering]] mentioned that a common belief in a magical snake persisted near [[İnebolu]] (the current name for the ancient city of Ionopolis).&lt;ref&gt;"A Turkish friend of the author of the present article once told him that in the early 1970's, when he was hunting in the hills near Inebolu, people warned him for a magical snake." {{cite web |last1=Lendering |first1=Jona |title=Glykon |url=http://www.livius.org/articles/religion/glykon/? |website=www.livius.org |publisher=LIVIVS |language=en|ref=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his "[[Coming out#"Coming out" applied to non-LGBT contexts|coming out]]" as a [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] in 1993, the English [[comic book]] writer and [[occultist]] [[Alan Moore]] has declared himself a devotee of Glycon. At the same time, he acknowledges that Glycon was almost certainly a hoax.&lt;ref name="SLATEDW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/ |title=Sidebar: How Alan Moore transformed American comics |last=Wolk |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Wolk |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ajJOBmav?url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/ |archivedate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One single marble statue of Glycon snake was found in excavations done under the site of the former Pallas railway station in [[Constanța]], Romania. The statue is 0.66 metres high and the snake dimension is 4.76 metres.&lt;ref&gt;Vatamanu Nicolae: "Esculap reincarnat in Glycon, sarpele cu plete", ''[[Viața Medicală]]'' 1972, No.7 pg 333–335&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romanians commemorated this unique sculpture on a postage stamp in 1974, and on a bank note of 10.000 lei in 1994.

[[File:Ian Lowe.jpg|thumb|Ian Lowe in Hobart, 6 April 2009]]
'''Ian Lowe''' (born 1942) is Emeritus Professor of [[Science and technology studies|Science, Technology and Society]] and former Head of the School of Science at [[Griffith University]], as well as an adjunct professor at [[Sunshine Coast University]] and [[Flinders University]]. In 1996 he was chair-person of the advisory council producing the first national report on the state of Australia's environment.  He is a patron of [[Sustainable Population Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.population.org.au/index.php/about-us/aims-a-objectives/139-aims-and-objectives Sustainable Population Australia - Aims and Objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615035832/http://www.population.org.au/index.php/about-us/aims-a-objectives/139-aims-and-objectives |date=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his principal interests is the way policy decisions influence use of science and technology, especially in the fields of energy and environment.

Lowe was made an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] in 2001 for services to science, technology, and the environment. In 2002 he was awarded a [[Centenary Medal]] for contributions to environmental science and won the [[Eureka Prize]] for promotion of science. His contributions have also been recognised by the Prime Minister's Environment Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement, the Queensland Premier's Millennium Award for Excellence in Science and the [[University of NSW]] Alumni Award for achievement in science. Lowe was named Humanist of the Year in 1988.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;He was awarded the Konrad Lorenz Gold Medal by the [[International Academy of Science]] in 2009.[http://www.naturaledgeproject.net/TNEPPatronIanLowe.aspx Professor Ian Lowe]&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the Australian Conservation Foundation from 2004 to April 2014. In 2009 the International Academy of Sciences, Health and Ecology awarded him the Konrad Lorenz Gold Medal.

Lowe was a member of the Australian Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council from 2002 to 2014 and a former member or chair of many other bodies advising all three levels of government in Australia. 

Lowe has authored or co-authored 10 books, 10 Open University books, more than 50 book chapters and over 500 other publications. He wrote for 13 years a regular column for New Scientist and also writes for several other publications, as well as contributing frequently to electronic media programs.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; Books by Ian Lowe include ''[[A Big Fix]]'', ''[[Reaction Time (book)|Reaction Time]]'',  ''[[Living in the Hothouse]]'', ''Why vs Why: Nuclear Power'', ''A Voice of Reason: Reflections on Australia'', ''Bigger or Better? Australia's Population Debate'' and ''The Lucky Country? Reinventing Australia''.

In April 2015 Lowe was appointed to the Expert Advisory Committee for the [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] in South Australia.

== Energy advocacy ==
Ian Lowe sees the [[nuclear power]] option for electricity generation as being risky and unworkable. He says nuclear power installations peaked last century and in the past 20 years, retirements, cancellations and deferments have outnumbered new reactor construction.&lt;ref name="lowenuke" /&gt; Lowe says nuclear power is too expensive, with insurmountable problems associated with waste disposal and weapons proliferation. It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change. Lowe advocates for [[renewable energy]] which he claims is "quicker, less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear".&lt;ref name="lowenuke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html |title=No nukes now, or ever |author=Ian Lowe  |date=20 March 2011 |work=The Age }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immobilization''' in [[soil science]] is the conversion of inorganic compounds to organic compounds by [[micro-organisms]] or [[plants]], by which it is prevented from being accessible to plants.&lt;ref&gt;Principles and Practices of Soil Science, the soil as a natural resource (4th edition), R.E. White&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization is the opposite of [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]].

==C:N Ratio==
Whether nitrogen is mineralized or immobilized depends on the C/N ratio of the plant residues.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. McLaren &amp; K. Cameron ''Soil Science: Sustainable production and environmental protection'' (2nd edition), Oxford University Press, (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-558345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general plant residues entering the soil have too little nitrogen for the soil microbial population to convert all of the carbon into their cells. If the C:N ratio of the decomposing plant material is above about 30:1 the soil microbial population may take nitrogen in mineral form (e.g. [[nitrate]]). This mineral nitrogen is said to be immobilized. This may cause nitrogen deficiency in plants growing in the soil.

As carbon dioxide is released via decomposition the C:N ratio of the organic matter decreases, and the microbial demand for mineral nitrogen is decreased. When the C:N ratio falls below about 25:1 further decomposition results in simultaneous mineralization of nitrogen which is in excess to that required by the microbial population.

When decomposition is virtually complete soil mineral nitrogen will be higher than it was initially due to mineralization of the plant residue nitrogen.

An '''invasive species''' is a species that is not native to a specific location (an [[introduced species]]), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecosystem Consequences of Biological Invasions |author=Joan G.

The term as most often used applies to introduced species (also called "non-indigenous" or "non-native") that adversely affect the [[habitat]]s and [[bioregion]]s they invade economically, environmentally, or ecologically. Such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region, [[Wilderness|wilderness areas]], particular habitats, or [[wildland–urban interface]] land from loss of natural controls (such as [[Predation|predators]] or [[herbivore]]s). This includes non-native invasive plant species labeled as '''exotic pest plants''' and '''invasive exotics''' growing in native [[plant community|plant communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Exotic Pest Plant Council. '[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plants of Greatest Ecological Concern in California]' accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in this sense by government organizations&lt;ref&gt;(September 21, 2006).

The term is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for [[noxious weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kudzu|kudzu vine]] (''Pueraria lobata''), [[Cortaderia jubata|Andean pampas grass]] (''Cortaderia jubata''), and [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis'') are examples.

Dispersal and subsequent proliferation of species is not solely an anthropogenic phenomenon. There are many mechanisms by which species from all Kingdoms have been able to travel across continents in short periods of time such as via floating rafts, or on wind currents. Charles Darwin performed many experiments to better understand long distance seed dispersal, and was able to germinate seeds from insect frass, faeces of waterfowl, dirt clods on the feet of birds, all of which may have traveled significant distances under their own power, or be blown off course by thousands of miles.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions is a natural phenomenon, which has likely been accelerated via hominid-assisted migration although this has not been adequately directly measured.

The definition of "native" is controversial in that there is no way to precisely determine nativity. For example, the ancestors of Equus ferus (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in 1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

==Causes==
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that, when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species based mechanisms===
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete [[native species]]. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.

Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.&lt;ref name="kolar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |author2=D.M.

Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location.&lt;ref name="tilm"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tilman|first=D. |year=2004

| pmid = 15243158 |issue= 30 |pmc= 503710}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low population densities, it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location, so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established. Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high [[propagule pressure]]).&lt;ref name="verl"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |author2=G.M.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as [[nutrient]]s, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[predation]], then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as [[zero-sum]] systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such [[unilateral]] competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.&lt;ref name="stoh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |author2= D. Binkley |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2|last3=Chong |first3=Geneva W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=Mohammed A. |last5=Schell |first5=Lisa D. |last6=Bull |first6=Kelly A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Yuka |last8=Newman |first8=Gregory |last9=Bashkin |first9=Michael |last10=Son |first10=Yowhan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sax"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sax |first= D.F. |author2= S.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long [[taproot]], or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (''[[Aegilops triuncialis]]'') was introduced to [[California]] on [[serpentine soil]]s, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high [[magnesium]]/[[calcium]] ratio, and possible [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |author2=S.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying [[abiotic]] factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Kalanchoe daigremontana]]'', produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic compounds]], that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="HERRERAFERRER-PARIS2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERRERA|first1=Ileana|last2=FERRER-PARIS|first2=José R.|last3=BENZO|first3=Diana|last4=FLORES|first4=Saúl|last5=GARCÍA|first5=Belkis|last6=NASSAR|first6=Jafet M.|title=An Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone|journal=Pedosphere|volume=28|issue=4|year=2018|pages=632–643|issn=1002-0160|doi=10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species like ''[[Stapelia gigantea]]'' [[ecological facilitation|facilitates]] the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Ileana|last2=Ferrer-Paris|first2=José R.|last3=Hernández-Rosas|first3=José I.|last4=Nassar|first4=Jafet M.|title=Impact of two invasive succulents on native-seedling recruitment in Neotropical arid environments|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=2016|volume=132|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.04.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301927334|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'' (yellow starthistle) and ''Centaurea diffusa'' ([[diffuse knapweed]]). These [[Eastern Europe]]an [[noxious weed]]s have spread through the [[Western United States|western]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast states]]. Experiments show that [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], a chemical produced at the root of ''C. diffusa'', has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. ''C. diffusa'' and ''C. solstitialis'' do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |author2=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |last2=Bais |first2=H.P. |last3=Stermitz |first3=F.R. |last4=Thelen |first4=G.C. |last5=Callaway |first5=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry [[detritus]] during the fire season in western North America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing ''B. tectorum'' to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt; |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=42480&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, [[zebra mussel]]s increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which [[invertebrate]]s live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]], increases the density and diversity of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrate communities.&lt;ref name="silv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |last2=Patterson |first2=B.A. |last3=Schlosser |first3=D. |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===
In [[ecosystem]]s, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When changes such as a [[forest fire]] occur, normal succession favors native [[grass]]es and [[forb]]s. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are often the limiting factors in these situations.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |last2=Grime |first2=J.P. |last3=Thompson |first3=K. |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every species occupies a ''[[Ecological niche|niche]]'' in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=Fath|first=Brian D.|publisher=Elsevier Science; 1 edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0444520333|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type can be found within the ''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'' species of skink.

Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, [[edge effect]]s describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alverson|first=William S.|last2=Waller|first2=Donald M.|last3=Solheim|first3=Stephen L.|date=1988|title=Forests Too Deer: Edge Effects in Northern Wisconsin|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00199.x|jstor=2386294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Tang|first2=Shaoqing|last3=Fatemi|first3=Mohammad|last4=Gross|first4=Caroline L.|last5=Julien|first5=Mic H.|last6=Curtis|first6=Caitlin|last7=van Klinken|first7=Rieks D.|date=2015-09-01|title=Population structure and genetic diversity of invasive Phyla canescens: implications for the evolutionary potential|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1–21|doi=10.1890/ES14-00374.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance. This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Prentis 2008 288-294"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Prentis |first= Peter |title= Adaptive evolution in invasive species |journal= Trends in Plant Science |volume= 13|issue= 6 |pages= 288–294 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2008.03.004 |pmid= 18467157 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following invasion events, selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment. Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment. These responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change, or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey.&lt;ref name="Eunmi 2002 386-391"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Carol Eunmi | title= Evolutionary genetics of invasive species |journal= Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume= 17 |issue= 8 |pages= 386–391 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02554-5 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations include changes in morphology, physiology, phenology, and plasticity.

Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity, pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Zenni 2013 635-644"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zenni |first= R.D. |title= Adaptive Evolution and Phenotypic Plasticity During Naturalization and Spread of Invasive Species: Implications for Tree Invasion Biology |journal= Biological Invasions |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 635–644 |doi=10.1007/s10530-013-0607-8 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment. This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.

This debate hinged on the [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scale]] at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |author2=E.G.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.&lt;ref name="tilm"/&gt;

===Vectors===
Non-native species have many ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s'', including biogenic vectors,&lt;!--what is a biogenic vector?--&gt; but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural [[Range (biology)|range]] extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |author2=T.M.

An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the [[Pacific rat]] (''Rattus exulans'') to Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matisoo-Smith |first=E. |author2=R.M.

[[File:EriocheirSinensis1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis'')]]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for [[horticulture]]. The [[pet trade]] moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.

The arrival of invasive [[propagule]]s to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |author2=N.E. Mandrak  |year=2007 |title= The risk of establishment of aquatic invasive species: joining invasibility and propagule pressure |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274 |pages=2733–2739|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2007.0841 |pmid=17711834 |issue=1625 |pmc=2275890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home," American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles. [[Agricultural Research Service]] entomologists identified them as [[rhinoceros beetle]], [[hercules beetle]], and [[Phalacrognathus muelleri|king stag beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems.&lt;!--were they actually invasive or just non-native?--&gt; To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] programs such as [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance]] (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be harmful to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zavaleta|first1=Erika|last2=Hobbs|first2=Richard|last3=Mooney|first3=Harold|title=Viewing invasive species removal in a whole-ecosystem context|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=August 2001|volume=16|issue=8|page=458|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Zavaleta_etal_2001.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable [[Chinese mitten crab]] is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Pollution and Climate Change|last=Seinfeld|first=John H.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==== Within the Aquatic Environment ====
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar|first=Jennifer L|last2=Gamboa|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Revenga|first3=Carmen|last4=Spalding|first4=Mark D|date=2008|title=Assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=485–492|doi=10.1890/070064|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1010 Discharging ballast water.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship de-ballasting]]
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls. Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=John|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Aquatic Invasions|volume=2|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.2.7|issn=1818-5487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/24305557/biofouling-moves-up-the-regulatory-agenda.|title=Biofouling moves up the regulatory agenda - GARD|website=www.gard.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is ballast water. [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Invasive species#cite%20note-MolnarGamboa2008-43|[47]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Xu|first=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|date=2014-08-24|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623330.2623364|publisher=ACM|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364|isbn=9781450329569}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Streftaris|first=N|last2=Zenetos|first2=Argyro|last3=Papathanassiou|first3=Enangelos|date=2005|title=Globalisation in marine ecosystems: The story of non-indigenous marine species across European seas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253862066|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=43|pages=419–453|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their new environment. For example, freshwater [[zebra mussel]]s, native to the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov seas]], most likely reached the [[Great Lakes]] via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached the [[St. Lawrence Seaway|Seaway]] were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98880204.html/|title=Noxious cargo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current regulations for the Great Lakes rely on ‘salinity shock’ to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/5ps/NVIC/2018/NVIC-01_18.pdf|title=Ballast Water Management for Control of Non-Indigenous Species in Waters of the United States|last=USCG|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually, only one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid, a neurotoxin. If toxic ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' spp. are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their “new environment” they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish, marine mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trainer|first=Vera L.|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen S.|last3=Lundholm|first3=Nina|last4=Thessen|first4=Anne E.|last5=Cochlan|first5=William P.|last6=Adams|first6=Nicolaus G.|last7=Trick|first7=Charles G.|date=2012|title=Pseudo-nitzschia physiological ecology, phylogeny, toxicity, monitoring and impacts on ecosystem health|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=14|pages=271–300|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2011.10.025|issn=1568-9883|hdl=1912/5118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton.

Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role of environmental changes associated with climate change, such as an increase in ocean temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Occhipinti-Ambrogi|first=Anna|date=2007|title=Global change and marine communities: Alien species and climate change|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=55|issue=7–9|pages=342–352|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.014|pmid=17239404|issn=0025-326X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahel|first=Frank J.|last2=Olden|first2=Julian D.|date=2008|title=Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge. For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=J.|last2=Hwang|first2=W.H.|date=2012|title=Effects of voyage routing on the survival of microbes in ballast water|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=42|pages=165–175|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.01.013|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further examine the effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Mark|last2=Ahmed|first2=Yasser|last3=Canning-Clode|first3=João|last4=Díaz|first4=Eliecer|last5=Eichhorn|first5=Sandra|last6=Fabritzek|first6=Armin G.|last7=da Gama|first7=Bernardo A.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of “hijackers” on ships’ hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.

===Impacts of wildfire and firefighting===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"/&gt;  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"/&gt;

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Effects==
[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]

===Ecological===
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in Hawaii (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |author2=D.

===Geomorphological===
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion.  While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |author2=J.

Shouse|year=2015 |title=Biogeomorphic Impacts of Invasive Species |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=45 |pages=69–87 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area. For example, in the Great Lakes Region the [[sea lamprey]] is an invasive species that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host organism. However, in the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-18  month feeding period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glfc.org/sea-lamprey.php|title=Great Lakes Fishery Commission - Sea Lamprey|website=www.glfc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the population of some economy dependent species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Economic opportunities====
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits.

=====Benefits=====
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases. Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody plant, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored. The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species. Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the Aldabra giant tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services. There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American Honey bee was introduced in the rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of non-native species to control agricultural pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHLAEPFER|first=MARTIN A.|last2=SAX|first2=DOV F.|last3=OLDEN|first3=JULIAN D.|date=2011-02-22|title=The Potential Conservation Value of Non-Native Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01646.x|pmid=21342267|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-native species can have other benefits. [[Chesapeake Bay#Depletion of oysters|Asian oysters]], for example, filter water pollutants better than native{{clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012}} oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this [[mollusk]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pelton, ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- does the asian threaten the local?--&gt; Additionally, some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment, a term referred to as [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]]. For example, ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium|L. leucozonium]]'', shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-09-12|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 1964518|pmid = 17848999|volume = 2|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000868|first = Amro|last = Zayed|first2 = Şerban A.|last2 = Constantin|first3 = Laurence|last3 = Packer|pages=e868}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become an important pollinator of [[Rubus|caneberry]] as well as [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]], [[apple trees]], and blueberry bushes.&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee.

=====Invasivorism=====
''See also [[:Category:Edible invasive species]]''

Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients. [[Miya's]] of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] created the first invasive species menu in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invasive-species-menu-of-a-world-class-chef/|title=Invasive Species Menu of a World-Class Chef|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=3|pages=40–43|date=September 1, 2013|author= Bun Lai |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0913-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2015/feb/06/cooking-cant-solve-the-invasive-threat|title=Cooking can't solve the threat of invasive species|author=Emma Bryce|date=6 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida]]
Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the [[Dodo]] bird, the [[Caribbean monk seal]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. Proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of [[lionfish]] by encouraging the consumption of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/invasive-lionfish-kings-caribbean-may-met-match-011600208.html|title=Invasive Lionfish, the Kings of the Caribbean, May Have Met Their Match|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costs====
Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="pimental"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |last2= R. |first2= Zuniga  |last3= Morrison |first3= D |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.&lt;ref name="simb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of [[ecosystem services]], costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan.|last=|first=|publisher=National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC.|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant industry====
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see [[dynamic accumulator]]) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., [[yellow starthistle]]). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by [[Western honeybee|honey bees]] infected by the invasive [[varroa mite]]. Introduced rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]'' and ''[[Rattus norvegicus|R. norvegicus]]'') have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Citrus Greening."

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquaculture====
[[Aquaculture]] is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., ''[[Oreochromis niloticus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |author2=O.

====Forestry====

[[File:Firewoodposter white web.pdf|thumb|right|Poster asking campers to not move firewood around, avoiding the spread of invasive species.]]
The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change [[forest ecology]] and damage the timber industry.

The Asian long-horned beetle (''[[Anoplophora glabripennis]]'') was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees.

====Tourism and recreation====
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1614/WS-04-022R |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds".

===Health===
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and [[tsetse fly]] pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of [[Paragonimus westermani|Asian lung fluke]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aquatic invasive species.

For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global [[biodiversity loss]] and is increasing because of tourism and [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated [[fresh water]] systems, though [[quarantine]]s and [[ballast water]] rules have improved the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] exclusion, [[Ecological niche|niche]] displacement, or [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odendaal | first1 = L.

Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the potential risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of diversity and discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing; 1st Unabridged edition|date=March 1, 2013|isbn=978-1443844536|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, ''Spartina alterniflora'' was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native ''Spartina foliosa.'' The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in [[introgression]] that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12469817|title=Anttila CK, King RA, Ferris C, Ayres DR, Strong DR.

== Invasive exotic diseases ==
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of [[smallpox]] into the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the Spanish, where it obliterated entire [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|populations of indigenous civilizations]] before they were ever even seen by Europeans.

Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the [[chestnut blight]] which has almost eliminated the [[American chestnut]] tree from its forest habitat.  Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.

Another example is the [[Dutch elm disease]], which has severely reduced the [[American elm]] trees in forests and cities.

Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]] and the bacterial disease [[Citrus greening disease|citrus greening]].&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Pest Alert: Citrus Greening." Clemson University Invasive Species Program. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/Pest%20Alerts/citrus_greening.html. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in recent years some argue that some introduced species may have a positive ecological impact on an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211095555.htm|title=Invasive plants can create positive ecological change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of [[ecology]] and [[geography]] where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Martha F. Hoopes |author3=Michael P. Marchetti |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology".&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on [[biogeography]] rather than on [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |author2=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

=== Introduced species on islands ===
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].

An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.

The field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Invasive species in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] the largest commercial crop is ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', the [[California native plants|native Californian]] Monterey pine tree, which grows as well in New Zealand as in [[California]]. However, the pine forests are also occupied by [[deer]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. They are exotic species and have thrived in the New Zealand environment. The pines are seen as beneficial while the deer are regarded as serious pests.

Common [[gorse]], originally a hedge plant in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], was introduced to New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.

[[Rabbit]]s, introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island. The [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] was illegally imported and illegally released, but it had little lasting effect upon the rabbit population other than to make it more resistant to the virus.

Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand birds are flightless. Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including natives.

[[Sparrows]], which were brought to control insects upon the introduced [[grain]] crops, have displaced native birds as have [[rainbow lorikeet]]s and [[cockatoos]] (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of [[Auckland]] City such as the [[Waitakere Ranges]].

In much of New Zealand, the Australian [[black swan]] has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced [[mute swan]].

Two notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the [[white tail spider]] and the [[redback spider]]. Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit. Until then,  the only spider (and the only venomous animal) dangerous to humans was the native [[katipo]], which is very similar to the redback and  interbreed with the more aggressive Australian variety.

==== South Georgia Island ====

In 2018, the [[South Georgia Island]] was declared free of invasive [[rodent]]s after a multi-year extermination effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/rat-begone-record-eradication-effort-rids-sub-antarctic-island-invasive-rodents|title=Rat begone: Record eradication effort rids sub-Antarctic island of invasive rodents|last=Warren|first=Matt|date=2018-05-08|work=Science|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-exterminate-rats-on-an-island&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ion Beam - GPN-2000-000383.jpg|thumb|A small ion beam rocket being tested by NASA.]]
An '''ion beam''' is a type of [[charged particle beam]] consisting of [[ions]]. Ion beams have many uses in [[electronics manufacturing]] (principally [[ion implantation]]) and other industries.  A variety of [[ion source|ion beam sources]] exists, some derived from the [[ion thruster|mercury vapor thrusters]] developed by [[NASA]] in the 1960s. The most common ion beams are of singly-charged ions.

== Units ==
Ion current density is typically measured in mA/cm^2, and ion energy in eV. The use of eV is convenient for converting between voltage and energy, especially when dealing with singly-charged ion beams, as well as converting between energy and temperature (1 eV = 11600 K).&lt;ref name="KRI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Harold R. |date=2011 |title=Applications of Broad-Beam Ion Sources: An Introduction |url=http://www.ionsources.com/PDF/Broad-Beam_BookPreview.pdf |location=Fort Collins, Colorado 80524 |publisher=Kaufman &amp; Robinson, Inc. |page= |isbn=9780985266400 |author-link=Harold R. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broad-beam ion sources==
Most commercial applications use two popular types of ion source, gridded and gridless, which differ in current and power characteristics and the ability to control ion trajectories.&lt;ref name="KRI"/&gt; In both cases electrons are needed to generate an ion beam. The most common electron emitters are hot filament and hollow cathode.

=== Gridded ion source ===
In a gridded ion source, [[Direct-current discharge|DC]] or [[Inductively coupled plasma|RF]] discharge are used to generate ions, which are then accelerated and decimated using grids and apertures. Here, the DC discharge current or the RF discharge power are used to control the beam current. 

The ion current density &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; that can be accelerated using a gridded ion source is limited by the [[space charge]] effect, which is described by [[Child's law]]: 

&lt;math&gt;j \approx \frac{4\epsilon_0}{9} \sqrt{\frac{2e}{m}} \frac{(\Delta V)^{\frac{3}{2}}}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;, 

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage between the grids, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the grids, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the ion mass. 

The grids are placed as closely as possible to increase the current density, typically &lt;math&gt;d\sim 1\ \mathrm{mm}&lt;/math&gt;. The ions used have a significant impact on the maximum ion beam current, since &lt;math&gt;j \propto m^{frac-{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Everything else being equal, the maximum ion beam current with [[krypton]] is only 69% the maximum ion current of an [[argon]] beam, and with [[xenon]] the ratio drops to 55%.&lt;ref name="KRI"/&gt;

=== Gridless ion sources ===
In a gridless ion source, ions are generated by a flow of electrons (no grids). The most common gridless ion source is the [[end-Hall ion source]]. Here, the discharge current and the gas flow are used to control the beam current.

==Applications==
===Ion beam etching or sputtering===

[[File:ZEISS Crossbeam 550- Your FIB-SEM for High Throughput 3D Analysis and Sample Preparation (33411552526).jpg|thumb|Carl Zeiss Crossbeam 550 – combines a [[Field emission microscopy|field emission scanning electron microscope]] (FE-SEM) with a focused ion beam (FIB).]]

[[File:Nanofluidics channels (33411553986).jpg|thumb|[[Nanofluidics]] channels fabricated with a Zeiss Crossbeam 550 L, in a silicon master stamp]]

One type of [[ion source|ion beam source]] is the [[duoplasmatron]]. Ion beams can be used for [[sputtering]] or ion beam etching and for [[ion beam analysis]].

Ion beam application, etching, or sputtering, is a technique conceptually similar to [[sandblasting]], but using individual atoms in an ion beam to [[ablate]] a target.  [[Reactive ion etching]] is an important extension that uses chemical reactivity to enhance the physical sputtering effect.

In a typical use in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor manufacturing]], a [[mask]] can selectively expose a layer of [[photoresist]] on a [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] made of a [[semiconductor]] material such as a [[silicon dioxide]] or [[gallium arsenide]] [[wafer]].  The wafer is developed, and for a positive photoresist, the exposed portions are removed in a chemical process. The result is a pattern left on the surface areas of the wafer that had been masked from exposure. The wafer is then placed in a [[vacuum chamber]], and exposed to the ion beam.  The impact of the ions erodes the target, abrading away the areas not covered by the photoresist.

[[Focused ion beam]] (FIB) instruments have numerous applications for characterization of thin-film devices. Using a focused, high-brightness ion beam in a scanned raster pattern, material is removed (sputtered) in precise rectilinear patterns revealing a two-dimensional, or stratigraphic profile of a solid material. The most common application is to verify the integrity of the gate oxide layer in a CMOS transistor. A single excavation site exposes a cross section for analysis using a scanning electron microscope. Dual excavations on either side of a thin lamella bridge are utilized for preparing transmission electron microscope samples.&lt;ref&gt;
Giannuzzi, Lucille A., Stevie, Fred A. ''Introduction to Focused Ion Beams: Instrumentation, Theory, Techniques, and Practice'', Springer 2005 – 357 pages
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common use of FIB instruments is for [[design verification]] and/or [[failure analysis]] of semiconductor devices. Design verification combines selective material removal with gas-assisted material deposition of conductive, dielectric, or insulating materials. Engineering prototype devices may be modified using the ion beam in combination with gas-assisted material deposition in order to rewire an integrated circuit's conductive pathways. The techniques are effectively used to verify the correlation between the CAD design and the actual functional prototype circuit, thereby avoiding the creation of a new mask for the purpose of testing design changes.

Materials science use sputtering for extending surface analytical techniques such as [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] or electron spectroscopy ([[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy|XPS]], [[Auger electron spectroscopy|AES]]) so that they can depth profile them.

===Biology===
In [[radiobiology]] a broad or [[microbeam|focused ion beam]] is used to study mechanisms of inter- and intra- cellular communication, [[signal transduction]] and DNA damage and [[DNA repair|repair]].

===Medicine===
Ion beams are also used in [[particle therapy]], most often in the treatment of cancer.

===Space applications===
Ion beams produced by ion and plasma thrusters on board a spacecraft can be used to transmit a force to a nearby object (e.g. another spacecraft, an asteroid, etc.) that is irradiated by the beam. This innovative propulsion technique named [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been shown to be effective in the area of active space debris removal as well as asteroid deflection.

===High-energy ion beams===
High-energy ion beams produced by [[particle accelerator]]s are used in [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Weaponry===
The use of ion beams as a [[particle beam weapon]] is theoretically possible, but has not been demonstrated. Electron beam weapons have been tested by the U.S. Navy in the early 20th century, but the hose instability effect prevents these from being accurate at a distance of over approximately 30 inches. See [[particle beam weapon]] for more information on this type of weapon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1102">An '''ionogram''' is a display of the data produced by an [[ionosonde]].  It is a graph of the virtual height of the ionosphere plotted against frequency.  Ionograms are often converted into electron density profiles.  Data from ionograms may be used to measure changes in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] due to [[space weather]] events.

{{distinguish|Isotropic radiator}}
'''Isotropic radiation''' is [[radiation]] that has the same intensity regardless of the direction of [[measurement]], such as would be found in a [[thermal cavity]]. The radiation may be [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]], [[Sound waves|sound]] or may be composed of [[elementary particle]]s.

      <comment>I hate to mess with this well-crafted list, but synonyms and invalid names really don't belong on a List of Species. If there is controversy in taxonomic placement (var. or sp?), sure. But names like Acer montanum, universally agreed as not valid, should be cleared away</comment>

A '''botanical garden''' is a place where [[plant]]s, especially [[fern]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[flowering]] plants, are grown and displayed for the purposes of [[research]] and [[education]]. This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with showy flowers, are grown for public amenity only. [[Botanical garden]]s that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as [[arboretum]]s.  They are occasionally associated with [[university|universities]], [[zoo]]s.

There are at least '''20 species of [[Gymnosperms]] or [[Coniferous]] plants in [[Montana]].''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fieldguide.mt.gov/displayClasses.aspx?phylum=Pinophyta |title=Montana Field Guide-Conifers |publisher=Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conifers''', division '''Pinophyta''', also known as division '''Coniferophyta''' or '''Coniferae''', are one of 13 or 14 [[division (botany)|division]] level [[taxon|taxa]] within the [[Plant|Kingdom Plantae]]. Pinophytes are [[gymnosperms]]. They are [[Conifer cone|cone-bearing]] seed [[plant]]s with [[Vascular plant|vascular]] tissue; all extant conifers are [[woody plant]]s, the great majority being [[tree]]s with just a few being [[shrub]]s. Typical examples of conifers include [[Cedrus|cedar]]s, [[Douglas-fir]]s, [[Cupressaceae|cypresses]], [[fir]]s, [[juniper]]s, [[Agathis|kauris]], [[larch]]es, [[pine]]s, [[Tsuga|hemlock]]s, [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]]s, [[spruce]]s, and [[Taxaceae|yew]]s.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;Campbell, Reece, "Phylum Coniferophyta."Biology. 7th. 2005. Print. P.595&lt;/ref&gt; The division contains approximately eight families, 68 genera, and 630 living species.&lt;ref name=Catalogue&gt;[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/show_database_details.php?database_name=Conifer+Database Catalogue of Life: 2007 Annual checklist - Conifer database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115190412/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/show_database_details.php?database_name=Conifer+Database |date=2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lott | first1 = J. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Pennell | first3 = K. | last4 = Lesage | first4 = A. | last5 = West | first5 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Iron-rich particles and globoids in embryos of seeds from phyla Coniferophyta, Cycadophyta, Gnetophyta, and Ginkgophyta: characteristics of early seed plants | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Botany | volume = 80 | issue = 9| pages = 954–961 | doi=10.1139/b02-083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4435">This is a list of [[mountain]]s ({{lang-hr|planina}}) in [[Croatia]].

The highest mountains in Croatia belong to the [[Dinarides]] range that is sometimes also called Dinaric Alps, of which Dinara is the highest mountain in Croatia. Together with the easternmost parts of the [[Alps]], these mountains span most of the country, and their [[orogenic]] activity started in the [[Paleozoic]] with the [[Variscan orogeny]] and continued in the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] with the [[Alpine orogeny]].

The mountains in the northeastern part of the country, in the [[Pannonian plain]], are considerably older than the rest as their orogeny happened in the [[Paleozoic]].

Mountains in the list are ordered by height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5015">This ''' list of protected areas in Aarhus Municipality''' lists protected areas in [[Aarhus Municipality]], [[Denmark]].

Three protections in the municipality are shared with adjacent [[Skanderborg Municipality]]. Most of the older protections are grounded in attempts at protecting scenic landscape values or securing public access, while more recent protections are mostly based in protecting biodiversity and threatened habitats.

In [[Labrador]], Canada, the [[North Atlantic Craton]] is known as the '''Nain Province'''.

}}
The '''Ontong Java Plateau''' ('''OJP''') is a huge [[oceanic plateau]] located in the south-west [[Pacific Ocean]], north of the [[Solomon Islands]].
The OJP was emplaced {{Circa}} 120&amp;nbsp;Ma with a much smaller volcanic event {{Circa}} 90&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Two other south-west Pacific plateaus, [[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]] and [[Hikurangi Plateau|Hikurangi]], now separated from the OJP by [[Cretaceous]] [[ocean basin]]s, are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous [[large igneous province]] together with the OJP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2006|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface and represented a volume of {{Convert|80000000|km3|abbr=on}} of [[basalt]]ic [[magma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rizo|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This "Ontong Java event", first proposed in 1991, represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years, with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to {{Convert|22|km3|abbr=on}}/year over three million years, several times larger than the [[Deccan Traps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarduno|Mayer|Winterer|Sliter|1991|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by [[seamount]]s such as the [[Ontong Java Atoll]], the largest atoll in the world.&lt;ref name="Neal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Neal|Mahoney|Kroenke|Duncan|1993|loc=Physical features and gross structure of the OJP, pp. 184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological setting==
The OJP covers {{Convert|1,500,000|km2|abbr=on}}, roughly the size of Alaska.  It reaches up to {{Convert|1700|m|abbr=on}} below sea level but has an average depth closer to {{Convert|2|-|3|km|abbr=on}}.   It is bounded by Lyra Basin to the north-west, East Mariana Basin to the north, Nauru Basin to the north-east, and the Ellice Basin to the south-east.  The OJP has collided with the Solomon Islands island arc and now lies on the inactive [[Vitiaz Trench]] and the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]]-[[Australian Plate|Australian]] plate boundary.&lt;ref name="Neal" /&gt;

The high plateau, with a crustal thickness estimated to at least {{Convert|25|km|abbr=on}} but probably closer to {{Convert|36|km|abbr=on}}, has a volume of more than {{Convert|5000000|km3|abbr=on}}.  The maximum extent of the event can, however, be much larger since lavas in several surrounding basins are closely related to the OJP event and probably represent dike swarms associated with the emplacement of the OJP.&lt;ref name="Neal" /&gt;

==Tectonic evolution==
OJP formed quickly over a [[mantle plume]] head, most likely the then newly formed [[Louisville hotspot]], followed by limited volcanism for at least 30 million years.  The extant seamounts of the [[Louisville Ridge]] started to form 70&amp;nbsp;Ma and have a different [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition, and therefore a shift in intensity and magma supply in the plume must have occurred before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahoney|Storey|Duncan|Spencer|1993|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early, short-duration eruptions of OJP coincide with the global [[Anoxic event#Jurassic and Cretaceous|Early Aptian oceanic anoxic event]] (known as OAE1a or the Selli Event, 125.0–124.6&amp;nbsp;Ma) that lead to the deposition of black [[shale]]s during the interval 124–122&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Additionally, isotopic records of seawater in sediments have been associated with the 90&amp;nbsp;Ma OJP submarine eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tejada|Suzuki|Kuroda|Coccioni|2009|loc=Abstract; Introduction, pp. 855–856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 80% of the OJP is being [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the Solomon Islands. Only the uppermost 7&amp;nbsp;km of the crust is preserved on the Australian Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|Taira|2004|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This collision has [[Tectonic uplift|lifted]] some of the OJP between {{Convert|200|-|2000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.  The construction of Pliocene stratovolcanoes in the western end of the convergence zone has resulted in the [[New Georgia Islands]] ({{Convert|1768|m|abbr=on}}) and [[Bougainville Island]] ({{Convert|2743|m|abbr=on}}).  Shortening, uplift, and erosion of the northern Melanesian arc and the Malaita [[accretionary prism]] at deep levels has produced [[Guadacanal]] ({{Convert|2447|m|abbr=on}}), [[Makira]] ({{Convert|1250|m|abbr=on}}), and [[Malaita]] ({{Convert|1251|m|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|Taira|2004|loc=Erosional levels of rocks in the Solomon Islands, p. 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7681">The '''Ottoman–German Alliance''' was an alliance between the [[German Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] that was ratified on August 2, 1914, shortly following the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The alliance was created as part of a joint-cooperative effort that would strengthen and modernize [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|the failing Ottoman military]], as well as provide Germany safe passage into neighboring [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Frank G. Weber, ''Eagles on the Crescent: Germany, Austria, and the diplomacy of the Turkish alliance, 1914-1918'' (Cornell University Press, 1970)..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On the eve of the [[First World War]], the Ottoman Empire was in ruinous shape.  As a result of successive wars fought in this period, territories were lost, the economy was in shambles and people were demoralized and tired.  What the Empire needed was time to recover and to carry out reforms; however, there was no time, because the world was sliding into war and the Ottoman Empire was highly unlikely to manage to remain outside the coming conflict. Since staying neutral and focusing on recovery did not appear to be possible, the Empire had to ally with one or the other camp, because, after the [[Italo-Turkish War]] and [[Balkan Wars]], it was completely out of resources. There were not adequate quantities of weaponry and machinery left; and neither did the Empire have the financial means to purchase new ones. The only option for the [[Sublime Porte]] was to establish an alliance with a European power; and at first it did not really matter which one that would be. As [[Talaat Pasha|Talat Paşa]], the Minister of Interior, wrote in his memoirs: “Turkey needed to join one of the country groups so that it could organize its domestic administration, strengthen and maintain its commerce and industry, expand its railroads, in short to survive and to preserve its existence.”{{Citation needed |date=September 2016}}

===Negotiating alliances===
Most European powers were not interested in joining an alliance with the ailing Ottoman Empire. Already at the beginning of the Turco-Italian War in Northern Africa, the [[Grand Vizier]] Sait Halim Paşa had expressed the government’s desire, and the Turkish ambassadors were asked to find out whether the European capitals would be interested. Only Russia seemed to have an interest – however, under conditions that would have amounted a Russian protectorate on the Ottoman lands. It was impossible to reconcile an alliance with the French: as France’s main ally was [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the long-time enemy of the Ottoman Empire since the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|War of 1828]]. Great Britain declined an Ottoman request.&lt;ref&gt; Strachan, ''The First World War: Volume I: To Arms. Vol. 1'' (2003) pp 644-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed V]] specifically wanted the Empire to remain a [[non-belligerent]] nation. However pressure from some of Mehmed’s senior advisors led the Empire to align with the Central Powers.  Whilst Great Britain was unenthusiastic about aligning with the [[Ottoman Empire]], Germany was enthusiastic.

==Treaty with Germany==
Germany needed the Ottoman Empire on its side.  The [[Orient Express]] had run directly to [[Constantinople]] since 1889, and prior to the First World War the Sultan had consented to a plan to extend it through [[Anatolia]] to [[Baghdad]] under German auspices.  This would strengthen the Ottoman Empire's link with industrialized Europe, while also giving Germany easier access to its African [[German colonial empire |colonies]] and to trade markets in [[British India | India]].  To keep the Ottoman Empire from joining the [[Triple Entente]], Germany encouraged [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria | Bulgaria]] to enter the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt; Hew Strachan, ''The First World War: Volume I: To Arms. Vol. 1'' (2003) pp 644-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[secret treaty]] was concluded between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the German Empire on August 2, 1914.  The [[Ottoman Empire]] was to enter the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]] one day after the German Empire declared war on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Yale | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/turkgerm.asp | title = The Treaty of Alliance Between Germany and Turkey}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance was ratified on 2 August by many high-ranking Ottoman officials, including [[Grand Vizier]] [[Said Halim Pasha]], the Minister of War [[Enver Pasha]], the Interior Minister [[Talat Pasha]], and Head of Parliament Halil Bey.&lt;ref&gt; Gerard E. Silberstein, "The Central Powers and the Second Turkish Alliance, 1915." ''Slavic Review'' 24.1 (1965): 77-89. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2492991 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there was no signature from the [[House of Osman]] as the Sultan [[Mehmed V]] did not sign it.  According to the Constitution, the Sultan was the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Ottoman Army | Army]], and this made the legitimacy of the Alliance questionable. This meant that the army was not able to fight on behalf of the Sultan. The Sultan himself had wanted the Empire to remain [[Neutrality (international relations) |neutral]]. He did not wish to command a war himself and as such left the Cabinet to do much of his bidding.  The third member of the cabinet of the Three Pashas [[Djemal Pasha]] also did not sign the treaty as he had tried to form an alliance with France.  Not all parts of the Ottoman government accepted the Alliance.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

[[Austria-Hungary]] adhered to the Ottoman–German treaty on 5 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Strachan | first = Hew | author-link = Hew Strachan | title = The First World War | volume = 1: To Arms | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | page = 670}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire]] did not enter the war until the [[Ottoman Navy]] [[Black Sea Raid|bombarded Russian ports]] on the 29 October 1914.

''A [[Rapa das Bestas|rapa das bestas]]'' is the name given to the annual ''curro'' (roundup) of wild horses celebrated the first friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday of July in Sabucedo, [[Pontevedra]], [[Spain]].

Across more than 200&amp;nbsp;km² of hillside currently more than six-hundred horses roam freely in fourteen droves, referred to in Galician as ''bestas'' (mares) and ''garañones'' (stallions). The festival involves bringing the horses down from the hillside, gathering them into an enclosure, cutting their manes and tails, and tagging them, nowadays with a microchip. The ''curro'' in Sabucedo is the most renowned of all and is set apart from the rest by unique characteristics, the most important of which is that neither ropes, sticks, nor other such instruments are used to subdue the animals.
The ''aloitadores'', those responsible for restraining the horses whilst the ''rapa'' takes place, use only their body strength and raw skill to complete the job. Another interesting feature of the ''rapa'' is the ''Bajada''– the process of rounding up the horses and leading them into Sabucedo – a part of the celebration joined by hundreds of local residents and visitors from further afield. Another element of the tradition is the celebration of a poignant mass, held very early on the Saturday morning, before going up the hill. During the mass, the congregation pray to San Lorenzo, the patron saint of Sabucedo, to keep those participating from any harm.

According to the scholar Manuel Cabada,&lt;ref&gt;''A Rapa das bestas de Sabucedo. Historia e antropoloxía dunha tradición'' (Vigo, Ir Indo, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; the ''rapa'' is a rite of passage from childhood to adolescence for those who seize a foal for the first time, guided and assisted by the older generation. 
The town of [[A Estrada]] is twinned with [[Almonte, Spain|Almonte]], located in the province of [[Huelva]], due to a similar celebration that takes place called ''Saca de las Yeguas''.

== History ==

Records show that the tradition of the ''bajada'', the subsequent ''rapa'' and the marking of the young foals dates back to the beginning of the 18th century. Nevertheless, it is believed that the tradition is actually much older as scholars such as Manuel Cabada have mentioned in their writings. In fact it could even be Pre-Roman, given that various [[petroglyphs]] have been found in the area in which men are depicted on horseback. In 1963, the festival was declared of [[Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain|National Touristic Interest]], and in 2007 was awarded the status of International Touristic Interest, one of only four in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to hold this prestigious title.

[[File:Rodrigues3d.png|thumb|The Rodrigues Triple Junction viewed from south.  Note the "wake" of the eastward propagating triple junction.]]
The '''Rodrigues Triple Junction''' ('''RTJ'''), also known as the '''Central Indian [Ocean] Triple Junction''' ('''CITJ''') is a geologic [[triple junction]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]] where three tectonic plates meet: the [[African Plate]], the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], and the [[Antarctic Plate]].  The triple junction is named for the island of [[Rodrigues]] which lies {{Convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} north-west of it.

The RTJ was first recognized in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKenzie|Sclater|1971|loc=Indian Ocean triple junction, pp. 488–494}}&lt;/ref&gt; then described as a stable R-R-R (ridge-ridge-ridge) triple junction based on coarse ship data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|1991|loc=Introduction, pp. 8019–8020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries==
The boundaries of the three plates which meet at the Rodrigues Triple Junction are all oceanic spreading centers, making it an R-R-R type triple junction.  They are: the [[Central Indian Ridge]] (CIR, between the African and Indo-Australian plates) with a spreading rate of 50&amp;nbsp;mm/yr; the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]] (SWIR, between the African and Antarctic plates) 16&amp;nbsp;mm/yr; and the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]] (SEIR, between the Indo-Australian and Antarctic plates) 60&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sauter|Mendel|Rommevaux-Jestin|Patriat|1997|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEIR has the highest spreading rates at the RTJ, and, while now considered an intermediate spreading centre, it was a fast spreading ridge between [[magnetic anomaly|anomalies]] 31 and 22, with a rate of 110&amp;nbsp;km/myr at anomaly 28.  The spreading rate is similar in the CIR but slower and the ridge has a more complex geometry.  The SWIR has ultra-slow spreading rates, a rough topography, and great number of large offset fracture zones.&lt;ref name="Dyment-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyment|1993|loc=Introduction, pp. 13863–13864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three boundaries are themselves intersected by diffuse boundaries: the CIR is intersected by the [[Indian Plate|Indian]]–[[Capricorn Plate|Capricorn]] boundary;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiens|DeMets|Gordon|Stein|1985|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CEIR by the Capricorn–[[Australian Plate|Australian]] boundary;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royer|Gordon|1997|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SWIR by the [[African Plate|Nubian]]–[[Somali Plate|Somalian]] boundary.&lt;ref name="Chu-1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chu|Gordon|1999|pp=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[East African Rift]] divides Africa into the Nubian and Somalian plates.  These plates converge in the southern part of the rift valley (2&amp;nbsp;mm/yr) but diverge in the northern part (6&amp;nbsp;mm/yr) and a very slight difference in spreading rates across the central part of the ultra-slow SWIR indicates there is a vague triple junction somewhere south of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="Chu-1999" /&gt;

==Tectonic evolution==
The RTJ was born when the [[Seychelles microcontinent]] drifted off the [[Indian Plate]] at 64&amp;nbsp;Ma and the [[Carlsberg Ridge]] opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masalu|2002|loc=Introduction, pp. 87, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the RTJ has moved eastward from south of Madagascar (modern coordinates) to its current location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhou|Dick|2013|loc=Tectonic setting, p. 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 65&amp;nbsp;Ma the RTJ has been migrating north-east at a decreasing rate: originally the velocity was 10&amp;nbsp;cm/yr, at 43&amp;nbsp;Ma 2.6&amp;nbsp;cm/yr, and since 41&amp;nbsp;Ma around 3.6–3.8&amp;nbsp;cm/yr.  The stability in migration rate around 41&amp;nbsp;Ma coincide with the bend in the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]&amp;nbsp;— hinting at a global reorganisation of tectonic plates at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Masalu|2002|loc=Conclusions, p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally considered a stable RRR (ridge-ridge-ridge) triple junction, the RTJ is now believed to be an unstable RRF (ridge-ridge-fault) triple junction in which the axis of the CIR is offset eastward by 14&amp;nbsp;km/myr because of differences in spreading rates between the CEIR and CIR.  This is a configuration similar to that of the [[Galapagos Triple Junction]] in the east Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Munschy|Schlich|1989|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each time the RTJ offset eastward a new segment is added to CIR. resulting in a constant length for the CEIR while CIR constantly lengthens.  Spreading rates in the SWIR, in contrast, is intermittent and very slow, but the extension of the plates in the SEIR and CIR causes constant lengthening of the SWIR near the RTJ.&lt;ref name="Dyment-intro" /&gt;

'''Rubble''' is broken [[rock (geology)|stone]], of irregular size, shape&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rubble |volume=23 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally found in the soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare [[cornbrash]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rubble" def. 2., "Brash n. 2. def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.

==Building==

"[[Rubble-work]]" is a name applied to several types of [[masonry]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown together in a wall between boards and [[grout]]ed with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] almost like [[concrete]], is called in [[Italian language|Italian]] "muraglia di getto" and in [[French language|French]] "bocage".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In Pakistan, walls made of rubble and concrete, cast in a formwork, are called 'situ', which probably derives from Sanskrit (similar to the Latin 'in situ' meaning 'made on the spot').

Work executed with more or less large stones put together without any attempt at [[Course (architecture)|courses]] is called rubble&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; walling. Where similar work is laid in courses, it is known as coursed rubble. [[Dry-stone wall]]ing is somewhat similar work done without the use of mortar. It is bound together by the fit of the stones and the regular placement of stones which extend through the thickness of the wall. A rubble wall built with mortar will be stronger if assembled in this way.

===Rubble walls in Malta===
[[File:Ta' Dmejrek-IMG 1500.jpg|thumb|Rubble wall near [[Dingli]], [[Malta]]]]

Rubble walls ({{lang-mt|ħitan tas-sejjieħ}}) are found all over the island of [[Malta]]. Similar walls are also frequently found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that were found in the area lying on the ground or in the soil.  It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. Rubble walls are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that  rubble walls offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many rubble walls on the side of the hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.

==Threatened species legislation==

===Federal legislation===
''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (Cth) and Regulations set up a framework for protection of the Australian environment, including its biodiversity and its natural and culturally significant places. 

===State legislation===
Threatened species in Australia are protected (or affected by) by four main types of legislation:
* Protected areas legislation (e.g., ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974]]'' (NSW)) 
* Threatened species legislation (e.g. Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW), ''[[Threatened Species Protection Act 1995]]'' (Tas)) 
* Native vegetation conservation laws 
* Fisheries legislation.

[[File:Diagram of umbra, penumbra &amp; antumbra.png|thumb|275px|right|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra of Earth and images that could be seen at some points in these areas (note: the relative size and distance of the bodies shown are entirely fictitious). ]]
[[File:Kernschatten und Halbschatten.svg|thumb|Umbra (A) and penumbra (B)]]
The '''umbra''', '''penumbra''' and '''antumbra''' are three distinct parts of a [[shadow]], created by any light source after impinging on an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] object. Assuming no [[diffraction]], for a point source only the umbra is cast.

These names are most often used for the shadows cast by [[celestial body|celestial bodies]], though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness, such as in [[sunspots]].

==Umbra==
[[File:Antumbra.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Umbra, penumbra, and antumbra formed through windows and shutters]]

The '''umbra''' (Latin for "shadow") is the innermost and darkest part of a shadow, where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body. An observer in the umbra experiences a total [[eclipse]]. The umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms a [[cone|right circular cone]]; to a viewer at the cone's [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], the two bodies are equal in [[apparent size]]. The [[lunar distance (astronomy)|distance]] from the [[Moon]] to the apex of its umbra is roughly equal to that between the Moon and [[Earth]] ({{cvt|384402|km|mi}}). Since Earth's diameter is 3.70 times the Moon's, its umbra extends correspondingly farther: roughly {{cvt|1400000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit2/eclipses.html |title=Lecture 9: Eclipses of the Sun &amp; Moon |work=Astronomy 161: An Introduction to Solar System Astronomy |first=Richard |last=Pogge |publisher=[[Ohio State University]] |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penumbra ==
{{Redirect|Penumbra}}   
The '''penumbra''' (from the Latin ''paene'' "almost, nearly") is the region in which only a portion of the light source is obscured by the occluding body. An observer in the penumbra experiences a [[partial eclipse]].
An alternative definition is that the penumbra is the region where ''some or all'' of the light source is obscured (i.e., the umbra is a subset of the penumbra).  For example, [[NASA]]'s Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility defines that a body in the umbra is also within the penumbra.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/misc/toolkit_docs_N0061/Tutorials/pdf/individual_docs/45_event_finding_preview.pdf ''Event Finding Subsystem Preview''] Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth umbral cone (partial).png|thumb|center|upright=3|Scale diagram of [[Earth's shadow]], showing how the umbral cone extends beyond the [[orbit of the Moon]] (the Moon is indicated by the yellow dot).]] 
{{clear}}

== Antumbra ==
The '''antumbra''' (from Latin ''ante'', "before") is the region from which the occluding body appears entirely  within the disc of the light source. An observer in this region experiences an [[annular eclipse]], in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body. If the observer moves closer to the light source, the apparent size of the occluding body increases until it causes a full umbra.

'''VENUS''' - ('''Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea''') is one of two principal cabled sea floor observatories operated by [[Ocean Networks Canada]]  at the [[University of Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. 

The VENUS cabled ocean observatory is designed to provide new ways of studying the ocean. Since its launch in 2006, it has enabled scientists to run and monitor various ocean experiments out of the convenience of their desktops. The aim of VENUS is to study coastal oceans in two sites near Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia. The first site of the VENUS seafloor network, operational since February 2006, is located in [[Saanich Inlet]] at 100m. The second site is located in the deeper waters of the [[Strait of Georgia]] and links instrument arrays deployed at depths varying from 100 to 300 meters.   

VENUS uses Internet, telecommunication technology, and a network of about 50 kilometers of fiber optic cables at a maximum depth of 300 meters to create a permanent link to cameras and other monitoring instruments on the seafloor.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star.''24, May 2008. Calamai, P.&lt;/ref&gt; The VENUS observatory has scores of sensors that measure such parameters as temperature, salinity, and pressure of the water 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]''. 21 June 2008 pg 39-41. Reichert, C.&lt;/ref&gt; The seafloor instruments provide oceanographers, marine biologists, and geologists with real-time ocean data. "The VENUS observatory represents a step change for the world of marine science and oceanography, which will help improve the way marine scientists observe ocean life in the future," said Dr. Phil Hart, Director of Engineering at Global Marine. Ship-based ocean research methods provide a snapshot view only, whereas the VENUS observatory can be like a continuous film, which will allow more reliable long term observation.

The data, including images and audio, are processed and made available to researchers and the public through the VENUS website. The goal of the project is to not only provide valuable information to advance research, but also to allow everyone from graduate school students to curious parents to log on and view the ocean up close. 

The facility is funded by the federal and provincial governments of Canada, as well as private industry. VENUS is designed to provide continuous observations for 20–25 years.

Sites in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network may also be classified as [[Important Bird Area]]s, Ramsar [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance|wetlands of international importance]], or both.

There are three possible classifications for sites in the network. Landscapes are always classified as being of Hemispheric Importance.

;Hemispheric Importance
:sites that act as [[Staging area (birds)|staging]], [[nest]]ing or breeding grounds for at least 500,000 shorebirds annually, or at least 30% of the biogeographic population of any species.

;International Importance 
:sites that act as staging, nesting or breeding grounds for at least 100,000 shorebirds annually, or at least 10% of the biogeographic population of any species

;Regional Importance
:sites that act as staging, nesting or breeding grounds for at least 20,000 shorebirds annually, or at least 1% of the biogeographic population of any species

The '''Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows''' is an [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Nepal]], [[India]], and [[Tibet]], which lies between the [[tree line]] and [[snow line]] in the western portion of the [[Himalaya]] Range.

==Setting==
The Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows covers an area of {{convert|70,200|sqkm|mi2}}, extending from the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]] in central Nepal westwards across [[Uttarakhand]] and eastern [[Himachal Pradesh]] states of India to the gorge of the [[Sutlej River]]. The alpine shrub and meadows lie between approximately {{convert|3000|and|5000|m|ft}} elevation. 

The [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] lie east of the Kali Gandaki gorge, while the [[Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] lies west of the Sutlej. Below {{convert|3000|m|ft}} lie the [[Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]]. Permanent ice and snow lies above {{convert|5000|m|ft}}. To the north, the Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows transition to the drier [[Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] of central Tibet. The [[Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] lies to the southwest.

==Flora==
Alpine shrublands, dominated by [[rhododendron]]s, predominate at lower elevations close to the treeline.

Above the shrublands are alpine meadows, known as [[bugyal]]s or bughiyals, which support a variety of herbaceous plants, including species of ''[[Anaphalis]], [[Cyananthus]], [[Jurinea]], [[Morina]], [[Potentilla]], [[Gentiana]], [[Delphinium]], [[Meconopsis]], [[Pedicularis]], [[Anemone]], [[Aster (genus)|Aster]], [[Polygonum]], [[Primula]]'', and ''[[Saussurea]]''. In the spring and summer, the alpine meadows are covered with brightly colored flowers.

On the upper slopes, low plants of genera ''[[Saxifraga]], [[Allium]], [[Corydalis]], [[Eriophyton]], [[Stellaria]], [[Soroseris]]'', and ''[[Cremanthodium]]'' grow among the boulders and scree.

An alpine steppe of ''[[Caragana pygma]], C. gerardiana, [[Lonicera spinosa]], [[Juniperus squamata]], [[Juniperus indica]], [[Ephedra gerardiana]], [[Hippophae tibetana]], [[Myricaria rosea]], [[Lonicera spinulosa]]'', and ''[[Berberis]]'' can be found in drier parts of the ecoregion.

==Fauna==
Large mammals include the [[snow leopard]] (''Uncia uncia''), [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep (''Pseudois nayaur''), [[Himalayan tahr]] (''Hemitragus jemlahicus''), [[Himalayan musk deer]] (''Moschus chrysogaster''), and [[mainland serow]] (''Capricornis sumatraensis''). Smaller mammals include weasels and pikas.

==Conservation==
