'''Annals''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:annales|annāles]]}}, from {{lang|la|annus}}, "year"){{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|OED|1884}} are a concise [[history|historical]] record in which events are arranged chronologically, year by year,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} although the term is also used loosely for any historical record.{{sfnp|OED|1884}}

==Scope==
The nature of the distinction between annals and history is a subject that has received more attention from critics than its intrinsic importance deserves, based on divisions established by the ancient Romans.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} [[Verrius Flaccus]] is quoted by [[Aulus Gellius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], {{lang|la|[[Noctes Atticae]]}}, v.18.&lt;/ref&gt; as stating that the etymology of ''history'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ιστορειν}}, ''historein'', equated with [[Latin]] {{lang|la|inspicere}}, "to inquire in person") properly restricts it to primary sources such as [[Thucydides]]'s which have come from the author's own observations, while annals record the events of earlier times arranged according to years.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} [[Hayden White|White]] distinguishes annals from [[chronicle]]s, which organize their events by topics such as the reigns of kings,{{sfnp|White|1987|p=16}} and from histories, which aim to present and conclude a narrative implying the moral importance of the events recorded.{{sfnp|White|1987|p=7}}{{sfnp|White|1987|p=11}}{{sfnp|White|1987|p=16}} Generally speaking, annalists record events drily, leaving the entries unexplained and equally weighted.{{sfnp|White|1987|p=7}}

==History==

===Ancient===
{{main|Annalists}}
{{hatnote|See also: The ''[[Annales Maximi]]'' and the [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals of Tacitus]].}}
The chief sources of information in regard to the annals of ancient [[Rome]] are two passages in [[Cicero]]&lt;ref name=chickpea&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'', ii.12.52.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|EB|1878}} and in [[Servius]]&lt;ref name=server&gt;[[Servius]], ''ad Aen''. i.373.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|EB|1911}} which have been the subject of much discussion. Cicero states that, from the [[Roman Republic|founding of the Republic]] down to the pontificate of [[Publius Mucius Scaevola]] ({{circa|lk=no|132}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), it was usual for the [[pontifex maximus]] to record the name of the magistrates and the noteworthy events of each year on a white tablet (an {{lang|la|album}}), which was exhibited in an open place at his house so that the people might read it.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Servius states the events were written for each day.{{refn|group=n|{{lang-la|per singulos dies}}.&lt;ref name=server/&gt;}} In the late Republic, these were known as the {{lang|la|[[Annales Maximi]]}}.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} After the pontificate of Publius, annals were compiled by various unofficial writers, of whom Cicero names [[Cato the elder|Cato]], [[Pictor]], and [[Piso]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} These annals have been generally regarded as the same with the {{lang|la|[[Commentarii Pontificum]]}} cited by [[Livy]], but there seems reason to believe that the two were distinct, with the {{lang|la|Commentarii}} being fuller and more circumstantial.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Verrius Flaccus's division of genres is borne out in the common division of Tacitus's works into ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} although he did not use those titles to refer to his own works.

===Medieval===
{{hatnote|See also: The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], the [[Chronicle of Ireland]] the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], and the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], [[Annals of Ulster|of Ulster]], [[Annals of Innisfallen|of Innisfallen]], [[Annales Cambriae|of Wales]], [[Annales Fuldenses|of Fulda]], [[Annales Bertiniani|of St&amp;nbsp;Bertin]], and [[Annales Laureschamenses|of Lorsch]].}}
Among the early Christians, it was common to establish the date of [[Easter]] by asking local Jews for the date of [[Passover]] ([[Nisan]] 14 in the [[Jewish calendar]]) and either using that date or the nearest Sunday to it.{{sfnp|Schwartz|1905|pp=104&amp;nbsp;ff}}{{sfnp|Gibson|1903|p=100}} By the end of the 3rd century, this date sometimes occurred before the [[spring equinox]] and frequently varied from city to city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Hist. Eccl.]]'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|325 Council of Nicaea]], [[Easter tables]] began to be drawn up according to [[computus|various methods of computing Easter]], often running from the [[Passion of Christ|Passion]] until decades or centuries into the future. Beginning in [[Irish monasticism|Ireland]], Wales, and England in the 7th century, monks began to briefly note important events of the year as [[marginalia]] in these tables.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Thereafter the compilation of annals became by and large a monastic activity, with the earliest recorded monastic annals being compiled in Ireland and known as the ''[[Chronicle of Ireland]]''.{{sfnp|Flechner|2013|pp=422&amp;nbsp;ff}}  Not all early annalistic texts, however, were monastic, and some in fact were made under royal patronage. For example, what is now called the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a text concerned mainly with the activities of kings, was written in annalistic form. Other examples of insular annals, written under various kinds of patronage, include the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'', the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'', and the ''[[Annals of Wales]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Cambriae}}).

Introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|insular missionaries]] to the continent, these texts were recopied, augmented, and continued, especially in [[Austrasia]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}} During the 9th-century [[Carolingian Renaissance]], they became the usual form of contemporary history: major examples include the ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', the ''[[Annales Fuldenses|Annals of Fulda]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Fuldenses}}), the ''[[Annales Bertiniani|Annals of St&amp;nbsp;Bertin]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Bertiniani}}), and the ''[[Annales Laureschamenses|Annals of Lorsch]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Laureschamenses}}).{{sfnp|EB|1911}} As the annals developed into fuller and more descriptive entries, they became more indistinguishable from [[chronicle]]s, although the term was still used for various works, such as the [[Annals of Waverley]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

===Modern===
In modern literature, the term "annals" is similarly loosely applied to works which more or less strictly adhere to the order of years,{{sfnp|EB|1911}} both in western contexts (English ''Annual Registers'', French {{lang|fr|Annuaires de la Revue}}, German {{lang|de|Jahrbücher}}) and to equivalent styles in other cultures (such as the Chinese [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]).

It is also applied to various [[periodicals]], particularly [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the [[sciences]], after the model of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]'s ''[[Annales de chimie et de physique]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5785">'''Anneliese Bulling''' (born April 21, 1900 in Ellwürden, Wesermarch (today known as [[Lower Saxony]]), died February 9, 2004 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]), also known as '''Anneliese Gutkind''', was a German&amp;ndash;American art historian specializing in [[Chinese art]] and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]].

== Life ==
Anneliese Bulling came from a wealthy, long-established and well-educated German landowning family. She lived with her father, Henry Bulling (1858&amp;ndash;1940), a banker, and her mother, Anna Umbsen (1867&amp;ndash;1955).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/wesermarsch/kultur/zeitgeschichte-mit-ganz-persoenlicher-note_a_1,0,478925174.html|title = Time history with a personal touch, Historian Vonderach written documentation "from Ellwürden to Hampstead"|date = May 14, 2009|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Hartfil|first = Norbert|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, she had a short-lived marriage to a farmer that was soon declared invalid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/politik/niedersachsen/deutsch-englische-erlebnisse_a_1,0,604194649.html|title = German-English experiences, Anneliese Bulling|date = June 18, 2011|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zietung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Welp|first = Jörgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her failed first marriage, Bulling went off to study Art History and Chinese Studies in [[Berlin]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] (now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) under [[Erich Haenisch]] and Brinkmann.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1935 she graduated with a degree in Chinese Architecture, and in the same year emigrated to [[London]] with her partner, the Jewish architect [[Erwin Gutkind]].{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1946 she found work as a research scholar at the [[Universities’ China Committee in London|Universities China Committee]] and then in 1947 in Cambridge at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]], where she received a PhD, the subject of her dissertation being ''Representational Art in the [[Han period|Han Period]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/14-4/Bulling.pdf|title = Archaeological Excavation in China 1946-1966|last = |first = |date = Summer 1972|journal = UPENN Expedition Magazine|accessdate = May 23, 2014|doi = |volume=14 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulling's research focus was Chinese art history, especially architecture and arts and crafts. She developed a theory that the Chinese characters are the result of prehistoric ([[Neolithic]]) astronomical calendar symbols.{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1956, Bulling and Gutkind married and emigrated to the United States for his professorship at the University of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1964 she joined Dr. Stackler's translation project, translating many Chinese books, and in 1966 she was promoted to Research Associate for Chinese Art and Archaeology at [[Columbia University]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her husband died in 1968.

Bulling died in 2004 at the age of 103 years. She had left the [[Oldenburg Municipal Museum]] an extensive collection of letters of correspondence from 1928&amp;ndash;1946 (around 4,200 letters and postcards), was the inspiration for the 2009 book, ''From Ellwürden to Hampstead. The letters of the Oldenburg emigrant Anneliese Bulling. A contribution to the history of mentalities of the Oldenburg bourgeoisie in the period of National Socialism'' by Andreas Vonderach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the context of fiction, '''apocrypha''' includes stories and works set in a fictional universe that do not belong in its [[canon (fiction)|canon]] but may still have some authority within it. The boundaries between canon and apocrypha can often be blurry.

Apocrypha may include tie-in merchandise, such as video games, novels and comics, which is often referred to as the fictional universe's '[[Expanded Universe|expanded universe]]'.

At times, apocryphal material may contradict the continuity that has already been established by canon. Even when no such contradictions occur, such material may sometimes be deemed apocrypha if it has been produced independently of the universe's creator. For example, [[Buffyverse]] creator [[Joss Whedon]] has little involvement with Buffyverse [[Buffyverse novels|novels]], has never closely overseen or edited one, and has never read an entire novel through.

[[Star Trek canon]] consists of the Star Trek television series and movies. All other Star Trek novels and comics, whether licensed by Paramount or not, are not part of canon, but are classified as apocrypha. 

Fan fiction is referred to as [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]].

==Etymology==
The word derives the Greek word '{{lang|el|απόκρυφα}}, which means ''opened, revealed,'' or ''uncovered''. [[Jerome]] coined the term to refer to those books of the [[Old Testament]] that were not found in the Hebrew Tanakh, and it has since been used to describe religious texts that may not belong to the [[Biblical canon|canon]].

The term is used in nonreligious contexts. An account or anecdote is said to be apocryphal if its authenticity or veracity is questionable.

'''Bengal studies''' ({{lang-bn|বঙ্গবিদ্যা}}; ''Bangabidya'') is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of the [[Bengali people]], [[Bengali culture|culture]], [[Bengali language|language]], [[Bengali literature|literature]], and [[History of Bengal|history]]. The focus of this field, which qualifies as [[area studies]] and [[cultural studies]], is on Indic Bengalis who follow an indigenous system of faith and refer to themselves as Bengalis. It is a subset of [[South Asian studies]] and [[Indology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangabidya.net/isbs/idea/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bengalistudies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the history and culture of the Bengali people have been undertaken by the Bengalis themselves and others travelling to Bengal since earliest times.{{vague|When?|date=November 2018}} The work of [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] is often considered{{by who?|date=November 2018}} to be a forerunner of Bengali studies in the modern period, while [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]] pioneered the study of Bengali poets through a critically annotated collection of the diverse oral poetic traditions of Bengal. Twentieth century Bengali historians like [[Ramesh Chandra Majumdar]] and [[Niharranjan Ray]] were champions of the study of the history and culture of the Bengali people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">The distinction between '''broad and general accents''' is a [[social construction|socio-culturo-economic]] contrast commonly made between different [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] of the same language, typically spoken in a single geographical location:
*A '''broad accent''' (sometimes equated with a '''local''' or '''[[vernacular]] accent''') is popularly perceived as very "strong" or "thick", highly recognizable to a particular population (typically within a particular region), and often [[conservative (linguistics)|linguistically conservative]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/broad "Broad." Def. 5. ''Oxford Dictionaries.'' © 2015 Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; almost always, it is the accent associated with the traditional speech of the local people or the [[working class]] (whether rural or urban) of a given region. 
*A '''general accent''' is perceived as geographically more widespread, not particularized to a certain population or location, sounding more "neutral" or "weak", and historico-linguistically innovative; it is typically associated with the [[middle class]] of a given region, a growing process of [[Standard language|standardization]] or [[wikt:supraregional|supraregionalization]] that transcends local boundaries, or more "[[mainstream]]" speakers in general. 

Sometimes a third category is also distinguished: a ''cultivated accent'' that is considered particularly cultured, stylish, affluent, or even contrived, associated with the educated [[upper class]] of a given region. All three distinctions are well studied [[Variation in Australian English|varieties]] within [[South African English|South African]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], and [[Australian English phonology]]. The capitalized term "broad" before a location is common in the United Kingdom, such as "[[Lancashire dialect|Broad Lancashire]]" or "[[Broad Yorkshire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/voices2005/pete_2.shtml |title=Tyke: It's all the Vikings' fault (sort of) |accessdate=16 April 2008 |last=Keane |first=Peter |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Bradford and West Yorkshire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged mainstream English accent of the United States has been called "[[General American]]" since the early-mid 20th century.

''Broad'' and ''general'' are not definitively established terms in [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]], and thus other terms are commonly used to make the same basic distinction. Irish linguist Raymond Hickey, for example, has classified the broad, traditional accent of [[Dublin]] as "local" and the city's general accents collectively as "non-local." He has also referred to a particular general and non-local accent common throughout Ireland as "supraregional."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Raymond.

'''Bunleua Sulilat''' (June 7, 1932 &amp;ndash; August 10, 1996, often referred to as Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, {{lang-th|หลวงปู่บุญเหลือ สุรีรัตน์}} {{IPA-th|luəŋ puː bunlɯːə suliːlat|}},{{fix|text=missing tone}} numerous variants of the spelling exist in Western languages: see below) was a [[Thailand|Thai]]/[[Isan]]/[[Laos|Lao]] [[mysticism|mystic]], [[myth]]-maker, [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] leader and [[sculpture]] artist. He is responsible for creating two religious-themed [[Sculpture garden|parks]] featuring giant fantastic sculptures made of [[concrete]] on the banks of the [[Mekong]] river near Thai-Lao border: [[Buddha Park]] (Lao: ວັດຊຽງຄວນ, Thai: วัดเซียงควน) on the Lao side (25&amp;nbsp;km southeast from [[Vientiane]]), and [[Sala Keoku]] (Thai: ศาลาแก้วกู่) on the Thai side (3&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Nong Khai]]).

==Biography==

Bunleua Sulilat was born in 1932 as the seventh of eight children to a family in [[Nong Khai]] province, [[Thailand]]. According to a legend, as a young man, he fell into a cave and thus met hermit Keoku, his spiritual mentor, after whom [[Sala Keoku]] (The Hall of Keoku) is named.

[[Image:Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat as a young man.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bunleua Sulilat as a young man.]]
Upon graduating from his apprenticeship with Keoku, Sulilat took on monumental sculpting, and proceeded with the construction (in 1958) of his first [[concrete]] sculpture garden, [[Buddha Park]] near [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]]. Concerned about the political climate in [[Laos]] after the [[History of Laos since 1945|1975 communist revolution]], Sulilat crossed [[Mekong]] fleeing to [[Thailand]]. In 1978, he commenced the construction of a new sculpture garden, [[Sala Keoku]], located across the river from the old one.

Sulilat's eccentric and captivating personality and the blend of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] he professed proved to hold great appeal to some of the locals, and [[Sala Keoku]] became something of a religious sect headquarters. The title Luang Pu (usually reserved for monks) came to be applied to Sulilat, who was technically a secular man. Both of the parks were constructed from donated [[concrete]] by hundreds of unskilled enthusiasts working without payment. Some other residents of the area considered Sulilat to be insane.

In his later years, Sulilat suffered a fall from one of his giant sculptures. Subsequently, his health deteriorated (the precise relation of his illness to the fall is unclear; he appears to have suffered from some blood disease), and he died in 1996. His mummified body has been enshrined at the 3rd floor of the [[Sala Keoku]] pavilion building.

==Style and vision==

Sulilat's sculpture gardens rely upon the rich [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|religious art tradition of the region]]. What sets them apart is the uncommonly large physical dimensions (made possible through the use of modern construction materials), highly individualized (and even quirky) artistic fantasy, and sporadic contemporary references (motorized vehicles, firearms, Western garments).

Having been erected by unskilled workforce, the gardens present fine specimens of [[Naïve art|''art naïf'']] and [[Outsider art|''art brut'']], and they certainly do possess the characteristic childish spontaneity and sense of wonder. (Sulilat claimed not to have had any artistic experience prior to the construction of [[Buddha Park]].) Yet, once again, the monumental scale of the projects and the long-term, communal, organized nature of construction are quite remarkable for the realm of [[outsider art]].

Reportedly, [[concrete]] has been chosen by Sulilat as the cheapest and most accessible material for his artwork. A large number of [[cement]] factories exist on the [[Laos|Lao]] side of Mekong. The statues have been designed by Sulilat himself, and subsequently built using (mostly) unpainted [[concrete]] [[Reinforced concrete|reinforced]] with metal. Larger installations rely upon [[brick]] support structures in the interior.

[[Image:SalaKeoku one step to Buddhahood.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Sala Keoku: one step to [[Buddhahood]]]]
Some parallels may be found between Sulilat's parks and the large-scale culture projects by [[Lek Viriyaphant]], in particular, the fantastic woodcarving compositions of the [[Sanctuary of Truth]]. However, the latter have been designed and implemented on another financial scale with a large input of professional labor. So, compared to Sulilat's heritage, a very different balance between skilled finesse and immediate individual artistic expression is maintained in those projects. ([[Wat Rong Khun]] is another example of a contemporary unconventional [[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand|Thai]] [[Buddhist art]] site.)

The didactic nature of Sulilat's vision found its most detailed expression in depictions of the [[Karma|karmic]] Wheel of Life present in the both of his gardens. The version in [[Sala Keoku]] is the more elaborate of the two. Mixing traditional and contemporary figures arranged in a circular pattern, it reveals the human progression from birth to death, which returns to its own origin. The composition culminates as a young man takes a step across the fence enclosing the entire installation to become a [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]] on the other side.

==Spellings==

Due to the lack of standard romanization scheme for [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]], there is a profusion of different spellings for Bunleua Sulilat's name, as well as the names of his parks, to the extent that makes all of them virtually impossible to account for.

Thus, Sulilat's first name has been spelled as Bunleua, Bounleua, Bun Leua, Boun Leua, Boon Leua, Bounlua, Bounlour, Boonlour, Bunluea, etc.

His last name has been spelled as Sulilat, Surirat, Soulilat, Sourirat, Sureerat, Su Ree Rat, etc.

The title Luang Pu has also been spelled as Luang Puu, Luang Pa, Louang Pou, Loungpou, etc.

[[Buddha Park]] is also known as Wat Xiengkhouane, Wat Xieng Khouan, Wat Xiengkhuan, Wat Xieng Khuan, Vat Xiengkhuane, etc.

[[Sala Keoku]] has also been referred to as Sala Keo Ku, Sala Keo Koo, Sala Keo Kou, Sala Kaew Ku, Sala Kaew Koo, Salakaewkoo, Sala Gaew Goo, Sala Kaeoku, Sala Kaeo Ku, etc. It is also known as Wat Khaek.

:''See also the Catharist [[Consolamentum]]
The '''''Consolatio''''' or '''consolatory oration''' is a type of [[Oration|ceremonial oratory]], typically used [[rhetoric]]ally to comfort mourners at funerals. It was one of the most popular [[classical rhetoric]] topics,&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;[[Ernst Robert Curtius]], ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', trans. W.R. Trask (Princeton: 1953) section 5.1 ''Topics of Consolatory Oratory'' pp.80-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrie70"&gt;[[Graham Petrie|Petrie, Graham]] (1970) "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3723527 A Rhetorical Topic in 'Tristram Shandy' "], ''[[Modern Language Review]]'', Vol. 65, No. 2, April 1970, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and received new impetus under [[Renaissance humanism]].

==Consolatio as a literary genre==
The ''Consolatio'' literary tradition ("consolation" in English) is a broad [[literary genre]] encompassing various forms of consolatory speeches, essays, poems, and personal letters. This literary tradition flourished in [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], and its origins date back to the fifth century BC. Orators in [[ancient history|antiquity]] often delivered consolatory speeches to comfort mourners at funerals or in cases of public mourning. Friends wrote personal letters consoling each other on the loss of a loved one. These were often highly personal and emotional. In addition to personal offerings of solace, ''Consolatio'' works also include philosophical [[treatises]] on grief. These works are usually more detached in tone, and many are written in essay format. Many ancient poets even wrote verse in this distinct ''Consolatio'' style.  These consolatory works are all called ''Consolatio'' because of their similar arguments, [[Literary topos|topoi]], and distinctive rhetorical appeals.&lt;ref name= Scourfield&gt;{{cite book|author=J. H. D. Scourfield|title=Consoling Heliodorus: A Commentary on Jerome, Letter 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouB8mQmvB8gC|year=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-814722-0|pages=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments of early ''Consolatio'' works survive, and it is not until [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes|Tusculan Disputations]]'', [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Seneca's Consolations|Ad Marciam]]'', and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' that a unified character appears. Scholars often view these works as the bedrock of the formal ''Consolatio'' tradition. (Fournier, introduction)

==Defining characteristics==
All ''Consolatio'' works draw from a relatively narrow range of arguments aimed at offering solace, to allay the distress caused by the death of a loved one, a matter of ill ''[[fortuna]]''. The conventional opening of a ''Consolatio'' was ''All must die''.&lt;ref name="Petrie70"/&gt; The most typical arguments characterizing the ''Consolatio'' genre were:&lt;ref name="Petrie70"/&gt; 
"All must die; even the oldest must die; the youngest too must die, and this is as one with the death of the old."&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrie70"/&gt;&lt;ref name= OCD&gt;Scourfield, JHD. "Consolation." Oxford Classical Dictionary. N.d. Print. Path: Consolatio; Kassel quote: "Death brings release from the miseries of life; time heals all griefs; future ills should be prepared for; the deceased was only ‘lent’--be grateful for having possessed him. Normally grief is regarded as natural and legitimate, though not to be indulged in."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-classical period, an additional Christian consolation was developed.&lt;ref name="Petrie70"/&gt; ''Consolatio'' works are united by their treatment of bereavement, by unique rhetorical structure and topoi, and by their use of universal themes to offer solace.&lt;ref name= OCD /&gt;

==Ancient history==
Some scholars claim the genre arose from the [[Sophist]] belief in the healing power of discourse.&lt;ref name= Scourfield/&gt; Others believe it arose as a response to passages of grief found in the works of the Greek poet [[Homer]].

Although several ancient writings contain elements of the ''Consolatio tradition'', it was the Academic [[Crantor|Crantor of Soli]] (c. 325- c. 275BC), a member of [[Academy|Plato’s Academy]], who first constructed his works in a distinct ''Consolatio'' Tradition. Although only fragments of his essays have survived, his influence is noted in the works of later writers, particularly Cicero’s ''Tusculan Disputations'' and Plutarch’s ''Consolation to Apollonius''. Crantor advocated [[metriopatheia]], a tactic for dealing with strong emotions.&lt;ref name= Baulthussen&gt;Baltussen, Han. "Personal grief and public mourning in Plutarch's consolation to his wife", '' American Journal of Philology'' '''130''' (2009): 67-67. July-Aug. 2009. :" Introduction: Beginnings of consolation."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consolatio (Cicero)|Cicero’s ''Consolatio'']] is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier ''Consolatio'' literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.&lt;ref name= Scourfield /&gt;

In the Early Imperial Age, most ''Consolatio'' works were constructed within the framework of [[Stoicism]]. [[Seneca the Younger]] produced the most recognizable examples of ''Consolatio'' in his three [[Consolations]], ''Ad Marciam'', ''Ad Polybium'', and ''Ad Helviam Matrem''. The most recognizable example of ''Consolatio'' in verse form was written by the pseudo-Ovidian, [[Albinovanus Pedo|Consolatio ad Liviam]].&lt;ref name= Scourfield /&gt; In Boethius’ ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', Philosophy herself consoles the author in his sore straits.&lt;ref name= OCD /&gt;

Other notable examples of the ''Consolatio'' tradition from [[ancient history|Antiquity]]: Pontus 4.11 in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto|Letters from the Black Sea]]'', [[Statius]]’ poem consoling Abascantus on his wife’s death, [[Apollonius of Tyana]], the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], and [[Libanius]]. Libanius was also the author of the funeral orations consoling mourners after the death of the Emperor Julian. The [[Plutarch|Plutarchian Corpus]] includes three works constructed in the ''Consolatio'' tradition: ''De exilio'', ''Consolatio ad uxorem'', ''Consolatio ad Apollonium''.&lt;ref name= Scourfield /&gt;

==Reception and influence==
The ''Consolatio'' genre, particularly its distinct tone and [[Literary topos|topoi]], widely influenced other literary genres. Elements of the ''Consolatio'' tradition can be found in a plethora of later works, and the tradition continued through the Middle Ages and into the early modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Kierdorf, Wilhelm (Köln); "Consolatio as a literary genre." Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider . Brill, 2009. Brill Online. University of California UC Berkeley CDL. 20 July 2009 &lt;http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=bnp_e619600&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Consolatio'' tradition==
In the [[Middle Ages]] Christian ideology taught that the distress, and death itself, were punishments for [[Fall of Man|Adam's fall]], while conceding that the tribulations of life could be vehicles of divine correction.

A return to the ancient view commenced with [[Petrarch]], though the [[Renaissance humanism|Quatrtrocento humanist]] [[Coluccio Salutati]] could only offer the solace of friendships and a sense of duty. The 'art of mourning' 's general revival was expressed in many consolatory letters that circulated in manuscript and were soon printed. Among them [[Gianozzo Manetti]]'s "bitter dialogue"  ''Antonini, dilectissimi filii sui, morte consolatorius'' (1438) took the new inimate view of [[grief|grieving]], and [[Francesco Filelfo]] offered an extensive compendium of Christian and Classical consolations in his consolatory oration for Antonio Marcello on the death of his son (1461). Marilyn Aronberg Lavin reads [[Piero della Francesca]]'s gnomic ''[[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' (''c'' 1455-60) as a ''consolatio'' of two friends (portrayed) who had each recently lost a son. 
	
[[Laurence Sterne]] parodied ''Consolatio'' and solemn authors in his comic novel ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''.&lt;ref name="Petrie70"/&gt;

The '''Corporation for National and Community Service''' ('''CNCS''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] agency that engages more than five million Americans in service through [[AmeriCorps]], Learn and Serve America, [[Senior Corps]], and other national service initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalservice.gov |website=Nationalservice.gov|title=National Service|accessdate=Nov 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's mission is to "support the American culture of citizenship, service, and responsibility".  While a government agency, CNCS acts much like a foundation and is the nation’s largest annual grant maker supporting service and volunteering. CNCS, formerly known as the "Corporation for National Service" or "CNS," was created as an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] by the [[National and Community Service Trust Act]] of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c103:6:./temp/~c103itpc1E:e312587: Bill Text, 103rd Congress (1993-1994), H.R.2010.EAS] [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Currently, CNCS delivers several programs that are designed to help communities address poverty, the environment, education, and other unmet human needs. The programs include:

===AmeriCorps===
{{Main|AmeriCorps}}
AmeriCorps is a national service program designed to engage Americans in a variety of service. Programs under the AmeriCorps umbrella include AmeriCorps National and AmeriCorps State programs, [[National Civilian Community Corps]], and VISTA ([[Volunteers in Service to America]]).

On April 21, 2009, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act was signed into law which reauthorized and dramatically expanded the AmeriCorps volunteer service program. The new law would more than triple the number of available AmeriCorps volunteer slots from then current 75,000 to 250,000 by fiscal year 2017 with 50% of these positions becoming full-time. The measure would also tie college tuition aid to demonstrated favorable community impacts; create a pilot Social Innovation Fund; expand eligibility for the Senior Companion and Foster Grandparent program; and expand participation by military veterans. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Other programs ===
*[[National Civilian Community Corps]]
*[[Volunteers in Service to America]]
*[[Senior Corps]]
*[[USA Freedom Corps]]
*[[President's Volunteer Service Award]]
*[[Presidential Freedom Scholarship Program]]
*[[FEMA Corps]]

==Special Initiatives==

===Employers of National Service===
On September 12, 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] launched the ''Employers of National Service'' initiative at the 20th Anniversary of [[AmeriCorps]] event on the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn of the White House]].&lt;ref&gt;Archive of Obama White House Blog https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/03/09/employers-national-service-and-americorps-vista-champions-change Accessed 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Employers participating in the initiative connect to the talent pipeline of [[AmeriCorps]], [[Peace Corps]], and other service year alumni, by indicating in their hiring processes that they view national service experience as a plus. The initiative is a collaboration between CNCS with the [[Peace Corps]], [[Service Year Alliance]], [[AmeriCorps Alums]], and the [[National Peace Corps Association]]. To date, over 500 employers have joined the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Employers of National Service Website. https://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/employers-national-service Accessed 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Commission on National and Community Service''' was a new, independent federal agency created as a consequence of the [[National and Community Service Act of 1990]], signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]].

The Commission was intentioned to mean to bring about a renewed focus on encouraging [[volunteering]] in the United States and was charged with supporting four streams of service:

# Service-learning programs for school-aged youth
# Higher education service programs
# Youth corps
# National service demonstration models

In 1993 the Corporation for National and Community Service was created by merging another agency, [[ACTION (U.S. government agency)|ACTION]], and the Commission on National and Community Service together, thus ending the Commission.

===Former programs===
====Learn and Serve America====
{{Main|Learn and Serve America}}
Formerly known as [[Serve America]], Learn and Serve America engaged students in community-based organizations and schools in [[service learning]] programs. In 2011 the United States House Appropriations Committee declined additional funding for Learn and Serve, and the program was discontinued.

===Timeline===
1990: President [[George H.W. Bush]] signs the [[National and Community Service Act]] of 1990 into law, ushering in a renewed federal focus on encouraging [[volunteering]] in the U.S. This legislation created the new independent federal agency called the [[Commission on National and Community Service]].

1992: Enacted as part of the 1993 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) is created as a demonstration program to explore the possibility of using post-Cold War military resources to help solve problems here at home. It is modeled on the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and the United States military.

1993: President [[Bill Clinton]] signs into passage The National and Community Service Trust Act, formally merging the federal offices of [[ACTION (U.S. government agency)|ACTION]] and the Commission on National and Community Service, including Serve America and NCCC, to form CNCS, along with the addition of the new AmeriCorps program.

2002: President [[George W. Bush]] creates the [[USA Freedom Corps]].

'''Crybaby Bridge''' is a nickname given to some bridges in the United States. The name often reflects an [[urban legend]] that the sound of a baby can be, or has been, heard from the bridge. Many are also accompanied by an urban legend relating to a baby or young child/children.

==Virginia==
There is an alleged "Crybaby" bridge in [[Blackstone, Virginia]]. The story goes that some children died around the bridge (accounts vary as to whether their death was accidental or intentional), and that at night their cries can be heard and a woman can be seen walking along the edge of the woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticalblaze.com/GhostsGeorgia.htm| title= "Crybaby" Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other phenomena reported include footsteps and the feeling of an 'evil presence.' It is also alleged that if a car is stopped on the bridge and baby powder is poured on the hood, baby footprints may appear in the powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Mark Moran and Mark Scuerman| title= Weird Georgia| publisher= Sterling Publishing Co., Inc.| year= 2006| isbn= 978-1-4027-3388-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio==

===Rogue's Hollow===
One of many purported crybaby bridges is located near [[Doylestown, Ohio]], in an area known as Rogue's Hollow. This bridge is located on Galehouse Road, between Rogue Hollow Road and Hametown Road. The bridge spans Silver Creek. Deep in Rogue's Hollow, this road previously led from the bottom of the hollow (Hametown Rd.) to the top (Rogue Hollow Rd.). The bridge is only approachable from Hametown Rd. from October to May, as the steeper portion of the road is seasonally closed to prevent accidents. The bridge is property of the Rogue's Hollow [[historical society]], which also owns the adjacent Chidester Mill.&lt;ref name="deadohio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadohio.com/CrybabyBridges.htm|title=Crybaby Bridges|website=www.deadohio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.rogueshollow.org/ Rogue's Hollow Historical Society]
''"Map to the Mill" link refers to the bridge; road and creek are visible in "Chidester Hill" photo.''

Map: {{Coord|40.94111|N|81.67528|W|display=inline}}

===The Screaming Bridge of Maud Hughes Road===
Maud Hughes Road is located in [[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. It is reputed to have been the site of many terrible accidents and suicides. Railroad tracks lie 25 feet below the bridge, and at least 36 people are said to have been reported dead on or around the Maud Hughes Road Bridge. Ghostly figures, mists, and lights have been reported, as well as black hooded figures and a phantom train. The legend says that a car carrying a man and a woman stalled on top of the bridge. The man got out to get help while the girl stayed. When the man returned, the girl was hanging on the bridge above the tracks. The man then supposedly perished with unexplained causes. To this day, many people have reported hearing the ghosts' conversations, then a woman's scream followed by a man's scream. A second story is that a woman was being chased down the road and when she got to the bridge she did not know the area and thought that there was a river underneath, so she jumped over the bridge and when she saw the train tracks screamed all the way down to her death. They say that to this day on certain nights you can still hear her screaming. Another popular and typical Crybaby Bridge story says that a woman once threw her baby off the bridge and hanged herself afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenoh.com/Counties/Butler/maudhughes.html|title=The Screaming Bridge of Maud Hughes Road&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt Road, Salem===
[[File:Cry Baby Bridge, Egypt Rd..jpg|thumb|Crybaby Bridge off Egypt Road]]
Although the bridge is off of Egypt Road near [[Salem, Ohio]], it is actually on what used to be West Pine Lake Rd., which now dead-ends to the east of the bridge. Legends attribute the crying baby to one that fell in and accidentally drowned. There is also a rumor that there is a cult of some sort in the woods surrounding the bridge. In 2010, there was a murder of an elderly woman that was found, strangled to death and burned just off the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemnews.net/page/content.detail/id/545970/Coroner--Woman-strangled--body-burned-off-Egypt-Road.html?nav=5007|title=News, Sports, Jobs - Salem News|website=www.salemnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closed road remains as an access way to high-voltage utility lines.&lt;ref name="deadohio" /&gt; The "baby cries" have been said to be heard at night or during the day.{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}

Map: {{Coord|40.929744|N|80.829978|W|display=inline}}

===Wisner Road===
This crybaby bridge is in the area of the [[melon heads]]. The bridge is on Wisner Road in [[Chardon Township, Geauga County, Ohio]], just north of Kirtland Chardon Rd. A large section of the road is permanently closed; the bridge lies just before the south end of the closed section.&lt;ref name="deadohio" /&gt;

The bridge as well as the melon head homestead is torn down now, as of 2013 in an attempt to keep the melon heads from leaving the area. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}}. The ancient sandstone bridge abutments still remain and local residents report the howling has only become louder in recent years.

== Oklahoma ==
In [[Alderson, Oklahoma|Alderson]], near [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]], the bridge is located at the end of Alderson Road and has been known to legends of a woman who was raped by her father several times and would throw her unwanted infants off the bridge. Local residents have reported sounds of babies crying underneath the bridge late at night and the appearance of a glowing woman floating over the rocky bed of North Boggy Creek.

In [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]], approximately 2 miles east of Sooner Rd. on 134th St. there is a collapsed and abandoned bridge. Legend of a woman and infant in their vehicle falling through the wood of the bridge during late-night hours, a few days later the vehicle and remains were discovered by law enforcement patrolling the area. The bridge was never repaired and the road was deemed unsafe and was closed off to vehicles. The cry of the baby is said to be heard at night.

Between [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]] and [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], on S. Douglas Blvd just south of 149th Street is a wooden bridge. It is at least as old as the school house sitting next to it. Strange moving objects have been reported there late at night.

In [[Kellyville, Oklahoma|Kellyville]], approximately 1.63 miles east of the Slick/Kellyville Road on West 181st Street on the north side, there is the original bridge abutments off of the new road. There is a local legend about a woman and her infant child driving down the road trying to escape her husband, only for the woman's car to run off the bridge. Legend has it that the baby was never found, and that if the bridge is visited at midnight the baby's cry can be heard and sometimes accompanied by a strange blue light.
 
In Oklahoma City at Lake Overholser, the metal bridge by Route 66 is known for sightings of a woman in all white with a baby on the bridge or on the side. At night her shadow allegedly appears if cars turn their lights off, and, additionally, walkers on the bridge have also allegedly reported feeling her presence and hearing a baby cry.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Maryland ==
There is a purported "Crybaby Bridge" off Beaver Dam Road in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]], near the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center]]. It is in or near the areas where the legendary [[Goatman (Maryland)|goatman]] has reported to have been seen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

There is another on Governor's Bridge Road, in [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]]. This bridge is a late-19th- to early-20th-century steel truss bridge; legend states that a woman and her baby were murdered in the 1930s. It is also said that in the early 20th century, a young woman was impregnated, but not married. In order to avoid judgment by family and peers, she drowned her baby in the river. Purportedly, if one parks one's car at or near this bridge, a baby can be heard crying; sometimes a ghost car will creep up from behind, but disappear when the driver or passenger turns around to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theshadowlands.net/places/maryland.htm|title=Shadowlands Haunted Places Index - Maryland|first=shadow|last=Lord|website=www.theshadowlands.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2010}}

In ''Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets'', authors Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman include three first-person narratives of crybaby bridge experiences in Maryland. The locations mentioned are the Governor's Bridge Road bridge discussed above, one on Lottsford Vista Road and a third unspecified, but possibly described the Lottsford Vista Road bridge as well. The latter narratives make mention of purported Satanic churches near the bridge and appearance of the Goatman.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman: Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets Page 178 Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.,  {{ISBN|1-4027-3906-0}} Accessed via Google Books August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Crybaby Bridge is located in Westminster, MD on Adams Mill Rd. The local legends attributed to this particular bridge range from a young woman who became pregnant and was afraid to tell her family to the location being used by the KKK to drown black babies in the 1800s.

There is also a Crybaby Bridge in [[Millington, Maryland]] on Walnut Tree Road. Many travelers mistakenly refer to this bridge as the "Smyrna Crybaby Bridge", due to its proximity to [[Smyrna, Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|39.288538|-75.791095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is located in Gaithersburg off Game Preserve Rd under a one lane bridge.

== South Carolina ==
There is a "Crybaby Bridge" on High Shoals Rd, just south of [[Anderson, South Carolina]]. The bridge in South Carolina was built in Virginia in 1919, brought to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to connect two counties together. In 1952 it was brought to Anderson, South Carolina. replaced the older bridge that had been there. It is about 194 feet long and about 17 feet wide. Shortly later locals called it Cry Baby Bridge. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

An old Grist mill sat below the bridge along the Rocky River in 1840, and ran until about 1900s. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1894 an electrical plant was built there by [[W. C. Whitner]]. It gave the [[Anderson County, South Carolina|Anderson County]] the nickname The Electric City. One of the generators from the electric mill is still on display in Anderson County. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
 
The bridge has many changes through the times, from no bridge, to wooden bridge, to the well known Iron Railed Bridge called Cry Baby Bridge to now modern cement bridge that now runs beside Cry Baby Bridge, it still remains a part of Anderson County's history and a famous landmark. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

A popular destination for paranormal enthusiasts just south of [[Pageland, South Carolina]] is one of the oldest "cry baby" bridges. Locally known as "Cry Baby Creek", the bridge spanning Flat Creek has been closed off to auto traffic since the late 50's, but is accessible by foot via a short walk through what is now a [[nature reserve]]. The story of Cry Baby Creek tells of a young mother who loses her baby in the slow moving waters after a late night accident on the bridge. Unlike the most other crybaby legends, the sounds coming from the creek are not limited to hearing a baby cry while standing on the bridge; many legends refer to witnesses actually seeing the mother search for her baby up and down the creek. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Texas ==

===De Kalb===
"Crybaby Bridge", or "Spook Bridge", located over Houston, Texas, runs across county road 4130, located 4 miles south of [[De Kalb, Texas]]. The old legend says that a woman and her triplets were rushing home late one night to prepare dinner for her husband that was soon to be home. As they approached the bridge the woman lost control of the car, causing it to ramp off the side of the old wooden bridge, killing the mother and her triplets. There are many stories of encounters with the spirits of the victims. Locals claim that late at night if you shut your vehicle engine off, kill your lights, and honk 3 times you will be able to hear the cries of the long dead triplets. There have been a few claims to have captured photographs of the disturbed spirit of the mother or as some call her the clay lady (due to the amount of clay under the bridge at one point of time), while others claim to have captured orb like lights that were not there before the photographs were taken. There are also claims of a strange white light that lingers around the area of the bridge, which unexpectedly comes out of nowhere and is gone in a blink of an eye. The witnesses of these events range from young teenagers to elderly men and women. If you ask a long time resident of De Kalb, Texas about cry baby bridge you are almost guaranteed a scary story. Some of these stories are not quite popular and are hard to find on the internet, mainly because they are not openly shared due to peoples' belief that they will be mocked for sharing their experiences at the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/BobBowan/Roamin-Around-East-Texas.htm#landmark|last=Bowman|first=Bob|publisher=[[Best of East Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lufkin===
Jack Creek, a stream west of [[Lufkin, Texas]], has for years been known as Cry Baby Creek, supposedly because a woman and a baby died when their auto veered off a wooden bridge and fell into the steep creek. Annette Sawyer of Lufkin said visitors who come to the site at night claim they have heard sounds resembling a baby crying. One visitor supposedly found the imprint of a baby’s hand on her auto window after returning from the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/TOWNS/Lufkin/Lufkin_Texas.htm#landmark|last=Bowman|first=Bob|publisher=[[Best of East Texas]]|title=Lufkin Landmarks and Attractions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port Neches===
"Sarah Jane Bridge" on East Port Neches Avenue in [[Port Neches, Texas]] is said to be the bridge from which a baby of the same name was thrown into the alligator-infested water by a man who had murdered the child's mother. It is said Sarah Jane can be heard crying from the water when one stands on the bridge on hot summer nights. The child's mother, a headless ghost wandering the woods nearby, can also be heard whispering "Sarah Jane" as she searches the forest with a lantern. The legendary Sarah Jane is Sarah Jane Block, who lost no children and lived to the age of 99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/spooky.htm|title=Spooky legend lives on|last=Cunningham|first=Carl|publisher=[[The Beaumont Enterprise|The Mid County Chronicle]]|date=1998-10-28|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panews.com/local/local_story_303205853.html|title=

==Utah==
Locals from the small town of [[Bear River City, Utah]] claim that many years ago a mother drove off the bridge with her two children in the car, killing all three of them. It is said that honking the horn three times will elicit a response from the ghostly children. Some claim to have heard a child's voice saying "Don't do it, Mother!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hauntin.gs/Cry-Baby-Bridge_Bear-River-City_Utah_United-States_8891|title=Search for "Cry+Baby+Bridge" - Hauntin.gs|website=Hauntin.gs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 1999, Maryland folklorist [[Jesse Glass]] presented a case against several crybaby bridges being genuine [[folklore]], contending that they were instead [[fakelore]] that was knowingly being propagated through the internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp37916 The University of Pennsylvania Online Books Page for ''The Witness; Slavery in Nineteenth Century Carroll County, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Glass, nearly identical stories of crybaby bridges in [[Maryland]] and [[Ohio]] began to appear online in 1999, but they could not be confirmed through local oral history or the media.

Among Glass' examples was the story of a bridge located in [[Westminister, Maryland|Westminster, Maryland]], which concerned the murder of escaped slaves and African American children. It's located specifically on Rockland Road, just off of Uniontown Road outside of Westminster's city limits past Rt. 31. In the 1800s the story held, unwanted black babies were drowned by being thrown off this bridge. Regional newspapers, such as the ''American Sentinel'' and the ''Democratic Advocate'', which usually covered racially motivated murders of the period, make no mention of the events described online.

However, in their book ''Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets'', authors Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman relate the story of a purported crybaby bridge on Lottsford Vista Road between Bowie and Upper Marlboro, asserting that this bridge has "made believers out of many skeptics."&lt;ref&gt;Moran; Sceurman, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The text included from their informant makes no mention of escaped slaves but does repeat a familiar component of such legends: an out-of-wedlock birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12918">'''Data curation''' is the organization and integration of [[data]] collected from various sources. It involves annotation, publication and presentation of the data such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Data curation includes "all the processes needed for principled and [[Data governance|controlled data]] creation, maintenance, and [[Data management|management]], together with the capacity to add value to data".&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée J. Miller]], [http://comad.in/comad2014/Proceedings/Keynote2.pdf “Big Data Curation”] in 20th International Conference on Management of Data (COMAD) 2014, Hyderabad, India, December 17–19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In science, data curation may indicate the process of extraction of important information from scientific texts, such as research articles by experts, to be converted into an electronic format, such as an entry of a biological database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative_glossary.html Bio creative Glossary].

== History and practice ==
The [[user (system)|user]], rather than the database itself, typically initiates data curation and maintains [[metadata]].&lt;ref name="deanop"/&gt; According to the [[University of Illinois]]' Graduate School of Library and Information Science, "Data curation is the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time."&lt;ref name=cragin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cragin|first=Melissa|author2=Heidorn, P.

Census data has been available in tabulated punch card form since the early 20th century and has been electronic since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/09/pub63watersgarrett.pdf|title=Preserving Digital Information (PDI) report|last=|first=|date=1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research|Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)]] web site marks 1962 as the date of their first Survey Data Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/about/history/|title=ICPSR: History|website=www.icpsr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heim, "Social Scientific Information Needs for Numeric Data: The Evolution of the International Data Archive Infrastructure." in ''Collection Management'' 9 (Spring 1987): 1-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact curation process undertaken within any organisation depends on the volume of data, how much noise the data contains and what the expected future use of the data means to its dissemination.&lt;ref name="haofda"/&gt;

The crises in space data led to the 1999 creation of the [[Open Archival Information System|Open Archival Information System (OAIS)]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html|title=The OAIS reference model|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15|date=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stewarded by the [[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems|Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)]], which was formed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx|title=CCSDS.org - The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)|website=public.ccsds.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term data curation is sometimes used in the context of [[biological databases]], where specific biological information is firstly obtained from a range of research articles and then stored within a specific category of database. For instance, information about anti-depressant drugs can be obtained from various sources and, after checking whether they are available as a database or not, they are saved under a drug's database's anti-depressive category. Enterprises are also utilizing data curation within their operational and strategic processes to ensure data quality and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, A. Freitas, and S.

The '''Epigravettian''' (Greek: ''epi'' "above, on top of", and [[Gravettian]]) was one of the last [[Archaeological industry|archaeological industries]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]]. It arose after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] around ~21,000 [[Calibration of radiocarbon dates|cal.]] [[Before Present|BP]]. It is related to the [[Gravettian]], of which it is considered a continuation by some scholars (e.g. G. Laplace). In this sense, the Epigravettian is simply the Gravettian after ~21,000 BP,{{Is this date calibrated?}} when the [[Solutrean]] had replaced the Gravettian in most of France and Spain. 

Its known range extends from southeast France to the western shores of the [[Volga River]], Russia, with a large number of sites in Italy. It was replaced by Mesolithic cultures around 10,000 BP.

==Policy==

Ethnopluralism has been proposed by some in the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] as a means to facilitate nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf|title=The Sociology of the Radical Right|last=Rydgren|first=Jens|date=2007|website=|work=Annual Review of Sociology|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing this policy would require [[ethnic cleansing]] to establish separate territories for different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

Ethnopluralism emphasizes the separation of varying ethnic and cultural groups, in contrast to cultural [[Social integration|integration]] and intra-cultural diversity. It has been part of the ideological foundation of the [[European New Right]], which has used ethnopluralism to express its favoritism towards the cultural identity of individual groups, thus expressing its opposition to heterogeneity within states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Tom|date=2006-08-01|title=The Nouvelle Droite in the 1980s and 1990s: Ideology and Entryism, the Relationship with the Front National|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|journal=French Politics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=158–178|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|issn=1476-3419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views of culture, ethnicity and race have become popular among several right-wing and [[far right|far-right]] groups in [[Europe]] since the 1970s, and has been covered in some [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[left-wing politics|left]] sources (i.e. ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'') also.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003" /&gt;

Ethnopluralists use the concept of cultural differentialism to assert a "right to difference" to propose [[regionalism (politics)|regional policies]] of ethnic and racial [[separatism]]. Among ethnopluralists there is no agreed upon definition of group membership, nor where these hypothetical borders would lie. Some ethnopluralists advocate limiting Europe to "true Europeans", while others propose much smaller divisions, similar to an ethnically-based [[communitarianism]]. While some ethnopluralists would allow European Muslims to remain in Europe, Jews and [[Romani people|Romani]] are typically rejected by ethnopluralists.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt; French [[Nouvelle Droite]] philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]] claims that indigenous cultures in Europe are being threatened, and that [[pan-European nationalism]] based on ethnopluralism would stop this process.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003"/&gt; Benoist has proposed ethnic and social territories be as small as possible, such that Muslims would be allowed ghettos in Europe subordinate to [[sharia]].&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

According to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]], the term "ethnopluralism" was first coined by German sociologist [[Henning Eichberg]] in an essay that was written in opposition to both Western and European [[eurocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin (2013).

{{Bronze Age}}
The '''Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture''', 3200 BC–2300 BC, is an eastern extension of the [[Corded Ware culture]] into Russia.

It runs from [[Lake Pskov]] in the west to the middle [[Volga]] in the east, with its northern reach in the valley of the upper Volga. It is really two cultures, the '''Fatyanovo''' in the west, the '''Balanovo''' in the east. The Fatyanovo culture emerged at the northeastern edge of the [[Middle Dnieper culture]], and probably was derived from an early variant of the Middle Dnieper culture.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, "[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World]]", Princeton University Press, 2007, p 380&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fatyanovo migrations correspond to regions with [[hydronym]]s of a [[Baltic language]] dialect mapped by linguists as far as the [[Oka river]] and the upper Volga. Spreading eastward down the Volga they discovered the [[copper]] ores of the western [[Ural Mountains|Ural foothills]], and started long term settlements in lower [[Kama river]] region. The Balanovo culture occupied the region of the Kama–[[Vyatka River|Vyatka]]–[[Vetluga River|Vetluga]] [[interfluve]]s&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; where metal resources (local copper sandstone deposits&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 102&lt;/ref&gt;) of the region were exploited.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatyanovo [[ceramics]] show mixed Corded Ware / Globular Amphorae traits. The later [[Abashevo culture]] [[pottery]] looked somewhat like Fatyanovo-Balanovo Corded Ware, but Abashevo [[kurgan]]s were unlike Fatyanovo flat cemeteries, although [[flat graves]]&lt;ref&gt;Elena E. Kuz'mina, The Origin of the Indo-Iranians, Volume 3, edited by J. P. Mallory, Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands 2007, p 221&lt;/ref&gt; were a recognizable component of the Abashevo burial rite. Balanovo burials (like the [[Middle Dnieper culture]]&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, "The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World", Princeton University Press, 2007, p 380&lt;/ref&gt;) were both of the flat and [[kurgan]] type, containing individual and also [[mass grave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlements are scant, and bear evidence of a degree of [[fortification]]. The villages were usually situated on the high hills of the riverbanks, consisting of several above-ground houses built from wooden logs with [[saddle roof]]s, and also joined by passages.&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; The economy seems to be quite mobile, but then we are cautioned that domestic [[swine]] are found, which suggests something other than a mobile society. The Fatyanovo culture is viewed as introducing an economy based on domestic livestock ([[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[horse]] &amp; [[dog]]) into the forest zone of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 196&lt;/ref&gt; The Balanovo also used [[Working animal|draught]] cattle and two wheeled [[wagon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

As is usual with such ancient cultures, our main knowledge comes from their [[inhumations]]. [[Shaft grave]]s were evident, which might be lined with wood. The deceased were wrapped in animal skins or [[birch bark]] and placed into wooden burial chambers in subterranean rectangular pits.&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; The interments are otherwise in accord with Corded Ware practices, with males resting on their right side and females on their left.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 196&lt;/ref&gt; Local metal objects of a [[Central Europe]]an provenance type were present. Copper ornaments and tools have been found in Balanovo burials ([[Chalcolithic]]). Burial goods depended on sex, age, and social position. Copper axes primarily accompanied persons of high social position, stone [[axe-hammer]]s were given to men, [[flint axe]]s to children and women. [[Amulet]]s are frequently found in the graves&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; as well as metal working implements.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory for an intrusive culture is based upon the physical type of the population ([[physical anthropology]]), flexed burial under [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, the presence of [[battle-axes]] and ceramics. There are similarities between Fatyanovo and [[Catacomb culture]] stone battle-axes.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 197&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Volosovo culture]] of indigenous forest foragers was different in its ceramics, economy, and mortuary practices. It dispersed when the Fatyanovo people pushed into the Upper and Middle Volga basin.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, "The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World", Princeton University Press, 2007, p 380&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic finds indicate Balanovo coexisted with the Volosovo people (mixed Balanovo-Volosovo sites), and also displaced them.&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the ethnic and linguistic attribution of the Volosovo culture is uncertain; Häkkinen maintains that their language was neither [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] nor [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], but a [[substratum]] to [[Finno-Permic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Häkkinen|first=Jaakko|title=Early contacts between Uralic and Yukaghir|journal=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia − Mémoires de la Société Finno-Ougrienne|year=2012|issue=264|page=96|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust264/sust264_hakkinenj.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013|publisher=Finno-Ugric Society|location=Helsinki|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultures of the [[Prikamsky subarea]] in the Late Bronze Age continued preceding traditions in pottery, house designs, and stable animal husbandry with the breeding of horse, cattle, and to a lesser extent, pigs and sheep. Scholars interpret some of these cultures with stages in the development of the [[Permic languages|proto-Permian language]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Koryakova, A. Epimakhov, The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages, Cambridge University Press, NY, NY, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-521-82928-1}}, p 102&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this culture represents the acculturation of [[Pit-Comb Ware culture]] people of this area from contacts with Corded Ware agriculturists in the West.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory, "Fatyanovo-Balanovo Culture", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p 196&lt;/ref&gt; It does not seem to represent a northern extension of the Indo-European [[Yamna culture]] horizon further south.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Historical sources mention a people inhabiting the region of the earlier Fatyanovo region. The [[Hypatian Codex|Hypatian Codex of Chronicles]] mentions that in 1147 the Prince of [[Rostov-Suzdal]] defeated the [[Golyad|Golyad']] (Голядь) who lived by the River Porotva. The [[Protva River|Protva]] is a tributary of the [[Oka river]] near [[Moscow]], where there is a wealth of Baltic hydronyms.

'''Freedom of choice''' describes an individual's [[wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] and [[autonomy]] to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Carter | first = Ian | title = Choice, freedom, and freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | quote = an explication of freedom of choice should reject the third axiom [...] A person has freedom of choice [[If and only if|iff]] she lacks constraints on the reasoned selection and performance of one or more of the items on an action-menu." and "(...) where a selection is necessarily made from a set of items greater than one | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Sebastiano Bavetta |author2=Pietro Navarra |date=2011|title=Index of Economic Freedom|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/download|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|page=65|chapter=5|accessdate=February 12, 2013|quote=As noted, there are two aspects of free choice: opportunity to choose and autonomy to choose.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[abortion debate]], for example, the term "freedom of choice" may be used in defense of the position that a woman has a right to determine whether she will proceed with or terminate a [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/mother/for_1.shtml|title=BBC - Arguments in favour of abortion.|quote=This leads some people to claim is that it is unethical to ban abortion because doing so denies freedom of choice to women and forces 'the unwilling to bear the unwanted'"|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.1964:|title=Freedom of Choice Act – H.R.1964|quote=Freedom of Choice Act – Declares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to: (1) bear a child; (2) terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability; or (3) terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability when necessary to protect her life or her health.|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-smalley/eggs-and-abortion-freedom_b_80202.html|publisher=Huffington Post  |title=Eggs And Abortion: Freedom Of Choice|author=Susan Smalley|accessdate=February 13, 2013|date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other topics such as  [[euthanasia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Euthanasiaandassistedsuicide/Pages/Arguments.aspx|title=Euthanasia and assisted suicide – Arguments|publisher=NHS|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth Control|contraception]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some social issues, for example the [[New York City soft drink size limit|New York "Soda Ban"]] have been both defended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hunter/new-york-soda-ban_b_1904920.html|publisher=Huffington Post  |title=Soda "Ban" May Actually Increase Freedom of Choice|author1=Lauren Hunter |author2=Kristin Van Busum |accessdate=February 12, 2013|date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/archives/2012/07/21/fizzy-math|title=The Fizzy Math Behind Bloomberg's Soda Ban|publisher=reason.com|author=Baylen Linnekin|quote=First, the ban would restrict food freedom of choice.|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reference to "freedom of choice."

== In economics ==
[[File:Soft drink shelf 2.jpg|thumb|237px|The freedom to choose which brand and flavor of soda to buy is related to [[Competition (economics)|market competition]]]]
In [[microeconomics]], freedom of choice is the freedom of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] to allocate their [[resources]] as they see fit, among the options (such as goods, services, or assets) that are available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Robert E. |authorlink1=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Lieberman |first2=Marc |title=Microeconomics: Principles &amp; Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR9uvGmChp8C |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |isbn=9781439038970 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pagoso|first1=Cristobal M. |last2=Dinio |first2=Rosemary P. |last3=Villasis |first3=George A.|title=Introductory Microeconomics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8Der6qyzaUC |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |year=1994 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc. |location= |isbn=9789712315404 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the freedom to engage in employment available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quizlet.com/3805244/microeconomics-chapter-04-the-market-system-flash-cards/ |title=Quizlet Microeconomics, Chapter 04 – The Market System |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratner et al., in 2008, cited the literature on [[libertarian paternalism]] which states that consumers do not always act in their own best interests. They attribute this phenomenon to factors such as emotion, cognitive limitations and biases, and incomplete information which they state may be remedied by various proposed interventions.  They discuss providing consumers with information and decision tools, organizing and restricting their market options, and tapping emotions and managing expectations. Each of these, they state, could improve consumers' ability to choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = R. K. | last2 = Soman | first2 = D. | last3 = Zauberman | first3 = G. | last4 = Ariely | first4 = D. | last5 = Carmon | first5 = Z. | last6 = Keller | first6 = P. A. | last7 = Kim | first7 = B.

However, [[economic freedom]] to choose ultimately depends upon [[market competition]], since buyers' available options are usually the result of various factors controlled by sellers, such as overall [[Quality (business)|quality]] of a product or a service and [[Advertising|advertisement]]. In the event that a [[monopoly]] exists, the consumer no longer has the freedom to choose to buy from a different producer. As [[Friedrich Hayek]] pointed out:
{{quote|text=Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his absolute mercy.|sign=[[Friedrich Hayek]]|source=''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', "Can planning free us from care?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QyQwvLDLycC|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As shown in the above quote, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] thinkers are often strong advocates for increasing freedom of choice. One example of this is [[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[Free to Choose]]'' book and TV series.

There is no consensus as to whether an increase in economic freedom of choice leads to an increase in happiness. In one study, [[the Heritage Foundation]]'s 2011 [[Index of Economic Freedom]] report showed a strong correlation between its [[Index of Economic Freedom]] and happiness in a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Sebastiano Bavetta |author2=Pietro Navarra |date=2011|title=Index of Economic Freedom|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/download|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|pages=61–68|chapter=5|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring freedom of choice ==
The [[Axiomatic system|axiomatic]]-[[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] approach has been used to address the issue of measuring the amount of freedom of choice (FoC) an individual enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dowding|first1=Keith|authorlink1=Keith Dowding|last2=van Hees|first2=Martin|authorlink2=Martin van Hees|title=Oxford Handbook of Individual and Social Choice|url=http://www.rug.nl/staff/martin.van.hees/2009handb.pdf|accessdate=February 15, 2013|year=2009|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|chapter=Chapter 15 – Freedom of Choice|pages=374–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On ranking opportunity sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Recherches Économiques de Louvain / Louvain Economic Review | volume = 56 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 383–90 | publisher = Department of Economics, Universite Catholique de Louvain via JSTOR | jstor = 40723933 | date = 1990 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Xu | first = Yongsheng | title = On ranking linear budget sets in terms of freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 281–89 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0287-x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prasanta Pattanaik|Prasanta K. Pattanaik]] and Yongsheng Xu presented three conditions that a measurement of FoC should satisfy:
#''Indifference between no-choice situations''. Having only one option amounts to the same FoC, no matter what the option is.
#''Strict monotonicity''. Having two distinct options x and y amounts to more FoC than having only the option x.
#''Independence''. If a situation A has more FoC than B, by adding a new option x to both (not contained in A or B), A will still have more FoC than B.
They proved that the [[cardinality]] is the only measurement that satisfies these axioms, what they observed to be counter-intuitive and suggestive that one or more axioms should be reformulated. They illustrated this with the example of the option set "to travel by train" or "to travel by car", that should yield more FoC than the option set "to travel by red car" or "to travel by blue car". Some suggestions have been made to solve this problem, by reformulating the axioms, usually including concepts of [[preference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sen | first1 = Amartya | author-link1 = Amartya Sen | title = Welfare, preference and freedom | journal = Journal of Econometrics | volume = 50 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 15–29 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | date = October 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076(91)90087-T | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pattanaik | first1 = Prasanta K. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Yongsheng | author-link1 = Prasanta Pattanaik | title = On preference and freedom | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–98 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1023/A:1004924211553 | date = April 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004924211553 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sugden | first = Robert | title = The metric of opportunity | journal = Economics and Philosophy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–37 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0266267100003874 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266267100003874 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rejecting the third axiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Carter | first = Ian | title = Choice, freedom, and freedom of choice | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | date = February 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-003-0277-z | quote = an explication of freedom of choice should reject the third axiom | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with happiness ==
A 2006 study by Simona Botti and Ann L. McGill showed that, when subjects were presented with differentiated options and had the freedom to choose between them, their choice enhanced their satisfaction with positive and dissatisfaction with negative outcomes, relative to nonchoosers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botti|first1=Simona|last2=McGill|first2=Ann L.|year=2006|title=When Choosing is Not Deciding: The Effect Of Perceived Responsibility on Satisfaction|journal= Journal of Consumer Research|volume=33|ssrn=1516287|accessdate=|doi=10.1086/506302|pages=211–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] compiled a list of experiments about freedom of choice and argued that "too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1086/651242 | title = Does Choice Mean Freedom and Well‐Being? | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | page = 344 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz argues that people frequently experience regret due to [[opportunity cost]]s for not making an optimal decision and that, in some scenarios, people's overall satisfaction are sometimes higher when a difficult decision is made by another person rather than by themselves, even when the other person's choice is worse. Schwarts had written a book and given speeches criticizing the excess of options in modern society, though acknowledging that "some choice is better than none".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz|first=Barry|title=The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less|year=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=0060005696|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html|title=The paradox of choice|last1=Schwartz|first1=Barry|date=July 2005|work=Talk|publisher=TED|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fumage''' is a [[surrealist techniques|surrealist art technique]] popularized by [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in which impressions are made by the [[smoke]] of a [[candle]] or [[kerosene lamp]] on a piece of paper or canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0292708580|pages=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WhsUW7jkc0C&amp;pg=PT141&amp;dq=Fumage+Paalen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ti23UMm0L4eG0QG-0IHwCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paalen´s first Fumage ''Dictated by a Candle'' was presented 1936 in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London. In the same year Paalen painted his first oil based on the fumage, "[[Pays interdit/Forbidden Land (Wolfgang Paalen)|Pays interdit]]" ("Forbidden Land"). Several other Surrealists as [[Roberto Matta]], but also [[Salvador Dalí]] later utilized the technique, Dali calling the technique "sfumato".&lt;ref name="HDS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspley|first=Keith|title=Historical Dictionary of Surrealism|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810858479|pages=209–210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KK7JHqNrRsC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Fumage+Dali&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0i23UKO0H6KT0QGbkoG4Cw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Fumage%20Dali&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been utilized by artists including Bimal Banerjee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|title=History of Indian Painting: The Modern Period|year=1994|publisher=Abhinav Pubns|isbn=8170173108|pages=240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22Bimal+Banerjee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wgK3UI2_GsW40QHF5YEY&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bimal%20Banerjee%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Blakemore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamblakemore.com/category/smoke-art "Smoke Art"] Asam Blakemore catalog&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alberto Burri]], [[Burhan Doğançay]], [[Jiri Georg Dokoupil]], [[Hugh Parker Guiler]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Antonio Muñiz]], and [[Otto Piene]].

==In popular media==
Guiler's usage of the fumage technique is depicted briefly in the 1987 film ''[[Henry and June]]'' and his fumage pictures were often used as the covers for his wife [[Anaïs Nin|Anaïs Nin's]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herron|first=Paul|title=Anaïs Nin: a book of mirrors|year=1996|publisher=Sky Blue Press|isbn=0965236404|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLqwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Guiler+Fumage&amp;dq=Guiler+Fumage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eS63UL7OFYjr0gGA1oHQAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Mary Flanagan]] compared the technique to the reading of tea leaves and to the [[Rorschach test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flanagan|first=Mary|title=Critical Play: Radical Game Design|year=2009|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0262062682|pages=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VXH43WH5Z4C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Fumage%22+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vC-3UPKrA4jX0QHssIGIBw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fumage%22%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; José Antonio Pérez Esteban's 2013 doctoral thesis analyzes fumage art, especially "soot paintings" by [[Jiri Georg Dokoupil]].

The '''gender paradox''' is a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] phenomenon first observed by [[William Labov]], in which "Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistic norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they are not."&lt;ref name=labov&gt;{{cite book |last=Labov |first=William |year=2001 |title=Principles of Linguistic Change, Vol. 2: Social Factors |url=https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Linguistic-Change-Vol-Language/dp/063117916X |location=Malden, MA |publisher=Blackwell Publishers Inc. | pages=261–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the "paradox" arises from sociolinguistic data showing that women are more likely to use [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] forms and avoid stigmatized variants than men for a majority of [[variation (linguistics)|linguistic variables]], but that they are also more likely to lead language change by using innovative forms of variables.

==Overview==
William Labov identifies three main principles that, in combination, constitute the gender paradox. They illuminate the juxtaposing roles of women, who display both conformist and nonconformist behavior in the treatment of linguistic variables.

===Stable linguistic variables===

The first of the three principles states that "For stable sociolinguistic variables, women show a lower rate of stigmatized variants and a higher rate of prestige variants than men."&lt;ref name=labov /&gt; This principle gives the most general understanding of women's treatment of linguistic variables, in that when variables are not undergoing any change, women tend to prefer the [[standard language|standard]] form of the variable to the non-standard form. It is a commonly occurring phenomenon that sociolinguists have observed in a wide array of societies. [[Peter Trudgill]]'s study of the (ng) variable in Norwich, England provides evidence to support this principle.

In his 1968 study, Trudgill studied the frequency of the (ng) variable among sixty random subjects, calculating the usage of the standard form [ɪŋ] versus that of the non-standard form [ən ~ n̩]. He classified his results into categories of class, style and sex. Women tended to avoid the stigmatized form, preferring the standard form more than men did, which hold true for nearly all English dialects. Females were even more careful with their choice in variable when speaking formally, indicating a high level of linguistic awareness.&lt;ref name=trudgill&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trudgill | first = Peter | title = Sex, Covert Prestige and Linguistic Change in the Urban British English of Norwich | journal = Language in Society | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–195 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | date = Oct 1972 | jstor = 4166683 | doi=10.1017/s0047404500000488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes from above===
Occasionally considered a corollary to the first principle, the second principle states: "In linguistic [[change from above]], women adopt prestige forms at a higher rate than men." These are language changes that individuals are generally conscious of. People are aware of the prestige associated with formal styles and thus are prone to [[hypercorrection]] – a product of [[linguistic insecurity]]. Several studies have shown that women are leaders both in eliminating stigmatized forms and adopting incoming prestige forms, and they do so at a notably higher rate than men.

This finding is widespread across languages and can be seen in examples such as (r)-pronunciation in New York City, the reversal of the Parisian French chain shift, and entire language shifts, like that from Hungarian to German in Austria.&lt;ref name=labov /&gt;

===Changes from below===

The third principle is as follows: "In linguistic [[change from below]], women use higher frequencies of innovative forms more than men do."

These changes, which generally occur below the level of social consciousness, are "the primary form of linguistic change that operates within the system." In these cases, women are the initiators and leaders of changes in progress.

The [[Northern cities vowel shift|Northern Cities Shift (NCS)]] offers a clear example of women leading change from below. For instance, the Atlas of North American English provides data on the regression analysis of 56 speakers in the Inland North, in which the most significant factor regarding sound change advancement is gender, making women the leading innovators. Women-led sound change from below is particularly salient for new and vigorous changes, like that of the palatalization of /t/ and /d/ in Cairo Arabic.&lt;ref name=labov /&gt;

==Explanations==

Researchers in sociolinguistics have attempted to provide a unified account and explanation for the gender paradox with varying levels of success.

===Neurobiological view===

One proposed explanation from J. K. Chambers is the notion that women lead sound change due to some inherent biological verbal advantage. Under this view, women command a greater range of variants and styles, despite similar gender roles, because of sex differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=J. K. |year=1995 |title=Sociolinguistic Theory|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sociolinguistic-Theory-Language-Society-Chambers/dp/0631183264 |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers Inc.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contradicted by the varying size of the "gender gap," and the fact that differences have not remained constant over time.&lt;ref name=Romaine&gt;{{Citation | last = Romaine | first = Suzanne | title = The Handbook of Language and Gender | place = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd | chapter = Variation in Language and Gender | chapterurl =http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/schwenter1/Romaine%202003.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labov asserts that if Chambers' biological explanation were to hold true, it would need to produce a robust effect across generations.&lt;ref name=labov /&gt; Greater verbal ability would also predict more accurate self-representation in women. In fact, women tend to over-report usages of prestige forms, and give less accurate self-reports of language variants than men.

===Social capital view===

Another possible explanation for women's leadership in language change is their greater sensitivity to the social status associated with certain variants. As women have historically been denied access to the standard economic capital available to men through education and job opportunities, this may have motivated the usage of prestige forms to help them gain social capital and advance their social standing, both consciously for cases of change from above and subconsciously for change from below. The notion that women's speech is in fact the "language of powerlessness" is supported by findings that some features of stereotypical women's speech were also used by men when in a position of subverted power.

However, this view fails to address the consistently higher use of prestige forms even in contemporary societies with high levels of gender equality. Studies of language variation in central Sweden show that gender differences in speech have been maintained or even increased since 1967, despite the fact that recent legislation in Sweden has led to widespread gender equality.&lt;ref name=Romaine/&gt; Nonetheless, the legislation may be too recent to have any great effect on the power entrenched in language and the inherent sexism that might remain despite various new laws.

===Network theory view===
Gendered patterns of speech can also be explained by [[Social Network (sociolinguistics)|social network theory]], which suggests that speech differences are accounted for by the differences between the social networks of men and women. Men tend to have denser, more local social networks, which are more conservative and resistant to change, resulting in higher usage of non-standard local variants. On the other hand, women tend to have more open, less locally-constrained networks, which are more likely to use standard variants and have access to innovative forms due to weak ties to other speech communities.&lt;ref name=Romaine/&gt;

==Complications==

In addition to the difficulties that arise in reconciling the gender paradox itself, other complications have emerged in the methodology and interpretations that led to its discovery.

===Ethnocentric data===

Though evidence of the paradox is widespread in sociolinguistic variation studies that use either sex or gender as a variable, findings that support the principles are not universal. Most data in support of the gender paradox come from studies of [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe or North America, but studies done in Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries often show contradictory patterns. For example, male speakers use the prestigious classical variety of Arabic far more than women, even though women lead in the use of locally "prestigious" standard variants.&lt;ref name=arabic&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ibrahim | first = Muhammad H. | title = Standard and Prestige Language: A Problem in Arabic Sociolinguistics | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–126 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd. | location = Oxford | year = 2008 | jstor = 30027950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male speakers of [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] also lead in the use of their ideal speech style, characterized by non-confrontational indirectness, whereas the women are "norm-breakers" and use the stigmatized, direct style associated with negative information.&lt;ref name=Keenan&gt;{{cite book | last = Keenan | first = Elinor | chapter = Norm-makers, Norm-breakers: Uses of Speech by Men and Women in a Malagasy Community | title = Explorations in the Ethnography of Speaking | edition = 2 | pages = 125–143 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1989 | chapterurl = https://www.webdepot.umontreal.ca/Usagers/tuitekj/MonDepotPublic/cours/2611pdf/Keenan-Norm-makers.pdf |chapter-format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; These counterexamples suggest that the gender paradox could be limited to western cultures or languages.

===Stylistic differences within women===

Several sociolinguists question the validity of making generalizations about a group as large as "women," which makes up roughly half the population of the world.  [[Penelope Eckert]] argues instead that women are not using prestige forms to declare whether or not they are women.  A single linguistic variable can be [[Indexicality|indexical]] of multiple traits and women (and men) can belong to multiple social groups, each with their own linguistic traits.  Language variations are chosen by their third order indexical qualities on a personal, rather than gender-wide level, reflected in the fact that no two women's speech is exactly alike.  These findings challenge the idea that women's use of prestige forms is not necessarily something inherent in their biology, but could also be an external, third-order indexical quality more highly valued among women than men.&lt;ref name=Eckert&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eckert | first = Penelope | title = Variation and the indexical field | journal = Journal of Sociolinguistics | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–476 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd. | location = Oxford | year = 2008 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9841.2008.00374.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-constructionist view===

[[Social Constructionism|Social constructionists]] view the gender paradox as questionable because many of the studies used as evidence fail to take into account the [[sex and gender distinction]]. When gender is mentioned at all, it is often used synonymously with sex. While statistics support the fact that women often lead language change, the motivations for doing so cannot be determined by statistics alone.  It is inconclusive whether it is something physiologically inherent that makes women more progressive in their language use, or if this trend is instead an effect of the role of the female gender within society.  If a tendency towards language change is a product of gender, which is socially constructed, then sociolinguistics should instead be focusing on the social aspects of femininity that are indexed by female speech. This view would also account for the inconsistency in results between studies done in western cultures supporting the gender paradox and those done in other cultures where the results are less conclusive.&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{Citation | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | title = Annual Review of Applied Linguistics | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | chapter = GENDER ISSUES IN LANGUAGE CHANGE | chapterurl =http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=147756&amp;jid=APL&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=147755&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifting of standard forms===

Variation among women could also be due to shifting standard forms.  In a 2003 study of the multilingual community of [[Japanese settlement in Palau#Language|Palau]], Kazuko Matsumoto and David Britain, examined the functions of prestige forms among women of various age groups.  They found that among Palau women of the parent and grandparent generations, the use of Japanese is considered a conservative behavior, as it is used to preserve their ethnic home language.  Among young Palau women, however, the use of Japanese is considered an innovative behavior because, having been raised speaking Palau, Japanese is an overly-prestigious foreign language used to secure a job in the modern employment market.&lt;ref name=Matsumoto&gt;{{cite journal | last = Matsumoto | first = Kazuko | title = Investigating the sociolinguistic gender paradox in a multilingual community: A case study from the Republic of Palau | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–152 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Essex | year = 2003 | url=http://ijb.sagepub.com/content/7/2/127.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/13670069030070020201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[gender studies]], '''hegemonic masculinity''' is part of [[Raewyn Connell|R.&amp;nbsp;W. Connell]]'s gender order theory, which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes men's dominant position in society and justifies the subordination of women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant social roles over women, and other gender identities, which are perceived as "feminine" in a given society.

As a [[sociology|sociologic]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by Marxist theorist [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a social group claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of social organization that has been sociologically challenged and changed.

The conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, [[Cognitive dissonance|psychologically contradictory]], and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.&lt;ref name=Don1993&gt;{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&amp;ndash;657 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00993540 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity. Moreover, proponents argue that hegemonic masculinity is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the health of men and women, and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]
Terry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the "real man" is defined. According to [R.&amp;nbsp;W.] Connell, contemporary hegemonic masculinity is built on two legs, domination of women and a hierarchy of intermale dominance. It is also shaped to a significant extent by the stigmatization of homosexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today’s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Kupers 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kupers | first = Terry A. | title = Toxic masculinity as a barrier to mental health treatment in prison | journal = [[Journal of Clinical Psychology]] | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 713&amp;ndash;724 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20105 | date = June 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20105 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===History===
The concept of hegemonic masculinity was first proposed in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;&lt;ref name=Kessler1982&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers &amp; disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;&lt;ref name=Con1983&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up? Essays on sex, class, and culture | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = Sydney Boston | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780868613741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a debate over the role of men in Australian labour politics.&lt;ref name=Con1982&gt;{{cite journal | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Class, patriarchy, and Sartre's theory of practice | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;320 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00211660 | jstor = 657273 | date = May 1982 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00211660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beginnings were organized into an article&lt;ref name=Carrigan1985&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carrigan | first1 = Tim | last2 = Connell | first2 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last3 = Lee | first3 = John | author-link2 = Raewyn Connell | title = Toward a new sociology of masculinity | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 551&amp;ndash;604 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00160017 | jstor = 657315 | date = September 1985 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00160017 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which critiqued the "[[gender role|male sex role]]" literature and proposed a model of multiple masculinities and power relations. This model was integrated into a systematic sociological theory of gender. The resulting six pages in ''Gender and Power'' by [[Raewyn Connell|R.&amp;nbsp;W. Connell]]&lt;ref name=Con1987&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender and power: society, the person and sexual politics | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = Sydney Boston | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780041500868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on "hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity" became the most cited source for the concept of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept draws its theoretical roots from the [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] term ''[[cultural hegemony|hegemony]]'' as it was used to understand the stabilization of class relations. The idea was then transferred to the problem of gender relations.

Hegemonic masculinity draws some of its historical roots from both the fields of social psychology and sociology which contributed to the literature about the male sex role that had begun to recognize the social nature of masculinity and the possibilities of change in men's conduct.&lt;ref name=Hack1957&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hacker | first = Helen Mayer | title = The new burdens of masculinity | journal = [[Journal of Marriage and Family|Marriage and Family Living]] | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 227&amp;ndash;233 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/348873 | jstor = 348873 | date = August 1957 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This literature preceded the [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] and [[feminist theory|feminist theories]] of [[patriarchy]] which also played a strong role in shaping the concept of hegemonic masculinity. The core concepts of power and difference were found in the [[gay liberation]] movement which had not only sought to analyse the oppression of men but also oppression by men.&lt;ref name=Alt1972&gt;{{cite book | last = Altman | first = Dennis | title = Homosexual: oppression and liberation | publisher = Angus and Robertson | location = Sydney, Australia | year = 1972 | isbn = 9780207124594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a hierarchy of masculinities has since persisted and strongly influenced the reformulation of the concept.

Empirical social research also played an important role as a growing body of field studies documented local gender hierarchies and local cultures of masculinities in schools,&lt;ref name=Willis1977&gt;{{cite book | last = Willis | first = Paul | author-link = Paul Willis | title = [[Learning to Labour|Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs]] | publisher = Saxon House | location = Farnborough, England | year = 1977 |oclc = 692250005}}&lt;/ref&gt; male-dominated workplaces,&lt;ref name=Cockburn1983&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto Press | location = London | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780861043842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and village communities.&lt;ref name=Herdt1981&gt;{{cite book | last = Herdt | first = Gilbert | title = Guardians of the flutes: idioms of masculinity | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1981 | isbn = 9780070283152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the concept was influenced by [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] produced the first analytic biographies of men and showed how adult personality was a system under tension and the psychoanalyst Robert J. Stoller&lt;ref name=Stoller1968&gt;{{cite book | last = Stoller | first = Robert J. | title = Sex and gender: the development of masculinity and femininity | publisher = Karnac Books | location = London | year = 1984 |origyear = 1968 | isbn = 9780946439034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized the concept of [[gender identity]] and mapped its variation in boys' development.

===Original framework===

The particular normative form of masculinity that is the most honoured way of being a man, which requires all other men to position themselves in relation to it, is known as hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Originally, hegemonic masculinity was understood as the pattern of practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue. In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].&lt;ref name=Don1993/&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Con1987" /&gt; The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.&lt;ref name=Con2005&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.

Hegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].&lt;ref name="Con1987" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up them.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.

Complicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

The interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.

==Criticisms==

As the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

===Underlying concept of masculinity===

The underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,&lt;ref name=Hearn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;72 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1464700104040813 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,&lt;ref name=Petersen&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;69 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X02250843 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod&lt;ref name=Brod&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brod | first = Harry | author-link = Harry Brod |chapter = Some thoughts on some histories of some masculinities: Jews and other others |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXk5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82| editor-last1 = Brod | editor-first1 = Harry | editor-last2 = Kaufman | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-link1 = Harry Brod | editor-link2 =  Michael Kaufman (author) | title = Theorizing masculinities | pages = 82&amp;ndash;96 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780803949041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that there is a tendency in men's studies field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.

===Ambiguity and overlap===

Early criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Many men who hold great social power do not embody an ideal masculinity. Martin&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman? Reflections on Connell's ''Masculinities'' | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 472&amp;ndash;474 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124398012004008 | date = August 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124398012004008 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley&lt;ref name=Weth&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&amp;ndash;356 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959353599009003012 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&amp;ndash;304 | publisher = Nordic Association of African Studies | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and sexuality, rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.

===The problem of realness===

It has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of power. Holter&lt;ref name=Holter&gt;{{cite book | last = Holter | first = Øystein Gullvåg | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional, aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.

===The masculine subject===

Several authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.&lt;ref name=Weth/&gt; To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified essentialism, wherein the "achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The pattern of gender relations===

There is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.&lt;ref name=Deme&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&amp;ndash;361 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1017596718715 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.

==Reformulation==

In one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.

===Gender hierarchy===
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}

Gender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences one another. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of "protest masculinity", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.

This new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.

===Geography of masculinities===

Change in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],&lt;ref name=Hoop&gt;{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Connell proposed a model of "transnational business masculinity" among jet-setting corporate executives.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.

===Social embodiment===

Social embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.&lt;ref name=Con2002&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamics of masculinities===

New theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the "long hours culture" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.&lt;ref name=Deme/&gt; This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or "philogynous" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&amp;ndash;111 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X11427021 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifespan development==

===Early childhood===
Children learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}
*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "doing" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = "Boys will be boys": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&amp;ndash;339 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00131910903045963 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity. Children learn and show development of gender identity as an ongoing process, based on social situations. Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in [[early childhood]]. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community.{{refn|name=Levant 1996}}{{refn|name=Weir}} Media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}}

Although gender socialization is well underway before children reach preschool, stereotypical differences between boys and girls are typically reinforced, rather than diminished, by their early educational childhood experiences.&lt;ref name="Gelb, S. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gelb | first = Steven A. | title = Language and the problem of male salience in early childhood classroom environments | journal = [[Early Childhood Research Quarterly]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | date = June 1989 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers have a large role in reinforcing gender stereotypes by limiting children's choices at this young age, thus not allowing boys to explore their feelings or their understandings about gender freely. This is done through the endorsement of hegemonic masculinity embodying physical domination, strength, competitiveness, sport, courage, and aggression.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"/&gt; These gendered performances are based on society's construction of femininity and masculinity in relation to heterosexuality. [[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt;

Another factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.&lt;ref name="Gelb, S. 1989"/&gt; A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents. Though, an ultimate conclusion by one author notes that young children know, feel, and think gender despite the wishes of adults to make gender disappear in their lives.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"/&gt;

===Middle childhood===
A lifespan perspective must be considered when discussing gender normalization. But one must also consider [[cultural hegemony]] in this stage of the lifespan as a child develops more of an understanding of their culture and begins to display original ideas of cultural norms as well as social norms.&lt;ref name="Liben"/&gt; According to the constructivist emphasis, the man/woman dichotomy is not the "natural" state, but rather a potent metaphor in Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Spector-Mersel, G. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spector-Mersel | first = Gabriela | title = Never-aging stories: Western hegemonic masculinity scripts | journal = [[Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/09589230500486934 | date = 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/09589230500486934 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building social relationships and developing individuality are essential benchmarks for this age of middle childhood, which ranges from eight years old to puberty.  A young boy is trying to navigate falling within the [[social structure]] that has been laid out for him, which includes interacting with both sexes, and a dominant notion of maleness.  The gender environmentalism, which emphasizes the role of societal practices in generating and maintaining gender differentiation, still plays a part in this stage of life, but is possibly more influenced by immediate and close interactions with boys close to their age.&lt;ref name="Liben"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liben | first1 = Lynn S. | last2 = Bigler | first2 = Rebecca S. | title = The developmental course of gender differentiation: Conceptualizing, measuring, and evaluating constructs and pathways | journal = Monographs of The Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = i&amp;ndash;viii and 1&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | jstor = 3181530 | pmid = 12465575 | date = 2002 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mono.2002.67.issue-2/issuetoc | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1111/mono.2002.67.issue-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys organize themselves in a hierarchical structure in which the high-status boys decide what is acceptable and valued – that which is hegemonically masculine – and what is not. A boy's rank in the hierarchy is chiefly determined by his athletic ability.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McGuffey | first1 = C. Shawn | last2 = Rich | first2 = B. Lindsay | chapter = Playing in the gender transgression zone: Race, class, and hegemonic masculinity in middle childhood|chapterurl= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mKn99NiaSZQC&amp;pg=PA166 | editor-last1 = Spade | editor-first1 = Joan Z. | editor-last2 = Valentine | editor-first2 = Catherine G. | title = The kaleidoscope of gender: prisms, patterns, and possibilities | pages = 166&amp;ndash;176 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Los Angeles, California | year = 2011 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781412979061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One site where gender is performed and socialized is in sport. Violent sports such as football are fundamental in naturalizing the equation of maleness with violence.&lt;ref name="Messner, Michael A 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = When bodies are weapons: Masculinity and violence in sport | journal = [[International Review for the Sociology of Sport]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 203&amp;ndash;220 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/101269029002500303 | date = September 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/101269029002500303 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays of strength and violence, through sports like football, help to naturalize elements of competition and hierarchy as inherently male behaviour.&lt;ref name="Messner, Michael A 1990" /&gt; There is considerable evidence that males are hormonally predisposed to higher levels of aggression on average that females, due to the effects of testosterone.&lt;ref name="Batrinos, Menelaos L 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563&amp;ndash;568 | publisher = Kowsar Medical (Tehran) | pmc = 3693622 | date = Summer 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=23843821 | doi=10.5812/ijem.3661}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the violent and competitive nature of sports like football can only be an exclusively masculine domain if girls and women are excluded from participating altogether. The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.

When a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt; Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"/&gt; This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"/&gt; Another notion which further confuses youth is "multiple masculinities" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.&lt;ref name="Spector-Mersel, G. 2006"/&gt; Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"/&gt;

===Adolescence===

The last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt; [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less "masculine" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.

The male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Oransky | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Celia | title = The development and validation of the meaning of adolescent masculinity scale | journal = [[Psychology of Men and Masculinity]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 57&amp;ndash;72 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0013612 | date = 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013612 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity. This is a time of confusion and disturbance; they feel influenced as a result of asserted hegemonic masculinity as well as social factors that lead them to become more self-conscious. De Visser et al.,&lt;ref name="de Visser"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = de Visser | first1 = Richard O. | last2 = McDonnell | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Man points: masculine capital and young men's health | journal = [[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 5&amp;ndash;14 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0029045 | pmid = 22888820  | date = January 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029045 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that although men need not engage in all masculine behaviour to be considered masculine, enacting in more masculine behaviours increases the likelihood they will be considered more masculine, otherwise known as building "masculine capital". It has been suggested that boys' emotional stoicism leaves them unable to recognize their own and others' emotions, which leaves a risk for developing psychological distress and empty interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"/&gt; Boys in their adolescence are pressured to act masculine in order to fit the hegemonic ideals, yet the possibility of suffering long-term psychological damage as a result looms overhead.&lt;ref name ="de Visser"/&gt;

== Media representations ==
The 1995 documentary, ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' discusses the depictions of homosexuals throughout film history. Furthermore, considering the media so heavily associates masculinity with heterosexual sex, it is no wonder that gay men in the media are given more feminine attributes, such as fragility, sensitivity, and a disregard for violence. Their disinterest in objectifying women's bodies makes them appear unmasculine. In [[Jackson Katz]]'s film ''Tough Guise'': ''Violence, Media &amp; the Crisis in Masculinity'', he explains:
{{quote|We can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intelligent. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=Tough Guise: Violence, Media &amp; the Crisis in Masculinity|date=1 January 2000|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139643/|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Applications==

===Education===

Hegemonic masculinity has been used in education studies to understand the dynamics of classroom life, including patterns of resistance and bullying among boys. It was also used to explore relations to the curriculum and the difficulties in gender-neutral pedagogy.&lt;ref name=Martino&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Martino | first = Wayne | title = Boys and literacy: Exploring the construction of hegemonic masculinities and the formation of literate capacities for boys in the English classroom | journal = [[Australian Association for the Teaching of English#Publications|English in Australia]] | volume = 112 | pages = 11&amp;ndash;24 | publisher = [[Australian Association for the Teaching of English]] | date = July 1995 | url = https://www.aate.org.au/journals/sample-journal-articles | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to understand teaching strategies and teacher identities among such groups as physical education instructors.&lt;ref name=Skelton&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Skelton | first = A. | title = On becoming a male physical education teacher: the informal culture of students and the construction of hegemonic masculinity | journal = [[Gender and Education]] | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 289&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0954025930050305 | date = 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0954025930050305 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has also been helpful in structuring violence-prevention programs for youth.&lt;ref name=Denbor&gt;{{citation | last = Denborough | first = David | contribution = Step by step: Developing respectful and effective ways of working with young men to reduce violence | editor-last1 = McLean | editor-first1 = Christopher | editor-last2 = Carey | editor-first2 = Maggie | editor-last3 = White | editor-first3 = Cheryl | title = Men's ways of being | pages = 91&amp;ndash;116 | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780813326535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional education programs for boys.&lt;ref name=SalisJack&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salisbury | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Jackson | first2 = David | title = Challenging macho values: practical ways of working with adolescent boys | publisher = Falmer Press | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780750704847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminology===

Hegemonic masculinity has greatly influenced criminology as data reflects that men and boys perpetuate more conventional crimes and more serious crimes than women and girls. Moreover, men are responsible for much more [[white-collar crime]]s than women as well. The concept of hegemonic masculinity helped in theorizing the relationship among masculinities and a variety of crimes.&lt;ref name=Mess1993&gt;{{cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Masculinities and Crime : Critique and Reconceptualization of Theory | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780847678693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in studies on specific crimes by boys and men, such as rape in Switzerland, murder in Australia, football hooliganism and white-collar crime in England, and assaultive violence in the United States.&lt;ref name=NewStank&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Newburn | first1 = Tim | last2 = Stanko | first2 = Elizabeth A. | title = Just boys doing business? Men, masculinities, and crime | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415093200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding costs and consequences, research in criminology showed how particular patterns of aggression were linked with hegemonic masculinity, not because criminals already had dominant positions, but because they were pursuing them.&lt;ref name=Bufkin&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bufkin | first = Jana L. | title = Bias crime as gendered behavior | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Human Rights, Gender Politics &amp; Postmodern Discourses | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 155&amp;ndash;176 | publisher =  | jstor = 29767117 | date = Spring 1999 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=jana-bufkin-2 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and sports===
Hegemonic masculinity has also been employed in studying media representations of men. Because the concept of hegemony helps to make sense of both the diversity and the selectiveness of images in mass media, media researchers have begun mapping the relations between different masculinities.&lt;ref name=Hanke&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanke | first = Robert | chapter = Redesigning men: Hegemonic masculinity in transition | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GJA7CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 | editor-last = Craig | editor-first = Steve | title = Men, masculinity and the media | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780803941632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portrayals of masculinity in men's lifestyle magazines have been studied and researchers found elements of hegemonic masculinity woven throughout them.&lt;ref name=Ricc&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardelli | first1 = Rosemary | last2 = Clow | first2 = Kimberley A. | last3 = White | first3 = Philip | title = Investigating hegemonic masculinity: Portrayals of masculinity in men’s lifestyle magazines | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 63 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 64&amp;ndash;78 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9764-8 | date = July 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9764-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rose_Ricciardelli/publication/225204116_Investigating_Hegemonic_Masculinity_Portrayals_of_Masculinity_in_Men's_Lifestyle_Magazines/links/02e7e538e358f2b2d3000000.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial sports are a focus of media representations of masculinity, and the developing field of sports sociology found significant use of the concept of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=Messner1992&gt;{{cite book | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Power at play: sports and the problem of masculinity | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780807041048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed in understanding the popularity of body-contact confrontational sports which function as an endlessly renewed symbol of masculinity and in understanding the violence and homophobia frequently found in sporting environments.&lt;ref name=MessSabo&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Messner | editor-first1 = Michael A. | editor-last2 = Sabo | editor-first2 = Donald F. | editor-link1 = Michael Messner | title = Sport, men, and the gender order: critical feminist perspectives | publisher = Human Kinetics Books | location = Champaign, Illinois | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780873224215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American football, and the prevalence of concussions in the sport, is a particularly salient example of the impacts of hegemonic masculinity. With the dominant mode of hegemonic masculinity valuing emotionlessness, invulnerability, toughness, and risk-taking, concussions have become normalized. Players have accepted them as simply "part of the game". If a man does not play through a concussion, he risks being blamed for the team's loss, or labelled as effeminate. It is noble to play in pain, nobler to play in agony, and noblest if one never exhibits any sign of pain at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burton Nelson | first = Mariah | title = The stronger women get, the more men love football: sexism and the American culture of sports | publisher = Harcourt Brace | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780151813933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches buy into this unwritten code of masculinity as well, by invoking euphemisms such as "he needs to learn the difference between injury and pain", while also questioning a player's masculinity to get him back on the field quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fainaru | first1 = Steve | last2 = Fainaru-Wada | first2 = Mark | title = League of denial: the NFL, concussions, and the battle for truth | publisher = Three Rivers Press | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780770437565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players, coaches, and trainers subscribe to the hegemonic model, thus creating a culture of dismissiveness, often resulting in concussions, which can lead to brain diseases like CTE.

===Health===

Hegemonic masculinity has been increasingly used to understand men's health practices and determinants. Practices such as playing through physical injuries and risk-taking sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex with multiple partners have been studied.&lt;ref name=SaboGor&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Sabo | editor-first1 = Donald F. | editor-last2 = Gordon | editor-first2 = David F. | title = Men's health and illness: gender, power, and the body | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780803952751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also been used to understand men's exposure to risk and their difficulty in responding to disability and injury.&lt;ref name=Gerschick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerschick | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = Adam Stephen | title = Gender identities at the crossroads of masculinity and physical disability | journal = Masculinities | volume =  2 | issue = 1 | pages = 34&amp;ndash;55 | publisher = Men's Studies Association | issn = 1072-8538 | oclc = 936771714 | date = 1994 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Men are less likely than women to seek professional services psychiatrists or counsellors, informal help through friends, and are more likely to report that they would never seek psychotherapy for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Addis | first1 = Michael E. | last2 = Mahalik | first2 = James R. | title = Men, masculinity, and the  contexts of help seeking | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 5&amp;ndash;14 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.5 | pmid = 12674814 | date = 5 January 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10822409_Men_Masculinity_and_the_Contexts_of_Help_Seeking Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, men who adhere to the masculine norm of stoicism have difficulty in identifying grief, sadness, or a depressed mood, some of the conventional diagnostic symptoms of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Addis | first = Michael E. | title = Gender and depression in men | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 153&amp;ndash;168 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00125.x | date = September 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00125.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of weakness would be a recognition of femininity, and as such, men distract themselves, avoid the problem, or get angry – one of the few emotions permissible under hegemonic masculine norms – when depressive symptoms surface.

===Organizations===

Hegemonic masculinity has proved significant in organizational studies as the gendered character of workplaces and bureaucracies has been increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; A particular focus has been placed on the military, where specific patterns of hegemonic masculinity have been entrenched but have been increasingly problematic.&lt;ref name=Mes2010&gt;{{cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Hegemonic masculinities and camouflaged politics: unmasking the Bush dynasty and its war against Iraq | publisher = Paradigm Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781594518171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies found that negative hegemonically masculine characteristics related to violence and aggression were required to thrive in the military at all ranks and in all branches. Additionally homophobic ideals were commonplace and further subordinated men in these positions. Studies have also traced the institutionalization of hegemonic masculinities in specific organizations and their role in organizational decision making.&lt;ref name=Mess1995&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Managing to kill: Masculinities and the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion | journal = Masculinities | volume =  3 | issue = 4 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;22 | publisher = Men's Studies Association | issn = 1072-8538 | oclc = 936763962 | date = 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

"Tough guy" attributes like unwillingness to admit ignorance, admit mistakes, or ask for help can undermine [[safety culture]] and productivity, by interfering with exchange of useful information. A Harvard Business School study found an intervention to improve the culture at [[Shell Oil]] during the construction of the [[Ursa tension leg platform]] contributed to increased productivity and an 84% lower accident rate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/17/482203447/invisibilia-how-learning-to-be-vulnerable-can-make-life-safer Invisibilia: How Learning To Be Vulnerable Can Make Life Safer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War, international relations, and militarism===
Hegemonic masculinity has impacted both conflict and [[international relations]], serving as a foundation for [[militarism]]. Charlotte Hooper discusses how [[US foreign policy]], following the [[Vietnam War]], was seen as a way of bolstering America's manhood.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics | journal = [[Review of International Studies]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 475&amp;ndash;480 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/s0260210599004751 | date = July 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/s0260210599004751 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the Vietcong, often categorized "as a bunch of women and children", had humiliated and emasculated America.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; In order to regain its manhood – both domestically and internationally – America needed to develop a [[hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinized]] and aggressive breed of foreign policy. Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both "the production and maintenance of masculinities."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.

Hooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity "symbolically, institutionally", and culturally through body shape.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their "enduring 'natural aggression'."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional "exclusion of women from combat", while furthering the myth "that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a "rite of passage" for young men.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; As such, "war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities" are formed and enshrined.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt;

Militarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a "dominating and organizationally competent" branch.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.

Male rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled "'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'",&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, "The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him."&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.

==Toxic masculinity==

Connell argues that a salient feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of "toxic" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''toxic masculinity'' to refer to stereotypically masculine  [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the "[[alpha male]]") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of [[anger]].{{refn|name=Liu 2016}}

===In psychology===

Terry Kupers defines toxic masculinity as "the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2010}} According to Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, "such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination". These traits are contrasted with more positive aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as "pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}

Toxic masculine norms are a feature of life for men in American [[prison]]s, where they are reflected in the behaviour of both staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either [[femininity]] or weakness, comprise an unspoken code among prisoners.{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2007}} Suppressing vulnerable emotions is often adopted in order to successfully cope with the harsh conditions of prison life, defined by [[punishment]], social isolation, and aggression. These factors likely play a role in [[Prisoner suicide|suicide among male prisoners]].{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Mankowski &amp; Smith}}

Bullying of boys by their peers and domestic violence experienced by boys at home can also be expressions of toxic masculinity.{{refn|name=Keith}} The often violent socialization of boys produces psychological trauma through the promotion of aggression and lack of interpersonal connection. Such trauma is often disregarded, such as in the saying "boys will be boys" with regard to bullying.{{refn|name=Liu 2017}}

===Health effects===

Men who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, [[violence]], dominance, primacy of work, need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of [[social status]], tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[stress (psychology)|stress]], [[body image]] problems, [[substance abuse]], and poor social functioning.{{refn|name=Wong et al.}} The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or "playboy" behaviour.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Panko}}

The social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern American society has moved more toward interdependence.{{refn|name=Weir}} Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against [[mental health]], as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions.{{refn|name=Weir}} Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians.{{refn|name=Horowitz}}{{refn|name=Ellis}}

===Men's movements===

Some authors associated with the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] have referred to the social pressures placed upon men to be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling as a "toxic" form of masculinity, in contrast to a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.{{refn|name=Ferber}}{{refn|name=Longwood}} The academic [[Shepherd Bliss]] proposed a return to [[agrarianism]] as an alternative to the "potentially toxic masculinity" of the warrior ethic.{{refn|name=Hartman}} Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] writes that Bliss's notion of toxic masculinity can be seen as part of the mythopoetic movement's response to male feelings of powerlessness at a time when the [[feminist movement]] was challenging traditional male authority:

{{quote|Thus Shepherd Bliss, for example, rails against what he calls "toxic masculinity"&amp;nbsp;– which he believes is responsible for most of the evil in the world&amp;nbsp;– and proclaims the unheralded goodness of the men who fight the fires and till the soil and nurture their families.{{refn|name=Kimmel 1995}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Jean-Baptiste Kiéthéga''' is an [[archeologist]] and [[historian]] from [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], currently [[Burkina Faso]]. Kiéthéga was born on May 10, 1947, in [[Yako, Burkina Faso|Yako]].

He is considered to be one of the first archeologists of West Africa. In course of his career, he was honored with a [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] yet in 1998 for his progressions in archeology. At that time he had trained around 40 young scholars in this field, and has taken care that his research was made public in the academic world, as well as to the public via for instance museums.&lt;ref name="PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/345 profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kiéthéga archaeological research in a developing country like Burkina Faso should not be seen as luxury. He views culture as a dynamic concept.&lt;ref name="PCF" /&gt;

Since 2005 he is a professor at the [[University of Ouagadougou]].

'''Jonathan McIntosh''' is an American producer, writer, artist, and cultural critic. He is the creator of the Pop Culture Detective Agency video series examining intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment. He was also a producer and co-writer on the ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' YouTube video series.

===Remix Work===
McIntosh produced [[video mashup]]s early in his film career. A proponent of [[remix culture]], he spoke on the topic and how media produced in this fashion can be uniquely powerful tools for commenting on political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I+C+i #2 // The Remix as Cultural Ecosystem|url=http://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/i-c-i-2-the-remix-as-cultural-ecosystem/217907|website=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American academic and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]] cites McIntosh's work as among his favorites in the book [[Remix (book)|Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy]] for its ability to deliver "a message more powerfully than any original alone could."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessig|first1=Lawrence|title=Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7eRPKIvEo9gC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;dq=%22jonathan+mcintosh%22+remix#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20mcintosh%22%20remix&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 July 2017|isbn=9781440634628}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Buffy versus Edward====
In 2012, McIntosh spoke before the [[United States Copyright Office]] to advocate for exemptions to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]—a law designed to criminalize the unauthorized production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services regarding copyrighted works—that was adversely affecting video artists like himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kravets|first1=David|title=Feds Considering Allowing DVD-Encryption Cracking|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/dvd-encryption-hacking|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Wired|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2009 video, ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed''—a high-profile mashup video and [[Webby Award]] nominee for remixing—was used as an example in the copyright discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nye Griffiths|first1=Daniel|title=Copyright In The Twilight Zone: The Strange Case Of 'Buffy Versus Edward'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/01/15/copyright-in-the-twilight-zone-the-strange-case-of-buffy-versus-edward|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Previous exemptions|final rulemaking]] stated an exemption for: "Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances." It specifically points out ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed'' in the rulemaking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the video evidence presented, the Register is able to conclude that diminished quality likely would impair the criticism and comment contained in noncommercial videos.  For example, the Register is able to perceive that Buffy vs Edward and other noncommercial videos would suffer significantly because of blurring and the loss of detail in characters’ expression and sense of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 1201 Rulemaking: Fifth Triennial Proceeding to Determine Exemptions to the Prohibition on Circumvention|date=2012|url=https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2012/Section_1201_Rulemaking_2012_Recommendation.pdf|website=Copyright.gov|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tropes vs. Women in Video Games===
From 2013-2015, McIntosh worked on the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games YouTube video series as a producer and co-writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan McIntosh|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7366402/|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=September 2017}} The web series was a highly successful [[Kickstarter]] created by [[Anita Sarkeesian]] that examined gender tropes in video games.

===Pop Culture Detective Agency===
In 2016 McIntosh launched the Pop Culture Detective Agency, a [[Patreon]]-funded web series examining the intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rouner|first1=Jef|title=Feminist Frequency’s Jonathan McIntosh Has New Show About Masculinity|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/feminist-frequency-s-jonathan-mcintosh-has-new-show-about-masculinity-8568260|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Houston Press|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The long-form video essays examine a variety of topics within these themes. One episode explored the concept of [[toxic masculinity]] through an American pop culture lens. Other episodes are devoted to examining specific pieces of pop culture, such as television programs [[Steven Universe]] and [[The Big Bang Theory]], and films including [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] and [[Star Wars]]. Some of the videos produced in the series propose new cultural tropes in which to understand the topics discussed, such as ''Born Sexy Yesterday'', which seeks to explain how fictional characters exhibit men’s fear of experienced women.

==Writing==
In 2014, McIntosh wrote the opinion piece, ''Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIntosh|first1=Jonathan|title=Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male|date=April 23, 2014|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/4/23/5640678/playing-with-privilege-the-invisible-benefits-of-gaming-while-male|website=Polygon|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullis|first1=Steve|title=Gaming While Male: A 'Privilege' Few Men Recognize|date=April 27, 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/04/27/306853264/gaming-while-male-a-privilege-few-men-recognize|website=NPR|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addressed the [[Gamergate controversy]] that had been receiving increasing media attention and public discourse. In the piece, he sought to address the underlying problems that contributed toward [[sexism in video gaming]] by examining the inherent privileges that male-identified gamers benefit from.  Taking inspiration from the famous ''Daily Effects of White Privilege'' list by [[Peggy McIntosh]], among others, McIntosh listed 25 Daily Effects of Male Game Privilege. These included such privileges as "I will never be asked or expected to speak for all other gamers who share my gender."

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.

And that, ironically, may result in 2012 being a catalyst for a shift in human consciousness, exactly as the prophets predicted."&lt;ref name="token" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cometh" /&gt;

'''''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History''''' is an [[academic journal]] published quarterly since 2000 by [[Slavica Publishers]], a division of [[Indiana University]].

The journal currently publishes a mixture of reviews and original research, in contrast to its predecessor ''Kritika: A Review of Current Soviet Books on Russian History'', published as a collection of reviews by [[Harvard University]] between 1964 and 1984. This original "Kritika" was the brainchild of Harvard history professor, [[Richard Pipes]], who conceived it as an outlet for his numerous graduate students to review recent Soviet books on [[Russian history]].

For his work, Schaeffer has received [[Fulbright]], Ryskamp, and Whiting fellowships.&lt;ref name="artsandsciences.virginia" /&gt;

==Biography== 
Schaeffer received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Religious Studies from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1988, and an additional B.A. from [[the Evergreen State College]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="uv-ra-ks6bb"/&gt;  He received a [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) in [[Buddhist Studies]] from the [[University of Washington]] in 1995 and then a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] (PhD) from [[Harvard University]] in 2000 in Tibetan and South Asian Religions.&lt;ref name="uv-ra-ks6bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uvatibetcenter"/&gt;

In 2000, he was appointed assistant professor at the [[University of Alabama]] in the Department of Religious Studies.   In 2003, he took a leave of absence for the entire year with the backing of a [[Mellon Foundation]] Fellowship. Schaeffer was awarded tenure and promoted to the position of associate professor a year early, in 2004. In late 2005, Schaeffer took a position at the [[University of Virginia]] as an associate professor in the Department of Religious Studies, specifically in Tibetan and Buddhist studies, where he oversees the study and research of over twenty graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/rel/schaefferlecture.html |title=Religion in Culture Lecture |publisher=[[University of Alabama]] Department of Religious Studies |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/rel/schaeffer.html |title=Kurtis R. Schaeffer: Assistant Professor, Asian Religions |publisher=[[University of Alabama]] Department of Religious Studies |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also the past co-director, with Frances Garrett, of the Tibetan and Himalayan Religious Group in the [[American Academy of Religion]] (AAR).  From 2005 to present, he served as a co-director for The Tibetan Buddhist Canonical Collections Cataloging Project for the [[Tibetan and Himalayan Library]]. He has also been Book Review Editor for the [[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]] from 2006 to the present, as well as for the Journal of the International Association for Tibetan Studies from 2005 to date.&lt;ref name="artsandsciences.virginia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uvatibetcenter" /&gt;

==Writings==
Schaeffer has written and edited several books, as well as numerous scholarly articles. Schaeffer's first book, ''Himalayan Hermitess: The Life of a Tibetan Buddhist Nun,'' was published by Oxford University Press in 2004. In this book, Schaeffer examines the autobiography (Tib: rnam thar) of a seventeenth-century Nepalese Buddhist nun, Orgyan Chokyi. Scaheffer is particularly interested in how the autobiography reveals women's voice within Tibetan Buddhist practice, voices which are often overlooked, ignored, or silenced.&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, Kurtis. ''Himalayan Hermitess: The Life of a Buddhist Nun.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, he explores the unique perspectives on Tibetan Buddhist doctrine and practice Orgyan Chokyi brings to light through her autobiography, including a more localized religious life, an emphasis on the physicality of the body in practice, and a particular focus on the day-to-day reality of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;''Himalayan Hermitess,'' 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaeffer followed ''Himalayan Hermitess'' with ''Dreaming the Great Brahmin: Tibetan Traditions of the Buddhist Poet Saint Saraha,'' where he works to broaden the idea of "tradition" as it relates to the Tibetan cultural world from the actions of a singular historical author to the multivariant roles and agencies of a given text throughout Tibetan life.&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, Kurtis. ''Dreaming the Great Brahmin: Tibetan Traditions of the Buddhist Poet Saint Saraha.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Schaeffer seeks to explore the creative traditions which surrounded the figure of Saraha and gave him life throughout the Tibetan Buddhist world long after his death, including exposing conflicted, and at times, contradictory visions of the century Indian figures life, actions, and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreaming the Great Brahmin,'' 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaeffer has continued to encourage a broad understanding of Tibetan culture and tradition, particularly through his 2014 book, ''The Culture of the Book in Tibet,'' published through Columbia University Press. This work explores the contours of Tibetan book production, consumption, and use to reveal the significant, yet incredibly variable, role of books in Tibetan cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, Kurtis. ''The Culture of the Book in Tibet,'' New York: Columbia University Press, 2014. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, Schaeffer reveals not only the crucial role of textual criticism and scholarship in Tibetan Buddhist practice, but also how Tibetan books simultaneously functioned as relics and sites of devotional activity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Culture of the Book in Tibet,'' 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his monographs, Schaeffer has also edited several volumes, including ''Among Tibetan Texts: Essays on Tibetan Religion, Literature, and History by E. Gene Smith,'' (Wisdom Publications, 2001), ''Power, Politics, and the Reinvention of Tradition: Tibet in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'' (Brill Publishers, 2006; co-edited with [[Bryan J. Cuevas]]). Most recently, Schaeffer edited two volumes in 2013 for Columbia University Press--''Sources of Tibetan Tradition'' (co-edited with Gray Tuttle) and ''The Tibetan History Reader'' (co-edited with Gray Tuttle and [[Matthew Kapstein]])--both of which make the recent research into Tibetan history, doctrine, and culture available for both academic researchers and for students in college classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tibetan History Reader,'' Edited by Kurtis Schaeffer and Gray Tuttle. New York: Columbia University Press, 2013. xiii-xv.; ''Sources of Tibetan Tradition,'' Edited by Kurtis Schaeffer, Gray Tuttle, and Matthew Kapstein. New York: Columbia University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing to produce foundational texts for classroom settings, Schaeffer has recently produced a translation of a life of the Buddha written by eighteenth-century Bhutanese intellectual Tenzin Chögyel (New York: Penguin Publishing, 2015). This work not only provides a clear translation of the Buddha's life narrative with helpful explanatory notes, but also includes an introduction by Schaeffer exploring the stylized format of the Buddha's life narrative and its potential to contain multiple interpretations of the Buddha's ontological identity.&lt;ref&gt;Chögyel, Tenzin. ''The Life of the Buddha,'' Translated by Kurtis Schaeffer. New York: Penguin Publishing, 2015. i-v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond monographs and edited volumes, Schaeffer has also written a number of academic papers and encyclopedia articles.

The [[oil painting]] depicts Picasso's mistress and muse, [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], asleep with a book upon her lap. The painting led to the breakup of Picasso's marriage to [[Olga Khokhlova]] after she saw it at a retrospective exhibition and realised that the facial features were not her own. The painting went to auction in 1989 and in 1996, where it failed to sell. In January 2011, it was announced that ''La Lecture'' would be going to auction on 8 February. The painting, which had not been seen in Europe since the exhibition, was then displayed at [[Sotheby's]] in Paris.

==Background==
Picasso met [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] in 1927 as she exited the Paris Metro and they later began a relationship, which they kept secret because she was only seventeen and Picasso was married to [[Olga Khokhlova]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12333330|title=Picasso painting La Lecture up for auction|date=1 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 February 2011 &lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAuRXEGg|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until he painted ''La Lecture'', Picasso often embedded some of Walter's features in the backgrounds of his other works.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; When ''La Lecture'' was exhibited at a Picasso retrospective, Khokhlova realised that her husband was in a relationship with another woman after noticing that the facial features in the painting were not hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/art-culture/Picassos-portrait-of-his-mistress-to-fetch-millions/articleshow/7403518.cms|title=Picasso's portrait of his mistress to fetch millions|date=1 February 2011|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended her marriage to Picasso shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Walter later inspired other Picasso works including ''[[Le Rêve (Picasso)|Le Rêve]]'', which Picasso painted in the same month as ''La Lecture'', and ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]''.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; On Walter's influence on Picasso and his work, ''The Art Wolf'' said "Marie-Thérès's potent mix of physical attractiveness and sexual naivety had an intoxicating effect on Picasso, and his rapturous desire for her brought about a number of images that are among the most sought after of his long career."&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/picasso-lecture-en.htm|title='La Lecture', a Picasso portrait of his muse Marie-Thérèse, to be auctioned in London|date=18 January 2011|publisher=The Art Wolf|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Picasso painted ''La Lecture'' from December 1931 to its completion in January 1932 during, what art experts have named, his "lovestruck period."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/01/20/erotic-picasso-work-tops-sotheby-auction/|title=Erotic Picasso work tops Sotheby's auction|publisher=[[Euronews]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is oil on panel and is 65.5 by 51 centimeters.&lt;ref name="ChinaC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/cultureexpress/20110121/103450.shtml|title=Picasso's "La Lecture" to be sold in Pairs|date=21 January 2011|publisher=[[China Central Television]]|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wBG9LxJq|archivedate=1 February 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso has used bright colours, including yellow and green, to depict a nude Walter asleep in a chair with a book in her lap.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/17/picasso-sothebys-la-lecture-auction|title=Picasso to make biggest impression at Sotheby's sale|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=17 January 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAw4FHLR|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Brown of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the book in Walter's lap is a "sexual symbol" and the painting has been described as being sensual, erotic and happy.&lt;ref name="EuroNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704754304576095693496901786?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Making a Big Impression|last=Studer|first=Margaret|date=28 January 2011|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the painting and Picasso, Philip Hook from Sotheby's said "In the early 1930s he was very lyrically in love and reflected that in these gorgeous colors, and lovely compositions. This period is just about the most desirable of all Picasso's (periods), certainly in market terms."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; As Picasso painted ''La Lecture'' just days apart from ''La Rêve'', the two paintings are very similar in composition.&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"/&gt;

==Auctions==
The painting was auctioned in 1989 and it sold for [[United States dollar|$]]5.8 million.&lt;ref name="LongFaces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long-faces-at-ny-art-houses-1345237.html|title=Long faces at NY art houses|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=2 May 1996|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wB97KYUt|archivedate=1 February 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''La Lecture'' went to auction again at [[Christie's]] in New York.

Alsdorf.&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"/&gt;

In January 2011, it was announced that ''La Lecture'' would be included in an Impressionist and Modern art sale by [[Sotheby's]] in London on 8 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23917491-three-sothebys-art-auctions-expected-to-raise-pound-150m.do|title=Three Sotheby's art auctions expected to raise £150m|last=Blunden|first=Mark|date=26 January 2011|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|publisher=Evening Standard Ltd|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was being sold by an American collector.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt; Ahead of the auction, ''La Lecture'', which had not been seen in Europe since the Picasso retrospective, went on display in Paris.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The painting was estimated to fetch between £12–18 million and Helena Newman from Sotheby's said that the painting will "excite a lot of interest."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; On 8 February, ''La Lecture'' was sold in six minutes to an anonymous telephone bidder for £25.2 million ($40.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12400465|title=Picasso painting La Lecture fetches £25m at auction|date=9 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to distinguish an installation from a sculpture (this may not apply to every installation) is to try to imagine it in a different space. If the objects present difficulties in a different space than the original, it is probably an installation.

'''Mapback''' is a term used by [[paperback]] collectors to refer to the earliest paperback books published by [[Dell Books]], beginning in 1943.  The books are known as mapbacks because the back cover of the book contains a map that illustrates the location of the action.  Dell books were numbered in series.  Mapbacks extend from #5 to at least #550; then maps became less of a fixed feature of the books and disappeared entirely in 1951.  (Numbers 1 through 4 had no map, although a later re-publication of #4, ''[[The American Gun Mystery]]'' by [[Ellery Queen]], added a map.)  The occasional number in the series between #5 and #550 contains no map, but some sort of full-page graphic or text connected with the book's contents.  

The artwork of the maps began with quite detailed maps, and later numbers contain more stylized ones.  "The back cover map was very popular with readers and remains popular with collectors ... the Dell 'mapbacks' are among the most well known vintage paperbacks."&lt;ref&gt;Canja, Jeff (2002).  ''Collectable Paperback Books: A new vintage paperback price reference (Second edition)''.  East Lansing, MI: Glenmoor Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dell's most memorable design innovation was not on the front but on the back covers ... the entire back covers given over to maps, or variously charts, blueprints, or what have you to represent story locale or scene of the crime: a stretch of California highway, the interior of an apartment, a sheik's 'city of stones.'  It was an enjoyable if slightly goofy gimmick and, amazingly, managed to last nearly ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Server, Lee (1994).  ''Over My Dead Body: The Sensational Age of the American Paperback: 1945-1955''. San Francisco: Chronicle Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==
"Besides distinctive front covers and back-cover maps, Dell paperbacks also had a number of other interesting features, including an "eye-in-keyhole" logo, front-cover blurbs, character lists, lists of key items or events in the book ("tantalizer-pages"), crowded title pages, and special chapter titles."&lt;ref&gt;Lyles, William H (1983). ''Putting Dell on the Map: A History of the Dell Paperbacks''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers, including Dell, thoughtfully included brief lists of the main characters in their books -- especially in mysteries -- to allow readers to keep the characters straight.  In mapbacks, "Persons this Mystery is about" followed the inside flyleaf, and gave a short descriptive paragraph.  For instance, the protagonist of the mapback shown at right is described as follows:
:"'''Rogan Kincaid''', a gambler, tall, lean, enigmatic and attractive to women, believes there is a logical explanation for everything, but is ready to change his mind after witnessing some of the goings-on at Cabrioun, an isolated hunting lodge near the Canadian border."

The "tantalizer-pages" contained two features meant to entice the browsing reader.  "What this Mystery is about" gives a list of clues and events that are found within.  Those from ''[[Rim of the Pit]]'' include:
:"A dead man's VOICE floating on the wind across a lonely, frozen lake ... An encased ACCORDION playing a dead man's favorite song ... A SEANCE in an isolated lodge at which a medium is forced by her second husband to summon the spirit of her first husband ... A terrifying THING which seems to take possession of a man ... FOOTPRINTS which seem to begin nowhere; end nowhere ... A weird, flying, manlike CREATURE ... A SILVER BULLET molded by a half-crazed man ... Horrible MURDER, apparently unsolvable, of a supernatural origin."

And the enticing section, "Wouldn't you like to Know --"
* What made a Great Dane suddenly leap to his feet during the seance, growl and quiver in fear?
* Why the appearance of the hideous apparition caused such obvious terror in the medium?
* How a man escaped from a strongly barricaded room?
* What a windigo is?
* The significance of the words "net" and "emit" on the inside of an envelope?
* Why all the mirrors in the dead woman's room were smashed?

Of course, non-mysteries had somewhat less tantalizing clues and questions, but the same format was kept.  The "List of Exciting Chapters" featured chapter titles which were frequently added or changed by Dell editors.

==Types of mapbacks==
Mapbacks were primarily mysteries, but many different sorts of books found their way into this inclusive line.  A few oddities were published without a map on the back cover.  Dell "War Books" such as #26, ''The Raft'' and #32, ''This Time For Keeps'', had back covers which exhorted the reader to "Buy War Bonds and Stamps", as did books of jokes and cartoons such as #38, ''Liberty Laughs'' and #77, ''G.I. Jokes''.  The rarest mapback of all is #278, ''Second Dell Book of Crossword Puzzles'' edited by Kathleen Rafferty, also map-less.  

Two other genres which had a number of entries in the mapback line were romances and Westerns.  Romances were not frequent, and were by "name" authors such as [[Faith Baldwin]] (#116, ''Honor Bound'') and [[Mary Renault]] (#189, ''Kind Are Her Answers''), only occasionally descending to the level of the "nurse romance".  The quality of Westerns was also generally high, including authors such as [[William MacLeod Raine]] (#179, ''Trail's End'') and Bliss Lomax (Harry Sinclair Drago) (#271, ''Gunsmoke and Trail Dust'').  

There are a number of [[movie tie-in (book)|movie tie-in]] novels in the series.  One of the most significant is #262, ''Rope'' as by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] -- actually written by Don Ward -- with a cover featuring [[James Stewart]].  The second mapback edition of [[Gerald Butler (author)|Gerald Butler]]'s ''Kiss The Blood Off My Hands'' is published as ''The Unafraid'', with a cover photograph of [[Joan Fontaine]] and [[Burt Lancaster]].  Other novels in the series are those upon which well-known films were based, although without movie tie-in covers -- these include ''Tugboat Annie'', ''The Sheik'', ''Now, Voyager'', ''The Harvey Girls'' and Mary Roberts Rinehart's ''The Bat''.  

But by far the largest number of mapbacks is made up of mysteries.  The mapback series contains some significant first editions ("first as such") by famous authors such as [[Dashiell Hammett]], and interesting editions of such authors as [[Rex Stout]] (''[[:Image:Stout-TMC-3.jpg|Too Many Cooks]]'' #45; ''[[Some Buried Caesar|The Red Bull]]'' #70), [[Agatha Christie]], [[Cornell Woolrich]], [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] writing as A. A. Fair, [[John Dickson Carr]] and his alter ego Carter Dickson, and [[Ellery Queen]].  There are editions of other mysteries which have stood the test of time and are still considered moderately significant today, such as the works of [[Phoebe Atwood Taylor]] (under her own name and as Alice Tilton), [[Patricia Wentworth]], [[Stuart Palmer]], [[Clayton Rawson]], [[Earl Derr Biggers]], [[Patricia McGerr]], [[Baynard Kendrick]], [[Margaret Millar]], [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]], [[C. W. Grafton]] (father of [[Sue Grafton]]) and many others.  

The Dell mapback line also contains a number of mysteries by writers who have fallen out of favor over the years -- or who were never popular.  Collectors cherish the [[Camp (style)|camp]] value of such mysteries as ''Murder Wears Mukluks'' by Eunice Mays Boyd, ''The Body That Wasn't Uncle'' by George Worthing Yates, and ''Death Wears a White Gardenia'' by Zelda Popkin.

The mapback line is also notable for what it does not contain -- mapbacks never partook of two popular trends in the 1950s that flourished at other paperback houses, namely the "lesbian confession" novel and the "juvenile delinquent" or "juvie" novel.

'''Margarete Emilie Charlotte Steffin''' (21 March 1908, [[Rummelsburg]], now part of [[Berlin]] – 4 June 1941, [[Moscow]]) was a German actress and writer, one of [[Bertold Brecht]]'s closest collaborators, as well as a prolific translator from Russian and [[Scandinavian languages]].

Born to a proletarian family, at the age of fourteen she went to work for the phone company but her interest in Social Democratic politics got her fired.  She worked in publishing and [[agitprop theatre]], and became secretary of the party's [[Lehreverband]] (1930) and worked at the ''Rote Revue''.  In 1931, she took a diction class from Brecht's wife [[Helene Weigel]] and became his lover.  She was introduced to the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]], playing a maid in ''[[The Mother (Brecht play)|Die Mutter]]'' (1932).

In 1933 Brecht and Weigel went into exile in Denmark.   Though soon replaced as Brecht's lover by [[Ruth Berlau]], Steffin entered an arranged marriage to a Danish citizen to stay as Brecht's secretary and followed the Brechts to Finland and Moscow when war broke out.   She died from [[tuberculosis]] (diagnosed already in 1931) while awaiting an American visa.   Brecht wrote six short poems on hearing of her death, eventually published together as ''Nach dem Tod meiner Mitarbeiterin M. S.''  The second reads:

My general is fallen&lt;br /&gt;
My soldier is fallen

My pupil has left&lt;br /&gt;
My teacher has left

My nurse is gone&lt;br /&gt;
My nursling is gone.

Brecht's 1955 ''Collected Works'' names Steffin as the collaborator on ''[[Round Heads and Pointed Heads|Roundheads and Peakheads]]'', ''[[Señora Carrar's Rifles]]'' and ''[[The Horatians and the Curiatians]]''.   In addition Brecht acknowledged her role in ''[[Fear and Misery in the Third Reich]]'', ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' and ''[[Mother Courage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;letter to [[Erwin Piscator]], 27 May 1940&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also thought to have had a large hand in ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]'',  ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'',  ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', and ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]''.

Steffin also corresponded with [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Arnold Zweig]].&lt;ref&gt;Steffin, Margarete: Briefe an berühmte Männer, Hamburg : Europ. Verl.-Anst., 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mirsky's Worst of the Web''' ('''WOTW''') was a [[website]] devoted to showcasing what David Mirsky, a former ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' writer, considered "the worst web sites ever". WOTW was the first well-trafficked site to feature "bad" web sites for entertainment purposes.  His commentary was short on constructive criticism and long on insulting the web site layout, content and graphics, and sometimes the web designers themselves.

WOTW was created by Mirsky in January 1995, in response to sites such as [[Glenn Davis (web design)|Glenn Davis]]'s ''[[Cool Site of the Day]]''.&lt;ref name=arbiters&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Arbiters of Cool | work = Internet Underground Online | accessdate = 2011-12-18 | date = December 1995 | url = http://underground-online.troybrophy.com/iu/archive/issue1/arbiters/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The format was simple: three days a week, Mirsky would select about three new sites, providing links and one-sentence comments that were "acidic, addictive, and insanely funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|last=Hargraves |first=John |title=Laughs from the past |accessdate=2011-12-18 |url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/comedy_circuit/heres_webcomedy.html |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220225131/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/comedy_circuit/heres_webcomedy.html |archivedate=February 20, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, at least, this was a paid job, supported by web service provider Volant.

The site's tagline was "If it isn't Mirsky's then it isn't  the worst!"

An article about the site gives some of its flavor:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Best of the Bad |first= Claudia |last= Montague |date= July–August 1995 |magazine= Marketing Tools |url= http://www.demographics.com/publications/MT/95_mt/9507_mt/MT297.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19970811105726/http://www.demographics.com/publications/MT/95_mt/9507_mt/MT297.htm |archivedate= 1997-08-11 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|There's a page with fuzzy photos celebrating the (unremarkable) renovation of a restaurant's dining room, which neglects to give the restaurant's name anywhere except in the small-print hypertext links at the bottom. There's one detailing a hamster's courageous but ultimately unsuccessful battle against tuberculosis (thankfully unillustrated). And there's a page for a surgical instrument supplier with nothing on it but the cover of the Fall catalog, featuring a shot of an intrusive-looking piece of equipment superimposed over an outdoor scene, and the caption, "Reaching New Horizons" ("Maybe the manufacturers are subtly hinting that it can also be used for fishing," Mirsky cracks.)}}

According to several interviews, Mirsky expected WOTW to lead to money-making opportunities, and grew frustrated with maintaining it because it never did.  On November 1, 1996, Mirsky stopped producing WOTW.&lt;ref name=NetSlaves&gt;{{Cite news | last = NetSlaves | title = Content Pioneer Recovers | work = Wired | accessdate = 2011-12-18 | date = 2000-03-03 | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/03/34699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurolinguistics''' is the study of the [[Neuron|neural]] mechanisms in the [[human brain]] that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of [[language]]. As an interdisciplinary field, neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication disorder]]s and [[neuropsychology]].  Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language.  Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], [[electrophysiology]], and [[computer modeling]].&lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|History of the brain|Neuroscience#History|History of neuroimaging|Cognitive science#History}}
Neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of [[aphasiology]], the study of linguistic deficits ([[aphasia]]s) occurring as the result of [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt;  Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing.&lt;ref name="kamil"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tlumaczenia-angielski.info/linguistics/neurolinguistics.htm | title=Neurolinguistics | accessdate=31 January 2009 | date=12 August 2007 | first=Kamil | last=Wiśniewski | work=Język angielski online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was [[Paul Broca]],&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last1=Phillips | first1=Colin |author2=Kuniyoshi L. Sakai | year=2005 | url=http://mind.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Sakai_Lab_files/Staff/KLS_Paper/KLS2005.pdf | title=Language and the brain | encyclopedia=Yearbook of Science and Technology | publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishers | pages=166&amp;ndash;169}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[French people|French]] surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or ''lesions'') on the left [[frontal lobe]], in an area now known as [[Broca's area]]. [[Phrenology|Phrenologists]] had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship,&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="muskingum"/&gt; and has been described as "epoch-making"&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1982.html | accessdate=25 January 2009 | title=Pierre Paul Broca | work=[[Who Named It?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "pivotal"&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Brain | year=2007 | url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/130/5/1432 | title=Paul Broca's historic cases: high resolution MR imaging of the brains of Leborgne and Lelong | doi=10.1093/brain/awm042 | last1=Dronkers | first1=N.F. |author2=O.

Later, [[Carl Wernicke]], after whom [[Wernicke's area]] is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the [[Motor system|motor]] production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension.&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kamil"/&gt;  The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain.&lt;ref name="muskingum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/broca.htm | title=Pierre-Paul Broca | accessdate=25 January 2009 | publisher=[[Muskingum College]] | date=May 2000 | last=Teter | first=Theresa | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205094518/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/broca.htm | archivedate=5 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of [[Korbinian Brodmann]], who "mapped" the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's [[cytoarchitecture]] (cell structure) and function;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/CMSD%20320/362unit4.html | publisher=[[California State University, Chico]] | title=CMSD 620 Neuroanatomy of Speech, Swallowing and Language | work=Neuroscience on the Web | year=2008 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | first=Patrick | last=McCaffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; these areas, known as [[Brodmann areas]], are still widely used in neuroscience today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.springer.com/biomed/neuroscience/book/978-0-387-26917-7 | accessdate=22 February 2009 | title=Brodmann's | first=Laurence | last=Garey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coining of the term "neurolinguistics" is attributed to Edith Crowell Trager, Henri Hecaen and Alexandr Luria, in the late 1940s and 1950s; Luria's book "Problems in Neurolinguistics" is likely the first book with Neurolinguistics in the title. Harry Whitaker popularized neurolinguistics in the United States in the 1970s, founding the journal "Brain and Language" in 1974.&lt;ref name="Peng 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Peng | first=F.C.C. | year=1985 | title=What is neurolinguistics? | journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics | volume=1 | issue=1 | doi=10.1016/S0911-6044(85)80003-8 | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics, in recent years the field has broadened considerably, thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]]) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ([[EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]]), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks;&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Colin M.; and Peter Hagoort (1999).  "The cognitive neuroscience of language." in Brown &amp; Hagoort, ''The Neurocognition of Language.'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weisler293"/&gt; electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], a brain response shown to be sensitive to [[Semantics|semantic]] issues in language comprehension.&lt;ref name="hagoort unification20"&gt;{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | title=How the brain solves the binding problem for language: a neurocomputational model of syntactic processing | journal=NeuroImage | volume=20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.013 | pmid=14597293 | pages=S18–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall274&gt;{{cite book | title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics | last=Hall | first=Christopher J | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWspkUKj274C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=neurolinguistics+and+psycholinguistics | page=274 | year=2005 | isbn=0-8264-8734-3 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The N400 was the first language-relevant [[event-related potential]] to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.&lt;ref name=neurocognition280&gt;Hagoort, Peter; Colin M.

{{Linguistics}}

===Interaction with other fields===
Neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of [[psycholinguistics]], which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of [[experimental psychology]]; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.&lt;ref name=Hall274/&gt;&lt;ref name="hagoort unification"&gt;{{cite journal | year=2003 | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | title=How the brain solves the binding problem for language: a neurocomputational model of syntactic processing | journal=NeuroImage | volume=20 | pages=S19&amp;ndash;S20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.013 | pmid=14597293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists.  In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms.&lt;ref name="pylkannen slides"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is neurolinguistics? | last=Pylkkänen | first=Liina | accessdate=31 January 2009 | url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/pylkkanen/Neural_Bases/01_Intro.pdf |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, experiments in [[sentence processing]] have used the [[ELAN (neuroscience)|ELAN]], [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], and [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]] brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as [[Janet Dean Fodor|Janet Fodor]] and [[Lyn Frazier]]'s "serial" model,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite journal | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | volume=6 | issue=2 | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. | year=2002 | title=Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01839-8 | pages=78}}, which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of Fodor and Frazier's model.&lt;/ref&gt; and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's "unification model".&lt;ref name="hagoort unification"/&gt;  Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by "generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure".&lt;ref&gt;Weisler (1999), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics considered===
Neurolinguistics research investigates several topics, including where language information is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning, and how neurophysiology can contribute to [[speech and language pathology]].

====Localizations of language processes====
Much work in neurolinguistics has, like Broca's and Wernicke's early studies, investigated the locations of specific language "[[Language module|modules]]" within the brain.  Research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Opinion: The cortical organization of speech processing | last1=Hickock | first1=Gregory |author2=David Poeppel | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n5/abs/nrn2113.html | volume=8 | year=2007 | issue=5 | pmid=17431404 | doi=10.1038/nrn2113 | pages=393&amp;ndash;402}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information,&lt;ref name=embicketal&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/11/6150.abstract?ck=nck | title=A syntactic specialization for Broca's area | last1=Embick | first1=David |author2=Alec Marantz; Yasushi Miyashita; Wayne O'Neil; Kuniyoshi L. Sakai | year=2000 | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume=97 | pmid=10811887 | issue=11 | pmc=18573 | pages=6150&amp;ndash;6154 | doi=10.1073/pnas.100098897}}&lt;/ref&gt; how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Colin M.; and Peter Hagoort (1999). "The cognitive neuroscience of language." in Brown &amp; Hagoort. ''The Neurocognition of Language''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and how the locations of brain activation differs when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.&lt;ref name=wangetal/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=brainBriefings_thebilingualbrain | publisher=[[Society for Neuroscience]] |date=February 2008 | accessdate=1 February 2009 | work=Brain Briefings | title=The Bilingual Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Time course of language processes====
Another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time.&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt;  The temporal ordering of specific [[Event-related potential#ERP Components Nomenclature|patterns of in brain activity]] may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the [[ELAN (neuroscience)|ELAN]], [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], and [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]]) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.&lt;ref name="friederici2002"/&gt;

====Language acquisition====
Another topic is the relationship between brain structures and [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Caplan (1987), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as [[babbling]]), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development,&lt;ref name="caplan12"&gt;Caplan (1987), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; while other research investigates the physical changes (known as [[neuroplasticity]]) that the brain undergoes during [[second language acquisition]], when adults learn a new language.&lt;ref name=sereno&gt;{{cite book | title=Language Experience in Second Language Speech Learning | editor=Ocke-Schwen Bohn |editor2=Murray J. Munro | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | location=Philadelphia | year=2007 | chapter=Behavioral and cortical effects of learning a second language: The acquisition of tone | last1=Sereno | first1=Joan A |author2=Yue Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuroplasticity is observed when both Second Language acquisition and Language Learning experience are induced, the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children, young adults and the elderly.

Cortex: A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System &amp; Behavior, 410.1016/j.cortex.2014.05.00124996640

====Language pathology====
Neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as [[aphasia]] and [[dyslexia]], and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.&lt;ref name="LSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caplan12"/&gt;

==Technology used==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=PET-image.jpg|image2=Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|width=150|caption2=Images of the brain recorded with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] (top) and [[fMRI]] (bottom). In the PET image, the red areas are the most active. In the fMRI image, the yellowest areas are the areas that show the greatest difference in activation between two tasks (watching a moving stimulus, versus watching a black screen).}}
Since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics. Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions.&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Linguistic Society of America]] | last=Menn | first=Lise | accessdate=18 December 2008 | title=Neurolinguistics | url=http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-neuro.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into [[hemodynamic]] methods, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.

===Hemodynamic===
{{Main|Neuroimaging}}
Hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in what is known as the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response).&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ward | first=Jamie | year=2006 | chapter=The imaged brain | title=The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience | isbn=1-84169-534-3 | publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such techniques include [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]].  These techniques provide high ''spatial resolution'', allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain;&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt; ''temporal resolution'' (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing.&lt;ref name="weisler293"&gt;Weisler (1999), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kutas"&gt;{{cite journal | year=2002 | volume=4 | issue=12 | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | last1=Kutas | first1=Marta |author2=Kara D. Federmeier | title=Electrophysiology reveals memory use in language comprehension}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations,&lt;ref name=embicketal/&gt;&lt;ref name="friederici2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Friederici | first=Angela D. | year=2002 | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | title=Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=78&amp;ndash;84 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.&lt;ref name=wangetal&gt;{{cite journal | year=2003 |author1=Wang Yue |author2=Joan A. Sereno; Allard Jongman; and Joy Hirsch | title=fMRI evidence for cortical modification during learning of Mandarin lexical tone | pmid=14614812 | journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume=15 | issue=7 | pages=1019&amp;ndash;1027 | doi=10.1162/089892903770007407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sereno/&gt;

In addition to PET and fMRI, which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas,&lt;ref name=Filler1992&gt;Filler AG, Tsuruda JS, Richards TL, Howe FA: Images, apparatus, algorithms and methods. GB 9216383, UK Patent Office, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; thus providing insight into how different areas interact. [[Functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.&lt;ref name="dieleretal2011"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ana Inés | last=Ansaldo | first2=Karima | last2=Kahlaoui | first3=Yves | last3=Joanette | title=Functional near-infrared spectroscopy: Looking at the brain and language mystery from a different angle | journal=Brain and Language | year=2011 | volume=121 | issue=2, number 2 |pages=77–8 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2012.03.001| pmid=22445199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrophysiological===

Electrophysiological techniques take advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons in the brain fire together, they create an [[Dipole|electric dipole]] or current.  The technique of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] measures this electric current using sensors on the scalp, while [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] measures the magnetic fields that are generated by these currents.&lt;ref name="tracking"/&gt; In addition to these non-invasive methods, [[electrocorticography]] has also been used to study language processing. These techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next, providing excellent ''temporal resolution'', which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production.&lt;ref name="tracking"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | year=2003 | volume=7 | issue=5 | title=Tracking the time course of word recognition with MEG | last1=Pylkkänen | first1=Liina |author2=[[Alec Marantz]] | pages=187&amp;ndash;189 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00092-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in EEG;&lt;ref name="kutas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van petten?"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Van Petten | first=Cyma | last2=Luka | first2=Barbara | title=Neural localization of semantic context effects in electromagnetic and hemodynamic studies | year=2006 | journal=Brain and Language | volume=97 | page=281 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2005.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, this technique is used primarily to ''how'' language processes are carried out, rather than ''where''.  Research using EEG and MEG generally focuses on [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs),&lt;ref name="kutas"/&gt; which are distinct brain responses (generally realized as negative or positive peaks on a graph of neural activity) elicited in response to a particular stimulus.  Studies using ERP may focus on each ERP's ''latency'' (how long after the stimulus the ERP begins or peaks), ''amplitude'' (how high or low the peak is), or ''topography'' (where on the scalp the ERP response is picked up by sensors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/Rugg-ColesChp1.pdf | chapter=Event-related brain potentials: an introduction | year=1996 | title=Electrophysiology of Mind | pages=1&amp;ndash;27 | publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online Monographs |author2=Michael D.

==Experimental design==

===Experimental techniques===
Neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain.  These techniques include the ''subtraction'' paradigm, ''[[Mismatch negativity|mismatch]] design'', ''violation-based'' studies, various forms of ''[[Priming (psychology)|priming]]'', and ''direct stimulation'' of the brain.

====Subtraction====
Many language studies, particularly in [[fMRI]], use the subtraction paradigm,&lt;ref name="Grabowski"&gt;Grabowski, T., and Damasio, A." (2000). Investigating language with functional neuroimaging. ''San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press. 14'', 425-461.&lt;/ref&gt; in which brain activation in a task thought to involve some aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processing&amp;mdash;the processing of real words), or activations while participants read [[syntax|syntactically]] complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.

====Mismatch paradigm====
{{Main|Mismatch negativity}}
The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a rigorously documented ERP component frequently used in neurolinguistic experiments.&lt;ref name="pulvermulleretal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Syntax as a reflex: neurophysiological evidence for the early automaticity of syntactic processing | journal=Brain and Language | year=2008 | volume=104 | issue=3 | pmid=17624417 | last1=Pulvermüller |first1=Friedemann |author2=Yury Shtyrov; Anna S.

====Violation-based====
[[File:ComponentsofERP.svg|right|thumb|An [[event-related potential]]]]
Many studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or ''violations'' of [[Syntax|syntactic]] or [[Semantics|semantic]] rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *''the garden was on the worked'',&lt;ref&gt;Example from Frisch et al. (2004: 195).&lt;/ref&gt; which violates an English [[phrase structure rule]], often elicit a brain response called the [[early left anterior negativity]] (ELAN).&lt;ref name="frisch194"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Frisch | first1=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne; Angela D. Friederici | title=Word category and verb&amp;ndash;argument structure information in the dynamics of parsing | year=2004 | journal=Cognition | pmid=15168895 | volume=91 | issue=3 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.09.009 | pages=191–219 [194]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violation techniques have been in use since at least 1980,&lt;ref name="frisch194"/&gt; when Kutas and Hillyard first reported [[Event-related potential|ERP]] evidence that [[semantic]] violations elicited an N400 effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kutas | first1=M. |author2=S.A.

Holcomb | year=1992 | title=Event-related Potentials Elicited by Grammatical Anomalies | journal=Psychophysiological Brain Research | pages=299–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies (fMRI and PET): Embick and colleagues, for example, used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fMRI.&lt;ref name=embicketal/&gt; Another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations in the same sentence and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how [[Syntax|syntactic]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] processes interact while people read or hear sentences.&lt;ref name="martin-loeches"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Brain Research | year=2006 | title=Semantics prevalence over syntax during sentence processing: a brain potential study of noun–adjective agreement in Spanish | pmid=16678138  | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.03.094| first1=Manuel | last1=Martín-Loeches |author2=Roland Nigbura; Pilar Casadoa; Annette Hohlfeldc; Werner Sommer | volume= 1093| issue=1 | pages=178&amp;ndash;189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frisch195"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Frisch | first1=Stefan |author2=Anja Hahne; Angela D.

====Priming====
{{Main|Priming (psychology)}}
In psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, ''priming'' refers to the phenomenon whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly if he or she has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning&lt;ref name="athabasca"/&gt; or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts).&lt;ref name="fiorentino"/&gt; If a subject is presented with a "prime" word such as ''doctor'' and then a "target" word such as ''nurse'', if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to ''nurse'' then the experimenter may assume that word ''nurse'' in the brain had already been accessed when the word ''doctor'' was accessed.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt; Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain&lt;ref name="fiorentino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devlin"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Morphology and the internal structure of words | year=2004 |last1=Devlin |first1=Joseph T. |author2=Helen L.

====Stimulation====
[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), a new noninvasive&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/MY00185/DSECTION=risks | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation - Risks | accessdate=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique for studying brain activity, uses powerful magnetic fields that are applied to the brain from outside the head.&lt;ref name="nami"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/Helpline1/Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation_(rTMS).htm | title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) | publisher=[[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] | accessdate=15 December 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108093742/http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/Helpline1/Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation_(rTMS).htm | archivedate=8 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location, and thus is able to imitate aphasic symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which parts of the brain will be examined.&lt;ref name="nami"/&gt;  As such, it is a less invasive alternative to [[Electrocorticography#DCES|direct cortical stimulation]], which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject's scalp be removed, and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation (such as individuals undergoing surgery for [[epilepsy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Neurosurgery | title=Neurons in human epileptic cortex. Response to direct cortical stimulation | year=1981 | volume=55 | issue=6 | pages=904&amp;ndash;8 | author1=A.R. Wyler |author2=A.A. Ward, Jr | pmid=7299464 | doi=10.3171/jns.1981.55.6.0904}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The logic behind TMS and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology: if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out, then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function.  Few neurolinguistic studies to date have used TMS;&lt;ref name="phillipssakai"/&gt; direct cortical stimulation and [[Electrocorticography|cortical recording]] (recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain) have been used with [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]] to make predictions about the behavior of human brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2005 | journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | last=Hagoort | first=Peter | pmid=16054419 | title=On Broca, brain, and binding: a new framework | volume=9 | issue=9 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.004 | pages=416–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject tasks===
In many neurolinguistics experiments, subjects do not simply sit and listen to or watch [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], but also are instructed to perform some sort of task in response to the stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;One common exception to this is studies using the mismatch paradigm, in which subjects are often instructed to watch a silent movie or otherwise not pay attention actively to the stimuli.  See, for example:

====Lexical decision====
{{Main|Lexical decision task}}
The [[lexical decision task]] involves subjects seeing or hearing an isolated word and answering whether or not it is a real word.  It is frequently used in [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] studies, since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word (as in "doctor" priming "nurse").&lt;ref name="athabasca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Psych355/Exp/lexical.shtml?sso=true | accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=27 June 2005 | publisher=Athatbasca University | title=Experiment Description: Lexical Decision and Semantic Priming | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208115451/http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Psych355/Exp/lexical.shtml?sso=true | archivedate=8 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorentino"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fiorentino | first1=Robert |author2=David Poeppel | title=Processing of compound words: an MEG study | journal=Brain and Language | volume=103 | year=2007 | pages=8&amp;ndash;249 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lexical integration: sequential effects of syntactic and semantic information | last1=Friederici | first1=Angela D. |author2=Karsten Steinhauer; Stefan Frisch | year=1999 | journal=Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 27 | issue=3 | pages=438–453 | doi=10.3758/BF03211539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammaticality judgment, acceptability judgment====
Many studies, especially violation-based studies, have subjects make a decision about the "acceptability" (usually [[Grammaticality|grammatical acceptability]] or [[Semantics|semantic]] acceptability) of stimuli.&lt;ref name="task effects"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yeetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Zheng Ye |author2=Yue-jia Luo; Angela D.

Experimental evidence has shown that the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects' brain responses to stimuli.  One experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the "acceptability" of sentences they did not show an [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] brain response (a response commonly associated with [[Semantics|semantic]] processing), but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences "made sense".&lt;ref name="task effects"/&gt;

====Probe verification====
Some studies use a "probe verification" task rather than an overt acceptability judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence is followed by a "probe word", and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frisch200"/&gt;  This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt;

====Truth-value judgment====
Subjects may be instructed not to judge whether or not the sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the [[proposition]] expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon | first=Peter | chapter=The Truth-Value Judgment Task | title=Methods for assessing children's syntax | url=http://faculty.tc.columbia.edu/upload/pg328/TRUTHVALUECHAPT.pdf | editor=D.

Retrieved 14 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Active distraction and double-task====
Some experiments give subjects a "distractor" task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes [[Attention|attentional resources]] to it.  For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli.  The subjects showed a [[Mismatch negativity|mismatch response]] (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attention&lt;ref name="pulvermulleretal2008"/&gt;&amp;mdash;or at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.

Another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment, in which a subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of [[working memory]] in language processing.&lt;ref name="rogalskyetal"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Broca's Area, Sentence Comprehension, and Working Memory: An fMRI Study | last1=Rogalsky | first1=Corianne |author2=William Matchin; Gregory Hickok | journal=[[Frontiers Research Foundation|Frontiers in Human Neuroscience]] | year=2008 | pages=14 | volume=2 | pmid=18958214 | pmc=2572210 | doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Mellon''' (June 11, 1907 &amp;ndash; February 1, 1999) was an American philanthropist and an owner/[[horse breeding|breeder]] of [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]].  He is one of only five people ever designated an "Exemplar of Racing" by the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]]. He was co-heir to one of America's greatest business fortunes, derived from the [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] created by his grandfather [[Thomas Mellon]], his father [[Andrew W. Mellon]], and his father's brother [[Richard B. Mellon]]. In 1957, when ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' prepared its first list of the [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)|wealthiest Americans]], it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister [[Ailsa Mellon-Bruce]], and his cousins [[Sarah Mellon]] and [[Richard King Mellon]], were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each (around ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|400000000|1957|r=-8}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|700000000|1957|r=-8}}}} in today's dollars).

Mellon's autobiography, ''Reflections in a Silver Spoon'', was published in 1992. He died at his home, Oak Spring, in [[Upperville, Virginia]], on February 1, 1999. He was survived by his wife, [[Rachel Lambert Mellon|Rachel]] (a.k.a. Bunny), his children, Catherine Conover (first wife of [[John Warner]]) and [[Timothy Mellon]], and two stepchildren, Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza, Viscountess Moore.

==Biography==
Paul Mellon was the son of [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|US Secretary of the Treasury]] from 1921 to 1932, and Nora McMullen of Hertfordshire and brother of Ailsa Mellon-Bruce. He graduated from [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], in 1925, where he wrote for the literary magazine and composed the school hymn. He then went on to graduate from [[Yale College]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. At Yale, he was a member of [[Chi Psi]] Fraternity, [[Scroll and Key]] and served as vice-chairman of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]''. He was a great benefactor of his alma maters, donating to the Forbes-Mellon Library at the [[University of Cambridge]], the Mellon Arts Center and the Mellon (now Icahn) Science Center to Choate, two residential colleges, and the [[Yale Center for British Art]].

After graduating from [[Yale]], he went to England to study at the [[University of Cambridge]], receiving a BA in 1931, while his father served as the US Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]] from 1932 to 1933. In 1930, he was a founding member, alongside Sir Timothy William Gowers, of the CRABS, the Clare Rugby And Boating Society (the oldest of the collegiate Gentlemen's societies still active). In 1938, he received an [[Oxbridge MA]] from [[Clare College, Cambridge]]. He was a major benefactor to Clare College's Forbes-Mellon Library, opened in 1986.

===Marriage and military service===
[[File:Paul Mellon, by William Orpen (1878-1931).jpg|thumb|Paul Mellon ([[William Orpen]], 1924)]]

Mellon returned to [[Pittsburgh]], to work for [[Mellon Financial Corporation|Mellon Bank]] and other businesses for six months. In 1935, he married Mary Conover Brown and the couple, who had two children, Catherine and [[Timothy Mellon|Timothy]], moved to [[Virginia]].

He enrolled at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in 1940 but six months later joined the [[United States Army]], asking to join the [[cavalry]]. Mellon served with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in Europe. He rose to the rank of [[major]] and was the recipient of four [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

After his wife Mary's death in 1946 from an [[asthma]] attack, he married [[Rachel Lambert Mellon|Rachel Lambert Lloyd]], known as "Bunny", the former wife of [[Stacy Barcroft Lloyd Jr]]. She was a descendant of the Lambert family who formulated and marketed [[Listerine]] and an heiress to the Warner-Lambert corporate fortune (Warner-Lambert is now part of [[Pfizer]], following a 2000 merger). Bunny Mellon was an avid [[horticulture|horticulturist]] and gardener, whose fondness for [[France|French]] [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting, as well as American art, Mellon came to share.&lt;ref name="Yale Center for British Art"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Mellon, Founder |publisher=Yale Center for British Art |url=http://britishart.yale.edu/about-us/paul-mellon-founder |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this marriage, he had two stepchildren: Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza Lambert Lloyd (d. 2008; who married and divorced [[Derry Moore, 12th Earl of Drogheda|Viscount Moore]]).

===Art collection===
While Mellon did not share his father's interest in business, the two found common ground in their love of art and philanthropy. Shortly before Andrew Mellon's death in 1937, construction began on the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for which Andrew Mellon had provided funds. Four years later Paul Mellon presented both the building by [[John Russell Pope]] and his father's collection of 115 paintings to the nation. He served on the museum's board for more than four decades: as trustee, as president (twice), as board chair, and as honorary trustee. Mellon commissioned [[I. M. Pei]] to build the East Building and, with his sister Ailsa, provided funds for its construction in the late 1970s. Over the years he and his wife Bunny donated more than 1,000 works to the National Gallery, among them many French and American masterworks.

In 1936, Mellon purchased his first British painting, "Pumpkin with a Stable-lad" by [[George Stubbs]], who became a lifetime favorite of Mellon's.  Beginning in the late 1950s, with the help of English art historian Basil Taylor, Mellon amassed a major collection by the mid-1960s.  London art dealer [[Geoffrey Agnew]] once said of his acquisitions: "It took an American collector to make the English look again at their own paintings."

Mellon granted his extensive collection of British art, rare books, and related materials to Yale University in the 1960s, along with the funding to create an appropriate museum to house it (designed by [[Louis Kahn]]).  He characteristically insisted that it not be named in honor of him, but rather would be called the [[Yale Center for British Art]], to encourage others to support it as well.  Mellon also provided extensive endowment support to fund not only operations but also an ongoing program of acquisitions, and he made a generous bequest to the Center at the time of his death. The [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] was founded in 1970 through a generous grant to [[Yale University]], as a London-based affiliate of the New Haven center, to encourage study of British art and culture both at the undergraduate and the research scholar levels.

Mellon also provided important leadership gifts to the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], as well as [[Choate Rosemary Hall]].

===Rokeby Stables===
Mellon owned many thoroughbred horses under his [[Rokeby Stables]], including [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Sea Hero]]. Two of his horses, [[Arts and Letters]] and [[Fort Marcy (horse)|Fort Marcy]], were named [[American Horse of the Year]] in 1969 and 1970 respectively. Both are inductees in the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]]. He also owned two European champions, [[Mill Reef]] and [[Gold and Ivory]]. Mill Reef was the #8 rated horse in the world for the 20th Century in ''A Century of Champions'', by John Randall and Tony Morris. Mellon won the [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder]] in 1971 and again in 1986.

===Establishment of philanthropic foundations===
Mellon established the Old Dominion Foundation in 1941 and the [[Bollingen Foundation]] in 1945, both to support advancement and learning of the [[humanities]] and [[liberal education]]. The Bollingen Foundation published over 100 books before closing in 1969, the same year the assets of the Old Dominion Foundation were merged into those of his sister Ailsa's Avalon Foundation. The combined organization was renamed [[The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] in honor of their father.

====Yale====
Paul Mellon's foremost philanthropic interest was his alma mater, Yale University. His most generous and well-known gifts established the [[Yale Center for British Art]], but his legacy makes itself felt across the campus.

Mellon's other major gift was to provide extensive funding to support the creation of two new undergraduate residential colleges at Yale, [[Ezra Stiles College]] and [[Morse College]]. Designed by [[Eero Saarinen]], these colleges along with the Kahn-designed British Art Center demonstrated Mellon's commitment to bringing [[modern architecture]] to Yale. Perhaps most importantly, the additional undergraduate capacity that these colleges provided were a critical prerequisite to the ability of the university to transition to co-education.

Beyond these capital gifts, Mellon endowed the deanships of each of Yale's 12 residential colleges. He created the Mellon Senior Forum program, which provides a weekly meal for seniors in each of the residential colleges where they can share progress on their senior essays and projects with one another.

Mellon was active in the humanities at Yale. He provided the funding necessary to create the [[Directed Studies at Yale University|Directed Studies program]] of intense freshman-year focus on the humanities. He supported significantly the undergraduate theater studies program, and endowed named professorships in schools throughout the University, particularly in the humanities.

====Other philanthropy====
Mellon was highly supportive of causes that advanced the preservation of horses, including the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. That organization allocates grants towards specific research projects for the safety, welfare, longevity and improvement of life for race horses.

He donated the $1 million bonus that Sea Hero won in the [[Chrysler]] [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|Triple Crown]] Challenge to the United States [[The Jockey Club|Jockey Club's]] Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. Furthermore, he requested that double that amount be raised in response to his donation. That goal was met during the 1995–1996 fiscal year. Upon his death he left yet another $2.5 million to the Foundation's endowment.

In 1999, Paul Mellon bequeathed $8 million to the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] for the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]. During his lifetime he agreed that £1 million of that sum could be allocated to the Museum's Courtyard Development and, under the terms of his Will, following his death in 1999, his Executors subsequently allocated a further $12.5 million to complete the renovations associated with the Courtyard, including the re-lighting of all of the Museum's galleries. The remaining balance was added to the Paul Mellon Fund which was established as a trust fund for the Museum at the time of the bequest, the income from which is being used to support education, exhibitions and publications.

He also helped to buy the 28,625-acre [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]] and the 1,500-acre [[Sky Meadows State Park]] in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of Virginia, where he used to go to look at the stars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/19/AR2007031901844.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a major benefactor of [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] and [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]], both in [[Cambridge]], England. Indeed, Clare Hall, founded 1966, gains much from his benefaction; his generous bequest serves the intellectual needs of the graduate college members. The Mellon Fellowship is another example of his generosity, permitting the reciprocal exchange of two students from Yale and two from Clare College for graduate study in each other's institutions.

He developed his great love of England and English culture while studying at Clare College from 1929-1931. "It was while I was at Cambridge that I embarked on the dangerous seas of collecting", Paul Mellon once said—a statement by the man who described himself as "the incurable collector" that has had profound implications for his major beneficiaries, both in the US and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/article/default.aspx?objid=36231|title=News|work=Cambridge Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon helped to arrange the merger of the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]], founded by his father Andrew W. Mellon and uncle [[Richard B. Mellon]] with [[Andrew Carnegie|Andrew Carnegie's]] [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in 1967 to create [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmu.edu/presidential-search/images/13-038_Presidential_Search_81712.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmu.edu/presidential-search/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he donated substantial funds to Carnegie Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetartan.org/2011/9/12/news/donations|title=Dietrich's donation to be one of higher education's largest|work=thetartan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Mellon was a trustee of the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] and one of the only five people ever designated an "Exemplar of Racing" by the Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]] and the [[Jockey Club|English Jockey Club Hall of Fame]].

Among honors, he was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire|Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in 1974, awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1985, and awarded the [[National Medal of Arts and Humanities]] in 1997.

In 1978, Mellon received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National - Jefferson Awards|work=Jefferson Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
*"I have been an amateur in every phase of my life; an amateur poet, an amateur scholar, an amateur horseman, an amateur farmer, an amateur soldier, an amateur connoisseur of art, an amateur publisher, and an amateur museum executive. The root of the word "amateur" is the Latin word for love, and I can honestly say that I've thoroughly enjoyed all the roles I have played." —Paul Mellon from his autobiography ''Reflections in a Silver Spoon''.&lt;ref name="Yale Center for British Art"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13067">'''Reproductive labor''' work often associated with care giving and domestic roles including cleaning, cooking, child care, and the paid domestic labor force.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vicki Smith|title=Sociology of Work: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=En-iCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1213|date=16 May 2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-2093-9|pages=1213–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has taken on a role in [[Feminist philosophy|feminist discourse and philosophy]] as a way of calling to attention to how women in particular are assigned to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] where the labor is reproductive and thus uncompensated and unrecognized in a capitalist system. These theories have evolved as a parallel of histories focusing on the entrance of women into the labor force in the 1970s, providing an intersectionalist approach that recognizes that women have been a part of the labor force since before their incorporation into mainstream industry if we consider reproductive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Mignon|title=Doing the Dirty Work : Gender, Race, and Reproductive Labor in Historical Perspective|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=21|issue=3|pages=313–336|doi=10.1177/0891243207300764|url=http://aaaaarg.fail/upload/mignon-duffy-doing-the-dirty-work-gender-race-and-reproductive-labor-in-historical-perspective.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions ==
The division between [[productive and unproductive labour]] is stressed by some [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] including [[Margaret Benston]] and Peggy Morton.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lise Vogel|title=Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKbdfZvS3_IC&amp;pg=PA17|date=7 June 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-24895-1|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories specify that while productive labor results in goods or services that have monetary value in the capitalist system and are thus compensated by the producers in the form of a paid wage, reproductive labor is associated with the private sphere and involves anything that people have to do for themselves that is not for the purposes of receiving a wage (i.e. cleaning, cooking, having children). These interpretations argue that while both forms of labor are necessary, people have different access to these forms of labor based on certain aspects of their identity.

These theories argue that both public and private institutions exploit the labor of women as an inexpensive method of supporting a work force. For the producers, this means higher profits. For the nuclear family, the power dynamic dictates that domestic work is exclusively to be completed by the woman of the household thus liberating the rest of the members from their own necessary reproductive labor. Marxist feminists argue that the exclusion of women from productive labor leads to male control in both private and public domains.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;Hartmann, H. (1981) ''The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union.'' Feminist Theory Reader, 187-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of reproductive labor as it relates to cleaning, cooking, child care, and the paid domestic labor force has been written about and discussed in writing and history prior to the term being codified. This includes works like Virginia Woolf's essay, "[[A Room of One's Own]]".

== Wages for housework ==
{{main|Wages for housework}}
Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists devoted their activism to fighting for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of creating compensated reproductive labor was present in the writings of socialists such as [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1898) who argued that women's oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere.&lt;ref name="Gilman1898"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte Perkins Gilman|title=Women and Economics: A Study of the Economic Relation Between Men and Women as a Factor in Social Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94EEAAAAYAAJ|year=1898|publisher=Small, Maynard,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman proposed that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, A. &amp; Hennessy, R. (2010). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-class/ Feminist Perspectives on Class and Work]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most influential of the efforts to compensate reproductive labor was the [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]], an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including [[Selma James]],&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;Gardiner, B. (2012). ''A Life in Writing.'' Interview with Selma James.&lt;/ref&gt; Mariarosa Dalla Costa,&lt;ref name="Costa"&gt;Dalla Costa, M. &amp; James, S. (1972). ''The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community''[https://libcom.org/library/power-women-subversion-community-della-costa-selma-james]&lt;/ref&gt; Brigitte Galtier, and [[Silvia Federici]]&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;Cox, N. &amp; Federici, S. (1975).[http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Counter-Planning_from_the_Kitchen.pdf]''Counter-Planning from the Kitchen: Wages for Housework a Perspective on Capital and the Left.''&lt;/ref&gt; published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite the efforts beginning with a relatively small group of women in Italy, The Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York with the help of Federici.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; As [[Heidi Hartmann]] acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy.&lt;ref name="Hartmann" /&gt;

[[Universal Basic Income]] has been proposed as a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = It’s Payback Time for Women|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/opinion/sunday/payback-time-for-women.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Judith|last = Shulevitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sharing reproductive labor ==
Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, [[Heidi Hartmann]] (1981) argues that these efforts "take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former."&lt;ref name="Hartmann" /&gt; Hartmann (1981) believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women's oppression as women, and instead focused on women's oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, [[Gayle Rubin]], who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature as well as anthropological studies and histories of sexual subcultures, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex"&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in which she coins the phrase "sex/gender system" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process.

More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions after gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre (1994) proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, as well as in the workplace (public sphere).&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, N. 1994. ''Who Pays for the Kids? Gender and the Structures of Constraint.'' [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3341533]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2013, Silvia Federici urges feminist movements to consider the fact that many women are now forced into productive ''and'' reproductive labor, resulting in a "[[Double burden|double day]]".&lt;ref name="Fed"&gt;Vishmid, M.(2013). ''Permanent Reproductive Crisis: An Interview with Silvia Federici'' [http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/permanent-reproductive-crisis-interview-silvia-federici]&lt;/ref&gt; Federici (2013) argues that the emancipation of women still cannot occur until they are free from their burdens of unwaged labor, which she proposes will involve institutional changes such as closing the wage gap and implementing child care programs in the workplace. Federici's (2013) suggestions are echoed in a similar interview with Selma James (2012) and these issues have been touched on in recent presidential elections.&lt;ref name="Gardiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mullin|first1=Amy|title=Reconceiving pregnancy and childcare: ethics, experience, and reproductive labor.|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36819">The '''"rhetoric of social intervention"''' ('''RSI''') '''model''' is a systemic [[communication theory]] of how human beings symbolically constitute, maintain, and change social systems (e.g., organizations, societies, and cultures). The RSI model was developed in the writings of communication theorist William R. Brown.&lt;ref name="Brown1978"&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1982"&gt;Brown, William R. (1982). Attention and the rhetoric of social intervention. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''68''(1), 17-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986"&gt;Brown, William R. (1986). Power and the rhetoric of social intervention. ''Communication Monographs,'' ''53''(2), 180-199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2010"&gt;Brown, William R. (2010). Need and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention. Eric Document ED515280.&lt;/ref&gt; The model provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting social system change and its side effects from a communication perspective. It also suggests a methodology for acting as an intervener to encourage and/or discourage social system change.&lt;ref name="OptGring"&gt;Opt, Susan K. &amp; Gring, Mark A. (2009). ''The rhetoric of social intervention: An introduction.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The model offers an alternative approach to understanding social system change by its emphasis on communication as the driver of change in contrast to models that focus on social, political, economic, and technological forces as catalysts for change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The RSI model is envisioned as three communication subsystems that function as starting points for interpreting or enacting social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The subsystems, known as attention, power, and need, form the RSI model framework.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; This entry describes the assumptive foundations of the RSI model. Then it discusses the attention, power, and need patterns of communication that that model identifies as points for generating social system change and continuity.

==RSI model foundations==
The beginnings of Brown's RSI model are reflected in three main documents—a book about [[Will Rogers]] that reports research on American dream ideology,&lt;ref name="Brown1970"&gt;Brown, William R. (1970). ''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream.'' Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a book chapter that outlines how human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolic realities,&lt;ref name="Brown1972"&gt;Brown, William R. (1972). Language and strategy. In J. Makay and W. Brown, ''The rhetorical dialogue: Contemporary concepts and cases.''(pp. 365-433) Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and a journal article in which he sketches the RSI model foundations by theorizing about the process by which human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolically constructed ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

===American Dream ideology===
''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American Dream'' was based on Brown's doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; An Oklahoman like Rogers, Brown was curious about Rogers' influence and popularity in the 1920s and 1930s. Brown researched the source of Rogers' ability to be persuasive and authoritative and concluded that it arose from Rogers' ability to embody and reflect characteristics that the U.S. public associated with the American dream.&lt;ref name="Brown1970" /&gt; The book describes American dream attributes, such as "the dream of the dignity and worth of the individual, of freedom and equality, of success, and of progress," and shows how Rogers symbolically identified with them.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1970). ''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream.'' Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brown acquired an in-depth understanding of American dream ideology, he later reported that the research left him wondering how social systems construct ideology.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To address this question, Brown began reading books and articles on language, philosophy, rhetoric, and linguistics.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

===The naming process===
A book chapter called Language and Strategy, written for ''The Rhetorical Dialogue: Contemporary Concepts and Cases,'' reflects Brown's initial investigations into the process by which human beings symbolically constitute reality, and, by extension, ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; The chapter describes how human beings learn to categorize experience symbolically and how this symbolizing activity functions rhetorically. Brown draws his ideas for what he calls the "naming" process from scholars such as rhetorical theorist [[Kenneth Burke]], philosopher [[Susanne Langer]], psycholinguist Roger Brown, and psychologists [[Jerome Bruner]], Jacqueline Goodnow, and George Austin.&lt;ref name="Burke1966"&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langer"&gt;Langer, Susanne. (1980). Philosophy in a new key: A study in the symbolism of reason, rite, and art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RogerBrown"&gt;Brown, Roger (1958). ''Words and things.'' New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruner1965"&gt;Bruner, Jerome S., Goodnow, Jacqueline J., &amp; Austin, George A. (1965). ''A study of thinking.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown, building on the ideas of Roger Brown,&lt;ref name="RogerBrown" /&gt; says that human beings learn to name, or to transform experience into symbols, from language tutors, such as parents, peers, educators, and the media. He argues that human beings create names by abstracting from experience and then classifying those abstractions as "same as" or "different from" other symbolic categorizations for experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; Brown urges that all names are incomplete—as abstractions, they simultaneously direct attention to certain parts of experience and away from other parts of experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt;

Brown suggests that all names create expectancies about experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; He argues that this enables human beings to use names rhetorically to clarify ambiguous experience, to suggest approach or avoidance behavior toward experience, and to unite and divide experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; For example, naming a person's actions as "terrorism" clarifies the experience, suggests avoidance behavior, and divides that experience from ones named "guerilla warfare."

Brown closes the chapter by outlining what he calls the "rhetorical reasoning" process by which human beings advocate for their particular ways of naming experience. The process involves proposing a name, explaining how the name fits the experience, and then suggesting the expected response to experience based on the proposed name.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; Brown notes that in these discussions, negotiations, agreements, and disagreements about the symbolic classification of experience, human beings create symbolic reality.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

===The ideology process===
In the article Ideology as Communication Process published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]],'' Brown merges his research in ideology and symbolic categorization to propose a model to describe the rhetorical process by which human beings create, maintain, and change ideology, and by extension, social systems.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; In two later articles, Brown refers to this model as the "rhetoric of social intervention."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the Ideology article, Brown argues that the communication and creation of ideology occur simultaneously and, although a specific ideology might fade, the communication process of constituting, maintaining, and changing ideology is continuous.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The RSI model directs attention to the continuous communication process that underlies social change and continuity.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

Brown defines ideology as "any symbolic construction of the world in whose superordinate 'name' human beings can comprehensively order their experience and subsume their specific activities."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, he views ideology as an ultimate symbolic categorization of all of experience that both creates and is shaped by a social system. Ideology is an overarching name that influences how social system participants make sense of their world, social hierarchy, and needs. At the same time, ideology emerges when participants symbolically constitute worldview, power, and need.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; For example, according to the RSI model, American dream ideology influences how U.S. Americans interpret their needs and roles in society, e.g., they need "freedom." The actions they take toward achieving "freedom" also create American dream ideology.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

Extending Roger Brown, the RSI  model holds that human beings learn ideology from language tutors.&lt;ref name="RogerBrown" /&gt; As they learn specific names for experience, they also learn the attributes and expectancies associated with the social system's symbolically constructed ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; For example, the U.S. social system often identifies attributes such as individualism, freedom, equality, success, and progress with American dream ideology. American dream ideology creates the expectancy that a more perfect life can be achieved by pursuing those attributes.&lt;ref name="Brown1970" /&gt; Brown theorizes that human beings construct ideology to meet an inherent human need for an ultimate sense of order, meaning, and explanation for all of experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, he identifies "ultimacy" as the primary attribute of ideology to distinguish it from names given to everyday experience. He writes that ideology is "that category of experience on which one is willing to bet the meaning of one's life."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RSI model, ideology arises out of the naming process.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Human beings create ideology by abstracting from and naming sensed and non-sensed experience. The model focuses on the symbolic abstraction process associated with the naming of worldview, relationships, and needs. The model refers to these three symbolic subsystems as attention, power, and need. Brown proposes that the subsystems are holistically interconnected, so that change in one brings about simultaneous change in the other two.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Hence, the RSI model provides a systemic, or what Brown later calls an "holographic," approach to understanding social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

According to the RSI model, bPecause ideology, like all names for experience, is abstractive, all ideologies are incomplete.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown theorizes that human beings adhere to an ideology as long as it seems to make comprehensive sense of experience. The model predicts that because ideology is always incomplete, adherents will encounter anomalies—experiences that violate or do not fit ideological expectancies. Human beings have an inherent need to avoid a sense of chaos or uncertainty, so they must find a way to account for or make sense of the anomalies to maintain a sense of order and meaning in life.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, Brown argues that the symbolic process by which human beings create and maintain ideology is paradoxically the same process that enables them to account rhetorically for the anomalies. He concludes that rhetorical interventions to address anomalies drive social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; 

The RSI model directs attention to the rhetorical process by which human beings deal with anomalies by focusing on communication patterns associated with the symbolic construction of attention, power, and need. Brown views each of these symbolic subsystems as a starting point for analyzing and initiating communication interventions to promote and impede ideological and, by extension, social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

==Attention interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the attention subsystem as "input-switching."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "attention."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, as human beings symbolically construct ideology, they create complex naming patterns to make sense of and interpret experience. They symbolically constitute templates or worldviews that give meaning to daily experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; They create these complex naming patterns (e.g., a good education will lead to a better life) by abstracting, or paying attention to some aspects of experience (foregrounding) and directing attention away from other aspects (backgrounding).&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Attention interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their complex naming patterns by communicatively shifting attention. Brown concludes that these rhetorical shifts in attention drive social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

In the Attention and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the attention intervention aspect of the RSI model.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; The RSI model holds that complex naming patterns create expectancies about experience (e.g., that getting a good education will make life better). But when lived experience fails to match the symbolically created expectancy (e.g., a person with a good education cannot find a job), the model suggests that human beings may become more attentive to anomalies in their naming pattern. Furthermore, the more widely human beings apply their naming patterns, the more likely they will encounter anomalies because all naming patterns are abstractions, or incomplete.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Because human beings are assumed to have an inherent need for order and to make sense of experience, the model predicts that human beings will attempt to compensate symbolically for these anomalies.

In the model, human beings communicatively promote or impede "attention switches" to compensate for anomalies so as to maintain meaning and order in their lives.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Attention switching involves a symbolic recategorizing of experience or a renaming of the expectancies associated with a symbolic category.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Attention switching occurs when human beings rhetorically shift what they attend to in experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; For example, instead of foregrounding education as the means to making a better life, they might shift to foregrounding spiritual development as the means to achieve a better life. Alternatively human beings could redefine "good education" as meaning only private education instead of all education. In both cases, the RSI model would say that human beings shifted attention to make sense of the anomaly in the "good education" template.

According to the RSI model, the conditions for an attention switch exist when there are two or more complex naming patterns that can make sense of experience and a systemic shift occurs from one template to another.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Attention interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication related to anomalies. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to deviance between symbolically created expectancies and lived experience (anomalies), (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of knowing, being, and valuing to account for the anomalies, and (3) their openness to these alternative complex names to regain a sense of order and meaning increases.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In the Attention article, Brown demonstrates RSI model concepts by examining the symbolic creation of the scientific worldview. He also applies the RSI model to identify attention switch cycles that generated social system shifts in U.S. black/white relationships from 1919-1965.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

The RSI model suggests that to promote an attention switch, interveners (persons attempting to bring about or prevent social change) communicatively feature attention to anomalies in currently held complex names. They advocate an alternative template that foregrounds aspects of experience that had been backgrounded in the currently held complex name. Their symbols mask attention to anomalies in the proposed naming pattern. Interveners that are attempting to prevent social system change communicatively feature attention to anomalies in the proposed template and mask attention to anomalies in the currently held naming pattern.

During an attention switch, experience itself is assumed not to change. What changes is how human beings symbolically categorize the experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Although experience does not change, the RSI  model suggests that it appears different because of concurrent shifts in interpretations of power and need.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; The shift to a new worldview brings about corresponding shifts in symbolic categorizations of needs and power relationships as well as an alternative social system future.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

The RSI model predicts that after human beings shift attention to a new naming pattern, they eventually will also encounter anomalies in that pattern itself because all naming patterns are incomplete. The cycle of attention switching will begin again.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Thus, although the content of a naming pattern may change, the communication process of creating, maintaining and changing naming patterns is continuous.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

In the RSI model, the attention subsystem is one starting point for the rhetorical analysis of or the intervention in social system change. Alternatively, social change can also be examined from the starting point of the symbolic construction of power.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

==Power interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the power subsystem as "interpersonal categorizing."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "power."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings are interdependent with others in the symbolic construction and sharing of needs and power.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The model holds that social systems arise out of the naming of relationships. Human beings interpersonally categorize to create and reify roles, social hierarchy, and relationship rules. In creating social order, human beings also create ideology. At the same time, ideology influences the social system participants' assumptions about social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Power interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in symbolically created hierarchy. These rhetorical interventions drive social system change and continuity.

In the Power and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the power intervention aspect of the RSI model.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown defines power as the degree to which human beings feel interdependent with others in fulfilling needs and in choosing futures.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings form power-sharing social systems in which they share responsibility for meeting needs and making choices that shape the social system's future.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model treats power as a communication medium that provides rules or power codes for taking actions and/or making decisions without deliberation.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown posits that relational names communicate what sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]] calls "power codes" that shape relationship participants' choices and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luhmann"&gt;Luhmann, Niklas. (1979). ''Trust and power.'' Chichester, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the relational name "teacher/student," students typically choose to follow the teacher's direction, such as doing homework, because of social system expectancies associated with that relationship. At the same time, teachers usually follow the social system's expected rules for behavior, such as treating all students fairly.

According to the model, human beings create power through communication by symbolically constituting relationships.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; They create relationships by naming people as "same as" or "different from" each other and acting as if those similarities and differences are real and have meaning. As human beings learn relational names from language tutors, they learn expectancies the social system associates with those names.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Thus, in the model, relational names are non-sensed or symbolic abstractions, which human beings make real in how they behave toward others and in objects created to represent relational names.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; For example, the stripes on a person's shirt and the social expectation that this person will salute officers make real the symbolic category "sergeant."&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

The RSI model holds that social hierarchy arises out of naming relationships "same" and "different." In the model, relational names that emphasize similarities between self and other are called "complementary" (e.g., friends, coworkers). These names convey the expectancy of equality.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Relational names that emphasize differences are called "reciprocal" (e.g., winner/loser, coach/player). These names convey the expectancy of inequality.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Social hierarchy is composed of complementary and reciprocal relationships. The social hierarchy becomes a symbolic reality when human beings act as if these relationships are real and that their expectancies have power.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;

According to the model, when expectancies associated with relational names are violated, conditions for a power intervention exist.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; For example, if the teacher does not treat students fairly, the students might attempt a power intervention by complaining to the teacher's superior or by dropping the class. More specifically, power interventions involve cycles of attention shifts from cooperation to maintain the current social hierarchy to competition by offering an alternative hierarchy, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to anomalies in social hierarchy, (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of social organizing based on exchange, threat, or integry, and (3) they become more open to alternative social hierarchies to regain social order. Human beings attribute motives in the choice to cooperate or challenge social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown draws upon economist [[Kenneth Boulding]]'s ideas about social organizers to suggest motives that human beings attribute to relationships—exchange, threat, and integry.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulding"&gt;Boulding, Kenneth. (1978). ''Ecodynamics: A new theory for societal evolution.''Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; For example, human beings cooperate because they expect something in return (exchange). They cooperate because they expect a negative outcome if they do not cooperate (threat). They cooperate because of an interpretation of shared human identity (integry).&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulding" /&gt;

Like attention interventions, power interventions occur in communication interactions. The RSI model suggests that to encourage a power shift, interveners communicatively create social disorder by foregrounding anomalies in the current social hierarchy template. They advocate alternative ways of social organizing as the means to regain social order.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To prevent a power shift and maintain the current social hierarchy, interveners communicatively foreground anomalies in the proposed template. They advocate ways to account for the anomalies in the current template. They attempt to dissuade openness to alternative ways of social organizing.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In both cases, Brown concludes that communication drives social system change and continuity.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Because social hierarchy is a symbolic abstraction, it will always be incomplete and imperfect.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; As human beings shift from one social hierarchy to another, the newly adopted hierarchy will one day appear non-needs meeting. Thus, in the model, a continuous cycle of power shifts occur from cooperation to competition and vice versa in the symbolic creation of power.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the Power article, Brown traces social hierarchy shifts in black/white relationships from the 1910s to the 1970s through the lens of the RSI model. He also examines the power intervention strategies, tactics, and maneuvers of New York urban planner [[Robert Moses]] to demonstrate RSI model concepts.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;

The RSI model predicts that shifts in the symbolic categorization of power also result in need and attention shifts. Attention shifts occur as human beings pay attention to different aspects of experience to promote or prevent power shifts.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Need interventions occur as shifts in power result in changes in interpretations of needs. As with the attention subsystem, the model views the power subsystem as one entry point for analyzing and intervening in social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Alternatively, social system change can be examined from the perspective of the need subsystem.

==Need interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the need subsystem as "intrapersonal categorizing."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "need."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings have an innate need for a sense of order in self—to know who they are, their role in society, and who and what around them is important and meaningful.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Social systems construct ideology to satisfy that need, just as the constructed ideology shapes how social system participants interpret their needs.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Need interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their symbolically constructed interpretations of needs.

More specifically, the RSI model holds that human beings have two types of needs: biosocial and symbolic.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; Biosocial needs are innate needs, necessary for growth and survival, which are expressed in communication (e.g., when a person says, "I need water" to fulfill a biological need for water). Symbolic needs are those constituted by communication (e.g., when a person says, "I need Brand X water" because advertisers have persuaded the person to interpret Brand X as better meeting the need for health than tap water).&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; In both cases, human beings create interdependencies with others to fulfill biosocial and symbolic needs. They learn from language tutors the social system's assumptions about what needs are important and how needs should be communicated and satisfied.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt;

Brown draws upon social anthropologist [[Edmund Leach]]'s idea of code-switching to explain how human beings create needs symbolically.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Leach, Edmund. (1976). ''Culture and communication: The logic by which symbols are connected.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach writes that human beings talk and act as if non-sensed or abstract concepts exist in the physical world (e.g., marriage, prosperity, recession), having "forgotten" that they symbolically constructed these concepts. They code switch, or act as if the non-sensed is now the sensed.&lt;ref name="Leach" /&gt;

Need interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication to anomalies in symbolic constructions of needs.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown theorizes that need interventions involve cycles that alternate between attributing and denying individual- and group-oriented needs.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase awareness or attention to unmet or attributed/denied needs, (2) they increase advocacy behavior toward those perceived as being able to meet the need, and (3) they become more open to those who can respond to attributed or denied need.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

The model predicts that once a particular need has been fulfilled, then attention to that particular need decreases, advocacy behavior decreases, and openness to others decreases.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; At the same time, attention to "new" needs increases.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; In addition, if a need goes unmet and the human beings advocating the need continually encounter non-needs meeting responses, they might begin advocating the need in ways that the social system names as inappropriate (e.g., shifting from protests to setting buildings on fire).&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Alternatively, the needs advocates might rename the need in a way that diminishes its urgency and shift attention to other needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

According to the model, to promote a shift in needs, an intervener communicatively increases attention to how current needs are not being met or how needs expectancies are unfulfilled. Then the intervener advocates an alternative interpretation of needs and shows how it makes better sense of experience in the attempt to increase others' openness to this needs proposal.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To prevent a shift in needs, an intervener foregrounds anomalies in the proposed interpretation of needs. Then the intervener advocates a way to account for anomalies in the currently existing interpretation of needs to attempt to maintain the current interpretation of needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In both cases, communication drives social system change and continuity.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Because the RSI model is systemic, the need subsystem is assumed to be interconnected with the power and attention subsystems.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, as interpretations of needs change, so do interpretations of power relationships within the social system. In addition, attention shifts occur when the social system emphasizes different types of needs (individual or group)&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt;

==Social system interventions==
Although Brown presents the RSI model as three subsystems, he theorizes that social system intervention is an holistic process that involves all three subsystems simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; He explains that human beings' linear language limits their ability to talk about all three subsystems concurrently. Thus, when analyzing or enacting interventions, human beings tend to emphasize one subsystem and background the other two.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model treats the shifts in the backgrounded subsystems as "side effects" of the primary subsystem intervention.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

In addition, in the RSI model, all social system interventions involve multiple interveners.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown notes, though, that the linear nature of language often results in human beings acting as if one person or group is the primary intervener.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model suggests that all social system change attempts are influenced simultaneously by interveners communicating to promote change and interveners communicating to impede change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Brown names his model "social intervention" to emphasize his conclusion that any attempt to encourage or discourage social system change is an intervention, not control or manipulation.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; He argues that the interconnected nature of the subsystems and the communication actions of multiple interveners mean that the outcome of any attempted system change evidences multi-causation. Thus, Brown views social intervention as a communication act that attempts to "nudge" a social system toward or away from a particular way of naming worldview, power, and needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

Overall, the RSI model is conceived of as a framework for analyzing and tracking the communication patterns that generate social system change and continuity. It also can be viewed as a methodology to guide efforts to promote and/or prevent social system change.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opt, Susan K. (2008).

'''Stjepan Ivšić''' ({{IPA-sh|stjêpaːn ǐːʋʃitɕ|hr}}; 13 August 1884 – 14 January 1962&lt;ref name="unizg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unizg.hr/rektori/sivsic.htm|title=Stjepan Ivšić|work=unizg.hr|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]]|language=hr|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Croat]]ian linguist, Slavic specialist, and accentologist.

After finishing primary school in Orahovica, he attended [[gymnasium (school)|secondary school]] in [[Osijek]] and [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]].{{sfn|Hamm|1962|p=188}} At the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] he studied [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[classical philology]], and later specialized at the universities in [[Krakow]], [[Prague]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Moscow]], and [[Kiev]]. He received his PhD in 1913 with the thesis ''Prilog za slavenski akcenat'' (A Contribution on Slavic Accent). He served as a professor at the secondary school in [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] in Zagreb from 1909 to 1915, and thenceforth as a professor of Slavic Studies at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb.

The focal point of Ivšić's research was Croatian [[Štokavian]] subdialects, on which he published several very important studies ("Šaptinovačko narječje," 1907; "Današnji posavski govor," 1913). He was especially interested in the accentuation of Croatian subdialects and Old Slavic grammars. He was the first to determine the existence of the [[neoacute]] in all three Croatian dialects.

In 1928 he participated in the efforts of state committee to create a common [[orthography]] for [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. In the paper "Jezik Hrvata kajkavaca" (1936) he partitioned dialects of [[Kajkavian]] language  (not including the ''goranski'' subdialects ) into four major groups. He extensively studied Croatian Glagolitic heritage, especially its special language features, on which he published several works. In 1934 he tracked the [[Baška tablet]] from Krk to Zagreb and wrote an enthusiastic article about it called "Sveta Lucija u Jurandvoru i njezin dragi kamen" (''[[Jutarnji list]]'', 1934). In 1937 he became the vice president of the Croatian Language Society, and in 1938 the editor of the journal ''Hrvatski jezik'' (Croatian Language). He served as the chancellor of the University of Zagreb from 1939 to 1943. During the period of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] he refused an offer to serve as the head of the Croatian State Office for Language and advocated a phonology-based orthography as opposed to the official etymological-morphological one (known as ''korienski'' 'root').

==Legacy==
In the spring of 1945, due to alleged collaboration with the enemy, he was sentenced to exile from Zagreb and lost his membership in the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. He was the only one to sign the conclusion of [[Novi Sad agreement]], with the note "I give this signature with the remark that the statement in Act 4 of the conclusion cannot be used for promoting Ekavian pronunciation in the  present-day Ijekavian area."

A high school in Ivšić's native [[Orahovica]] bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ss-sivsic-orahovica.skole.hr/ Stjepan Ivšić High School]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thelma Mae Harper''' ([[Married and maiden names|nee]] '''Crowley'''), also known as '''Mama''', is a [[fictional character]] played by American actress [[Vicki Lawrence]].  She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the southern United States.  Vicki Lawrence, the actress who originated Mama, born April 14, 1949, created Mama in the mid-seventies and undoubtedly based Mama on actual grandmother figures she knew while growing up in the '50s and '60s. Mama first appeared as a [[supporting character]] in "[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' which aired on [[CBS]] from 1967 until 1978. In 1982, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a made-for-TV movie based on "The Family" sketches characters. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]), and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence &amp; Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the "Mama" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';&lt;ref name="1of100"&gt;Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

Lawrence performed on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for eleven seasons. In the seventh season in 1974, ''The Family'' skit was created, which debuted the "Mama" role.&lt;ref name="ref20of100"&gt;Burnett, Carol. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nZKvdLhPrIC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false This Time Together: Laughter and Reflection], p. 88-90 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after ''The Carol Burnett'' show ended, the TV-movie-special ''Eunice'' (the character of Mama's daughter) was broadcast. The special included the key characters from ''The Family'' sketches, including Mama.&lt;ref name="21of2002"&gt;Ingram, Billy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FezBbNPAoYoC&amp;pg=PT123&amp;dq=%22carol+burnett%22+%22the+family%22+vicki&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FDNYT6407MrQAb7ckcgP&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carol%20burnett%22%20%22the%20family%22%20vicki&amp;f=false TVparty!: television's untold tales], p.181-83 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The skit turned movie was spun off for a third time with a sitcom that surrounded the "Mama" character. ''Mama's Family'' has two contrasting lives. This is as result of the show's cancellation from [[NBC]] after one and a half seasons (1983 to 1984).&lt;ref name="ref11of100"&gt;Goodman, Walter (21 January 1983).

By the "Mama" character's full development on the second life of ''Mama's Family'', Thelma had spent much of her time tending to the housework and nurturance of her loved ones, constantly engaged in cooking, cleaning, and providing loving support to her family. She ruled the roost with a [[wikt:smart aleck|smart mouth]] and snappy retorts; an explosively quick temper; and a brash, rough and abrasive manner. Mama solved most of her problems with a can of [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]]; a purse whack; an object slam; a shove; a startling shout; and a healthy dose of wisecracking insults and criticisms."&lt;ref name="ref12of100"&gt;West, Beverly West &amp; Jason Bergund [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFBhC9fcKsMC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22vicki+lawrence%22+mama&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2QFYT7KyLoTw0gH3w8jjDw&amp;ved=CEwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vicki%20lawrence%22%20mama&amp;f=false TV therapy: the television guide to life], p. 11-12 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Burnett was originally supposed to play the "Mama" character while Lawrence was to play her daughter, but because of Burnett's desire to swap roles, Lawrence played Mama. In her autobiography, Vicki called Thelma "the only role which I got to go to makeup to get ugly!" It is Lawrence's most well-known role.&lt;ref name="ref8of100"&gt;Pendergast, Todd &amp; Sara Pendergast. [https://books.google.com/books?id=al4YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Thelma+Harper%22&amp;dq=%22Thelma+Harper%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uv5XT7OaHauB0QHCy7zfDw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTg8 St. James encyclopedia of popular culture, Volume 3], p. 106 (2000) ("One of her ongoing roles — the hilarious, purse-lipped, irascible Southern matriarch Thelma Harper, the character for which she is best known ...")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Mama's appearance is based on that of a stereotypical elderly woman. She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during ''The Family'' sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=duy-zxLKkw&amp;sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&amp;f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&amp;f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. 
 
Mama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.

==Mama's persona==

===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===

The persona of the "Mama" character was revolutionized as between ''The Family'' sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the "Mama" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the "Ed" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has "blossomed" and "matured" from ''The Family'' sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &amp;#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persona evolution===
The character of "Mama" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2947,3546407&amp;dq=carol-burnett+mama&amp;hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mama's catch phrases===
Unlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''"Good Lord!"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''"Good Lord in heaven!"'' or ''"Good night Louise!"'' Among her other locutions included ''"Now hear this!"'' ''"Hell's bells!"'' ''"God-awful!"'' ''"The hell you say,"'' ''"Smut,"'' ''"For heaven's sake!"'' ''"For crying out loud!"'' ''"In a pig's eye,"'' ''"Shoot!"'' ''"Real good,"'' ''"Oh I bet the neightbors are just lovin' this."'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''"Nitwit,"'' ''"Dimwit,"'' ''"Goon,"'' ''"Goober Goon,"'' ''"Lamebrain,"'' ''"Dunce,"'' ''"Tramp,"'' etc.

==Evolution of family members' personas==
Unlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in ''The Family'' sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma &amp; family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.

== Mama's life history ==
In ''[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]'' sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Phillip, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the "Eunice" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton "Vint" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during "Mama's Family." (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)

Thelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of ''The Family'' sketches.

In ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, [[Vinton "Buzz" Harper Jr.]] and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.

Vinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.

Thelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.

Thelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.

After Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.

Thelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba swears off beer from that point forward.

Thelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: "Old lady". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''"Get the hell out of my life!"''

Thelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, "Food Circus", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.

One of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.

As a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge "no-no".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.

Thelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.

==Post-television show appearances==
[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]
Lawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.

Thelma "wrote" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.&lt;ref name="ref9of100"&gt;Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence &amp; Monty Aidem. [https://books.google.com/books?id=93Eaz3sQFMkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mama for President: Good Lord, Why Not?] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thelma also appeared on ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' on October 2, 2009 playing for charity. She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.

On October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch. Later seen out of the Thelma persona, Vicki Lawrence played as a special guest judge to the contestants alongside RuPaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-2-season-1-rupauls-all-stars-drag-race/1696401/playlist.jhtml#vid=851720 |title=RuPaul's Drag Race, Eden's World Full Episodes, Reality TV Shows |publisher=LogoTV |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2013, Thelma appeared in a special sketch during ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday'' in honor of Betty White. The sketch features a Beverly Hills high school class reunion with three of Betty's "classmates" from 1939. The sketch has a run time just over two minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[MeTV]]'s insertion of ''Mama's Family'' into their 2015–2016 schedule also brought with it several new video spots of Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, used for bumpers and promotional commercials on the network.

'''Tintern Abbey''' ({{lang-cy|Abaty Tyndyrn}} &lt;small&gt;{{audio|Cy-Abaty Tyndyrn.ogg|pronunciation}}&lt;/small&gt;) was founded by [[Walter de Clare]], Lord of [[Chepstow]], on 9 May 1131. It is situated adjacent to the village of [[Tintern]] in [[Monmouthshire]], on the Welsh bank of the [[River Wye]], which at this point forms the border between Monmouthshire in [[Wales]] and [[Gloucestershire]] in England. It was only the second [[Cistercian]] foundation in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] (after [[Waverley Abbey]]), and the first in [[Wales]]. The abbey fell into ruin after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century. Its remains have been celebrated in poetry and painting from the 18th century onwards. In 1984 [[Cadw]] took over responsibility for the site. The site welcomes approximately 70,000 people every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gov.wales/docs/caecd/research/2016/160721-visitor-attractions-survey-2015-en.pdf|title=Wales Visitor Attractions Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Welsh Government|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
[[Walter de Clare]], of the powerful family of [[De Clare|Clare]], was first cousin of [[William Giffard]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], who had introduced the first colony of Cistercians to [[Waverley Abbey|Waverley]], [[Surrey]], in 1128. The monks for Tintern came from a daughter house of [[Cîteaux]], [[L'Aumône Abbey]], in the [[diocese of Chartres]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. H.|last=Round|contribution=Clare, Walter de (d. 1137/8?)|editor-first=C. Warren|editor-last=Hollister|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, Tintern established two daughter houses, [[Kingswood Abbey|Kingswood]] in [[Gloucestershire]] (1139) and [[Tintern Abbey (County Wexford)|Tintern Parva]], west of [[Wexford]] in southeast [[Ireland]] (1203).

The Cistercian monks (or [[White Monks]]) who lived at Tintern followed the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. The ''Carta Caritatis'' (Charter of Love) laid out their basic principles, of [[obedience, poverty, chastity]], silence, prayer, and work.  With this austere way of life, the Cistercians were one of the most successful orders in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The lands of the Abbey were divided into agricultural units or [[Monastic grange|granges]], on which local people worked and provided services such as smithies to the Abbey. Many endowments of land on both sides of the Wye were made to the Abbey.

==Development of the buildings==
The present-day remains of Tintern are a mixture of building works covering a 400-year period between 1136 and 1536. Very little remains of the first buildings; a few sections of walling are incorporated into later buildings and the two recessed cupboards for books on the east of the cloisters are from this period. The church of that time was smaller than the present building and was slightly to the north.  
[[Image:Tintern Abbey-inside-2004.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Tintern Abbey, interior]]
During the 13th century the Abbey was mostly rebuilt; first the [[cloisters]] and the domestic ranges, then finally the great church between 1269 and 1301. The first [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the rebuilt [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] was recorded to have taken place in 1288, and the building was consecrated in 1301, although building work continued for several decades.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=John |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of Wales|The Buildings of Wales]] |title=Gwent/Monmouthshire |year=2000 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071053-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk]], the then lord of Chepstow, was a generous benefactor; his monumental undertaking was the rebuilding of the church. The Abbey put his coat of arms in the glass of its east window in thanks to him.

It is this great abbey church that is seen today. It has a [[Cruciform plan|cruciform]] plan with an [[Aisle#Architecture|aisled]] [[nave]]; two chapels in each [[transept]] and a square ended aisled [[chancel]]. The [[Decorated Gothic]] church represents the architectural developments of its day. The abbey is built of [[Old Red Sandstone]], of colours varying from purple to buff and grey. Its total length from east to west is 228 feet, while the [[transept]] is 150 feet in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~familyalbum/ktintern.htm Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire, 1901]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1326 [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] stayed at Tintern for two nights. In 1349 the [[Black Death]] swept the country and it became impossible to attract new recruits for the [[lay brother]]hood. Changes to the way the granges were tenanted out rather than worked by lay brothers show that Tintern was short of labour. In the early 15th century Tintern was short of money, due in part to the effects of the Welsh uprising under [[Owain Glyndŵr]] against the English kings, when Abbey properties were destroyed by the Welsh rebels. The closest battle to the abbey was at [[Cwmcarvan#Craig-y-Dorth|Craig-y-dorth]] near [[Monmouth]], between [[Trellech]] and [[Mitchel Troy]].

==Dissolution and ruin==
[[Image:Turner Tintern1.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Chancel and Crossing of Tintern Abbey, Looking towards the East Window'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]], 1794]]
In the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], his [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] ended monastic life in England, Wales and Ireland. On 3 September 1536, Abbot Wych surrendered Tintern Abbey and all its estates to the King's visitors and ended a way of life that had lasted 400 years. Valuables from the Abbey were sent to the [[Lord High Treasurer|royal Treasury]] and Abbot Wych was pensioned off. The building was granted to the then lord of Chepstow, [[Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester]]. Lead from the roof was sold and the decay of the buildings began.

In the next two centuries little or no interest was shown in the history of the site. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ruins were inhabited by workers in the local wire works.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; However, in the mid-18th century it became fashionable to visit "wilder" parts of the country. The [[Wye Valley]] in particular was well known for its romantic and [[picturesque]] qualities and the ivy clad Abbey became frequented by tourists. One of the earliest prints of the Abbey was in the series of engravings of historical sites made in 1732 by [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck]].&lt;ref&gt;Tintern Conservation Area survey, [http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/08/Tintern-CAA-Main-Body-feb15.pdf p.13]&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of the book ''Observations on the River Wye'' by the Reverend [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]] following his 1770 tour,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/observationsonr00gilpgoog Gilpin, William, 1724-1804: "Observations on the river Wye, and several parts of South Wales, etc. : relative chiefly to picturesque beauty: made in the summer of the year 1770." Archived online] Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; visitors greatly increased, a fact evidenced both by the number of poetic descriptions and of atmospheric paintings and prints of the site.

==Poetry and painting== 
A dedicatory letter at the start of Gilpin’s work is addressed to the poet [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]] and mentions a similar tour made in 1771 by the poet [[Thomas Gray]]. Neither of those dedicated a poem to the Abbey, but it appeared in the work of a number of others, including Rev. Dr. Syned Davies’ long “Describing a Voyage to Tintern Abbey, in Monmouthshire, from Whitminster in Gloucestershire”, which was made by boat with a party of others as early as 1745.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umich.edu/enchanting-ruin-tintern-abbey-romantic-tourism-wales/poetical.html#entry1 Rev.

Epistle IV, in “THE LANGUAGE OF THE SENSE” Poetical Tintern at lib.umich.edu] Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Another topographical work, the six-canto ''Chepstow; or, A new guide to gentlemen and ladies whose curiosity leads them to visit Chepstow: Piercefield-walks, Tintern-abbey, and the beautiful romantic banks of the Wye, from Tintern to Chepstow by water'', was published from Bristol in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chepstow_Or_A_New_Guide_to_Gentlemen_and.html?id=x509HQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y William Pine, 1786: "Chepstow; Or, A New Guide to Gentlemen and Ladies Whose Curiosity Leads Them to Visit Chepstow: Piercefield-walks, Tintern-abbey, etc." Google Books] Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the “Poetical description of Tintern Abbey” by the parson poet Rev. Duncomb Davis, who lived locally and furnished it with many historical and topical discursions, including the method of iron-making that took place adjacent to the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umich.edu/enchanting-ruin-tintern-abbey-romantic-tourism-wales/poetical.html#entry6 Rev. Duncomb Davis' poem, in “THE LANGUAGE OF THE SENSE” Poetical Tintern at lib.umich.edu University of Michigan] Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This appeared in two guide books, the most popular of which was [[Charles Heath (Monmouth)|Charles Heath]]'s ''Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Tintern Abbey'', that went through many editions from 1793 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umich.edu/enchanting-ruin-tintern-abbey-romantic-tourism-wales/poetical.html#entry2poem,  Charles Heath: "Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Tintern Abbey" in “THE LANGUAGE OF THE SENSE” Poetical Tintern at lib.umich.edu University of Michigan] Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

William Wordsworth’s poem "[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]], on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour, July 13, 1798", is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not actually mention the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Kennedy, "Wordsworth, Turner, and the Power of Tintern Abbey",  ''Wordsworth Circle'', [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-92803037/wordsworth-turner-and-the-power-of-tintern-abbey Spring 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc.umd.edu/sites/default/RCOldSite/www/rchs/reader/tabbey.html Gilpin, William, Observations on the river Wye, and several parts of South Wales, Page 46: Online text at rc.umd.edu] Accessed 1 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Following a similar walking tour with friends, [[Robert Bloomfield]] also dedicated a long poem to “The Banks of the Wye” (1811) in which the Abbey is only mentioned briefly as one of many items on the way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/wye/HTML/BanksOfWyeII.html Robert Bloomfield: The Banks of Wye: Poem Text II.65–88] Accessed 1 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, that was followed in 1825 by yet another long poem dealing with the area, annotated and in four books, by  Edward Collins: ''Tintern Abbey or the Beauties of Piercefield'' (1825).&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?181452 Edward Collins "Tintern Abbey: or, The beauties of Piercefield: a poem: in four books: interspersed with illustrative notes" at University of Toronto] Accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Edward Jerningham]]’s earlier short lyric, “Tintern Abbey”, written in 1796, followed Gilpin, whom he quoted, in commenting on the mournful lesson of the past.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=VrIDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=Tintern&amp;f=false Edward Jerningham “Tintern Abbey” in ''Poems and Plays'', Vol.2,  p.135 at Google Books] Accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Two poems of about that time also moralised on a visit to the ruins. Edmund Gardner, in his “Sonnet written in Tintern Abbey”, concludes with the line that 'Man’s but a temple of a shorter date',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=91E3AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;ots=KWaDlqMO9o&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CMan%E2%80%99s%20but%20a%20temple%20of%20a%20shorter%20date%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CMan%E2%80%99s%20but%20a%20temple%20of%20a%20shorter%20date%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false Edmund Gardner, “Sonnet written in Tintern Abbey”: The sonnet originally appeared pseudonymously, accompanying a similarly moralising sonnet on the Severn in ''The European Magazine'' vol.30, p.119 at Google Books] Accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; while Luke Booker, in his “Original sonnet composed on leaving Tintern Abbey and proceeding with a party of friends down the River Wye to Chepstow”, hopes at death to sail as peacefully to the 'eternal Ocean'.&lt;ref&gt;Booker's sonnet appeared in [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ydplX3_4zP8C&amp;lpg=PP126&amp;ots=E7FymDVfjc&amp;dq=Tintern!%20whose%20venerable%20arches&amp;pg=PP126#v=onepage&amp;q=Tintern!%20whose%20venerable%20arches&amp;f=false Charles Heath’s guide to Tintern Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]]' sonnet on “Tintern Abbey” dates from 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/poetryforpeopleo00houg/poetryforpeopleo00houg_djvu.txt Richard Monckton Milnes: "Poetry for the People", p.87 “Tintern Abbey”] Accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that Tennyson’s “[[Tears, Idle Tears]]” (1847) was composed on a visit, but no mention of the Abbey appears there and the poem refers to personal feelings.&lt;ref&gt;James Gribble, ''Literary Education: a revaluation'', Cambridge University 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nGKMe9_3HjAC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;ots=qCF5GWGtHy&amp;dq=tears%20idle%20tears%20%20Tennyson's%20private%20situation&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=tears%20idle%20tears%20%20Tennyson's%20private%20situation&amp;f=false pp.58–61]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry and access==
The area adjacent to the abbey became industrialised from the mid-16th century with the setting up of the first wireworks by the [[Company of Mineral and Battery Works]] and the later expansion of factories and furnaces up the Angidy valley. Charcoal was made in the woods to feed these operations and, in addition, the hillside above the Abbey was quarried for the making of lime at a kiln in constant operation for some two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyedeantourism.co.uk/general_cache1 Wye-Dean Tourism (exact ref not found)] Accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The site was in consequence subject to a degree of pollution&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Rzepka, ''Inventions and Interventions'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kVqe8edkKscC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=tintern+abbey++industry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4e93c9snm7&amp;sig=QkJTjb_4YKN5lP_W7BxqddUrkCc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCWoVChMI14Kv8YjvyAIVi7gUCh1weAOp#v=onepage&amp;q=tintern%20abbey%20%20industry&amp;f=false ch.14, pp.189–222]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ruins themselves were inhabited by the local workers. [[John Thomas Barber Beaumont|J.T.Barber]], for example, remarked on “passing the works of an iron foundry and a train of miserable cottages engrafted on the offices of the Abbey” on his approach.&lt;ref&gt;.” J.T.Barber, A tour throughout South Wales and Monmouthshire, London 1803 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9dcuAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22passing%20the%20works%22&amp;f=false p.266]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, the local roads were rough and dangerous and the easiest access to the site was by boat. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], while trying to reach Tintern from Chepstow on a tour with friends in 1795, almost rode his horse over the edge of a quarry when they became lost in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cottle, ''Early recollections: chiefly relating to the late Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', London 1837, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GydEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22being+an+indifferent+walker+%28from+a+former+dislocation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P28lmz042H&amp;sig=ACX3wMF9aopcszod7eK9NqxQ0VM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAWoVChMIsuvFu_nuyAIVwUAUCh2J7AYM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22being%20an%20indifferent%20walker%20%28from%20a%20former%20dislocation%22&amp;f=false pp.43–50]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1829 that the new Wye Valley turnpike was completed, cutting through the abbey precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Cadw, [http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/wye_valley/english/wyevalley_013.htm Lower Wye Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 the [[Wye Valley Railway]] opened a station for Tintern. Although the line itself crossed the river before reaching the village, a [[Tintern Wireworks Branch|branch]] was built from it to the wire works, obstructing the view of the Abbey on the road approach from the north.

Not all tourists were shocked by the intrusion of industry, however. [[Joseph Cottle]] and [[Robert Southey]] set out to view the ironworks at midnight on their 1795 tour,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cottle, ''Early Recollections'' pp.50–1&lt;/ref&gt; while others painted or sketched them during the following years.&lt;ref&gt;See the 1798 print of “Iron Mills, A View near Tintern Abbey" belonging to [http://search.digido.org.uk/?id=llgc-id%3a1133291&amp;query=*&amp;query_type=full_text&amp;page=1&amp;qf=subject_lctgm_topic%3aFoundries the National Library of Wales] and James Ward’s 1807 sketch of “Mr Thompson’s Wire Mill, Tintern” at the [http://www.centerforbritishart.org/art-in-focus-wales/182/mr-thompsons-wire-mill-tintern Yale Center for British Art]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1799 print of the Abbey by [[Edward Dayes]] includes the boat-landing near the ruins and some of the encroaching housing. In the background above are the cliffs of a lime quarry and smoke rising from the kiln (see the Gallery). Though [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]’s 1805 painting of the ruins does not include the intrusive buildings commented on by others, it makes their inhabitants and animals a prominent feature. Even [[William Havell]]’s panorama of the valley from the south pictures smoke rising in the distance, much as Wordsworth had noted five years before “wreathes of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees” in his description of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;”Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey”, lines 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage==
In the 20th century ruined abbeys became the focus for scholars, and architectural and archaeological investigations were undertaken. In 1901 the Abbey was bought by the crown from the [[Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]] for £15,000. It was recognised as a monument of national importance and repair and maintenance works began to be carried out. In 1914 the [[Office of Works]] was passed responsibility for the ruins, and major structural repairs and partial reconstructions were undertaken — the [[ivy]] considered so romantic by the early tourists was removed. In 1984 [[Cadw]] took over responsibility for the site, which was [[Grade I]] listed from 29 September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-24037-abbey-church-of-st-mary-tintern-abbey-inc |title=Abbey Church of St Mary (Tintern Abbey) including monastic buildings – Tintern – Monmouthshire – Wales |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch of the Abbey's watergate, which led from the Abbey to the River Wye, still exists today as part of the nearby Anchor Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=fotolibra.com (showing the Abbey watergate attached to the Anchor Inn) |url=http://www.fotolibra.com/gallery/1169001/the-anchor-inn-tintern-wye-valley-wales/ |title=The Anchor Inn Tintern Wye Valley Wales |publisher=Fotolibra |date= |accessdate=23 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=visitmonmouthshire.com (mentions the Abbey watergate) |url=https://www.visitmonmouthshire.com/thedms.aspx?dms=3&amp;venue=1250480 |title=The Anchor Inn |publisher=Visit Monmouthshire |date= |accessdate=23 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watergate arch was also [[Grade II]] listed from 29 September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-24032-the-anchor-p-h-including-the-watergate-ti#.WLjsUDsrI2x |title=The Anchor P H including the Watergate, Tintern |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] took an [[LSD|acid]] trip at Tintern Abbey on 28 July 1967, and wrote his poem "Wales Visitation" as a result. In the poem he wrote of:&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg: A biography by Barry Miles, Virgin Publishing 2000 p394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://teifidancer-teifidancer.blogspot.com/2010/01/allen-ginsbergs-wales-visitation.html Allan Ginsburg's 'Wales Visitation'] 2010-01-31, accessed 2012-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13849">In [[archaeology]] a '''typology''' is the result of the [[Categorization|classification]] of things according to their physical characteristics. The products of the classification, i.e. the classes, are also called types. Most archaeological typologies organize portable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] into types, but typologies of larger structures, including buildings, [[Ancient monument|field monuments]], [[fortification]]s or roads, are equally possible. A typology helps to manage a large mass of archaeological data. According to Doran and Hodson, "this superficially straightforward task has proved one of the most time consuming and contentious aspects of archaeological research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doran |first1=J.E. |last2=Hodson |first2=F.R. |year=1975 |title=Mathematics and Computers in Archaeology |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-250-6 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
Typology is based on a view of the world familiar from [[Plato]]'s [[metaphysics]] called [[essentialism]]. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen as a consequence of the imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.

==History==
Although the principles were not clearly articulated, the application of basic typological techniques can occasionally be found in the work of [[Early modern period|early modern]] [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]]. As early as the 1530s, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] successfully identified [[Roman brick]]s (under the misleading designation "Briton brykes") at several different sites, distinguishing them from more modern bricks by size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver |title=John Leland and the 'Briton Brykes' |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=87 |year=2007 |pages=346–56 |doi=10.1017/s0003581500000949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiquaries began to recognise in the late 16th century that medieval [[English church monuments|monumental effigies]] represented with their legs crossed were likely to be older than those with straight legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=O.D. |title=Antiquarian attitudes: crossed legs, crusaders and the evolution of an idea |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=90 |year=2010 |pages=401–40 |doi=10.1017/s0003581510000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, [[John Aubrey]] worked out crude evolutionary sequences based on typological distinctions for medieval architecture, handwriting, shield-shapes and costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Michael |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |year=1975 |pages=156–7, 162–6, 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colvin |first=H.M. |chapter=Aubrey’s 'Chronologia Architectonica' |editor-first=John |editor-last=Summerson |title=Concerning Architecture |place=London |year=1968 |pages=1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Horsfall Turner |authorlink=Olivia Horsfall Turner |title='The Windows of this Church are of several Fashions': architectural form and historical method in John Aubrey's 'Chronologia Architectonica'|journal=Architectural History |volume=54 |year=2011 |pages=171–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the development of medieval [[Gothic architecture]] was further refined in the 18th century, culminating in the clear sequence of styles published by [[Thomas Rickman]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankl |first=P. |title=The Gothic: literary sources and interpretations through eight centuries |place=Princeton |year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watkin |first=D. |title=The Rise of Architectural History |place=London |year=1980 |pages=53–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M. |title=Thomas Gray’s contribution to the study of medieval architecture |journal=Architectural History |volume=36 |year=1993 |pages=49–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries archaeological typologies continued to be constructed using a combination of empirical observation and intuition. According to Eggers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eggers |first=Hans-Jürgen |year=1986 |title=Einführung in die Vorgeschichte |place=München |publisher=Piper Verlag |pages=88–95 |ISBN=3-492-00393-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most archaeologists give [[Oscar Montelius]] the credit for the first serious application of the typological method, but in Eggers' view, his contemporary colleague from Stockholm, Hans Hildebrand made important contributions to the development of the methodology as well. Hildebrand published a fundamental paper on the development of [[fibulae]] in the 1870s using the typological method, whereas Montelius at the same time went to international congresses and published smaller papers on this method.

Another early example is the typology published in 1899 by [[Flinders Petrie]] for the objects (mainly pottery) found in 900 prehistoric Egyptian graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=D.G. |year=1971 |chapter=Seriation from abundance matrices |title=Mathematics in the Archaeological and Historical Sciences |editor1-first=F.R. |editor1-last=Hodson |editor2-first=D.G. |editor2-last=Kendall |editor3-first=P. |editor3-last=Tautu |pages=215–252 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-213-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typology formed the basis for his manual [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] of the graves.

==Statistical methods for creating a typology==
With the development of [[statistics|statistical]] techniques and numerical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including [[Cluster analysis]], [[Principal components analysis]], [[correspondence analysis]] and [[Factor analysis]]) have been used to build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spaulding, Albert C|title=Statistical Techniques for the Discovery of Artifact Types|date=1953|publisher=American Antiquity|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s [[archaeologist]]s began to use [[phylogenetic]] methods borrowed from [[Cladistics]].

==Ceramic typology==
For cultures that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably spend a great deal of time defining ceramic "types." Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.

The names assigned to the ceramic types are arbitrary. In United States, the common practice is a two-part name, the first part being an arbitrary geographic reference and the second part providing a brief description of the pottery's most obvious design attributes. Thus, for example, the type "Flagstaff Black-on-white" was first defined using a collection from the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, and its primary design attribute is the use of black paint on a white background.

Non-archaeologists should be aware of the limitations of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate.

==Non-archaeological typology as an art form==
In the middle of the twentieth century, German photographers [[Bernd and Hilla Becher]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/026202277X Bernd and Hilla Becher, ''Water Towers'', The MIT Press, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; raised typology to an art form by photographing countless similar architectural features including water towers, workers' houses and industrial landscapes. They documented their work in books.

== Types of typologies ==
''There are four main types of typologies that archaeologists organize artifacts into.''

=== Morphological/descriptive typology ===
One class of typology consists of a descriptive or [http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology a morphological] approach. It is based on the physical characteristics and the external features of an artifact. Some examples of  morphological and descriptive typologies would be categorizing artifacts distinctively on their weight, height, color, material, or whichever class the individual decides upon.

==== Projectile point typology ====
An example of morphological/descriptive typology consists of when an archaeologist excavates a site and finds dozens upon dozens of Native American arrowheads. The archaeologist narrows down their classification by organizing the pieces into morphological/descriptive groups. So, the [[projectile point]]s could be sorted by weight, height, color, material, or however the archaeologists prefers. One of the first national typology bases available on the web, [http://www.projectilepoints.net/Search/Search.html The Projectile Points Typology Database] , exhibits how the arrowhead artifacts found are classified among the fifty states by region, state, or nationwide.

In this particular example, the arrowheads are classified by their shape. The categories consist of: notched, stemmed, lanceolate, and other projectile points. Each category may also be narrowed down into subsequent ones.

=== Chronological typology ===
This type consists of sequential ordering of archaeological artifacts merely based on form. It involves collecting dates or relative dates that establishes the position in time the artifact lies in to reflect the civilization/events of a current region &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Chronology|chronological]] typology is made up of diagnostic artifacts, or relics that suggests a particular event/people occurred during a period of time &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/glossary.html|title = Glossary of Archaeology Terms|website = www.wvculture.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.jefpat.org/diagnostic/Post-Colonial%20Ceramics/PaintedWares/index-paintedwares.htm underglaze painted earthenwares] for an example of chronological typology.

=== Functional typology ===
Artifacts organized into this kind of typology are sorted by the use they serve rather than the looks they have or the chronological sequence they possess.  In some cases, the artifacts may not be removed because of the functional purpose they exhibit, and the restoration of the pieces can be more difficult than other types of objects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.venipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Functional_Artifacts|title = Functional Artifacts - Venipedia|website = www.venipedia.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stylistic typology ===
This type of classification displays information about the artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology is not to be confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. [[Pottery]] is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=abDhtdHFyCkC|title = Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality: A Dialectical Approach to Artifact Classification and Sorting|last = Adams|first = William Y.|last2 = Adams|first2 = Ernest W.|date = 2007-11-26|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521048675|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''unitary executive theory''' is a theory of [[United States Constitution|American constitutional law]] holding that the [[President of the United States|President]] possesses the power to control the entire executive branch. The doctrine is rooted in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]], which vests "the executive power" of the United States in the President.

Although that general principle is widely accepted, there is disagreement about the strength and scope of the doctrine.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt; It can be said that some favor a "strongly unitary" executive, while others favor a "weakly unitary" executive.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt; The former group argue, for example, that [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s power to interfere with intra-executive decision-making (such as firing executive branch officials) is limited, and that the President can control policy-making by all executive agencies within the limits set for those agencies by Congress. Still others agree that the Constitution requires a unitary executive, but believe this to be harmful, and propose its abolition by [[Constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendment]].&lt;ref name="Berry" /&gt;

{{anchor|Plural executive}}'''Plural executives''' exist in several [[U.S. state|states]] where, in contrast to the federal government, executive officers such as [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]], [[State attorney general|attorney general]], [[comptroller#United States|comptroller]], [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], and others, are elected independently of the [[Governor (United States)|state's governor]], with [[Texas#State government|Texas]] being one example. This type of executive structure is known as a plural executive. Another type of plural executive, used in Japan, Israel, and Sweden, though not in any U.S. state, in which a collegial body comprises the executive branch – however, that collegial body does not comprise multiple members elected in elections, but is rather more akin to the [[U.S. Cabinet]] in formation and structure.

==Theory==
The [[Vesting Clause]] of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] provides, "The executive Power [of the United States] shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." Proponents of the unitary executive theory argue that this language, along with the [[Take Care Clause]] ("The President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed..."), creates a "hierarchical, unified executive department under the direct control of the President."&lt;ref name="plural"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Calabresi |first1= Steven |last2= Rhodes |first2= Kevin |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Structural Constitution: Unitary Executive, Plural Judiciary |journal= Harvard Law Review |year= 1992 |volume= 105 |issue= 6 |page= 1165 |doi=10.2307/1341727 |jstor= 1341727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general principle that the President controls the entire executive branch was originally rather innocuous, but extreme forms of the theory have developed.&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt; [[John Dean]] explains: "In its most extreme form, unitary executive theory can mean that neither Congress nor the federal courts can tell the President what to do or how to do it, particularly regarding national security matters."&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean |first= John |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dj56j5TsNUAC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22unitary+executive%22#PPA102,M1 |title= Broken Government |page= 102 |publisher= Viking |year= 2007|isbn= 9780670018208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to law professors [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Cass Sunstein]], "No one denies that in some sense the framers created a unitary executive; the question is in what sense. Let us distinguish between a strong and a weak version."&lt;ref name="Lessig"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lessig |first1= Lawrence |last2= Sunstein |first2= Cass |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.pegc.us/archive/Authorities/Lessig_Col_L_R_President.pdf |format= PDF |title= The President and the Administration |journal= [[Columbia Law Review]] |volume= 94 |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either its strong or weak form, the theory would limit the power of Congress to divest the President of control of the executive branch.  The "strongly unitary" theory posits stricter limits on Congress than the "weakly unitary" theory.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt;

Some scholars oppose even the "weakly unitary" theory and favor creating a plural executive, as in the many state governments that separately elect an attorney general.&lt;ref name="Berry"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Berry |first1= Christopher |last2= Gersen |first2= Jacob |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=nwwps |title= The Unbundled Executive |journal= University of Chicago Law Review |year= 2008 |quote= We certainly do not claim that the most sensible or even any plausible interpretation of the US Constitution establishes a plural unbundled executive; but perhaps it should |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807190941/http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=nwwps |archivedate= August 7, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those scholars acknowledge that a constitutional amendment would be required to eliminate the federal unitary executive.

Proponents of a strongly unitary theory argue that the president possesses ''all'' of the executive power and can therefore control subordinate officers and agencies of the executive branch. This implies that the power of Congress to remove executive agencies or officers from Presidential control is limited. Thus, under the strongly unitary executive theory, independent agencies and counsels are unconstitutional to the extent that they exercise discretionary executive power not controlled by the president.&lt;ref name="plural" /&gt;

The [[Federal government of the United States#Judicial branch|judicial branch]] implications are that a part of the executive branch cannot [[lawsuit|sue]] another part because "the executive cannot sue himself." If the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] were to adjudicate disputes between [[List of United States federal agencies|executive agencies]], it would violate the doctrine of [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Latham |first= Joshua |url= http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bcealr/27_3/04_FMS.htm |title= The Military Munitions Rule and Environmental Regulation of Munitions |journal= Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review |volume= 27 |page= 467 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption of constitutional provisions==
The phrase "unitary executive" was discussed as early as the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, referring mainly to having a single individual fill the office of President, as proposed in the [[Virginia Plan]]. The alternative was to have several executives or an executive council, as proposed in the [[New Jersey Plan]] and as promoted by [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Edmund Randolph]], and [[George Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Ralph |editor-last= Ketchum |title= The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates |publisher= Signet Classic |year= 1986 |page= 67 |quote= Mr. [James] Wilson entered into a contrast of the principal points of the two plans [i.e. the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan]... These were... A single Executive Magistrate is at the head of the one—a plurality is held out in the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s4.html |title= Records of the Federal Convention, Article 2, Section 1, Clause 1 |year= 1787 |work= The Founder’s Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Pennsylvania ratifying convention in 1787, [[James Wilson]] emphasized the advantages of a single chief executive, including greater accountability, vigor, decisiveness, and responsibility:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he executive authority is one. By this means we obtain very important advantages. We may discover from history, from reason, and from experience, the security which this furnishes. The executive power is better to be trusted when it has no screen. Sir, we have a responsibility in the person of our President; he cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes. We secure vigor. We well know what numerous executives are. We know there is neither vigor, decision, nor responsibility, in them. Add to all this, that officer is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Wilson |first= James |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s8.html |title= Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention |date= December 4, 1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1788, the letters of the [[Federal Farmer]] were published, generally considered among the most astute of [[Anti-Federalist]] writings. The [[pseudonym]]ous Federal Farmer defended the proposed unitary executive, arguing that "a single man seems to be peculiarly well circumstanced to superintend the execution of laws with discernment and decision, with promptitude and uniformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Richard |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ybmeEcpEvlsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22superintend+the+execution+of+laws+with+discernment+and+decision%22 |title= Founding the American Presidency |page= 39 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year= 1999|isbn= 9780847694990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Federalists]] such as [[James Madison]] were emphasizing an additional advantage of a unitary executive. In [[Federalist No. 51]], he wrote that an undivided executive would strengthen the ability of the executive to resist encroachments by the legislature: “As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided [into branches], the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Madison |first= James |url= http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm |title= Federalist no. 51 |date= February 6, 1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Hamilton]] later pointed out that the Constitution grants executive power and legislative power in different ways, with the legislative powers of Congress being expressly limited to what is "herein granted," unlike executive powers which are not expressly limited by an enumeration. Hamilton wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the article which gives the legislative powers of the government, the expressions are "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States." In that which grants the executive power, the expressions are "The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States." The enumeration ought therefore to be considered, as intended merely to specify the principal articles implied in the definition of executive power....&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hamilton |first= Alexander |url= http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=h&amp;p=c&amp;a=p&amp;ID=27786&amp;c=748 |title= Pacificus Letters, No. 1 |date= June 29, 1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the principle of ''[[Statutory_interpretation#Textual|expressio unius]]'' may be more applicable as a limitation upon congressional power than upon executive power.  According to Hamilton, the unenumerated executive powers that are vested solely in the President "flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity with other parts of the Constitution, and with the principles of free government."&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

Those other parts of the Constitution include the extensive powers granted to Congress. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to make laws, which the President then must execute, provided that those laws are constitutional. Article I, Section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution known as the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] grants Congress the power to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution all Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof". The Constitution also [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Enumerated powers|grants Congress power]] "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The theory of the unitary executive can only be legitimate insofar as it allows Congress to wield its constitutional powers while ensuring that the President can do the same.

==Judicial decisions==
In the 1926 case of ''[[Myers v. United States]]'', the United States Supreme Court decided that the President has the exclusive power to remove executive branch officials, and does not need the approval of the Senate or any other legislative body.  The Court also wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ordinary duties of officers prescribed by statute come under the general administrative control of the President by virtue of the general grant to him of the executive power, and he may properly supervise and guide their construction of the statutes under which they act in order to secure that unitary and uniform execution of the laws which article 2 of the Constitution evidently contemplated in vesting general executive power in the President alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Myers v. United States |vol= 272 |reporter= U.S.  |opinion= 52 |pinpoint= |court= |date= 1926 |url=  http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=272&amp;page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent cases such as ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'' (Presidential removal of certain kinds of officers), ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' (executive privilege), and ''[[Bowsher v. Synar]]'' (control of executive functions) have flexed the doctrine's reach back and forth. [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] in his solitary dissent in ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'' argued for an unlimited presidential removal power of all persons exercising executive branch powers, which he argued included the [[independent counsel]]; the court disagreed, but later moved closer to Scalia's position in ''[[Edmond v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Calabresi |first1= Steven |last2= Lawson |first2= Gary |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/107/4/Calabresi-Lawson.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090306120412/http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/107/4/Calabresi-Lawson.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2009-03-06 |format= PDF |title= The Unitary Executive, Jurisdiction Stripping, and the Hamdan Opinions: A Textualist Response to Justice Scalia |journal= Columbia Law Review |year= 2007 |volume= 107 |pages= 1002–1047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the strong version of the theory==
[[Loyola Law School]] Professors [[Karl Manheim]] and [[Allan Ides]] write that "the separation among the branches is not and never was intended to be airtight," and they point to the President's veto power as an example of the executive exercising legislative power. They also cite other examples of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power being exercised by the executive branch, as necessary elements of the administrative state, but they contend that ultimately all administrative power belongs to Congress rather than the President, and the only true "executive" powers are those explicitly described in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Manheim Ides"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manheim |first1=Karl |last2=Ides |first2=Allan |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=943046 |title=The Unitary Executive |journal=Los Angeles Lawyer |date=September 2006 |id=Loyola-LA Legal Studies Paper No. 2006-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this understanding, Manheim and Ides follow in the footsteps of Lessig and Sunstein.&lt;ref name="Lessig" /&gt;

Professors [[David Jeremiah Barron]] and [[Marty Lederman]] have also criticized the strong version of the unitary executive theory. They acknowledge that there is a compelling case for a unitary executive within the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Barron-Lederman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=David |last2=Lederman |first2=Martin |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/jan08/barron_lederman.shtml |title=The Commander In Chief At The Lowest Ebb: Framing The Problem, Doctrine, And Original Understanding |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=121 |page=689 |year=2008 |quote=we think the text, as reinforced by historical practice, makes a strong case for at least some form of a 'unitary executive' within the armed forces, particularly as to traditional functions during armed conflicts. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125114946/http://harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/jan08/barron_lederman.shtml |archivedate=January 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that the Constitution does not provide for an equally strong unitary executive outside the military context, and they argue that the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons|Commander in Chief Clause]] would be superfluous if the same kind of unitary presidential authority resulted from the general constitutional provision vesting executive power in the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=David |last2=Lederman |first2=Martin |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/feb08/barron_lederman2.shtml |title=The Commander in Chief at the Lowest Ebb: A Constitutional History |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=121 |page=941 |year=2008 |quote=there are those who would argue that the 'unitary executive' must have effective control over all Article II functions, in which case the superintendence guaranteed by the Commander in Chief Clause would not appear to do any additional work with respect to superintendence. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124223310/http://harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/feb08/barron_lederman2.shtml |archivedate=January 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to claims of some authors,&lt;ref name="Rethinking Presidential Power"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Kelley |first=Christopher |url=http://www.users.muohio.edu/kelleycs/paper.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rethinking Presidential Power: The Unitary Executive and the George W. Bush Presidency |conference=63rd Annual Meeting of the [[Midwest Political Science Association]] |date=April 7–10, 2005 |location=Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first administration to make explicit reference to the "Unitary Executive" was not that of President [[George W. Bush]].  For example, in 1987, [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a [[signing statement]] that declared: "If this provision were interpreted otherwise, so as to require the President to follow the orders of a subordinate, it would plainly constitute an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority as head of a unitary executive branch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reagan |first=Ronald |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/092987d.htm |title=Statement on Signing the Federal Debt Limit and Deficit Reduction Bill |date=September 29, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The George W. Bush administration made the Unitary Executive Theory a common feature of signing statements.&lt;ref name="Johnsen"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Dawn Johnsen |last=Johnsen |first=Dawn |url=http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/documents/JOHNSEN.pdf |format=PDF |title=What's a President To Do?

{{Place of articulation}}
'''Uvularization''' is a [[secondary articulation]] of [[consonant]]s or [[vowel]]s by which the back of the tongue is constricted toward the [[uvula]] and upper [[pharynx]] during the articulation of a sound with its primary articulation elsewhere.

==IPA symbols==
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], uvularization can be indicated by the symbol {{IPA|⟨ʶ⟩}} (a superscript [[voiced uvular approximant]] (inverted small capital R)) after the letter standing for the consonant that is uvularized, as in {{IPA|[tʶ]}} (the uvularized equivalent of {{IPA|[t]}}).

==Occurrence==
Uvularized consonants are often not distinguished from [[pharyngealized consonant]]s, and they may be transcribed as if they were pharyngealized. 

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and several other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Berber languages]], uvularization is the defining characteristic of the series of "[[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]]" [[coronal consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (1994) "The phonetics and phonology of Semitic pharyngeals. In Keating (ed.) ''Phonological structure and phonetic form: papers in laboratory phonology III'', 191&amp;ndash;233. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shahin, Kimary (1996) "Accessing pharyngeal place in Palestinian Arabic", in Eid &amp; Parkinson (eds.) ''Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics: Papers from the Ninth Annual Symposium on Arabic Linguistics, Washington DC, 1995'', 131&amp;ndash;149&lt;/ref&gt;

Uvularized consonants in standard Arabic are {{IPA|/sʶ/}}, {{IPA|/dʶ/}}, {{IPA|/tʶ/}}, {{IPA|/ðʶ/}}, {{IPA|/lʶ/}}. Regionally there is also {{IPA|/zʶ/}} and {{IPA|/rʶ/}}. Other consonants, and vowels, may be phonetically uvularized.
 	
In [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], long vowels are uvularized before [[uvular consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Wood (1997) "The gestural organization of vowels and consonants: a cinefluorographic study of articulator gestures in Greenlandic", 5th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''vedette''''' is the main female artist of a show derived from [[cabaret]] and its genres ([[revue]], [[vaudeville]], [[music hall]] or [[burlesque]]). 

The purpose of the vedette in a cabaret or nightclub show is to entertain the public. The vedette has to know how to [[triple threat (entertainer)|sing, dance and act]] on stage. Depending on the quality of its show, career or mastery of one or more stage talents, can be considered a ''super vedette'' or ''first vedette''. Generally a vedette is a woman with physical presence, personality and charisma that captivates the public. In addition to singing, dancing and acting, vedettes often included groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, and even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage.

In the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. [[Paris]] and [[Las Vegas]] were considered the main cradle of the vedettes.

==Etymology==
''Vedette'' is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le-dictionnaire.com/definition.php?mot=vedette|title=Le Dictionnaire - Définition vedette|website=www.le-dictionnaire.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.

The vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with  so-called [[showgirl]]s. Venues such as [[Le Lido]], the [[Moulin Rouge]], and the [[Crazy Horse]] in France. The [[Teatro Maipo]] and the [[Teatro El Nacional]] in Argentina, and the [[Teatro de la Ciudad |Teatro de la Ciudad "Esperanza Iris"]] in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows.

==Europe==

===France===
[[File:Le Lido.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Lido]] of Paris]]
France is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, [[Paris]], has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the [[Moulin Rouge]] and the [[Folies Bergère de Paris]], pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing [[Tableau vivant]]. Other famous venues are the [[Le Lido]] and [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]], also famous for their vaudeville and Revues. In more recent times, this group of entertainment centers would be joined by [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse]].

Among the main vedettes of France are considered the "Three Graces" of Belle Époque: [[Émilienne d'Alençon]], [[Liane de Pougy]], and [[La Bella Otero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardianpromenade.com/sex/the-courtesan/|title=The Courtesan|date=14 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Mistinguett]] became one of the most popular French artists of her time and the most important woman in the world of the spectacle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/m/mistinguett.htm|title=Biografia de Mistinguett|website=www.biografiasyvidas.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was [[Gina Palerme]].

At the beginning of the century, the novelist [[Colette]] was also distinguished by acting in shows of magazine. Another prominent figure at that time is the world-famous Dutch spy [[Mata Hari]].

The legendary [[Cléo de Mérode]] of the Folies Bergère was another of the great stars of the Parisian nightlife of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portalsolidario.net/ocio/visu/biografia.php?rowid=10182|title=Biografía insólita. Cleo de Mérode, la bailarina más deseada|website=www.portalsolidario.net|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mistinguett Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mistinguett]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]]]]

[[Joséphine Baker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|title=Biography - The Official Licensing Website of Josephine Baker|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[United States|American]] origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes of the twentieth century. Her "Revue Nègre", which included a [[jazz]] orchestra, caused a sensation in the Parisian cabarets. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made with bananas) were more attractive to [[Europe]]ans than to [[United States|Americans]]. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez ''Josephine''.

Another important figure was [[Coccinelle]], considered the first transsexual vedette in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20161228073700/http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 December 2016|title=''Biography of Coccinelle in her official web page''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actress and singer [[Liliane Montevecchi]] stood out as vedette in the Folies Bergère in the 1970s, and eventually conquered [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty.

In recent times the vedette shows emphasize figures like [[Arielle Dombasle]] (known as the vedette-like Dolorès Sugar Rose) and Marlène Mourreau.

The image of the Vedette in Mexico arises from the beginning of the 20th century with the rise of the called "Carpas" and the [[Revue]]s. Some venues such as Teatro Principal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museoebc.org/eventos/historia-del-teatro-principal-en-mexico-1753-1931|title=Historia del Teatro Principal en México 1753-1931 - Museo EBC|website=museoebc.org|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Teatro Colón&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/08/20/opinion/o-01802.htm|title=El Teatro Colón, en el D.F. de México|last=Clarín.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Teatro Arbeu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciudadanosenred.com.mx/el-teatro-arbeu/|title=EL TEATRO ARBEU - Ciudadanos en Red|date=2 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were considered as the cathedral of the revues and burlesque in [[Mexico City]].

Conesa, Montalván and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous [[foxtrot]] called ''Mi querido capitán (My dear captain)''.


In the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1090805/0/eujenia-arenas/cabarets/mexico/|title=Los últimos cabarets mexicanos|last=20Minutos|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikikí, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro Lírico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/|title=''Article about the Teatro Lírico''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224958/http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/#|archive-date=2017-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the ''Exoticas'', a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These "Exoticas" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859|title=Tongolele y las "exóticas" en Magazine de Policía y VEA|first=Gabriela Pulido|last=Llano|date=1 October 2013|journal=Diario de Campo|issue=13|pages=32–36|accessdate=2 July 2018|via=www.revistas.inah.gob.mx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702093257/https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859#|archive-date=2018-07-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the "Exoticas" was [[Tongolele|Yolanda Montes "Tongolele"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivelohoy.com/entretenimiento/8041423/perfume-de-gardenia-arranca-gira-en-la|title=Perfume de Gardenia arranca gira en LA|first=Tommy|last=Calle|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with ''Tongolele'', the most famous were [[Su Muy Key]] ''The Chinese Doll'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miguelangelmoralex-bitacora.blogspot.com/2010/05/su-muy-key.html|title=Bitácora: SU-MUY-KEY|first=Miguel Angel|last=Morales|date=1 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Ellen Bromfield|Kalantan]]. Another famous "Exóticas" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Naná.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poresto.net/ver_nota.php?zona=yucatan&amp;idSeccion=33&amp;idTitulo=94881|title=''Por esto Yucatán: The Amazing World of the Exoticas''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous "Rumberas", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The [[Rumberas film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html|title=1946-1950: Rumberas y Arrabal|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222034740/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html#|archive-date=2012-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the called [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]]. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans [[María Antonieta Pons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690512/bio|title=María Antonieta Pons|website=IMDb|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amalia Aguilar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amaliaaguilar.com/history_1.html|title=Amalia Aguilar - Beginnings|website=www.amaliaaguilar.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ninón Sevilla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/entretenimiento/biografias/022450/ninon-sevilla|title=Ninón Sevilla|last=Espectáculos|date=2 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rosa Carmina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/search?q=rosa+carmina|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the Mexican [[Meche Barba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/2008/09/las-rumberas-parte-4-la-rumbera.html|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza: LAS RUMBERAS parte 4: LA RUMBERA MEXICANA... MECHE BARBA|first=René Muñoz|last=López|date=1 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America.
The Cuban [[Rosita Fornés]] deserves special mention. She reaches the final consecration in Mexico before conquering the rest of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/estrellas/rosita_fornes.html|title=Rosita Fornés|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704020007/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/estrellas/rosita_fornes.html#|archive-date=2013-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s the splendor of the vedettes in Mexico lost force. Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or "El Patio" by the stars such as [[Sonia Furió]], [[Ana Luisa Peluffo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poresto.net/ver_nota.php?zona=yucatan&amp;idSeccion=33&amp;idTitulo=97347|title=''Por esto Yucatán: Ana Luisa Peluffo|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ana Bertha Lepe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elanecdotario.com/2006/ago06/7/ago7a.htm|title=''Article about Ana Bertha Lepe''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the fury of the [[Rock and Roll]] era, were famous figures like Malú Reyes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estroncio90.typepad.com/blog/2011/12/malu-reyes.html|title=Malu Reyes - Vuelve Primavera: El rock de los 60 en México|website=estroncio90.typepad.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emily Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venamimundo.com/Videos/EmilyCranz.html|title=Emily Cranz|website=www.venamimundo.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses such as [[Jacqueline Voltaire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.articulosiete.com/content/qu%C3%A9-se-fi%C3%A7ieron-las-chicas-go-go|title=''ArtículoSiete.com: The A Go go Girls''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305041541/http://www.articulosiete.com//content/qu%C3%A9-se-fi%C3%A7ieron-las-chicas-go-go|archive-date=5 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irán Eory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diariojudio.com/comunidad-judia-mexico/iran-eory-zl-leyenda-del-cine-y-la-television-mexicana/7463/#|title=Iran Eory Z'L, Leyenda del Cine y la Televisión Mexicana - Diario Judío: Diario de la Vida Judía en México y el Mundo|website=diariojudio.com|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; also performed shows as vedettes.


The 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Clóset, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the [[Teatro Fru Fru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistacinefagia.com/2004/07/tivoli/|title=Tívoli - revistacinefagia.com|first=Revista|last=Cinefagia|website=www.revistacinefagia.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called [[Mexican sex comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html|title=1976-1982: Los años de las "Ficheras"|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011320/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html#|archive-date=2013-08-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, the popular television program ''Variedades de medianoche (Varieties of the Midnight)'' contributed to the boom of these women and launched to the fame to dozens of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematerapia.blogspot.mx/2011/12/variedades-de-medianoche-1977.html|title=''Cinematerapia: Variedades de Medianoche''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190012/http://cinematerapia.blogspot.mx/2011/12/variedades-de-medianoche-1977.html#|archive-date=2017-11-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "vedette" is not commonly used in the United States or other Anglo-Saxon countries, (here called "[[showgirl]]s"). [[Las Vegas]] is considered, after Paris, as the main venue for revue shows and musicals worldwide.

The British [[Lydia Thompson]] became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage. She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the "British Blondes", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmai2/d2lydtm1.htm|title=Streetswing's Burlesque History Archives: Lydia Thompson|first=Sonny|last=Watson|website=www.streetswing.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her innovations consisted of a casual style, against the spasmodic movements of other strippers (she emphasized the joke during the striptease) and brought a keen sense of humor to her performances.

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[grammar]], the '''voice''' of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its [[verb argument|argument]]s (subject, object, etc.). When the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is the agent or doer of the action, the verb is in the [[active voice]]. When the subject is the patient, target or undergoer of the action, the verb is said to be in the [[passive voice]]. Voice is sometimes called '''diathesis'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Rutger|last=Allan|title=Diathesis/Voice (Morphology of)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics|year=2013|accessdate=March 20, 2018|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-448X_eagll_COM_00000099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the sentence:

:''The cat ate the mouse.''

the verb "ate" is in the active voice. However, in the sentence:

:''The mouse was eaten by the cat.''

the verbal phrase "was eaten" is passive.

In the sentence:

:''The hunter killed the bear.''

the verb "killed" is in the active voice, and the doer of the action is the "hunter". 
A passive version of the sentence is:

:''The bear was killed by the hunter.''

where the verbal phrase "was killed" is followed by the word "by" and then by the doer "hunter".

In a [[transformational grammar|transformation]] from an active-voice [[clause]] to an equivalent passive-voice construction, the subject and the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]] switch grammatical roles. The direct object gets ''promoted'' to subject, and the subject ''demoted'' to an (optional) [[Adjunct (linguistics)|adjunct]]. In the first example above, ''the mouse'' serves as the direct object in the active-voice version, but becomes the subject in the passive version. The subject of the active-voice version, ''the cat'', becomes part of a prepositional phrase in the passive version of the sentence, and can be left out entirely.

==History==
In the grammar of Ancient Greek, voice was called διάθεσις (''diáthesis'') "arrangement" or "condition", with three subcategories: active (ἐνέργεια [enérgeia]), passive (πάθος [páthos]), and middle (μεσότης [mesótēs]).&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Thrax. τέχνη γραμματική (Art of Grammar). [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html ιγ´ περὶ ῥήματος] (13. On the verb).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dia/qesis|διάθεσις|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Latin there are two voices: active and passive (Latin: [genus] activum, passivum).

==Active==
{{further|Active voice}}
The active voice is the most commonly used in many languages and represents the "normal" case, in which the subject of the verb is the agent.

In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action or causes the happening denoted by the verb.

Example: ''Kabaisa ate the potatoes.''

The verb ''ate'' indicates the active voice. But consider the following sentence which is in passive voice:

''The potatoes were eaten by Kabaisa''.

The words ''were eaten'' indicate the passive voice.

The passive voice shows that something has been acted upon by someone or something else.

==Passive==
{{anchor|The passive voice}}
{{further|Passive voice|English passive voice}}

The passive voice is employed in a clause whose [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] expresses the [[Theta role|theme]] or [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] of the verb. That is, it undergoes an action or has its state changed.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, William, John Archibald, Mark Aronoff, and Janie Rees-Miller (eds.) (2001). ''Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction'' Fourth edition. Boston: Bedord/St. Martin's. {{ISBN|0-312-24738-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the passive voice the grammatical subject of the verb is the recipient (not the doer) of the action denoted by the verb.

Some languages, such as [[English language|English]] and  [[Spanish language|Spanish]], use a ''[[periphrasis|periphrastic]]'' passive voice; that is, it is not a single word form, but rather a construction making use of other word forms. Specifically, it is made up of a form of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to be'' and a past [[participle]] of the main verb. In other languages, such as [[Latin]], the passive voice is simply marked on the verb by [[inflection]]: ''librum legit'' "He reads the book"; ''liber legitur'' "The book is read".

==Middle==
{{anchor|The middle voice}}
{{further|Deponent verb|Reflexive verb|Mediopassive voice|Unaccusative verb}}

Some languages (such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Ancient Greek]]) have a '''middle voice''', which is a set of inflections or constructions which is to some extent different from both the active and passive voices. The middle voice is said to be in the middle between the active and the passive voices because the subject often cannot be categorized as either agent or patient but may have elements of both. For example, it may express what would be an [[intransitive verb]] in English. In ''The casserole cooked in the oven'', ''cooked'' is [[syntax|syntactically]] active but [[semantics|semantically]] passive. In Classical [[Greek language|Greek]], the middle voice often has a reflexive sense: the subject acts on or for itself, such as "The boy washes himself", or "The boy washes". It can be transitive or intransitive. It can occasionally be used in a causative sense, such as "The father causes his son to be set free", or "The father ransoms his son".

In English there is no verb form for the middle voice, though some uses may be classified by traditional grammarians as middle voice, often resolved via a [[reflexive pronoun]], as in "Fred shaved", which may be expanded to "Fred shaved himself" – contrast with active "Fred shaved John" or passive "John was shaved by Fred". This need not be reflexive, as in "my clothes soaked in detergent overnight". English used to have a distinct form, called the [[passival]], which was displaced over the early 19th century by the progressive passive and is no longer used in English.&lt;ref name="vuolo"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2012/05/lexicon_valley_when_the_progressive_passive_replaced_the_passival_in_english_grammar_.html "The House is Building"? Why you never learned the passival tense, even though it used to be proper English grammar.], by Mike Vuolo, ''Slate,'' May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2903 A peeve for the ages], January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the passival, one might say "The house is building.", which may today be rendered instead as "The house is being built." Likewise "The meal is eating.", which is now "The meal is being eaten." Note that the similar "Fred is shaving" and "the clothes are soaking" remain grammatical. It is suggested that the progressive passive was popularized by the [[Romantic poets]], and is connected with [[Bristol]] usage.&lt;ref name="vuolo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt and [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/David.denison Denison], "[http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/lel/staff/david-denison/papers/thefile,100129,en.pdf The language of the Southey-Coleridge Circle]", Language Sciences 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[deponent verb]]s in [[Latin]] (i.e., verbs passive in form but active in meaning) are survivals of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] middle voice.&lt;ref name="Sihler" section 414a&gt;Sihler, Andrew L, "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tcVTC9XJN-8C New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin]", 1995, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
Some languages have even more grammatical voices. For example, [[Classical Mongolian language|Classical Mongolian]] features five voices: active, passive, causative, reciprocal, and cooperative.  Hebrew has active, passive, causative, intensive and reflexive voices.

The [[antipassive voice]] deletes or demotes the object of transitive verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among [[ergative–absolutive language]]s (which may feature passive voices as well), but also occurs among [[nominative–accusative language]]s.

There are also constructions in some languages that appear to change the [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]] of a verb, but in fact do not. So called hierarchical or [[Inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] languages are of this sort. Their agreement system will be sensitive to an external person or animacy hierarchy (or a combination of both): 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 or Anim &gt; Inan and so forth. E.g., in [[Meskwaki]] (an Algonquian language), verbs inflect for both subject and object, but agreement markers do not have inherent values for these. Rather, a third marker, the direct or inverse marker, indicates the proper interpretation: ''ne-wa:pam-e:-w-a'' [1-look.at-DIR-3-3Sg] "I am looking at him", but ''ne-wa:pam-ekw-w-a'' [1-look.at-INV-3-3Sg] "He is looking at me". Some scholars (notably Rhodes) have analyzed this as a kind of obligatory passivization dependent on animacy, while others have claimed it is not a voice at all, but rather see inversion as another type of alignment, parallel to [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]], [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]], [[Active–stative language|split-S]], and [[Active–stative language|fluid-S]] alignments.

==Passive in topic-prominent languages==

=== Chinese ===

==== Mandarin ====
{{anchor|The passive voice in topic-prominent languages}}
[[Topic-prominent language]]s like [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] tend not to employ the passive voice as frequently. Mandarin-speakers construct the passive voice by using the [[Coverb#Chinese|coverb]] {{lang|zh|被}} (''bèi'') and rearranging the usual word order.&lt;ref&gt;Li &amp; Thompson (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this sentence using active voice:

Note: the first line is in Traditional Chinese while the second is Simplified Chinese.

:{{interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|lang2=zh-Hans|italics3=yes|glossing4 = no abbr
|狗 咬了 這個 男人。
|狗 咬了 这个 男人。
|Gǒu yǎo-le zhège nánrén.
|dog bite-PERFECT this man
|"A dog has bitten this man."}}

corresponds to the following sentence using passive voice. Note that the agent phrase is optional.

:{{interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|lang2=zh-Hans|italics3=yes|glossing4 = no abbr
|這個 男人 被 (狗) 咬了。
|这个 男人 被 (狗) 咬了。
|Zhège nánrén bèi'' (''gǒu'') ''yǎo-le.
|This man  PASSIVE dog bite-PERFECT
|"This man has been bitten (by a dog)."}}

In addition, through the addition of the auxiliary verb "to be" (''shì'') the passive voice is frequently used to emphasize the identity of the actor. This example places emphasis on the ''dog'', presumably as opposed to some other animal:

:{{interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|lang2=zh-Hans|italics3=yes|glossing4 = no abbr
|這個 男人 是 被 狗 咬了。
|这个 男人 是 被 狗 咬了。
|Zhège nánrén shì bèi gǒu yǎo-le.
|This man {to be}  PASSIVE dog bite-PERFECT
|"This man has been bitten by a ''dog''."}}
Mandarin has also a ''object-retaining passive'' which contains both object and topic (mostly the possessor of the object) :

:{{interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|lang2=zh-Hans|italics3=yes|glossing4 = no abbr
|他 被 小偷 偷了 錢包。
|他 被 小偷 偷了 钱包。
|tā bèi xiǎotou tōu-le qiánbāo
|He  PASSIVE  thief steal-PERFECT wallet
|"His wallet was stolen by a thief."}}

==== Cantonese ====
In [[Cantonese]], those features are quite similar by using the [[Coverb#Chinese|coverb]] {{lang|yue|俾}} (''bei2''), but the agent phrase is NOT optional, often with a formal agent 人(''jan4''):

:{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|glossing3 = no abbr
|個 男人 俾 狗 咬唨喇。
|Go3 naam4jan4 bei2 gau2 ngaau5-zo2-laa3
|The man  PASSIVE dog bite-PERFECTIVE-PERFECT
|"The man has been bitten by a dog."}}

:{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|glossing3 = no abbr
|佢 俾 人 打唨喇。
|Keoi5 bei2 jan4 daa2-zo2-laa3
|He  PASSIVE someone hit-PERFECTIVE-PERFECT
|"He has been beaten (by someone)."}}

However, in some dialects of [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], a passive voice with an optional agent phrase is also available:

Qinzhou ([[Qin-Lian Yue]] ):
:{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|glossing3 = no abbr
|佢 著 打喇。
|Ki3 zoek6 daa2-laa3
|He  PASSIVE beat-PERFECT
|"He has been beaten."}}

In the actor-emphasizing passive voice of Cantonese, besides the addition of the auxiliary verb "to be" (''hai6'') , the [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] event is also converted to a adjective-like predicative with the suffix {{lang|zh-Hant|嘅}}(''ge3'') or㗎(''gaa3''), which is a more emphasized one from the liaison of {{lang|zh-Hant|嘅}}(''ge3'') and 啊(''aa3''):

:{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|glossing3 = no abbr
|個 男人 係 俾 狗 咬唨 嘅
|Go3 naam4jan4 hai6 bei2 gau2 ngaau5-zo2 ge3
|The man {to be}  PASSIVE dog bite-PERFECTIVE {(adjective suffix)}
|"The man was bitten by a ''dog''."}}

=== Japanese ===
Although a topic-prominent language, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] employs the passive voice quite frequently, and has two types of passive voice, one that corresponds to that in English and an indirect passive not found in English. This indirect passive is used when something undesirable happens to the speaker.

:{{fs interlinear|lang = ja|glossing3 = no abbr
|彼 は 泥棒 に 財布 を 盗まれた。
|Kare wa dorobō ni saifu o nusumareta.
|He  TOPIC  thief  AGENT wallet  OBJECT steal-PASSIVE-PAST
|"His wallet was stolen by a thief."}}

:{{fs interlinear|lang = ja|glossing3 = no abbr
|僕 は 彼女 に 嘘 を つかれた。
|Boku wa kanojo ni uso o tsukareta.
|I  TOPIC her  AGENT lie  OBJECT tell-PASSIVE-PAST
|"I was lied to by her." (''or'' "She lied to me.") }}

==Impersonal Constructions==

===Fourth person in Finnic languages===&lt;!--links from [[Estonian grammar]]--&gt;
{{anchor|The fourth person in Baltic-Finnic languages}}
Some languages do not contrast voices, but have other similar constructions. For example, [[Finnic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] have a "passive", expressed by [[grammatical conjugation|conjugating]] the verb in "common person". Although it is generally referred to as the passive ("''passiivi''") in Finnish grammars, it may more appropriately be referred to as the [[fourth person]] form of a verb.

===Other impersonal forms===
Similarly in French and Welsh, impersonal forms are used: ''On lit le journal.''; ''Darllenir y papur newydd.'': "One reads the newspaper.", i.e., "The newspaper is read."

The function of the fourth person is simply to leave out the agent. The agent is almost always human and never mentioned. &lt;!-- Action is performed actively, so in Finnish the agent must be capable of own initiative; e.g., "a dog bit me" -&gt; "I was bitten", but "wind blew over a car" can't be converted into "a car was blown over". The latter would imply somebody or something either blowing over the car or otherwise causing the wind.--&gt;The grammatical role of the object remains unaltered, and thus [[transitive verb|transitivity]] may also be used. For example, the fourth-person construction ''Ikkuna hajotettiin'', with a transitive verb, means "Someone broke the window", while the third-person construction ''Ikkuna hajosi'' uses the [[Anticausative verb|anticausative]] and means "The window broke".

===Impersonal in Celtic languages===
{{anchor|The Impersonal in Celtic Languages}}

[[Celtic languages]] have an inflection commonly called the "impersonal" or "autonomous" form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Celtic Languages|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-01035-7|pages=14–15|author=Martin John Ball, James Fife}}&lt;/ref&gt; of similar origin{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} to the Latin "passive-impersonal". This is similar to a passive construction in that the agent of the verb is not specified. However its syntax is different from prototypical passives, in that the object of the action remains in the accusative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=GRAIMÉAR GAEILGE na mBRÁITHRE CRÍOSTAÍ|year=1960|publisher=M.H. Mac an Ghoill agus a Mhac Teo.|author=Na Bráithre Críostaí}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is similar to the use of the pronoun ''"on"'' in French (except wherever ''"on"'' is instead used an alternative to ''"we"'', which is very frequent). It increasingly corresponds to the passive in modern English, in which there is a trend towards avoiding the use of the passive unless it is specifically required to omit the subject. It also appears to be similar to the "fourth person" mentioned in the preceding paragraph. However, what is called in Irish ''an briathar saor'' or ''the free verb'' does not suggest passivity but a kind of generalised agency.

The construction has equal validity in transitive and intransitive clauses, and the best translation into English is normally by using the "dummy" subjects "they", "one", or impersonal "you". For example, the common sign against [[tobacco]] consumption has its closest direct translation in English as "No smoking":

:{{interlinear|lang = ga| glossing = no abbr
|Ná caitear tabac
|Don't use-IMPERSONAL tobacco.|}}

An example of its use as an intransitive is:

:{{interlinear|lang = ga| glossing = no abbr
|Téithear {go dtí} {an sráidbhaile} {go minic} {Dé Sathairn}
|Go-IMPERSONAL to {the village} often Saturday
|"People often go to the village of a Saturday."}}

The difference between the autonomous and a true passive is that while the autonomous focuses on the action and overtly avoids mentioning the actor, there is nonetheless an anonymous agent who may be referred to in the sentence. For instance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=Jim|title=the Grammar of Autonomy In Irish|journal=Hypothesis A/Hypothesis B: Linguistic Explorations in Honor of David M. Perlmutter|date=January 2007|url=http://ohlone.ucsc.edu/~jim/PDF/auton.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{interlinear|lang = ga| ablist = AUT:"autonomous" form of the verb
|Théití ag ithe béile {le chéile}
|go[PAST.HAB.AUT]  eat PROG  meal  {with each other}
|"People used to go  eating   a meal  together."}}

In English, the formation of the passive allows the optional inclusion of an agent in a prepositional phrase, "by the man", etc. Where English would leave out the noun phrase, Irish uses the autonomous; where English includes the noun phrase, Irish uses its periphrastic passive – which can also leave out the noun phrase:

:{{interlinear|lang2 = ga|italics1 = no| italics2 = yes
|The tobacco was smoked (by the man)
|Bhí an tabac caite (ag an bhfear)
|Was the tobacco consumed (by the man)|}}

The impersonal endings have been re-analysed as a passive voice in [[Modern Welsh]] and the agent can be included after the preposition ''gan'' (''by''):

:''Cenir y gân gan y côr.''
:The song is sung by the choir.

==Dynamic and static passive==
Some linguists draw a distinction between static (or stative) passive voice and dynamic (or eventive) passive voice in some languages. Examples include [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. "Static" means that an action was done to the subject at a certain point in time resulting in a state in the time focussed upon, whereas "dynamic" means that an action takes place.

===German===
{{anchor|In German}}
* Static passive auxiliary verb: '''sein'''
* Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''werden'''

: ''Der Rasen ist gemäht'' ("The lawn is mown", static)
: ''Der Rasen wird gemäht'' ("The lawn is being mown", literally "The lawn becomes mown", dynamic)

===English===
{{anchor|In English}}
* Static passive auxiliary verb: '''be''' (the "be-passive")
* Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''get''' (the "get-passive")

Note that for some speakers of English this is not accepted and is considered colloquial or sub-standard.

: ''The grass is cut'' (static)
: ''The grass gets cut'' or ''The grass is being cut'' (dynamic)

===Swedish===
{{anchor|In Swedish}}
* Static passive auxiliary verb: '''vara''' (är, var, varit)
* Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''bli''' (blir, blev, blivit)
Dynamic passive in Swedish is also frequently expressed with the s-ending.

: ''Dörren är öppnad.'' "The door has been opened."
: ''Dörren blir öppnad.'' "The door is being opened."

The '''vara''' passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, simply using the corresponding adjective:
:''Dörren är öppen.'' "The door is open."

The '''bli''' passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, the s-passive:
:''Dörren öppnas.'' "The door is opening."

===Spanish===
{{anchor|In Spanish}}
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two verbs corresponding to English ''to be'': ''ser'' and ''estar''. ''Ser'' is used to form the ordinary (dynamic) passive voice:

:''La puerta '''es''' abierta.'' "The door is [being] opened [by someone]"
:''La puerta '''es''' cerrada.'' "The door is [being] closed [by someone]"

However, this construction is very unidiomatic. The usual passive voice is the ''se pasiva'', in which the verb is conjugated in the active voice, but preceded by the ''se'' particle: 

:''La puerta '''se abre'''.''
:''La puerta '''se cierra'''.''

''Estar'' is used to form what might be termed a static passive voice (not regarded as a passive voice in traditional [[Spanish grammar]]):

:''La puerta '''está''' abierta.'' "The door is open.", i.e., it has been opened.
:''La puerta '''está''' cerrada.'' "The door is closed.", i.e., it has been closed.

In the ''ser'' and ''estar'' cases, the verb's participle is used as the complement (as is sometimes the case in English).

===Italian===
{{anchor|In Italian}}
[[Italian language|Italian]] uses two verbs (''essere'' and ''venire'') to translate the static and the dynamic passive:

Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: '''essere''' and '''venire''' ('''to be''' and '''to come''')
:''La porta '''è''' aperta.'' or ''La porta '''viene''' aperta''. "The door is opened [by someone]" or "The door '''comes''' open [by someone]".
:''La porta '''è''' chiusa.'' or ''La porta '''viene''' chiusa''. "The door is closed [by someone]" or "The door '''comes''' closed [by someone]".

Static passive auxiliary verb: '''essere''' (to be)
:''La porta '''è''' aperta''. "The door is open," i.e., it has been opened.
:''La porta '''è''' chiusa.'' "The door is closed," i.e., it has been closed.

===Venetian===
{{anchor|In Venetian}}
In [[Venetian language|Venetian]] (Vèneto) the difference between dynamic (true) passive and stative (adjectival) passive is more clear cut, using '''èser''' (to be) only for the static passives and '''vegner''' (to become, to come) only for the dynamic passive:

:''Ła porta '''ła vien''' verta''. "The door is opened", dynamic
:''Ła porta '''ła xè / l'è''' verta''. "The door is open", static

Static forms represents much more a property or general condition, whereas the dynamic form is a real passive action entailing "by someone":

:'''''èser''' proteto''. "To be protected = to be in a safe condition", static
:'''''vegner''' proteto''. "To be protected = to be defended (by so)", dynamic

:'''''èser''' considarà''. "To be considered = to have a (good) reputation", static
:'''''vegner''' considarà''. "To be taken into consideration (by people, by so)", dynamic

:'''''èser''' raprexentà (a l'ONU)''. "To be represented (at the UN) = to have a representation", static
:'''''vegner''' raprexentà a l'ONU (da un dełegà)''. "To be represented at the UN (by a delegate)", dynamic
