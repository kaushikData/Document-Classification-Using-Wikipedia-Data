The '''1st Danish Artillery Battalion''' ({{lang-da|1. Danske Artilleriafdeling, 1DAA}}) is a part of [[Army Combat and Fire Support Center]] and was created after under the [[Danish Defence Agreement 2013-2017]], after the ''[[Danish Artillery Regiment]]'' was disbanded. It is the only remaining military unit in the [[Royal Danish Army|Danish Army]] that is involved with artillery, and is therefore the bearer of the traditions of the former regiment and can trace its roots back to 1684.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nye myndigheder, nye baretmærker og farver|url=http://forsvaret.dk/HST/Nyt%20og%20Presse/forlig2013-17/Pages/Nyemyndigheder,nyebaretm%C3%A6rkerogfarver.aspx|website=Forsvaret.dk|language=Danish|access-date=2015-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024535/http://forsvaret.dk/HST/Nyt%20og%20Presse/forlig2013-17/Pages/Nyemyndigheder,nyebaretm%C3%A6rkerogfarver.aspx|archive-date=2015-11-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battalion is divided into a number of [[Artillery battery|batteries]] with around 500 personnel in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsvaret.dk/HST/om_haeren/Pages/default.aspx forsvaret.dk: om Hæren]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Directorate General for National Security''' ({{lang-ar|المديرية العامة للأمن الوطني}} (also '''DGNS''', '''The Sûreté Nationale''', or '''The Sûreté''') is the [[civil police]] of [[Algeria]]. It polices Algeria's larger cities and urban areas. The Sûreté is part of the [[Ministry of Interior (Algeria)|Ministry of Interior]] and is charged with maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, investigating crimes, and apprehending offenders. It also performs other routine police functions, including traffic control.

== Organization ==
[[File:Police Algérienne.jpg|280px|thumbnail|right|Agents from the police Algerian .]]
The Sûreté is headed by a Director General and in 2007 consisted of a force of 130,000 and is believed to be organized along the lines of the [[National Police (Algeria)|National Police]], with operational and investigative branches and supporting services.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judicial]] Police branch is responsible for [[criminal]] investigations, working in close coordination with the Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Ministry of Justice. Police are assigned to the capitals of the [[wilayat]] are under the nominal control of the individual governors. A special riot [[police]] force is equipped with modern riot-control gear. Although the police were able to cope with urban disturbances and violence during the early and mid-1980s, the [[military]] had to be called in to help quell the severe riots in late 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Study]] Algeria&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal security==
Elements of the Sûreté Nationale also play a role in countering threats to the government arising from political subversion. The Sûreté assigns police contingents to work with customs inspectors at legal points of entry to control illegal activities. Their main concerns are apprehending undesirable immigrants and contraband traffickers.  The [[Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité]] (DRS) is the Algerian state intelligence service. It is separate from Directorate General for National Security and was an active player in the [[Algerian Civil War]] of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Phillips (2008), passim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Kervyn and François Gèze.

'''Andorran nationality law''' is based primarily on the principle of [[jus sanguinis]].

==Eligibility for Andorran citizenship==

===By descent===

Children born to recognised parents who were Andorran citizens at the time of birth (regardless of the place of birth) are eligible for Andorran citizenship.

===By birth===

Children born in [[Andorra]] under any one of the following conditions are eligible for Andorran citizenship:

* born to parents of whom either one (or both) was born in Andorra and was living permanently and principally in Andorra at the time of birth
* born to non-Andorran parents who were living permanently and principally in Andorra for at least 10 years at the time of birth

===By naturalisation===

Those seeking to become Andorran citizens via [[naturalisation]] are required to fulfill the following criteria:

* they must renounce existing foreign citizenships
* they must have resided in Andorra permanently for at least ten years if the applicant has spent all of his mandatory education in Andorra or for at least 20 years if he/she can prove his/her integration into Andorran society

==Loss of citizenship==

If an Andorran citizen serves in the armed forces or government of another country or takes up a foreign citizenship, he/she automatically forfeits his/her Andorran citizenship.

Former Andorran citizens may restore their former citizenship if their request to the government is successful.

Any Andorran may live in France without requesting a visa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F16162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual nationality==

[[Multiple citizenship|Dual nationality]] is strictly forbidden by Andorran law. On the other hand, Spanish law, though, recognizes dual nationality with Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/Satellite/Portal/es/areas-tematicas/nacionalidad/nacionalidad/tener-doble-nacionalidad "citizens of (...) Andorra should not renounce to their previous nationality"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Caspe''' took place during the [[Aragon Offensive]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 16–17 March 1938.

==Background==

After the [[Battle of Teruel]], the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]] in Aragon was exhausted and badly equipped. In March 1938 a huge Nationalist force of 150,000 men and more than 900 planes started an offensive in Aragon, breaking the Republican front. Most of the units of the Republican Army fled and the retreat became a rout, but in some points others fought bravely.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. (2006). ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.'' Penguin Books. London. pp.324-325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Caspe.==
On 9 March the Nationalists advanced 36 kilometres, on 10 March they occupied [[Belchite]] held by the [[XV International Brigade]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated777"&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.777&lt;/ref&gt; and pushed forward to [[Caspe]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated777"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. (2006). ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.'' Penguin Books. London. p.325&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the commander in chief of the Republican army, [[Vicente Rojo Lluch|Vicente Rojo]] ordered to establish a defensive line with the town of Caspe at its centre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated777"/&gt; By 16 March three Nationalist divisions of the Varela’s Army, led by [[Fernando Barron|Fernando Barrón]], Muñoz Grandes and Bautista Sánchez, surrounded the town held by the XV International Brigade. The Brigade fought with great valour, but after two days of heavy fighting Caspe fell to the Nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.778&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Nationalists continued their advance and by 3 April occupied [[Lérida]].&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. (2006). ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939.'' Penguin Books. London. p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Ciudad Universitaria''' took place around the campus of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] between 15 and 23 November 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==History==
The battle took place in the first months of the Civil War in the [[University City of Madrid]], the new campus of Madrid’s Complutense University. It lasted for about a week, between 15 and 23 November 1936, following which the front stabilized until the end of the war. The aim of the Republican militias was the defence of the capital at any price, to achieve which they needed to stop the progress of the columns at the command of General Varela and avoid the fall of Madrid into rebel hands.&lt;ref name="Rojo"&gt;[[Vicente Rojo Lluch]], ''Así fue la defensa de Madrid: aportación a la historia de la Guerra de España, 1936–1939'' (1st edition). México (1967). Ediciones Era. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the attacking armies of the military rebellion on the other hand was to "take the city" within the shortest possible period of time.
This battle signalled the beginning of a new phase in the Spanish Civil war, for until then the [[Francoist]] troops had been advancing relatively unopposed across Spain, conquering large swathes of territory in a few months. But here, at the Ciudad Universitaria, for the first time, they encountered fierce and relentless opposition.&lt;ref name="Reverté"&gt;Jorge Martínez Reverte (2004). ''La Batalla de Madrid'' (1st edition). Barcelona: Crítica.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bellebranche Abbey''' ({{lang-fr|Abbaye de Bellebranche}}) is a former [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]] located in [[Saint-Brice, Mayenne|Saint-Brice]], [[Mayenne]], [[France]], founded in 1152 and suppressed during the [[French Revolution]].

==History==
Bellebranche Abbey was established by monks from [[Louroux Abbey]], in [[Anjou]], in 1150. The foundation was made final on 27 July 1152 by the gift of [[Robert III de Sablé]]. His son, [[Robert IV de Sablé]], confirmed and augmented his father's gift on the death of his wife, Clemence of Mayenne, and his departure for the [[Holy Land]] in 1190.

The foundation was confirmed by Popes [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] in 1165, [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]] in 1264, [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] and [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]]. Among the privileges of the monks was that of electing the [[abbot]] and the [[prior]], which they took care to have confirmed in 1498 by [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]].

The abbey was soon the richest of the Cistercian houses of Anjou and Maine, thanks to the generosity of the lords of Sablé, Château-Gontier, Laval, Craon, Sillé, Anthenaise and Rohan. 

The abbey was suppressed and sold off as a national asset in 1793.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">The '''Centre for Cultural Decontamination''' ({{lang-sr|Центар за културну деконтаминацију}}, ''Centar za kulturnu dekontaminaciju'') is an independent cultural institution located in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The centre was established in 1994 as a response to the political and cultural climate in Serbia. The centre works against "nationalism, xenophobia, intolerance, hatred and fear." The institute functions as a gallery, community and a professional forum. It was founded by [[Borka Pavićević]], previously a principal of the [[Yugoslav Drama Theater]].&lt;ref name=WeissKulic2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Srdjan Jovanovic|title=Nationalism and Catharsis: The Center for Cultural Decontamination, Belgrade|url=http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/culturaldecontamination.php|work=Mapping Conversations Issue 2|publisher=Cabinet Magazine|accessdate=27 May 2014|author2=Kulic, Vladimir |date=Spring 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote box|What I was saying was directed at one type of people that I passionately, frankly can not stand, not them personally, but the job they do, these centers for decontamination, where I ask the question of who has the right to put oneself in the role of some decontaminator, [to decontaminate] let's say me. Here we return to the Bible, who is the one who is allowed to cast a stone. I am and we all are contaminated, but who is the one who considers himself or herself pure enough to decontaminate us others. And then when you look through it a little bit it turns out that this is quite another matter. It's not about criticizing their community to the world, that's fine, but about ratting their community to the world for big money. That's something I am ready to die fighting against it. My whole life I am fighting against things that I think are not good and that cost me, of course, but it was worth it, but to do any of it for money, for foreign money, I am deliberately saying foreign money, because...you don't go outside to clean your own backyard, and if you do go outside to clean your own backyard, then cleaning your own backyard wasn't on your mind. Anyway, had I done what was expected from a large part of my profession, the so-called colleagues and so on, had I done what they [decontaminators] almost requested from me, somewhere in '94, '95, '96, and that was to return to Zagreb where I came from, today I would have been welcomed on the red carpet from those ladies and gentlemen who decontaminate this situation. I would have been welcomed as a symbol – here, we are fixing the situation, we are all brothers, we are all this, we are all that. Why – because that is a performance, because that is a show, and based on that performance someone says – fine, here you go the reward of $100,000.|—[[Ranko Munitić]], film &amp; TV critic, essayist, theorist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bećković|first=Olja|title=Kritika|url=http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/utisak_nedelje.php?nav_id=179537&amp;yyyy=2005&amp;mm=10|work=[[Utisak nedelje]]|publisher=[[B92]]|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=30 October 2005|language=serbian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425143617/http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/utisak_nedelje.php?yyyy=2005&amp;mm=10&amp;nav_id=179537|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''DeLoyd "Dutch" Thompson''' was a pioneering aviator of the early 20th century.

He was born in 1888&lt;!--Hundt source indicates 26 in 1914 --&gt; and grew up in [[Buffalo Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  As a pilot, he was part of the tradition of "[[Barnstorming|exhibition]]" pilots, travelling throughout countrysides and entertaining with their aeronautical feats.&lt;ref name=hundt&gt;{{cite news |last=Hundt |first=Brad |title=A century ago, a Washington man changed aviation |newspaper=[[Observer-Reporter]] |date=August 2, 2014 |url=http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20140802/NEWS01/140809905 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VVJseFGT?url=http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20140802/NEWS01/140809905 |archivedate=January 11, 2015 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 1914, Thompson set the [[flight altitude record]] by flying to a height of {{convert|15,256|ft|m}} over [[Overland Park, Kansas]] in his Day-Gyro plane.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  Because of the coldness at that altitude, he wore a sheepskin suit.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  When the plane ran out of fuel, he executed a spiral glide maneuver to return to earth.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  This feat, which placed him at the altitude of modern [[turboprop]] planes,  happened only 10 years after the [[Wright brothers]]' first flight.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  However, because of the advances in flight technology, the record did not last long.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;

In 1916, during the run-up to American involvement in [[World War I]], he tried to raise American awareness of the aerial warfare and to encourage greater protections for the East Coast, by launching [[pyrotechnics]] over [[Washington, D.C.]] .&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  He dropped packets reading, "This 'Bomb' is Harmless. Suppose it had contained [[Nitroglycerin|Nitro-Glycerine]] and was hurled by the ''[[Central Powers|enemy]]'' instead of by DeLloyd Thompson, who flies the American Flag? WAKE UP AND PREPARE"&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;

That same year, he broke the air speed record over Long Island by traveling 108.4&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;  He was the second American to [[Aerobatic loop|loop an airplane]].&lt;ref name=m1969 /&gt; He invented the undertaker's drop, a famous airplane maneuver.&lt;ref name=m1969 /&gt;  He was the second aviator in the world to sky-write with an airplane.&lt;ref name=m1969 /&gt;

In 1937, developed and constructed the DeLloydCabinaire, a 2 seat monoplane, but that venture failed, due in part to the continuing [[Great Depression]], and only 2 were ever built.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; That year, his last flight was a demonstration of that plane.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

Following his aeronautical career, he made an unsuccessful bid to become mayor of [[Washington, Pennsylvania]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  He also became the owner of a coal mine and worked as a construction contractor&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  He was in an automobile accident on [[U.S. Route 40 in Pennsylvania]] 1945.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  He died in Washington 1949 from heart failure.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;

[[File:DeLloyd Thompson plaque at Washington County Airport 1949.jpg|thumb|lef|150px|The plaque, created by [[Early Birds of Aviation]], which was installed at the [[Washington County Airport (Pennsylvania)|Washington County Airport]] in 1949.]]
On July 13, 1949, the DeLoyd Thompson Memorial Gates were dedicated at the [[Washington County Airport (Pennsylvania)|Washington County Airport]].&lt;ref name=m1969 /&gt;  The event, which was attended by 5,000, was marked with an [[airshow]] conducted by the [[Early Birds of Aviation]].&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;&lt;ref name=m1969&gt;{{cite news | title =Memorial for Dutch Thompson | newspaper =[[Observer-Reporter]] | date =September 8, 1969 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19690908&amp;id=KmteAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y2ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1654,675652 | accessdate =February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the grounds of the airport outgrew the gates.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;  In 1969, the plates from the gate were refurbished and airport administration building.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Barbara |title=Part of pioneer aviator’s legacy may return to Washington County Airport |newspaper=[[Observer-Reporter]] |date=November 25, 2013 |url=http://www.observer-reporter.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131125/NEWS01/131129514 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215043544/http://www.observer-reporter.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20131125%2FNEWS01%2F131129514 |archivedate=February 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the plates were removed from the grounds, and were at risk of being sold for scrap before being rescued by Margaret Thompson, DeLoyd's daughter-in-law.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;  They eventually were placed in the custody of the Washington County Historical Society at the [[F. Julius LeMoyne House]].&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;  In 2013 and 2014, Clay Kilgore, executive director of the Washington County Historical Society, led an effort to restore the plaques to the airport.&lt;ref name=hundt /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">The '''Deciates''' (Δεκιῆται) were a [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribe in the first few centuries BC. They lived in the [[Antibes]] area of what is now France, west of the river [[Var River|Var]] (Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:alphabetic%20letter=D:entry%20group=2:entry=deciates entry on Deciátes]; Cosson, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–23).

The Deciates had a town in the area, ''oppidum Deciatum'' but this was not Antibes itself (Pliny the Elder, Chorographia, 2.69):

:''In litoribus aliquot sunt cum aliquis nominibus loca: ceterum rarae urbes quia rari portus, et omnis plaga austro atque africo exposita est. Nicaea tangit Alpes, tangit oppidum Deciatum, tangit Antipolis.''

'''"Dreamin'"''' was the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Eddie Friel]].

The song is a ballad, with Friel singing about the dream he is having and how free he feels in it before he awakes.

The song was performed second on the night, following [[Poland]]'s [[Justyna]] with "[[Sama (song)|Sama]]" and preceding [[Germany]]'s [[Stone &amp; Stone]] with "[[Verliebt in Dich]]". At the close of voting, it had received 44 points, placing 14th in a field of 23. This result was something of a surprise, as Ireland had won the previous 3 Contests (and would in fact go on to win the next one).

The song caused some controversy in the lead-up to the contest as it was discovered to be very similar to a [[Julie Felix]] song called "Moonlight". The second-placed song in the national final was for a while considered for entry, until it was announced that "Dreamin'" could go through.

It was succeeded as [[Republic of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Irish representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 contest]] by [[Eimear Quinn]] with "[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]" which went on to win the contest for Ireland yet again.

This is an overview of the '''economy of [[Monaco]]'''. Monaco, situated on the French coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate.

The [[Principality]] has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no [[income tax]] and low business taxes and thrives as a [[tax haven]] both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. The state retains [[Monopoly|monopolies]] in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.

Though official economic statistics are not published, year 2011 estimates place the national product at $5.748 billion and the per capita income at $188,409. The unemployment rate is 2%, as of 2012.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mn.html]

Living standards are high and roughly comparable to those in the prosperous French metropolitan areas. Monaco does not publish national income figures; the estimates below are extremely rough.

==Background==
Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the rail link to France and a [[Monte Carlo Casino|casino]]. Monaco's economy is now primarily geared toward finance, commerce, and tourism.

==Modern times==
Low taxes have drawn many foreign companies to Monaco and account for around 75% of the $5.748  billion annual GDP income in (2011). Similarly, tourism accounts for close to 15% of the annual revenue, as the Principality of Monaco also has been a major center for tourism ever since the famed [[Monte Carlo Casino]], which was established in 1856. The casino is alluded to in the [[ABBA]] song ''[[Money, Money, Money]]''.

Financial and insurance activities, along with scientific and technical activities are main contributors to GDP of Monaco. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monacostatistics.mc/Economy-and-Finance/ GDP Gross Domestic Product]&lt;/ref&gt; Banking sector of Monaco is rather large: in 2015 consolidated banking assets 8.42 times exceeded the country's GDP. Banks operating in Monaco traditionally specialize in private banking, asset and wealth management services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebanks.eu/articles/banks-in-Monaco Banks in Monaco]&lt;/ref&gt;

An economic and customs union with France governs customs, postal services, telecommunications, and banking in Monaco. Before the [[euro]], Monaco used the [[French franc]]. Now part of the [[Eurozone]], but not the EU, Monaco mints [[Monegasque euro coins|its own euro coins]].

All residents pay tax in the form of 19.6% [[value-added tax]] on all goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Genta, Evelyne (Monaco Ambassador to the UK) ''Monaco Might Not Charge Residents Income Tax, But it's No Tax Haven'' ''The Telegraph'' 16 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Monaco is noted for its activity in the field of marine sciences. Its [[Oceanographic Museum]], formerly directed by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], is one of the most renowned institutions of its kind in the world. Monaco imports and exports products and services from all over the world. There is no commercial agriculture in Monaco; it is 100% urban.

==Tax haven==
Monaco levies no income tax on individuals. The absence of a personal income tax in the [[principality]], has attracted to it a considerable number of wealthy "tax refugee" residents from European countries who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco; celebrities such as Formula One drivers attract most of the attention, but the vast majority of them are less well-known business people.

In 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians, Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon, alleged that Monaco had lax policies with respect to money laundering, including within its famed casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not properly investigated.

In 1998, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued a first report on the consequences of the tax havens' financial systems. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in its last report, as well as Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia and the Marshall Islands, underlining its lack of co-operation as regards to financial information disclosure and availability.

In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: "The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN." The Principality is no longer blamed in the 2005 FATF report, as well as all other territories. However, since 2003, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven.

The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco is the only territory that refuses to perform the second round, initially forecast between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories are implementing the third and last round, planned between 2005 and 2007.

The '''Euro-Atlantic Center (EAC) '''is a independent [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[non-governmental organization]] uniting young professionals and students active in the field of international relations, Slovak foreign policy and security. The EAC was founded in 1999 by a group of students from Banská Bystrica, Slovakia. The headquarters of the organization is located at the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations of the [[Matej Bel University]] in Banská Bystrica. Since 2008, the EAC is also active at the [[University of Economics in Bratislava]], where the regional bureau is located.

== Aims ==
The EAC has two main goals:
# ''Towards its members'' - to practically prepare students for their future careers by developing their teamwork, managerial, journalistic, analytical and networking skills.
#''Towards the public'' - inform, educate and raise the awareness of young people and the general public about topics related to international and national security, as well as about international affairs focusing on NATO and the European Union.

== Projects ==
*''The Slovak Security Forum'' - The project represents Slovakia’s second biggest security conference, which traditionally opens the Slovak diplomatic season. Moreover, it represents one of the main pillars of the dialogue on national security in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teraz.sk/slovensko/lparizekslovensko-nechce-byt-len-konzume/283710-clanok.html |title= Slovenské bezpečnostné fórum |publisher=TASR |date= |accessdate=2018-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Visegrad Youth Forum'' - The project consists of several phases, which culminate in a three-day conference in Banská Bystrica. The entire project is organized and carried out in English with the participation of university students from all V4 member states. During the conference participants take part in a welcoming reception, panel discussions, workshops, full-day simulation and a field trip near Banska Bystrica.
*''Speaking Tours'' - Each year, the EAC embarks on a journey to a number of selected Slovak high schools and universities, aiming to bring important topics closer to a broader audience. Each past editions of the project focused on different main topics.
#2014 - This is NATO - on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the entry of the Slovak Republic to NATO,
#2015 - SK PRESS 2016 - the priorities of the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union,

'''External association''' was a hypothetical relationship between [[Ireland]] and the [[British Commonwealth]] proposed by [[Éamon de Valera]] in 1921–22, whereby Ireland would be a [[sovereign state]] associated with, but not a member of, the Commonwealth; the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] would be head of the association, but not [[head of state]] of Ireland. De Valera proposed external association as a compromise between [[isolationism|isolationist]] [[Irish republicanism]] on the one hand and [[Dominion]] status on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkings|first=M. A.|date=March 1981|title=Defence and the Role of Erskine Childers in the Treaty Negotiations of 1921|journal=Irish Historical Studies |volume=22|issue=87|pages=251–270: 253 |jstor=30075034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas a full republic could not be a member of the Commonwealth until the [[London Declaration]] of 1949, a Dominion could not be fully independent until the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].

External association was never implemented as such; however, de Valera's 1930s diplomacy reflected similar ideas, as did the Commonwealth's London Declaration.

==Origins==
Troy D. Davis suggests de Valera's thinking on external association was influenced, during his tour of the United States in 1919–20, by the US [[Sugar Intervention]] in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Troy D.|date=Spring 2006|title=Eamon de Valéra's Political Education: The American Tour of 1919-20|journal=New Hibernia Review / Iris Éireannach Nua|publisher=University of St. Thomas (Center for Irish Studies)|volume=10|issue=1|pages=65–78|jstor=20646520|doi=10.1353/nhr.2006.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Mansergh]] traces the first reference to "external association" to 27 July 1921, preceding a proposal by de Valera on 10 August for a [[treaty of free association]] between the [[Irish Republic]] and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Mansergh 1991, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; De Valera told Mansergh in 1965 that the idea of external association came to him "one morning as he was tying his bootlaces", shortly after [[Jan Smuts]]' exploratory visit following the June 1921 ceasefire which ended the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] (later called the Irish War of Independence).&lt;ref&gt;Mansergh 1997, pp.191–192&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1921, [[David Lloyd George]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK prime minister]], proposed negotiations into "how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire may best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/22769/page/639943 |title=Further Correspondence Relating to the Proposals of His Majesty's Government for an Irish Settlement. [In Continuation of the Correspondence contained in Cmd. 1470.]  |year=1921 |series=[[Command paper]]s |volume=Cmd.1539 |publisher=HMSO |page=11 |accessdate=17 February 2017 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Valera accepted and explained his concept of external association to the plenipotentiaries sent to London. Their head, [[Arthur Griffith]], later said de Valera told him the idea was to get out of the "straitjacket of the Republic" while "bringing Cathal along", referring to [[Cathal Brugha]], the staunchest republican in the [[Dáil ministry]].&lt;ref name="Coogan2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|title=Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xscRAhBt2JgC&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=17 May 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780312295110|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document No. 2==
The British ministers negotiating with the Irish plenipotentiaries rejected the idea of external association, and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] the two sides signed on 6 December 1921 provided for an [[Irish Free State]] with the same status as the [[Dominion of Canada]]. De Valera opposed this, and in the [[Second Dáil]] debate on the Treaty offered his alternative "Document No. 2", of which articles 2 to 6 described the "Terms of Association":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1922/01/10/00025.asp#N8 |title=Appendix 18: The President's alternative proposals|date=10 January 1922|work=Treaty debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#&lt;li value="2"&gt; That, for purposes of common concern, Ireland shall be associated with the States of the British Commonwealth, viz: the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], the [[Dominion of New Zealand]], and the [[Union of South Africa]].
# That when acting as an associate the rights, status, and privileges of Ireland shall be in no respect less than those enjoyed by any of the component States of the British Commonwealth.
# That the matters of "common concern" shall include Defence, Peace and War, Political Treaties, and all matters now treated as of common concern amongst the States of the British Commonwealth, and that in these matters there shall be between Ireland and the States of the British Commonwealth "such concerted action founded on consultation as the several Governments may determine".
# That in virtue of this association of Ireland with the States of the British Commonwealth citizens of Ireland in any of these States shall not be subject to any disabilities which a citizen of one of the component States of the British Commonwealth would not be subject to, and reciprocally for citizens of these States in Ireland.
# That, for purposes of the Association, Ireland shall recognise His Britannic Majesty as head of the Association.

De Valera, a former mathematics teacher, used [[Venn diagram]]s and other graphs to illustrate the relationships he envisaged between Ireland and the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/De_Valera_theory.html|title=De Valera's theory of external association|last=Ní Shúilleabháin|first=Cáit|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics|accessdate=5 June 2013|location=University of St Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have suggested the putative virtues of his proposal were too subtle and abstract to appeal to either supporters of the Treaty or republicans opposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akenson|first=D. H.|date=April 1971|title=Was De Valera a Republican?|journal=The Review of Politics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=33|issue=2|pages=233–253|jstor=1406252|doi=10.1017/s0034670500012250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curran|first=Joseph M.|date=Spring 1968|title=The Consolidation of the Irish Revolution, 1921-1923: The Free Staters|journal=Irish University Review|volume=5|issue=1|pages=36–50|jstor=25504816}}&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist reporting on the Dáil debate said of de Valera's presentation, "One felt, however, we were entering the region of pure [[casuistry]], nebulous, unpalpable and unreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/freestateorrepub00burcuoft#page/32/mode/1up |page=32 |title=Free state or republic?

==Rejection of association==
The Dáil [[Anglo-Irish Treaty Dáil vote|voted to accept the original Treaty]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1922/01/07/00003.asp#N243 Treaty debates 7 January 1922 c.345]&lt;/ref&gt; and de Valera resigned as [[President of Dáil Éireann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1922/01/09/00003.asp Treaty debates 9 January 1922 cc.349–380]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Irish Civil War]], he was nominal leader of the anti-Treaty side, although the military force was led by republicans who regarded external association as an unacceptable compromise. In June 1922, UK prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] sought clarification from the pro-Treaty [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]] that was drafting the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]; one question was:&lt;ref name="jstor30008695p396"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Grady|first=Joseph P.|date=November 1989|title=The Irish Free State Passport and the Question of Citizenship, 1921-4|journal=Irish Historical Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=26|issue=104|pages=396–405: 397 |jstor=30008695}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Is it intended by the Irish representatives that the I.F.S. shall be within the empire on the basis of common citizenship, or merely associated with it?
[[Arthur Griffith]]'s answer was:&lt;ref name="jstor30008695p396"/&gt;
:it is intended that the Irish Free State shall be, not merely associated with, but a member of and within the Community of nations known as the British Empire and on the basis of common citizenship as explicitly provided by the Treaty

The pro-Treaty [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] party formed the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] until 1932 and participated in the Commonwealth's [[Imperial Conference]]s.

==1930s developments==
{{see also|Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949}}
De Valera's [[Fianna Fáil]] party, founded in 1926, came to power in the Free State after the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 general election]] and proceeded to eliminate many of the symbols of the state's Dominion status, including the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1933/en/act/pub/0006/ Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933] [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt; and appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1933/en/act/pub/0045/print.html Constitution (Amendment No. 22) Act, 1933] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this implicitly abrogated the 1921 Treaty, the Privy Council ruled in 1935 that the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] empowered the Free State government to do so.&lt;ref name="mooreDecision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/(WebFiles)/34740D4947655F668025765E0036AE51/$FILE/Moore%20v%20AG_1935.rtf|title=Moore -v- Attorney General of the Irish Free State|work=Important Judgments|publisher=Courts Service|accessdate=2 November 2010|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936]] abolished the office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] and removed all [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|references to the monarch]] from the constitution, with most functions reassigned to [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|the Executive Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1936/en/act/pub/0057/ Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act, 1936] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936]], passed immediately afterwards, effected that the king continued to be head of state for external purposes, including [[treaty|treaties]] and [[Diplomatic accreditation|accrediting diplomats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1936/en/act/pub/0058/ Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, [[Constitution of Ireland|a new constitution]] came into effect. This made no mention of the British Commonwealth or monarchy, and established the office of [[President of Ireland]] with many of the internal functions of a head of state, including [[order of precedence|precedence]], [[pardon]], [[signing into law|signing laws]], and appointing [[Cabinet (government)|ministers]], [[Courts of the Republic of Ireland#Judges|judges]], and [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]].  Nevertheless, the External Relations Act remained in force by virtue of the Constitution's allusion to the British monarch in Article 29.4.2°:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html#article29_4_2 |nopp=Y  |title=Constitution of Ireland|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 29.4.2°|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0707624401  |format=PDF |url=https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Constitutional%20Review%20Group%201996.pdf#page=96 |title=Report |last=Constitution Review Group |series=Official publications |volume=Pn.2632 |year=1996 |publisher=Stationery Office |nopp=Y |pages=Article 29.4 |accessdate=24 July 2015 |location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|Deputy [James] Dillon]] ... asked was this State a republic, and were we a member State of the British Commonwealth. ... The position, as I conceive it to be, is this: We are an independent republic, associated as a matter of our external policy with the States of the British Commonwealth. To mark this association, we avail ourselves of the procedure of the External Relations Act ..., by which the King recognised by the States of the British Commonwealth therein named acts for us, under advice, in certain specified matters in the field of our external relations.
:And now, to Deputy Dillon's second question—are we or are we not a member of the British Commonwealth? That is a question for which the material necessary for a conclusive answer is not fully available. It depends on what the essential element is in the constitution of the British Commonwealth.
By contrast, Nicholas Mansergh wrote in 1948, "External association has never been put into practice because the United Kingdom and the oversea dominions have never recognized that it exists."&lt;ref&gt;Mansergh 1997, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Ireland and London Declaration==
Fianna Fáil lost power [[Irish general election, 1948|in 1948]], and [[Government of the 13th Dáil|the Inter-Party Government]]'s [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], which came into force in 1949, repealed the External Relations Act and declared the Irish state to be a republic, implicitly leaving the Commonwealth. With the prospect of [[Dominion of India|newly independent India]] also [[Republic Day (India)|declaring a republic]], the Commonwealth leaders agreed in the [[London Declaration]] of 28 April 1949 that republics could be members of the Commonwealth, while the British monarch would remain [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

The '''Federated States of Micronesia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Micronesia.ogg|ˌ|m|aɪ|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|n|iː|ʒ|ə}}; abbreviated '''FSM''' and also known simply as '''Micronesia''') is an independent republic [[associated state|associated to]] the [[United States]]. It consists of four [[Federal state|states]]{{spaced ndash}} from west to east, [[Yap State|Yap]], [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], [[Pohnpei State|Pohnpei]] and [[Kosrae State|Kosrae]]{{spaced ndash}}that are spread across the [[Western Pacific Ocean]]. Together, the states comprise around 607 islands (a combined [[land area]] of approximately {{convert|702|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) that cover a [[Longitude|longitudinal]] distance of almost {{convert|2700|km|0|abbr=on}} just north of the [[equator]]. They lie northeast of [[New Guinea]], south of [[Guam]] and the [[Marianas]], west of [[Nauru]] and the [[Marshall Islands]], east of [[Palau]] and the [[Philippines]], about {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} north of eastern [[Australia]] and some {{convert|4000|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of the main islands of [[Hawaii]].

While the FSM's total land area is quite small, it occupies more than {{convert|2600000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Ocean]], giving the country the 14th largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/01/daily-chart-10?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/dc/st/dropsintheocean|title=Drops in the ocean: France’s marine territories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] [[Island country|island nation]]s capital is [[Palikir]], located on [[Pohnpei Island]], while the largest city is [[Weno]], located in the [[Chuuk Atoll]].

Each of its four states is centered on one or more main [[high island]]s, and all but Kosrae include numerous outlying [[atoll]]s. The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the [[Caroline Islands]] in the wider region of [[Micronesia]], which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term ''Micronesia'' may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.

The FSM was formerly a part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI), a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986 under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the [[Marshall Islands|Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (RMI) and the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]] (ROP). The FSM has a seat in the United Nations.

The ancestors of the Micronesians settled over four thousand years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on [[Yap Island]].

[[Nan Madol]], consisting of a series of small [[artificial island]]s linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about [[Anno Domini|AD]] 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.

European explorers—first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in search of the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] ([[Indonesia]]) and then the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]—reached the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the [[Spanish East Indies]] through the capital, [[Manila]], and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of ''Santiago de la Ascension'' in what today is [[Kolonia]] on the island of Pohnpei.

Following defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]], the Spanish sold the archipelago to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899 under the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany incorporated it into [[German New Guinea]].

During [[World War I]], it was captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the war, the [[League of Nations]] awarded a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] for Japan to administer the islands as part of the [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|South Pacific Mandate]].

During [[World War II]], a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in [[Truk Lagoon]]. In February 1944, [[Operation Hailstone]], one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.

Following World War II, it was administered by the [[United States]] under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].

On May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] chose not to participate. The FSM signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683|Security Council Resolution 683]]. The Compact was renewed in 2004.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

The Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the [[Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia|1979 constitution]], which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators—one from each state—serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.

The president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.

===Defense and foreign affairs===
{{main|Compact of Free Association}}

In international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly - Overall Votes - Comparison with U.S. vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626185544/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf |date=June 26, 2017 }} lists Micronesia as in the country with the fourth high coincidence of votes. Micronesia has always been in the top four.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSM is a sovereign, self-governing state in [[Associated state|free association]] with the [[United States|United States of America]], which is wholly responsible for its defense. The Division of Maritime Surveillance operates a paramilitary Maritime Wing and a small [[Water police|Maritime Police]] Unit. The Compact of Free Association allows [[nationality law of the Federated States of Micronesia|FSM citizens]] to join the U.S. military without having to obtain U.S. permanent residency or citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-army-info.com/pages/pdfs/enlistment_standards.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081001231147/http://www.us-army-info.com/pages/pdfs/enlistment_standards.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-01|title=U.S. Military Enlistment Standards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for immigration and employment for Micronesians in the U.S., and establishes economic and technical aid programs.

FSM has foreign relations with 56 countries, including the [[Holy See]]. FSM was admitted to the [[United Nations]] based on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]'s recommendation on August 9, 1991 in Resolution 703 and the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]'s approval on September 17, 1991 in Resolution 46/2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/46/2 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/2, ''Admission of the Federated States of Micronesia to Membership in the United Nations,'' adopted 17 September 1991.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903224742/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F46%2F2 |date=September 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSM is an active member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federated States of Micronesia|url = https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/fsm|website = U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate = 2016-12-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161023081319/https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/fsm|archive-date = October 23, 2016|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed sovereignty===
[[Spain]] has a claim to [[sovereignty]] over a few islands including [[Kapingamarangi]] in [[Pohnpei State]].  A commission of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under [[Pope Leo XIII]] arbitrated a dispute for the [[Caroline Islands]] and others extending from the [[Equator]] to 11°N [[Latitude]] and from 133°E to 164°E [[Longitude]].  [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] on 17 December 1885 agreed in a [[treaty]] that they were a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]].  In 1899, Spain sold "las  Carolinas" to Germany.   Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], not [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] or [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]].  In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never [[Cession|ceded]] by Spain; therefore, Spain retained [[sovereignty]].  In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued the following declaration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Successive Spanish governments have not abandoned Spain's sovereignty, or insisted on enforcing it, or recognized the sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia over Kapingamarangi.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberanía española en Oceanía'', Instituto de Estudios Africanos, CSIC, Madrid, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Zay ''Territories under Spanish Sovereignty in Oceania'' (partial translation of Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberanía española en Oceanía''), Palau Museum, Koror, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The Federated States of Micronesia claims sovereignty and has [[de facto]] control of the island.

==Geography==
[[File:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of Kolonia Town from Sokehs Ridge in [[Pohnpei]].]]
{{main|Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

The Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 [[island]]s extending {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} across the [[archipelago]] of the [[Caroline Islands]] east of the [[Philippines]]. The islands have a combined area of {{convert|702|km2|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The islands are grouped into four states, which are [[Yap State|Yap]], [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] (called Truk until January 1990), [[Pohnpei State|Pohnpei]] (known as "Ponape" until November 1984), and [[Kosrae]] (formerly Kusaie). These four states are each represented by a white star on the national flag. The capital is [[Palikir]], on Pohnpei.

==Transportation==
The Federated States of Micronesia is served by four international airports.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

Economic activity in the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily of [[subsistence farming]] and [[fishing]]. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade [[phosphate]]. [[longline fishing|Long line]] fishing of [[tuna]] is also viable with foreign vessels from [[China]] that operated in the 1990s. The potential for a [[tourist industry]] exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. [[United States foreign aid|Financial assistance from the U.S.]] is the primary source of revenue, with the U.S. pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in 1986–2001;{{update inline|date=June 2016}} the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] lists high dependence on U.S. aid as one of the main concerns of the FSM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/SIDS-states/profiles/fed_st_micronesia.htm |title=Federated States of Micronesia |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=17 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130043513/http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/sid/SIDS-states/profiles/fed_st_micronesia.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ulithi-Dancers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|People performing a welcome ceremony on [[Ulithi]] atoll.]]
The indigenous population of the nation, which is predominantly Micronesian, consists of various ethnolinguistic groups. It has a nearly 100% Pacific Islander and [[Asian people|Asian]] population: [[Chuukese people|Chuukese]] 48.8%, [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]] 24.2%, [[Kosraean language|Kosraean]] 6.2%, [[Yapese people|Yapese]] 5.2%, [[Yap]] outer islands 4.5%, [[Asian ethnic groups|Asian]] 1.8%, [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] 1.5%, other 6.4%, unknown 1.4%. A sizeable minority also have some [[Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia|Japanese ancestry]], which is a result of intermarriages between Japanese settlers and Micronesians during the Japanese colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr12120a.htm President Emanuel Mori Meets With Japan Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015858/http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr12120a.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}; [http://www.aesonline.org/3056 AESonline.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070616091249/http://www.aesonline.org/3056 |date=June 16, 2007 }} Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a growing expatriate population of Americans, Australians, Europeans, and residents from China and the Philippines since the 1990s. [[English language|English]] has become the common language of the government, and for secondary and tertiary education. Outside of the main capital towns of the four FSM states, the local languages are primarily spoken. Population growth remains high at more than 3% annually, offset somewhat by net emigration.

===Languages===
English is the official and common language. Also spoken are [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]], [[Kosraean language|Kosraean]], [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]], [[Yapese language|Yapese]], [[Ulithian language|Ulithian]], [[Woleaian language|Woleaian]], [[Nukuoro language|Nukuoro]], and [[Kapingamarangi language|Kapingamarangi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other languages spoken in the country include [[Pingelapese]], [[Ngatikese]], [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]], [[Puluwatese language|Puluwatese]], [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese]], and [[Mokilese language|Mokilese]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} There are about 3,000 speakers of Kapingamarangi and [[Ulithian language|Ulithian]], and under 1,000 speakers of [[Nukuoro language|Nukuoro]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Most Micronesians are [[Christian]].

United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Most Protestant groups trace their roots to American Congregationalist missionaries.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; On the island of Kosrae, the population is approximately 7,800; 95 percent are Protestants.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; On [[Pohnpei]], the population of 35,000 is evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics.

The [[sport]] of [[Association football|football]] in the Federated States of Micronesia is run by the [[Federated States of Micronesia Football Association]]. They control the [[Micronesian Games|Micronesian games]], the nation's football championship and the [[Federated States of Micronesia national football team|Micronesia National Football Team]].

=== FSMAA ===
[[Federated States of Micronesia Athletic Association|The Federated States of Micronesia Athletic Association]] is the governing body for the country's [[Sport|sports]] and athletics.[[File:Yap Stone Money.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A large (approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;m or about 8&amp;nbsp;ft in height) example of Yapese stone money ([[Rai stones]]) in the village of Gachpar.]]

==Culture==
{{see also|Music of the Federated States of Micronesia}}

Each of the four states has its own culture and traditions, but there are also common cultural and economic bonds that are centuries old. Cultural similarities include the importance of the traditional extended family and clan systems and are found on all the islands.

The island of Yap is notable for its "stone money" ([[Rai stones]]), large disks usually of calcite, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter, with a hole in the middle. The islanders, aware of the owner of a piece, do not necessarily move them when ownership changes. There are five major types: ''Mmbul'', ''Gaw'', ''Ray'', ''Yar'', and ''Reng'', the last being only {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. Their value is based on both size and history, many of them having been brought from other islands, as far as [[New Guinea]], but most coming in ancient times from [[Palau]]. Approximately 6,500 of them are scattered around the island.

Pohnpei is home to ''[[Nan Madol]]: Ceremonial Centre of Eastern Micronesia'', a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], but the site is currently listed as ''In Danger'' due to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1503|title=Nan Madol: Ceremonial Centre of Eastern Micronesia - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=|first=|date=7 August 2018|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807221707/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1503|archive-date=7 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is working on the conservation of the site.

===Literature===
There have been very few published literary writers from the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guam.mvarietynews.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4591%3Aseeking-micronesian-literary-writers&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=2 "Seeking Micronesian literary writers"], ''Marianas Variety'', February 18, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928150350/http://guam.mvarietynews.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4591%3Aseeking-micronesian-literary-writers&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=2 |date=September 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Emelihter Kihleng]] became the first ever Micronesian to publish a collection of poetry in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/oia/press/2008/05122008b.html "Micronesian Poet Publishes Collection of Poems"], Office of Insular Affairs, May 12, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229151437/http://www.doi.gov/oia/press/2008/05122008b.html |date=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The register is maintained by the [[:fi:Patentti-_ja_rekisterihallitus|Finnish Patent and Registration Office]].

== Content ==

The content of the Trade Register is specified by Finnish law.

=== Identifier ===

When a start-up notification is filed with the Trade Register or the Register of Foundations, the new business or foundation receives its Business&amp;nbsp;ID ({{lang-fi|'''Y-tunnus''', Yritys- ja yhteisötunnus}}, {{lang-sv|'''FO-nummer''', Företags- och organisationsnumret}}).

== Public availability ==

The particulars reported by a company in its notice to the Trade Register and the documents attached to the notice are all public information.

The '''''Gascony Show''''' is an English-language radio [[chat show]] aired in the southwest of France and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]]&lt;ref name=radiocoteaux1774922&gt;[http://www.radiocoteaux.com/emissionsthematiques.php "Emissions thématiques sur le site officiel de radio coteaux, frequences 104.4 et 97.7 FM"] By Patrick Martinez, Radio Coteaux&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Gascony]] region. The show is presented by Irishman John Slattery.

==The show==
[[File:John Slattery Gascony Show.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Slattery, the Gascony Show host in the radio studio.|''The Gascony Show'' host, John Slattery, in the studio in Saint Blancard]]
John Slattery takes over the airwaves at 5pm and finishes at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. The ''Gascony Show'' is a music-based programme that includes light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the host. Listeners' views and comments are discussed and there are rotating segments such as "Song of The Week" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big "Bag O Topics."

Podcasts of all previous shows&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5436793&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/podcasts/GasconyShowPodcasts.xml "The Gascony Show Podcasts"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt; are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5434434&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/the-gascony-show/id455503319 "The Gascony Show on iTunes"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invited guests==

The show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests,&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2334923&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/archives.html "The Gascony Show Archives"] Recorded shows with guests.&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2345213&gt;[http://web.me.com/claire.jefferson/StellaWulf/StopPress.html "Stella Wulf, News &amp; Events"] Interview, Sunday, 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stella is the author of "The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales," "Rum Rhymes and Vagabond" and "The Song of the Froom." She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.

Subsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew.&lt;ref name=pkmediapromotions6456442&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMediaPromotions "The Gascony Show Channel"] Produced by PK Media Promotions.&lt;/ref&gt; These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of [[Peter Gabriel]] and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

A highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding,&lt;ref name=leaffielding5437658&gt;[http://www.leaffielding.com/news.html "Leaf Fielding on the Gascony Show"] Interview, Sunday, 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called [[Operation Julie]]. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book ''To Live Outside The Law'',&lt;ref name=leaffielding1116349&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/07/leaf-fielding-outside-law-drugs "To Live Outside The Law"] By The Guardian, Thursday, 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.

==Regular contributors==

The show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local [[expatriates]] living in the Gascony region.

Hefeydd Hen, according to legend, tried to force his daughter Rhiannon to be married against her will to [[Gwawl]]. She met [[Pwyll]] of [[Dyfed]] and fell in love, planning to marry in one year and one day at his court on his estate. In accordance with the plan, they tried to marry but were thwarted by Clud and his son Gwawl. They put the wedding off for a further year. Pwyll and Rhiannon then went to Hefeydd’s court; he dressed as a beggar, asking for food. By a trick, Gwawl was captured and killed and Hefeydd was forced to allow Rhiannon to marry Pwyll in his court and then let her to return to [[Arberth]].&lt;ref name="mab" /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Caeawg, the leader, armed was he in the noisy conflict;&lt;br /&gt;
His was the foremost part of the advanced division, in front of the hosts.&lt;br /&gt;
Before his blades fell five battalions.&lt;br /&gt;
Of the men of Deivyr and Brenneich, uttering groans:&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty hundred perished in one hour.&lt;br /&gt;
Sooner did his flesh go to the wolf, than he to the nuptial feast;&lt;br /&gt;
He sooner became food for the raven, than approached the altar;&lt;br /&gt;
Before he entered the conflict of spears, his blood streamed to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2228">'''IBM Laboratory Vienna''' was an [[IBM]] research laboratory based in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

The laboratory started with a group led by [[Heinz Zemanek]] that moved from the [[Technische Hochschule]] (now the [[Technical University of Vienna]]).&lt;ref name="jones90"&gt;{{cite book| first=Cliff B. | last=Jones | authorlink=Cliff Jones (computer scientist) | title=Systematic software development using VDM | publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] | year=1990 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the group worked on [[computer hardware]] projects. Later a [[compiler]] for the [[ALGOL 60]] programming language was produced. The group built on ideas of [[Calvin Elgot|Calvin C. Elgot]], [[Peter Landin]], and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], to create an [[operational semantics]] that could define the whole of IBM's [[PL/I]] programming language. The [[meta-language]] used for this was dubbed by people outside the laboratory as the [[Vienna Definition Language]] (VDL). These descriptions were used for [[compiler design]] research into compiler design during 1968–70.&lt;ref name="jl71"&gt;{{cite article| | first1=Cliff B. | last1=Jones | first2=Peter | last2=Lucas | authorlink2=Peter Lucas (computer scientist) | title=Proving correctness of implementation techniques | editor-first1=E. | editor-last1=Engeler | work=A Symposium on Algorithmic Languages | volume=188 | series=[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]] | pages=178–211 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[formal method]] VDM ([[Vienna Development Method]]) was a result of research at the laboratory by [[Dines Bjørner]], [[Cliff Jones (computer scientist)|Cliff Jones]], [[Peter Lucas (computer scientist)|Peter Lucas]], and others.&lt;ref name="jones90" /&gt;

[[File:Karain - Cave Chamber.jpg|thumb|Second chamber]]
'''Karain Cave''' ({{lang-tr|'''Karain Mağarası'''}}) is a [[Paleolithic]] archaeological site located at ''Yağca Village'' {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Antalya]] city in the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] region of [[Turkey]].

==Overview==
The Karain prehistoric site is situated {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level and about {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the eastern slope of [[Beşparmak Mountains|Sam Dağı Mountain]] (''Mount Katran''), where the western [[Taurus Mountains]] [[limestone|calcareous]] zone borders on the ''[[Travertine]] Plain''. Karain is a complex of caves that consists of three main chambers and corridors, separated by calcite walls, narrow curves and passageways. Halls and galleries contain [[speleothem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/666/ |title=Karain Cave - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |newspaper=unesco |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
A fragment of a [[Neanderthal]] cranium discovered and dated confirms human habitation since the early [[Paleolithic]] age between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;*XVIII. International symposium on excavation, research and archaeometry, '''''The importance of Anatolian Paleolithic under the light of 1985-1995 Karain excavations''''', Dr. Kadriye Özçelik, Işın Yalçınkaya et al. (27 May 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*XXVI. International symposium on excavation, research and archaeometry, '''''2003 Karain excavations''''', Dr. Kadriye Özçelik, Işın Yalçınkaya et al. (24 May 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers documented the continuity of human presence in the cave for a period of more than 25,000 years, from the [[Mesolithic]], through the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Chalcolithic]], to the [[Bronze Age]]. It is assumed that during the time of [[Ionia|Greek colonization of Asia Minor]] ([[Iron Age]]), the cave had a religious function, as Greek inscriptions and decorations suggest, that are carved into the rock in front of the entrance.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://turkisharchaeonews.net/site/karain-cave |title=Karain Cave |publisher=Turkish archaeo news |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifacts===
Paleolithic and Neolithic flint blades, scrapers and arrowheads, some made in [[Levallois technique]] were discovered. In the subsequent layers lithic figurines and bone sculptures have been found, that suggest relations to the nearby [[Hacılar|Hacılar culture]]. The attention of researchers was especially drawn to the carving of a human face, stylistically similar to the products of the [[Natufian culture]] which flourished in the [[Levant]] during the Mesolithic period. This discovery may corroborate a commercial relationship of the population of southern Asia Minor and Palestine.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

The [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] hosts an extensive collection of Karain artifacts.

==History==
De Forenede Dampvaskerier was founded by Kristian Peter Thorgaard when he Lunds Lunds Kitteldepot in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/navne/53-familien-eikemo-thorgaard-omsaetning-rundede-15-mia.-kr|title=53 Familien Eikemo Thorgaard: Omsætning rundede 1,5 mia. kr.|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he acquired another company, Kivi. The name of his company was changed to Kivi Kittel and later to Kivi-Tex.

Kivi-Tex acquired Danish service company Elite Miljø in 2004. In 2017, it acquired Swedish textile services company Textilia from Accent Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfd.dk/om-dfd/textilia|title=Lavare Holding gets a new owner – Accent Equity divests to De Forenede Dampvaskerier|website=dfd.dk|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter beacons''' are [[radio transmission]]s of uncertain origin and unknown purpose, consisting of only a single repeating [[Morse code]] letter. They have been classified into a number of groups according to transmission code and [[frequency]], and it is supposed that the source for most of them is Russia.

(Some beacons sending Morse code letters are well known directional or [[non-directional beacon]]s for [[radio navigation]]. These are not discussed in this article.)

Letter beacons have been referred to as:
* SLB, or "Single Letter Beacons"
* SLHFB, or "Single Letter High Frequency Beacons"
* SLHFM, or "Single Letter High Frequency Markers"
* Cluster beacons
* MX — an ENIGMA&lt;ref group="NOTES"&gt;''E.N.I.G.M.A.'' stands for "European Numbers Information Gathering and Monitoring Association". It was a unique association of radio listeners based in the United Kingdom and active during the 1990s. They issued a printed bulletin every few months, which was mailed to subscribers. All 18 issues of the ENIGMA bulletin contained interesting information about odd and mysterious [[high frequency]] transmissions, contributed from radio listeners worldwide. The reception logs were organized, collated and analyzed by the core ENIGMA staff. The coverage was mostly about so-called [[numbers stations]], but there was also some coverage of letter beacons. The ENIGMA bulletins were not archived in libraries and it is difficult to obtain copies today. The major achievement of ENIGMA was the systematic classification and naming of the numerous radio oddities, which were previously described by different and conflicting names in various publications. The original ENIGMA group was disbanded in 2000. In his farewell letter, ENIGMA co-founder Mike G. wrote that all ENIGMA publications and research material would be deposited at the [[British Library]] ([[Boston Spa]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and ENIGMA-2000&lt;ref group="NOTES"&gt;[http://www.apul64.dsl.pipex.com/enigma2000/ ENIGMA-2000] is an Internet based community with the same general interests as the old ENIGMA association and with wider coverage of general [[intelligence]] matters. This group produces a regular newsletter and maintains the old ENIGMA station naming scheme. ENIGMA-2000 shows less interest in letter beacons than its predecessor.&lt;/ref&gt; designation.

==Transmission locations==
These radio transmissions were discovered in the late 1960s. Their presence became known to the wider amateur radio community in 1978, when beacon “W” started transmitting on 3584&amp;nbsp;kHz, in the [[80 meters]] band. There is indirect evidence that this particular transmitter was located in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1982 there were also reports, supposedly based on [[Huff-Duff|HF direction finding]] by the US military, that beacon “K” transmitting on 9043&amp;nbsp;kHz was located at {{coord|48|30|N|134|58|E|}}, near the city of [[Khabarovsk]] in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to D.W. Schimmel, in 1986 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) released the following [[Huff-Duff|HF direction finding]] results for single letter beacons, all of which indicate locations in the USSR:&lt;ref name="Schimmel"/&gt;

The link with the USSR and, more recently, Russia is further supported by the existence of single letter beacons transmitting letters existing only in the [[Other alphabets in Morse code|Cyrillic Morse code alphabet]].

The ENIGMA group also accepted these locations for cluster beacons "C", "D", "P" and "S", adding Vladivostok for beacon "F".&lt;ref name="ENIGMA18"&gt;{{cite journal

Transmissions of the "P" beacon in December 2007, even on [[medium frequency]] (420 and 583&amp;nbsp;kHz), suggest the Russian naval base at Kaliningrad as a possible source.&lt;ref name="RConnolly"&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=32
| publisher=PW Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaliningrad officially uses the [[ITU]] registered [[call sign]] ''RMP''.

==Types==
The single letter beacons can be classified into two groups, "cluster beacons" and "channel markers". A beacon "P" exists in both groups. A third group, called FSK beacons, is now extinct. The following sections list the beacons currently (December 2007) active, according to published listeners’ reports.

===Cluster beacons===
[[File:Screen capture of cluster letter beacons.gif|thumb|Radio spectrum screenshot showing cluster beacons "D" on 7038.7&amp;nbsp;kHz and "C" on 7039.0&amp;nbsp;kHz]]
A group of radio beacons with single-letter identifiers ("C", "D", "M", "S", "P", "A", "M" and "K") have been regularly reported near 3594, 4558, 5154, 7039, 8495, 10872, 13528, 16332 and 20048&amp;nbsp;kHz. The term "cluster beacons" is frequently used for them, as they transmit in parallel on frequencies only 0.1&amp;nbsp;kHz apart. These beacons transmit only their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.

The following call signs and frequencies of cluster beacons have been reported recently (September 2007 to November 2008) in Numbers&amp;Oddities newsletter,&lt;ref name="Numbers&amp;Oddities newsletter"&gt;[http://www.numbersoddities.nl Numbers&amp;Oddities newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; Utility DX Forum&lt;ref name="Utility DX Forum"&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/UDXF/ Utility DX Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and ENIGMA-2000:&lt;ref name="ENIGMA-2000"&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/enigma2000/ ENIGMA-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, some cluster beacons (especially "F" and "M") have been reported transmitting on frequencies different from their regular channel for short periods.

===Solitary beacons and channel markers===
A second family of letter beacons includes all those operating outside the clusters. For this reason, they are often called "solitary beacons" or "solitaires". They also transmit their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.

A few solitary beacons, like "R" on 4325.9 and 5465.9&amp;nbsp;kHz, operate exactly like the cluster beacons, sending only their single letter identifier.

However, the majority of solitary beacons, most notably "P" on various MF and HF frequencies, transmit their single-letter identifier in Morse code. Sometimes the routine transmission is interrupted and brief messages are sent in fast Morse code or in an FSK digital mode. Therefore, a more appropriate term for these beacon-like single-letter transmissions is "channel markers",&lt;ref name="Orr1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poundstone"/&gt; as their purpose is to occupy and identify a particular HF transmission channel when no traffic is transmitted. There is no evidence that the cluster beacon "P" and the solitary beacon "P" are directly related.

It was reported in "Numbers and Oddities", issue 142, that beacon C on 8000&amp;nbsp;kHz also transmitted messages under the regular call sign RIW, which is allocated to a Russian naval communication station in Khiva, Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ary Boender |title=Numbers &amp; Oddities, issue 142 |url=http://www.numbersoddities.nl/2009.zip |format=ZIP |date=July 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925205846/http://numbersoddities.nl/2009.zip |archivedate=September 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a few oddities transmitting signals with poor modulation and irregular timing, like "V" on 5342 and 6430.7&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The following call signs and frequencies of solitary beacons and markers have been reported recently (September 2007 to September 2009) in Numbers&amp;Oddities newsletter,&lt;ref name="Numbers&amp;Oddities newsletter"/&gt; Utility DX Forum&lt;ref name="Utility DX Forum"/&gt; and ENIGMA-2000:&lt;ref name="ENIGMA-2000"/&gt;

===FSK beacons===
This group includes the "K" and "U" beacons, which are no longer active. They transmitted their Morse code single letter identification by shifting the frequency of the carrier by approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. This mode of "FSK-CW" is designated F1A. The use of FSK indicated that the transmitter was suitable for FSK data transmissions, like [[radioteletype]].

==ENIGMA designation==
ENIGMA devised a naming scheme for all stations in their sphere of interest. In the original scheme, the following identifications were issued to letter beacons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | journal=ENIGMA Newsletter
 | title=Station Naming

ENIGMA-2000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/enigma2000 ENIGMA-2000]&lt;/ref&gt; the Internet-based ENIGMA successor group, revised the original ENIGMA designators. The current designations for letter beacons are the following (since 2007):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Applications==
The purpose of the letter beacons is not yet known with certainty. Many theories have appeared in specialized publications, but none is based on documentary evidence. They have been postulated to be radio propagation beacons, channel markers, or beacons used in tracking [[satellites]] or for [[civil defense]] purposes.&lt;ref name="Poundstone"&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 0-688-04830-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stations of this family, in particular the “U” beacon, have been implicated in deliberate [[radio jamming|jamming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ENIGMA, cluster beacons are used by the Russian navy (especially its submarine branch) to find the most suitable radio frequency for contact based on current radio propagation conditions.&lt;ref name="ENIGMA18"/&gt;

Robert Connolly also links "P" channel marker with communications facilities at the Russian naval base of Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="RConnolly"/&gt; "P" transmissions carrying Russian navy "XXX" ([[flash priority]]) Morse code messages with call signs ''RPM'' and ''RDL'' further support this view.

==Similar systems==
A few aero navigation [[non-directional beacon]]s also transmit single letter identification codes. They can be easily distinguished from letter beacons because they transmit in the allocated [[low frequency]] and [[medium frequency]] bands; most of them are listed in appropriate aviation handbooks and their transmission mode is [[Types of radio emissions#Low-speed data|A2A]] (full carrier with audio modulation).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12034">This is a '''list of countries by annual per capita consumption of [[tobacco]] cigarettes'''.
Cigarettes are smoked by over 1 billion people, which is nearly 20% of the world population in 2014. 
About 800 million of these smokers are men. 
While smoking rates have leveled off or declined in [[developed nation]]s, especially among men, in [[developing nation]]s tobacco consumption continues to rise. 
More than 80% of all smokers now live in countries with low or middle incomes, and 60% in just 10 countries, a list headed by China.&lt;ref&gt;WCR, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;China is one of the world largest country, which also is the leading country in the cigarette industry. In 2014, [[China]] produced and consumed more than 30% of cigarettes total in the world. There is a strong relationship between SES and smoking behaviors. According to the research, developing countries having the most tobacco use. In other words, the higher the level of SES the more smokers. “China was found to be one of the countries with the highest male-to-female ratio of smoking prevalence,” which 74% of males and 8% of females were smokers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A526822436/OVIC?u=okccc_main&amp;sid=OVIC&amp;xid=4f88826c|title=Income, occupation and education: Are they related to smoking behaviors in China?|last=Wang|first=Qing|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Smokers are over half of adult males in Indonesia (57%, but mostly [[kretek]], a local form of cigarette) and China (53% estimated), and nearly half in [[Bangladesh]], though for women the figure is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;WCR, pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42% to 20.8% of adults,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm#fig&lt;/ref&gt; with further significant decline to 18% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2012/index.htm 2012 Surgeon General's Report—Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are large regional differences in smoking rates, with [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Mississippi]] topping the list, and [[Idaho]], [[California]] and [[Utah]] at significantly lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a2.htm State-Specific Prevalence of Cigarette Smoking Among Adults and Quitting Among Persons Aged 18–35 Years — United States, 2006], [https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/ Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report], September 28, 2007, 56(38); 993–996, [https://www.cdc.gov/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]] the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from 2014–15 showing 14.7% of the population (over 18) to be daily smokers, a decline from 22.3% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics [http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4364.0.55.0012014-15?OpenDocument] National Health Survey: First Results, 2014-15&lt;/ref&gt; 
Young adults are the most likely age group to smoke, with a marked decline in smoking rates with increasing age.
The prevalence of smoking is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage [low earners], with over double the rate in the most disadvantaged quintile of the population as compared to the least.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4338.0~2011-13~Main%20Features~Tobacco%20smoking~10008 Smoking] Profiles of Health, Australia, 2011-13, 07/06/2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
Smoking rates in rural areas tend to be higher than in city areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

With a length of ca. 14 km it is the longest street of Chișinău; it starts from the border of Botanica and [[sectorul Centru|center of Chișinău]] - ''head to head'' with Gagarin Street, near to [[Chișinău Railway Station]], and ends at the city periphery with a [[viaduct]] near [[Sîngera]] town (which is also part of Chișinău Municipality), being continued to South-East of Moldova by M14 road (part of [[European route E58]] and [[European route E581]]). It goes in parallel with the Moldovan inter-urban railway route Chișinău–[[Bender, Moldova|Bender]], at a short distance from it. There are 970 [[House numbering|house (address) numbers]] on Munceşti Highway, and this is the host for a big number of industrial enterprises. This is one of the oldest streets of Chişinău. In the XVI–XVIII centuries in this area was located a homonymous village, Muncești, which later was enclosed in Chișinău.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnaltv.md/ro/news/2016/9/3/-quot-muncim-quot-pe-cea-mai-lunga-strada-din-capitala-10239542/ "Muncim" pe cea mai lungă stradă din capitală].

'''''The Cambridge History of Inner Asia''''' is an ongoing series of history books published by [[Cambridge University Press]] (CUP) covering the early and modern history of [[Inner Asia]]n and [[Central Asia]]n peoples.

The first volume titled "''The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia''" was edited by Denis Sinor, a Distinguished [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Central Asian Studies]] at the [[Department of Central Eurasian Studies (Indiana University)|Department of Central Eurasian Studies]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in 1987 and published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franke |first=Herbert |url=http://histories.cambridge.org/book?id=chol9780521243049_CHOL9780521243049 |title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia edited by Denis Sinor |website=Histories.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume introduces the geographical setting of [[Central Asia]] and follows its history from the palaeolithic era to the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the thirteenth century.

The series' second volume, ''The Cambridge History of Inner Asia: The Chinggisid Age'', was published in 2009. Similar to the previous volume, a large group of international experts contributed to each chapter.
