[[File:Active Al2O3.jpg|thumb|300px|Activated alumina]]
'''Activated alumina''' is manufactured from aluminium hydroxide by dehydroxylating it in a way that produces a highly porous material; this material can have a surface area significantly over 200 m²/g.  The compound is used as a [[desiccant]] (to keep things dry by absorbing water from the air) and as a [[filter (water)|filter]] of [[fluoride]], [[arsenic]] and [[selenium]] in [[drinking water]]. It is made of [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina; Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It has a very high surface-area-to-weight ratio, due to the many "tunnel like" pores that it has. Activated alumina in its phase composition can be represented only by metastable forms (gamma-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc.). Corundum (alpha-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), the only stable form of aluminum oxide, does not have such a chemically active surface and is not used as a sorbent.

==Uses==

===Catalyst applications===
Activated alumina is used for a wide range of adsorbent and catalyst applications including the adsorption of catalysts in polyethylene production, in [[hydrogen peroxide]] production, as a selective adsorbent for many chemicals including [[arsenic]], [[fluoride]], in [[sulphur]] removal from fluid streams (Claus Catalyst process).

===Desiccant===
Used as a desiccant, it works by a process called ''adsorption''.  The water in the air actually sticks to the alumina itself in between the tiny passages as the air passes through them.  The water molecules become trapped so that the air is dried out as it passes through the filter.  This process is reversible.  If the alumina desiccant is heated to ~200&amp;nbsp;°C, it will release the trapped water.  This process is called ''regenerating'' the desiccant.

===Fluoride adsorbent===
Activated alumina is also widely used to remove fluoride from drinking water. In the US, there are widespread [[water fluoridation|programs to fluoridate]] drinking water.  However, in certain regions, such as the Rajasthan region of India, there is enough fluoride in the water to cause [[Skeletal fluorosis|fluorosis]]. A study from the Harvard school of Public Health found exposure to fluoride as a child correlated with lower IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developmental Fluoride Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10579664/3491930.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Activated alumina filters can easily reduce fluoride levels from 10.0 ppm to less than 1.0 ppm.  The amount of fluoride leached from the water being filtered depends on how long the water is actually touching the alumina filter media. Basically, the more alumina in the filter, the less fluoride will be in the final, filtered water. Lower temperature water, and lower pH water (acidic water) are filtered more effectively too. Ideal pH for treatment is 5.5, which allows for up to a 95% removal rate.

As per researches conducted by V.K.Chhabra {Chief Chemist (retd.) P.H.E.D.Raj.} Activated alumina, when used as a fluoride filter, under field conditions can best be regenerated by a solution of lye ([[sodium hydroxide]]; NaOH), [[sulphuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
The fluoride uptake capacity (FUC) of activated alumina can be up to 5000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. The FUC can be determined as follows:

'''''V.K.Chhabra’s method (Chief Chemist retired, PHED Raj., India)'':''' 
Fluoride solution: Dissolve 22.1 g anhydrous NaF in distilled water and dilute to 1,000 mL.
1 mL = 10&amp;nbsp;mg fluoride.
10 mL/L = 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L fluoride.

Procedure:
To one litre of simulated distilled water containing 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L of fluoride, agitate at 100 rpm using the jar test machine. Add 10 g of the AA under test. After one hour, switch off the machine and take out the solution. After 5 minutes, carefully decant the supernatant solution and determine the fluoride. Calculate the difference between the original and treated water fluoride concentration. Multiply the difference by 100 to give the fluoride uptake capacity of AA in mg/kg.

===Vacuum systems===
In [[vacuum|high vacuum]] applications, activated alumina is used as a charge material in ''fore-line traps'' to prevent [[oil]] generated by [[rotary vane pump]]s from back streaming into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ronald Vane]] |title=Reducing Oil Back streaming in Electron Microscopes |url=http://www.evactron.com/backstreaming.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207235312/http://www.evactron.com/backstreaming.html |archivedate=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomaterial===
Its mechanical properties and non-reactivity in the biological environment allow it to be a suitable material used to cover surfaces in friction in body prostheses (e.g. hip or shoulder prostheses).

The '''Whitcomb area rule''', also called the '''transonic area rule''', is a design technique used to reduce an [[aircraft]]'s [[drag (physics) | drag]] at [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] speeds, particularly between [[Mach number | Mach]] 0.75 and 1.2. 

This is one of the most important operating speed ranges for commercial and military [[fixed-wing aircraft]] today, with transonic acceleration being considered an important performance metric for combat aircraft and necessarily dependent upon transonic drag.

==Description==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

At high-subsonic flight speeds, the local speed of the airflow can reach the speed of sound where the flow accelerates around the [[aircraft]] body and [[wing]]s. The speed at which this development occurs varies from aircraft to aircraft and is known as the [[critical Mach | critical Mach number]]. The resulting [[shock wave]]s formed at these points of sonic flow can result in a sudden increase in [[Drag (physics)| drag]], called [[wave drag]]. To reduce the number and power of these shock waves, an [[aerodynamic]] shape should change in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]al area as smoothly as possible.

The area rule says that two airplanes with the same longitudinal cross-sectional area distribution have the same wave drag, independent of how the area is distributed laterally (i.e. in the fuselage or in the wing). Furthermore, to avoid the formation of strong shock waves, this total area distribution must be smooth. As a result, aircraft have to be carefully arranged so that at the location of the wing, the fuselage is narrowed or "waisted", so that the total area does not change much. Similar but less pronounced fuselage waisting is used at the location of a bubble canopy and perhaps the tail surfaces.

The area rule also holds true at speeds exceeding the [[speed of sound]], but in this case, the body arrangement is in respect to the Mach line for the design speed. For example, consider that at Mach 1.3 the angle of the Mach cone formed off the body of the aircraft will be at about μ = arcsin(1/M) = 50.3° (where μ is the angle of the Mach cone, or simply [[Mach angle]], and M is the [[Mach number]]). In this case the "perfect shape" is biased rearward; therefore, aircraft designed for high speed cruise usually have wings towards the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1956/naca-report-1284.pdf | title = Supersonic area rule | author-link = Robert Thomas Jones (engineer)| first = Robert T | last = Jones | year = 1956 | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | publisher = NACA | type = report | format = [[Portable document format |PDF]] | id = 1284}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of such a design is the [[Concorde]]. When applying the transonic area rule, the condition that the plane defining the cross-section meets the longitudinal axis at the Mach angle μ no longer prescribes a unique plane for μ other than the 90° given by M = 1. The correct procedure is to average over all possible orientations of the intersecting plane.

==Sears–Haack body==

A superficially related concept is the [[Sears–Haack body]], which is the shape with the minimum wave drag for a given length and a given volume. However, the Sears–Haack body shape is derived starting with the [[Prandtl–Glauert transformation |Prandtl–Glauert equation]] which governs small-disturbance supersonic flows. But this equation is '''not''' valid for transonic flows where the area rule applies. So although the Sears–Haack body shape, being smooth, will have favorable wave drag properties according to the area rule, it is not theoretically optimum.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670030792.pdf nasa.gov.

==History==
===Germany===
[[Image:Patent 932410 Seite 5.gif|thumb|right|[[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] [[patent drawing]] from March 1944.]]
The area rule was discovered by [[Otto Frenzl]] when comparing a swept wing with a w-wing with extreme high wave drag&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.akl.tu-darmstadt.de/media/arbeitskreis_luftverkehr/downloads_6/kolloquien/9kolloqium/heinzerlingflgelpfeilungundflchenregel.pdf | first = Werner | last = Heinzerling | publisher = Deutsches Museum | place = München, [[Germany | DE]] | language = German | title = Flügelpfeilung und Flächenregel, zwei grundlegende deutsche Patente der Flugzeugaerodynamik |trans-title=Wing sweep and area rule, two basic German patents of aircraft aerodynamics | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while working on a transonic wind tunnel at [[Junkers  (Aircraft) | Junkers]] works in Germany between 1943 and 1945. He wrote a description on 17 December 1943, with the title "Arrangement of Displacement Bodies in High-Speed Flight"; this was used in a patent filed in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Patent-Area-Rule.pdf | language = German | title = Patentschrift zur Flächenregel |trans-title=Patent for the area rule | format = PDF | date = 21 Mar 1944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this research were presented to a wide circle in March 1944 by Theodor Zobel at the ''Deutsche Akademie der Luftfahrtforschung'' (German Academy of Aeronautics Research) in the lecture "Fundamentally new ways to increase performance of high speed aircraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Hans-Ulrich | last = Meier | language = German | title = Die Pfeilflügelentwicklung in Deutschland bis 1945 |trans-title=The swept-wing development in Germany until 1945 | ISBN = 3-7637-6130-6 | pages = 166–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Subsequent German wartime aircraft design took account of the discovery, evident in slim mid-fuselage of aircraft including the [[Messerschmitt P.1112]], [[Messerschmitt P.1106|P.1106]] and [[Focke-Wulf 1000x1000x1000]] type A long-range bomber, but also apparent in delta wing designs including the [[Henschel Hs 135]]. Several other researchers came close to developing a similar theory, notably [[Dietrich Küchemann]] who designed a tapered fighter that was dubbed the "Küchemann Coke Bottle" when it was discovered by US forces in 1946. In this case Küchemann arrived at the theory by studying airflow, notably spanwise flow, over a [[swept wing]]. The swept wing is already an indirect application of the area rule.

===United States===
[[Wallace D. Hayes]], a pioneer of [[supersonic]] flight, developed the transonic area rule in publications beginning in 1947 with his Ph.D. thesis at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Wallace Hayes"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/01/q1/0308-hayes.htm | title = Wallace Hayes | type = obituary | publisher = Princeton}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Richard Whitcomb Examines Model - GPN-2000-001262.jpg|thumb|April 1955: Whitcomb examines a model aircraft designed in accordance with his area rule.]]
[[Richard T. Whitcomb]], after whom the rule is named, independently discovered this rule in 1952, while working at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]]. While using the new Eight-Foot High-Speed Tunnel, a [[wind tunnel]] with performance up to Mach 0.95 at NACA's [[Langley Research Center]], he was surprised by the increase in drag due to shock wave formation. Whitcomb realized that, for analytical purposes, an airplane could be reduced to a streamlined body of revolution, elongated as much as possible to mitigate abrupt discontinuities and, hence, equally abrupt drag rise.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallion|first=Richard P.|title=The NACA, NASA, and the Supersonic-Hypersonic Frontier|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025896_2010028361.pdf|work=NASA|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shocks could be seen using [[Schlieren photography]], but the reason they were being created at speeds far below the speed of sound, sometimes as low as Mach 0.70, remained a mystery. 

In late 1951, the lab hosted a talk by [[Adolf Busemann]], a famous German aerodynamicist who had moved to Langley after [[World War II]]. He talked about the behavior of airflow around an airplane as its speed approached the critical Mach number, when air no longer behaved as an incompressible fluid. Whereas engineers were used to thinking of air flowing smoothly around the body of the aircraft, at high speeds it simply did not have time to "get out of the way", and instead started to flow as if it were rigid pipes of flow, a concept Busemann referred to as "streampipes", as opposed to [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], and jokingly suggested that engineers had to consider themselves "pipefitters".

Several days later Whitcomb had a "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]" moment. The reason for the high drag was that the "pipes" of air were interfering with each other in three dimensions. One does not simply consider the air flowing over a 2D cross-section of the aircraft as others could in the past; now they also had to consider the air to the "sides" of the aircraft which would also interact with these streampipes. Whitcomb realized that the shaping had to apply to the aircraft ''as a whole'', rather than just to the fuselage. That meant that the extra cross-sectional area of the wings and tail had to be accounted for in the overall shaping, and that the fuselage should actually be narrowed where they meet to more closely match the ideal.

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
[[Image:A380 singapore airlines takeoff arp.jpg|thumb|right|Underside of an [[Airbus A380|A380]]. Several area rule-dictated features are visible – see text]]

The area rule was immediately applied to a number of development efforts. One of the most famous of these developments was Whitcomb's personal work on the re-design of the Convair [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], a U.S. Air Force jet fighter that was demonstrating performance considerably worse than expected.{{Sfn | Wallace | 1998 | p = 144}}  By indenting the fuselage beside the wings, and (paradoxically) adding more volume to the rear of the plane, transonic drag was considerably reduced and the intended Mach 1.2 design speed was reached. The culminating design of this research was the Convair [[F-106 Delta Dart]], an aircraft which for many years was the USAF's primary all-weather interceptor.&lt;ref&gt;The Era of High-Speed Flight https://history.nasa.gov/SP-440/ch5-10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous designs of the era were likewise modified in this fashion, either by adding new fuel tanks or tail extensions to smooth out the profile. The [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tupolev Tu-95 'Bear']], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[bomber]], has large bulged landing gear nacelles behind the two inner engines, increasing the aircraft's overall cross section aft of the wing root. Its [[Tupolev Tu-114|airliner version]] has been the [[fastest propeller-driven aircraft]] in the world since 1960. The [[Convair 990]] used a similar solution, adding bumps called [[Anti-shock body| antishock bodies]] to the [[trailing edge]] of the upper wing. The 990 remains the fastest U.S. [[airliner]] in history, cruising at up to [[Mach number |Mach]] 0.89. Designers at [[Armstrong-Whitworth]] took the concept a step further in their proposed M-Wing, in which the wing was first swept forward and then to the rear. This allowed the fuselage to be narrowed on either side of the root instead of just behind it, leading to a smoother fuselage that remained wider on average than one using a classic swept wing.

One interesting outcome of the area rule is the shaping of the [[Boeing 747]]'s upper deck.{{Sfn | Wallace | 1998 | p = 147}}  The aircraft was designed to carry standard [[intermodal container]]s in a two-wide, two-high stack on the main deck, which was considered a serious accident risk for the pilots if they were located in a cockpit at the front of the aircraft. They were instead moved above the deck in a small "hump", which was designed to be as small as possible given normal streamlining principles. It was later realized that the drag could be reduced much more by lengthening the hump, using it to reduce wave drag offsetting the tail surface's contribution. The new design was introduced on the 747-300, improving its cruise speed and lowering drag, with the side effect of slightly increasing capacity on passenger flights.

Aircraft designed according to Whitcomb's area rule (such as the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] and the [[Northrop F-5]]) looked odd at the time they were first tested and were dubbed "flying Coke bottles," but the area rule is effective and came to be an expected part of the appearance of any transonic aircraft. Later designs started with the area rule in mind, and came to look much more pleasing. Although the rule still applies, the visible fuselage "waisting" can only be seen on a few aircraft, such as the [[B-1 Lancer| B-1B Lancer]], [[Learjet 60]], and the [[Tupolev Tu-160| Tupolev Tu-160 'Blackjack']]. The same effect is now achieved by careful positioning of aircraft components, like the boosters and cargo bay on rockets; the [[jet engines]] in front of (and not directly below) the wings of the [[Airbus A380]]; the jet engines behind (and not purely at the side of) the fuselage of a [[Cessna Citation X]]; the shape and location of the canopy on the [[F-22 Raptor]]; and the image of the [[Airbus A380]] above showing obvious area rule shaping at the wing root, which is practically invisible from any other angle.

As of 2013 there were a wide variety of [[propulsion system]]s available or potentially available for automobiles and other vehicles. Options included [[internal combustion engine]]s fueled by [[petrol]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[propane]], or [[natural gas]]; [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[fuel cell vehicle]]s fueled by [[hydrogen]] and all [[electric car]]s. Fueled vehicles seemed to have the short term advantage due to the limited range and high cost of [[rechargeable battery|batteries]]. Some options required construction of a network of [[filling station|fueling]] or [[charging station]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT42213&gt;{{cite news |title=Trucking Industry Is Set to Expand Its Use of Natural Gas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/business/energy-environment/natural-gas-use-in-long-haul-trucks-expected-to-rise.html |accessdate=April 23, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 22, 2013 |last1=Cardwell |first1=Diane |last2=Krauss |first2=Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no compelling advantage for any particular option car makers pursued parallel development tracks using a variety of options. Reducing the weight of vehicles was one strategy being employed.

==Recent developments==
The use of high-technology (such as electronic [[engine control unit]]s) in advanced designs resulting from substantial investments in development research by European countries and Japan seemed to give an advantage to them over Chinese automakers and parts suppliers who, as of 2013, had low development budgets and lacked capacity to produce parts for high-tech engine and power train designs.&lt;ref name=Economist42013&gt;{{cite news |title=Propulsion systems The great powertrain race Carmakers are hedging their bets on powering cars |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21576219-carmakers-are-hedging-their-bets-powering-cars-great-powertrain-race |accessdate=April 19, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |edition=print |date=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The chief characteristic of an automotive engine (compared to a [[stationary engine]] or a [[marine engine]]) is a high [[power-to-weight ratio]]. This is achieved by using a high rotational speed. However, automotive engines are sometimes modified for marine use, forming a [[marine automobile engine]].

==History==
{{main|History of the automobile}}
In the early years, [[steam engine]]s and [[electric motor]]s were tried, but with limited success. In the 20th century, the internal combustion (ic) engine became dominant. In 2015, the internal combustion  engine remains the most widely used but a resurgence of electricity seems likely because of increasing concern about ic engine [[exhaust gas]] emissions.

As of 2017, the majority of the cars in the United States are gasoline powered. In the early 1900s, the internal combustion engines faced competition from steam and electric engines. The internal combustion engines of the time was powered by gasoline. Internal combustion engines function with the concept of a piston being pushed by the pressure of a certain explosion.&lt;ref name="Cummins"&gt;Cummins Jr., Lyle C. (1976) Early IC and Automotive Engines. SAE Technical Papers. Wilsonville: Carnot Press, 760604, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; This explosion is burning the hydrocarbon within the cylinder head an engine. Out of all the cars manufactured during the time, only around one fourth are actually considered internal combustion. Within the next couple of years, the internal combustion engine came out to become the most popular automotive engine.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;L. Collier, James. (2006) Steam Engines. 1st ed. Tarrytown: Cavendish Square Publishing, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime within the 19th century, [[Rudolf Diesel]] invented a new form of internal combustion power, using a concept of injecting liquid fuel into air heated solely by compression.&lt;ref name="Cummins"/&gt; This is the predecessor to the modern diesel engine used in automobiles, but more specifically, heavy duty vehicles such as semi-trucks.

== Engine types ==

=== Internal combustion engines ===

{{Main|Internal combustion engine}}

[[Petrol engine]]s quickly became the choice of manufacturers and consumers alike. Despite the rough start, noisy and dirty engine, and the difficult gear shifting, new technologies such as the production line and the advancement of the engine allowed the standard production of the gas automobiles. This is the start, from the invention of the gas automobile in 1876, to the beginning of mass production in the 1890s. Henry Ford’s Model T drove down the price of cars to a more affordable price. At the same time, Charles Kettering invented an electric starter, allowing the car to be more efficient than the mechanical starter.&lt;ref name="Electric"&gt;The History of the Electric Car. (2014). Energy.gov. Retrieved 28 March 2017, from https://energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance of fuel propelled gas automobiles to be the highly capable and affordable. The demand of gasoline rose from 3 billion barrels in 1919 to around 15 billion in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Melosi, M. (2004). Automobile and the Environment in American History: Energy Use and the Internal Combustion Engine. Autolife.umd.umich.edu. Retrieved 28 March 2017, from http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Overview/E_Overview3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal combustion engine is a motor that is powered by the expansion of gas which is created by the combustion of [[hydrocarbon]] gases fuels.&lt;ref name="Chamber of Secrets"&gt;Chambers, A. (1902). Lee's American Automobile Handbook (1st ed.). Chicago: Laird &amp; Lee. Retrieved from https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Alfred_B_Chambers_Lee_s_American_Automobile_Manual?id=_lYF6H7Q0GYC.&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate, an internal combustion used the heat of a combustion created by the injected hydrocarbon fuel to create mechanical motion. At the time of the early 1900s, [[Methanol|wood alcohol]] was a popular fuel for French and German automobiles, but as governments imposed large taxes on the production, the price of wood alcohol rose above that of gasoline.&lt;ref name="Chamber of Secrets" /&gt; Gasoline engines became popular as a result of this, as internal combustion engines were commonly known as gasoline engines. Although gasoline engines became popular, they were not particularly desirable due to the dangers of fuel leaks that may cause explosions. Therefore, many inventors attempted to create a kerosene burning engine as a result. This was not a successful venture applying it for automotive usage. There are many different types of fuels for internal combustion engines. These include [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], and [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]].

=== Steam engines ===

{{Main|History of steam road vehicles}}

The [[steam engine]] was invented in the late 1700s, and the primary method of powering engines and soon, locomotives. One of the most popular steam automobile was the “Stanley Steamer,” offering low pollution, power, and speed. The downside of these steam automobiles is the unreliability, complexity, and the frequent accidents that occurred with them. The startup time for a steam car may take up to 45 minutes, defeating the purpose of faster transportation. By the time the steam automobile was improved, the complexity of manufacturing relative to the gas automobiles made steam automobiles unprofitable.&lt;ref name="Electric" /&gt;

A steam engine is a device which transforms heat into mechanical motion. This is provided with the usage of boilers, which create steam by boiling water. In the early 1900s, [[Abner Doble]] introduced a steam powered car in the United States which had capabilities that could potentially overpower [[Ford Model T|Ford’s Model T]] in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Geoghegan, J. (2017). Full Steam Ahead. American History, (1), 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Steam has been known to have very efficient fuel economy with a high power source. That is why half the world was powered by steam for almost the entirety of the 19th century and almost half the 20th century. The main drawback of the steam engine in automobiles was the fact that operators were required to have full knowledge of boilers and steam engines before operating, as it was detrimental to the engine itself if the operator neglected it.&lt;ref name="Chamber of Secrets" /&gt;

=== Electric motors ===
{{main|Electric motor}}
[[History of the electric vehicle|Electric vehicles]] seemed to be the most viable option, similar to the steam automobiles. It was first invented in the early 1800s, and became a viable option of transportation around 1890, when William Morrison created the first electric car that traveled 14 miles per hour. The electric cars offered low pollution and a soundless ride, unlike their gasoline counterparts. The greatest downside of electric cars was the range. The typical electric car could reach around 20 miles before requiring a recharge. Manufacturers could not increase the number of batteries, due to the bulkiness of the batteries at the time. Without an incentive to purchase the electric automobiles, gas automobiles was the most viable option at the time.&lt;ref name="Electric" /&gt;

[[Electric car]]s use batteries to store electricity which is used to power [[electric motor]]s. The battery delivers the power to the motor, which is either AC or DC. The difference between AC and [[DC motor]]s is the sort of system that is required to run it in an electric vehicle. An [[AC motor]] is generally cheaper but the components required to run it in an electric vehicle such as the controller and inverter makes it more expensive than the DC motor. A unique feature of electric vehicles compared to its gasoline counterparts, the electric vehicle is more simple than the gasoline vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Schwitters, C. (2017). AC versus DC charging - what is the difference - Plug In America. Plug In America. Retrieved 11 April 2017, from https://pluginamerica.org/ac-versus-dc-charging-what-difference/&lt;/ref&gt; The electric vehicle bypasses the gasoline car components such as the crankshaft which allows it to generate power much faster than gasoline. Because of the faster transfer of power, the electric vehicle is able to accelerate faster than gasoline cars.&lt;ref&gt;How Do Battery Electric Cars Work?. (2017). Union of Concerned Scientists. Retrieved 11 April 2017, from http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/how-do-battery-electric-cars-work#.WOqfj_ krK70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the electric vehicle made its reappearance because of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 OPEC Oil Embargo]]. Previously, the abundant gasoline had become the prime source of fuel for vehicles. But after the shortage, manufacturers began looking towards electric vehicles again. Despite the improved technology from the 1800s, the electric vehicles faced similar technological flaws such as limited mileage and speed. They could only travel up to 45 miles per hour and had a range of approximately 40 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative Fuels Data Center: How Do All-Electric Cars Work?. (2017). Afdc.energy.gov.

==Meteorological background==
A succession of slow-moving low pressure systems crossed the UK during Autumn 2000 associated with the [[jet stream]] being in a more southerly position than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blackburn M, Hoskins B |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Atmospheric variability and extreme Autumn rainfall in the UK |year=2001 |url=http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~mike/autumn2000/son00_paper9.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding in Kent and Sussex resulted from a succession of thunderstorms passing along a near-stationary front.&lt;ref name="climateprediction"/&gt; Much of the rock in this area is impermeable and there had already been significant rainfall in the south-east allowing for increased surface flow and river levels. Several fronts passed over central and northern England in the following weeks causing flooding in Shropshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire.

===Prelude===
The rainfall for this period in the three preceding years had been above the 1961-1990 average.&lt;ref name="climateprediction"&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK Autumn 2000 floods |url=http://climateprediction.net/content/uk-autumn-2000-floods |publisher=WWF/climateprediction.net |accessdate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211031059/http://climateprediction.net/content/uk-autumn-2000-floods |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous spring was unsettled, with April and May particularly wet,&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt; which increased the aquifer recharge season.&lt;ref name="climateprediction" /&gt; Heavy rain was also seen in June, leading to high river levels and some flooding in Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt;

September 2000 was generally unsettled, with wet periods between 14-19. This resulted in some flooding on 15 September around [[Portsmouth]] and [[Southsea]] as a pumping station at [[Eastney]] failed after {{convert|58|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell in 4.5 hours, being the heaviest rain since 1986 in the area. Total rainfall was also measured at 65mm in [[Havant]] making this a 1 in 108 year storm event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment |url=http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/media/Env_20110706r7_Appendix.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110930130247/http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/media/Env_20110706r7_Appendix.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Portsmouth City Council |accessdate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sussex===

On 12 October many roads were flooded across both [[West Sussex|West]] and [[East Sussex]] including the [[A21 road|A21]] and [[A22 road|A22]]. A lifeboat crew rescued 20 people trapped in a supermarket in [[Uckfield]] and others were rescued by helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/969573.stm  |title= Floods cause chaos |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-06 |date=12 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shropshire===

[[Shrewsbury]], [[Ironbridge]] and [[Bridgnorth]] flooded as the Severn breached its banks and reached its highest levels in 53 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/image_galleries/shrewsbury_floods_2000_gallery.shtml |title= Time shift: 2000 Floods |publisher=BBC Shropshire |accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worcestershire===

The Severn breached its banks in many parts of the county, including at [[Bewdley]], [[Worcester]] and [[Upton-upon-Severn]]. In Worcester, the Severn peaked on 3 November at its highest level in 53 years. The river remained in flood for several days however and the main road bridge in the city was closed. Homes were flooded in [[Diglis]] as well as many businesses on the city's waterfront and the cricket ground. In Bewdley, the floods led to renewed calls for flood defences in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2000/11/09/Worcestershire+Archive/7784108.FLOODS_ROUND_UP__Praise_for_the_heroes/ |title= Floods Round-up |publisher=Worcester News |accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were completed in 2006 and have since reduced the impact of flooding on the town.

===Yorkshire===
[[File:The Ouse in flood. York - geograph.org.uk - 126451.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Ouse in flood, York]]
Flooding affected [[York]] during the summer and autumn of 2000 as the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] reached its highest levels since records began. The floods cost the city council in excess of £1 million and 40 people had to be moved from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/3559528.stm  |title= York counts cost of 2000 flood |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-02 |date=13 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floods were the worst in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded and the army were called in to help with flood relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dennis | first1 = I.

==Aftermath==

===Attributing flood risk to climate change===

In 2011 a team of climate scientists from the [[University of Oxford]], the [[Met Office]], [[ETH Zurich]], the National Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan and Risk Management Solutions Ltd. published an article on the role of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in the Autumn 2000 floods in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature |year=2011 |volume=470 |issue=7334 |pages=382–385 |title= Anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood risk in England and Wales in autumn 2000 |vauthors=Pall P, Aina T, Stone DA, Stott PA, Nozawa T, Hilberts AG, Lohmann D, Allen MR |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09762.html#/author-information  |accessdate=2 April 2012 |doi=10.1038/nature09762|bibcode = 2011Natur.470..382P |pmid=21331040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The risk of major flooding occurring during October and November 2000 was estimated to have increased due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The team used thousands of model simulations run on the personal computers of members of the public through the [[Climateprediction.net]] project.

Warm sea surface temperatures in the English Channel and Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benestad | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Melsom | first2 = A. | doi = 10.3354/cr023067 | title = Is there a link between the unusually wet autumns in southeastern Norway and sea-surface temperature anomalies? | journal = Climate Research | volume = 23 | pages = 67 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2002ClRes..23...67B }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with an abnormally warm North Atlantic, added moisture and energy to weather systems as they crossed the UK.&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt; September was the wettest since 1981, October the wettest since 1903 and November the wettest since 1970. Overall the autumn of 2000 was the wettest since 1872, and more rain fell in September, October and November than in any other 3-month period since rainfall records began in 1727. Climatologically it was calculated that Autumn 2000 was a 1-in-500-year event, assuming a static climate.&lt;ref name="Hudson" /&gt;

===Government report===
Defra commissioned an independent review by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] under George Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.org.uk/Information-resources/Document-Library/Learning-to-live-with-rivers |format=PDF |title=Learning to live with rivers |last=Fleming |first=George |date=November 2001 |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers |accessdate=2012-05-18 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109114430/http://www.ice.org.uk/Information-resources/Document-Library/Learning-to-live-with-rivers |archivedate=9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was to consider methods of estimating and reducing flood risk  and look at whether flood risk management could make more use of natural processes. Other terms of reference included the possible [[Effects of global warming|impact of climate change]] and experience of other countries. The resulting report entitled [[Environment Agency#Autumn 2000 Floods and Learning to Live with Rivers|''Learning to Live with Rivers'']] specifically criticised a reluctance to use computer models and inadequate representation of the dynamic effects of land use, catchment processes and climatic variability. More broadly, the report noted that sustainable flood risk management could only be achieved by working with the natural response of the river basin and by providing the necessary storage, flow reduction and discharge capacity. It concluded that floods can only be managed, not prevented, and the community must learn to live with rivers.

The report found that damage was reduced by flood defences and by timely warnings and evacuations where the defences could not hold back the water. As a result, 280,000 properties were protected from the floods, but over 10,000 properties were still flooded at an estimated cost of £1 billion.

A '''ballistic table''' or '''ballistic chart''' is a tool which predicts the [[trajectory]] of a [[projectile]], and is used to compensate for physical effects in order to increase the probability of the projectile reaching the intended target. Ballistic tables are used in [[hunting]], [[sport shooting]], [[military]] and scientific applications. Corrections in ballistic tables are given relative to a zero range.&lt;ref name="hornady"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hornady.com/team-hornady/ballistic-calculators/ballistic-resources/external-ballistics|title=External Ballistics - Hornady Manufacturing, Inc|website=hornady.com|accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballistic charts are often given in angular measurements, with units in either [[milliradian]]s (mil) or [[minutes of arc]] (moa).&lt;ref name="shootingillustrated"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/2/18/mil-moa-or-inches/|title=Shooting Illustrated &amp;#124; Mil, MOA or inches?|website=shootingillustrated.com|accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tables are usually generated using computer programs built on mathematical functions. The number of inputs to the ballistic calculator can sometimes vary depended on the specific generator, or the user may choose to only input certain variables.

For example, a very simple drop table can be made using inputs for the sight adjustment value (in mil or moa), the zero range, intended target ranges, [[muzzle velocity]], [[caliber]], [[ballistic coefficient]] and bullet weight.&lt;ref name="sportsmansguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.sportsmansguide.com/ballisticscharts/|title=Ballistics Charts &amp;#124; Ballistic Tables for Remington, Federal, Winchester &amp;#124; Sportsman&amp;#039;s Guide - Guide Outdoors|website=guide.sportsmansguide.com|accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the environmental effects that play a role in calculating the trajectory are gravity, projectile spin, wind, temperature, air pressure and humidity. More advanced tables can take more factors into account to ensure a more accurate prediction of the trajectory, which becomes increasingly important on [[long range shooting|longer ranges]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Some of these variables may have a negligible effect on shorter ranges.

'''Biantitropical''' (or '''amphitropical''') '''distribution''' refers to the pattern of [[species]] that exist at comparable [[latitude]]s across the [[equator]] but not in the [[tropics]].  For example, a species may be found north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], but not in between.  This usually has to do with the optimal temperature for the species existing at both latitudes.  How the life forms distribute themselves to the opposite hemisphere when they can't normally survive in the middle depends on the species; plants may have their seed spread through wind, animal, or other methods ([[Seed dispersal|dispersal]]) and then germinate upon reaching the appropriate climate, while sea life may be able to travel through the tropical regions in a larval state or by going through deep ocean currents with much colder temperatures than on the surface.

'''Cetyl palmitate''' is the [[ester]] derived from [[palmitic acid]] and [[cetyl alcohol]]. This white waxy solid is the primary constituent of [[spermaceti]], the once highly prized wax found in the skull of [[sperm whale]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Wilhelm Riemenschneider and Hermann M. Bolt "Esters, Organic" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_565.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cetyl palmitate is a component of some [[solid lipid nanoparticle]]s.

'''Coex''' is a [[biopolymer]] with flame-retardant properties derived from the functionalization of [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] fibers such as [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[jute]], [[cannabis]], [[coconut]], [[ramie]], [[bamboo]], [[raffia palm]], [[stipa]], [[Abacá|abacà]], [[sisal]], [[Urtica|nettle]] and [[Aerva javanica|kapok]]. The treatment effectiveness was also proven on wood and [[Semisynthesis|semi-synthetic]] fibers such as [[Rayon|cellulose acetate]], [[cellulose triacetate]], [[viscose]], [[Modal (textile)|modal]], [[lyocell]] and [[Cuprammonium rayon|cupro]].

The material is obtained by sulfation and phosphorylation reactions on glucan units linked to each other in position 1,4 and in particular on the secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups of cellulosic biopolymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tonani|first=Alberto|title=Cellulose Substrate with Anti-Flame Properties and Relative Production Method|date=2015-02-13|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf;jsessionid=67C7066DFC5A24E3B793EA8B0A0773B9.wapp2nC?docId=WO2015019272&amp;recNum=2&amp;maxRec=13&amp;office=&amp;prevFilter=&amp;sortOption=Pub+Date+Desc&amp;queryString=FP%253A%2528zanolo%2529&amp;tab=PCTDescription|last2=Novello|last3=Sirna|last4=Giannatempo|first2=Andrea|first3=Calogero|first4=Simone|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical modification of the fibers does not involve physical and visual alterations compared to the starting material.

in 2015 the World Textile Information Network (WTiN) declared Coex the winner of the "Future material award" as best innovation for the Home Textile category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futurematerialsawards.com/winners/|title=Winners {{!}} Future Materials Awards 2015|website=futurematerialsawards|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Coex preserves the physical and chemical characteristics of the raw material to which is applied. The main features of Coex materials are comfort, hydrophilicity, antistatic properties, mechanical resistance and a great versatility in the textile sector, like all natural and semi-synthetic cellulosic fibers.

This materials are resistant to moths, mildew and sunlight. The main feature of biopolymers Coex is the flame resistance, they work with fireproof action, creating a barrier to the flames and not simply delaying the fire. Through molecular modification fibres carbonize and therefore extinguish the flame. The resulting products are hypoallergenic and biodegradable.

'''Cyclopropane fatty acids''' ('''CPA''') are a subgroup of [[fatty acids]] that contain a [[cyclopropane]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/lipids/fa_cycl/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217172219/http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/Lipids/fa_cycl/index.htm |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are usually rare, the seed oil from [[lychee]] contains nearly 40% CPAs in the form of [[triglyceride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gaydou, E. M.; Ralaimanarivo, A.; Bianchini, J. P. "Cyclopropanoic Fatty-Acids of Litchi (Litchi-Chinensis) Seed Oil - a Reinvestigation" J. Agr. Food Chem. 1993, vol. 41, pp. 886-890. {{DOI|10.1021/jf00030a009}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Biosynthesis==
CPAs are derived from unsaturated fatty acids by [[cyclopropanation]]. The methylene donor is a methyl group on [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM).  The conversion is catalyzed by [[cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase]].&lt;ref&gt;Grogan DW, Cronan JE Jr: Cyclopropane ring formation in membrane lipids of bacteria" Microbiol Mol Biol Rev 1997, vol. 61, pp. 429-441. http://mmbr.asm.org/content/61/4/429.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanism is proposed to involve transfer of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; group from SAM to the [[alkene]], followed by deprotonation of the newly attached methyl group and ring closure.&lt;ref&gt;Ludger A. Wessjohann and Wolfgang Brandt, Thies Thiemann "Biosynthesis and Metabolism of Cyclopropane Rings in Natural Compounds" Chem. Rev., 2003, volume 103, pp 1625–1648. {{DOI|10.1021/cr0100188}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cyclopropene fatty acids==
[[File:Malvalic acid.svg|thumb|right|[[malvalic acid]], a cyclopropene fatty acid]]
[[Cyclopropene|Cycloprop''e''ne]] fatty acids are even rarer than CPAs.  The best-known examples are [[malvalic acid]] and [[sterculic acid]].  Sterculic acid as its triglyceride is present in sterculia oils and at low levels in [[Kapok tree|kapok]] seed oil (~12%), [[cottonseed oil]] (~1%), and in the seeds of the tree ''[[Sterculia foetida]]'' (~65-78%). These acids are highly reactive but the cyclopropene ring is destroyed during refining and hydrogenation of the oils. They have attracted interest because they reduce levels of the enzyme [[stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase]] (SCD), which catalyzes the biodesaturation of [[stearic acid]] to [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of pharmacology and therapeutics: Pharmacology of lipid transport and atherosclerotic processes, Volume 1 |last=Abraham |first=Samuel |year=1975 |publisher=Pergamon Press |page=108 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QP1NAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22cyclopropene+fatty+acids+were+specific+inhibitors%22&amp;dq=%22cyclopropene+fatty+acids+were+specific+inhibitors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vYIrT4znB4mCtgeLnO3ODw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electric Power Research Institute''', Inc. or '''EPRI''', is an American independent, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization that conducts research and development related to the [[Electricity generation|generation]], delivery, and use of [[electricity]] to help address challenges in electricity, including reliability, efficiency, affordability, health, safety, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epri.com/#/about/epri?lang=en|title=EPRI Public Site|website=www.epri.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPRI's principal offices and laboratories are located in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California; [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], N.C.; [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], TN; and [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], MA.

==History==
In November 1965, the [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Great Northeastern Blackout]] left 30 million people in the United States without electricity. Historic in scale and impact, it demonstrated the nation's growing dependence upon electricity and its vulnerability to power loss. The event marked a watershed moment for the U.S. [[Electricity sector of the United States|electricity sector]] and triggered the creation of the Electric Power Research Institute.

Following the blackout, leaders in [[United States Congress|Congress]] held hearings in the early 1970s about the lack of research supporting the power industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819152610/http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Chauncey Starr, then the Dean of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]], led the initiative, proposed by Congress, to create an independent research and development organization to support the electricity sector and address its technical and operational challenges. In 1972, at a formal hearing of the [[U.S. Senate Commerce Committee]], Starr presented a vision for the Electric Power Research Institute to serve Congress's mandate for objective, scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Summer 2012|title=Born in a Blackout|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr served as the first President of EPRI for five years and formally retired at age 65, but continued to work at EPRI for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Spring 2012|title=The Man Who Never Stopped|url=http://eprijournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1025049_Spring_online.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=1|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Continuum mechanics|cTopic=Fluid mechanics}}
'''Fluid mechanics''' is the branch of [[physics]] concerned with the mechanics of [[fluid]]s ([[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es, and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s) and the [[force]]s on them.  It has applications in a wide range of disciplines, including [[mechanical engineering | mechanical]], [[civil engineering | 
civil]], [[chemical engineering | chemical]] and [[biomedical engineering]], [[geophysics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[biology]]. It can be divided into [[fluid statics]], the study of fluids at rest; and [[fluid dynamics]], the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion.  It is a branch of [[continuum mechanics]], a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a ''macroscopic'' viewpoint rather than from ''microscopic''. Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of research, typically mathematically complex.  Many problems are partly or wholly unsolved, and are best addressed by [[numerical methods]], typically using computers.  A modern discipline, called [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), is devoted to this approach.  [[Particle image velocimetry]], an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow, also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow.

==Brief history==
{{main|History of fluid mechanics}}
The study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of [[ancient Greece]], when [[Archimedes]] investigated fluid statics and [[buoyancy]] and formulated his famous law known now as the [[Archimedes' principle]], which was published in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]''—generally considered to be the first major work on fluid mechanics. Rapid advancement in fluid mechanics began with [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (observations and experiments), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (invented the [[barometer]]), [[Isaac Newton]] (investigated [[viscosity]]) and [[Blaise Pascal]] (researched [[hydrostatics]], formulated [[Pascal's law]]), and was continued by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] with the introduction of mathematical fluid dynamics in ''Hydrodynamica'' (1739).

Inviscid flow was further analyzed by various mathematicians [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Siméon Denis Poisson]]) and viscous flow was explored by a multitude of [[engineers]] including [[Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille]] and [[Gotthilf Hagen]]. Further mathematical justification was provided by [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], and [[boundary layers]] were investigated ([[Ludwig Prandtl]], [[Theodore von Kármán]]), while various scientists such as [[Osborne Reynolds]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] advanced the understanding of fluid viscosity  and [[turbulence]].

==Main branches==

===Fluid statics===
{{main|Fluid statics}}
[[Fluid statics]] or '''hydrostatics''' is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies [[fluid]]s at rest.  It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in [[mechanical equilibrium|stable]] [[hydrostatic equilibrium|equilibrium]]; and is contrasted with [[fluid dynamics]], the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why [[atmospheric pressure]] changes with [[altitude]], why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container. Hydrostatics is fundamental to [[hydraulics]], the [[engineering]] of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids.  It is also relevant to some aspect of [[geophysics]] and [[astrophysics]] (for example, in understanding [[plate tectonics]] and anomalies in the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]), to [[meteorology]], to [[medicine]] (in the context of [[blood pressure]]), and many other fields.

===Fluid dynamics===
{{main|Fluid dynamics}}
[[Fluid dynamics]] is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that deals with '''fluid flow'''—the science of liquids and gases in motion.  Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems.  The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties  of the fluid, such as [[velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as functions of space and time. It has several subdisciplines itself, including '''[[aerodynamics]]''' (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|movement]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through pipelines, predicting evolving [[weather]] patterns, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and modeling [[explosions]].  Some fluid-dynamical principles are used in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] and crowd dynamics.

==Relationship to continuum mechanics==
Fluid mechanics is a subdiscipline of [[continuum mechanics]], as illustrated in the following table.
{{Continuum mechanics context}}
In a mechanical view, a fluid is a substance that does not support [[shear stress]]; that is why a fluid at rest has the shape of its containing vessel.  A fluid at rest has no shear stress.

==Assumptions==

[[File:Reynolds.svg|thumb|right|Balance for some integrated fluid quantity in a [[control volume]] enclosed by a [[control surface (fluid dynamics)|control surface]].]]
The assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a physical system  can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations. Fundamentally, every fluid mechanical system is assumed to obey:
* [[Conservation of mass]]
* [[Conservation of energy]]
* [[Conservation of momentum]]
* The continuum assumption
For example, the assumption that mass is conserved means that for any fixed [[control volume]] (for example, a spherical volume)—enclosed by a [[control surface (fluid dynamics)|control surface]]—the [[derivative|rate of change]] of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from ''outside'' to ''inside'', minus the rate at which mass is passing from ''inside'' to ''outside''. This can be expressed as an [[Continuity equation#Integral form|equation in integral form]] over the control volume.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{vanchor|continuum assumption|CONTINUUM_ASSUMPTION}}''' is an idealization of [[continuum mechanics]] under which fluids can be treated as [[continuous function|continuous]], even though, on a microscopic scale, they are composed of [[molecules]]. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic (observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and bulk velocity are taken to be well-defined at "infinitesimal" volume elements—small in comparison to the characteristic length scale of the system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. Fluid properties can vary continuously from one volume element to another and are average values of the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead to inaccurate results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano scale. Those problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails, can be solved using [[statistical mechanics]].  To determine whether or not the continuum hypothesis applies, the [[Knudsen number]], defined as the ratio of the molecular [[mean free path]] to the characteristic length [[Scale (ratio)|scale]], is evaluated. Problems with Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using the continuum hypothesis, but molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for all ranges of Knudsen numbers.
{{anchor|mathematical_fluid_mechanics}}

==Navier–Stokes equations==
{{main|Navier–Stokes equations}}
The '''Navier–Stokes equations''' (named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]]) are [[differential equations]] that describe the force balance at a given point within a fluid. For an [[incompressible fluid]] with vector velocity field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, the Navier–Stokes equations are

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}  = - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P +   \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

These differential equations are the analogues for deformable materials to Newton's equations of motion for particles – the Navier–Stokes equations describe changes in [[momentum]] ([[force]]) in response to [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt;P &lt;/math&gt; and viscosity, parameterized by the [[kinematic viscosity]] &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt;/math&gt; here. Occasionally, [[body force]]s, such as the gravitational force or Lorentz force are added to the equations.

Solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations for a given physical problem must be sought with the help of [[calculus]]. In practical terms only the simplest cases can be solved exactly in this way. These cases generally involve non-turbulent, steady flow in which the [[Reynolds number]] is small. For more complex cases, especially those involving [[turbulence]], such as global weather systems, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and many more, solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations can currently only be found with the help of computers. This branch of science is called [[computational fluid dynamics]].

==Inviscid and viscous fluids==

An '''inviscid fluid''' has no [[viscosity]], &lt;math&gt;\nu=0 &lt;/math&gt;. In practice, an inviscid flow is an [[ideal fluid|idealization]], one that facilitates mathematical treatment. In fact, purely inviscid flows are only known to be realized in the case of [[superfluidity]]. Otherwise, fluids are generally '''viscous''', a property that is often most important within a [[boundary layer]] near a solid surface,&lt;ref&gt;Kundu, P.K., Cohen, I.M., &amp; Hu, H.H., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Chapter 10, sub-chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; where the flow must match onto the [[no-slip condition]] at the solid. In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical system can be treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is inviscid, and then [[Method of matched asymptotic expansions|matching]] its solution onto that for a thin [[laminar flow|laminar]] boundary layer.

For fluid flow over a porous boundary, the fluid velocity can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the fluid in the porous media (this is related to the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] speeds to assume that a gas is [[Incompressible fluid|incompressible]]—that is, the density of the gas does not change even though the speed and [[static pressure]] change.

==Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids==
A '''Newtonian fluid''' (named after [[Isaac Newton]]) is defined to be a [[fluid]] whose [[shear stress]] is linearly proportional to the [[velocity]] [[gradient]] in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless of the forces acting on a fluid, it ''continues to flow''. For example, water is a Newtonian fluid, because it continues to display fluid properties no matter how much it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is that the [[drag (physics)|drag]] of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is proportional to the force applied to the object. (Compare [[friction]]).  Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave—to good approximation—as a Newtonian fluid under normal conditions on Earth.&lt;ref name=Batchelor_145&gt;Batchelor (1967), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, stirring a [[non-Newtonian fluid]] can leave a "hole" behind. This will gradually fill up over time—this behaviour is seen in materials such as pudding, [[Non-newtonian fluid#Oobleck|oobleck]], or [[sand]] (although sand isn't strictly a fluid). Alternatively, stirring a non-Newtonian fluid can cause the viscosity to decrease, so the fluid appears "thinner" (this is seen in non-drip [[paint]]s). There are many types of non-Newtonian fluids, as they are defined to be something that fails to obey a particular property—for example, most fluids with long molecular chains can react in a non-Newtonian manner.&lt;ref name=Batchelor_145/&gt;

===Equations for a Newtonian fluid===
{{main|Newtonian fluid}}
The constant of proportionality between the viscous stress tensor and the velocity gradient is known as the [[viscosity]]. A simple equation to describe incompressible Newtonian fluid behaviour is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau=-\mu\frac{dv}{dy}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the shear stress exerted by the fluid ("[[Drag (physics)|drag]]")
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid viscosity—a constant of proportionality
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dy}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of shear.

For a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity, by definition, depends only on [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], not on the forces acting upon it. If the fluid is [[incompressible fluid|incompressible]] the equation governing the viscous stress (in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]) is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}=\mu\left(\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the shear stress on the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; face of a fluid element in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; direction
:&lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; direction
:&lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; direction coordinate.

If the fluid is not incompressible the general form for the viscous stress in a Newtonian fluid is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij} = \mu \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} - \frac{2}{3} \delta_{ij} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \right) + \kappa \delta_{ij} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; is the second viscosity coefficient (or bulk viscosity). If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is termed a [[non-Newtonian fluid]], of which there are several types. Non-Newtonian fluids can be either plastic, Bingham plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic.

In some applications another rough broad division among fluids is made: ideal and non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a shearing force.  An ideal fluid really does not exist, but in some calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One example of this is the flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is neglected, the term containing the viscous stress tensor &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; in the Navier–Stokes equation vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called the [[Euler_equations_(fluid_dynamics)|Euler equation]].

A '''highly hazardous chemical''' is a substance classified by the [[United States|America]]n [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] as material that is both toxic and reactive and whose potential for human injury is high if released. Highly hazardous chemicals may cause cancer, birth defects, induce genetic damage, cause miscarriage, injury and death from relatively small exposures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39047">The '''history of [[fluid mechanics]]''', the study of how [[fluid]]s move and the [[force]]s on them, dates back to the Ancient Greeks.

==Antiquity==

===Pre-history===

A pragmatic, if not scientific, knowledge of fluid flow was exhibited by ancient civilizations, such as in the design of arrows, spears, boats, and particularly hydraulic engineering projects for flood protection, irrigation, drainage, and water supply.&lt;ref&gt;G. Garbrecht (1987).  ''Hydrologic and hydraulic concepts in antiquity'' in ''Hydraulics and Hydraulic Research: A Historical Review'' (A.A. Balkema). &lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest human [[Cradle of Civilization|civilizations]] began near the shores of rivers, and consequently coincided with the dawn of [[hydrology]], [[hydraulics]], and [[hydraulic engineering]].

===Archimedes===
[[Image:Buoyancy.svg|thumb|The forces at work in [[buoyancy]] as discovered by [[Archimedes]]. Note that the object is floating because the upward force of buoyancy is equal to the downward force of [[Gravitation|gravity]].]]

The fundamental principles of hydrostatics and dynamics were given by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''On Floating Bodies'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ τῶν ὀχουμένων}}), around 250 BC.  In it, Archimedes develops the law of [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' Principle]].  This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Archimedes' Principle''|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll |publisher=[[Weber State University]] | url =http://www.physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archimedes maintained that each particle of a fluid mass, when in equilibrium, is equally pressed in every direction; and he inquired into the conditions according to which a solid body floating in a fluid should assume and preserve a position of equilibrium.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hydromechanics |volume=14 |pages=115–116 |first=Alfred George |last=Greenhill |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Alexandrian school===
In the Greek school at [[Alexandria]], which flourished under the auspices of the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemies]], attempts were made at the construction of hydraulic machinery, and about 120 BC the fountain of compression, the [[siphon]], and the [[Force pump|forcing-pump]] were invented by [[Ctesibius]] and [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]]. The siphon is a simple instrument; but the forcing-pump is a complicated invention, which could scarcely have been expected in the infancy of hydraulics. It was probably suggested to Ctesibius by the [[Egyptian wheel]] or [[Noria]], which was common at that time, and which was a kind of chain pump, consisting of a number of earthen pots carried round by a wheel. In some of these machines the pots have a valve in the bottom which enables them to descend without much resistance, and diminishes greatly the load upon the wheel; and, if we suppose that this valve was introduced so early as the time of Ctesibius, it is not difficult to perceive how such a machine might have led to the invention of the forcing-pump.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Sextus Julius Frontinus===
Notwithstanding these inventions of the Alexandrian school, its attention does not seem to have been directed to the motion of fluids; and the first attempt to investigate this subject was made by [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], inspector of the public fountains at [[Rome]] in the reigns of [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]]. In his work ''De aquaeductibus urbis Romae commentarius'', he considers the methods which were at that time employed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from ajutages (tubes), and the mode of distributing the waters of an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] or a [[fountain]]. He remarked that the flow of water from an orifice depends not only on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the height of the water in the reservoir; and that a pipe employed to carry off a portion of water from an aqueduct should, as circumstances required, have a position more or less inclined to the original direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted with the law of the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth of the orifice, the want of precision which appears in his results is not surprising.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Science in medieval Islam|Islamicate scientists]], particularly [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) and later [[Al-Khazini]] (fl. 1115–1130), were the first to apply [[experiment]]al [[scientific method]]s to fluid mechanics, especially in the field of [[fluid statics]], such as for determining [[specific weight]]s.  They applied the mathematical theories of [[ratio]]s and [[infinitesimal]] techniques, and introduced [[algebra]]ic and fine [[calculation]] techniques into the field of fluid statics.&lt;ref name=Rozhanskaya-642&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), "Statics", p. 642, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996|pp=614–642}}:
{{quote|Using a whole body of mathematical methods (not only those inherited from the antique theory of ratios and infinitesimal techniques, but also the methods of the contemporary algebra and fine calculation techniques), Arabic scientists raised statics to a new, higher level. The classical results of Archimedes in the theory of the centre of gravity were generalized and applied to three-dimensional bodies, the theory of ponderable lever was founded and the 'science of gravity' was created and later further developed in medieval Europe. The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends – statics and dynamics – turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics. Archimedean statics formed the basis for creating the fundamentals of the science on specific weight. Numerous fine experimental methods were developed for determining the specific weight, which were based, in particular, on the theory of balances and weighing. The classical works of al-Biruni and al-Khazini can by right be considered as the beginning of the application of experimental methods in medieval science. Arabic statics was an essential link in the progress of world science. It played an important part in the prehistory of classical mechanics in medieval Europe. Without it classical mechanics proper could probably not have been created.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fluid statics, Biruni discovered that there is a correlation between the specific gravity of an object and the volume of water it displaces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} He also introduced the method of [[Test method|checking tests]] during experiments and measured the [[weight]]s of various liquids. He also recorded the differences in weight between [[freshwater]] and [[saline water]], and between hot water and cold water.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During his experiments on fluid mechanics, Biruni invented the [[conical measure]],&lt;ref name="Marshall Clagett 1961 p. 64"&gt;Marshall Clagett (1961), ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages'', p. 64, [[University of Wisconsin Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to find the ratio between the [[weight]] of a substance in air and the weight of water displaced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1206, [[Al-Jazari]]'s ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' described many hydraulic machines. Of particular importance were his water-raising [[pump]]s. The first known use of a [[crankshaft]] in a [[chain pump]] was in one of al-Jazari's [[Sakia|saqiya]] machines. The concept of minimizing [[Intermittency|intermittent working]] is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump.&lt;ref name=Hill-776&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, pp. 751–795 [776].

This pump is remarkable for three reasons: the first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial [[vacuum]]) in a pump, the first application of the [[double-acting cylinder|double-acting]] principle, and the conversion of [[Rotary engine|rotary]] to [[reciprocating motion]], via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 1991, pp. 64–69 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225091836/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm |date=2007-12-25 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=The Origin of the Suction Pump: Al-Jazari 1206 A.D.|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm|accessdate=2008-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102543/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm|archivedate=2008-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill-1996&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', [[Routledge]], pp. 143, 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries==
===Castelli and Torricelli===
[[Benedetto Castelli]], and [[Evangelista Torricelli]], two of the disciples of [[Galileo]], applied the discoveries of their master to the science of hydrodynamics. In 1628 Castelli published a small work, ''Della misura dell' acque correnti'', in which he satisfactorily explained several phenomena in the motion of fluids in rivers and [[canal]]s; but he committed a great [[paralogism]] in supposing the velocity of the water proportional to the depth of the orifice below the surface of the vessel. Torricelli, observing that in a jet where the water rushed through a small ajutage it rose to nearly the same height with the reservoir from which it was supplied, imagined that it ought to move with the same velocity as if it had fallen through that height by the [[force of gravity]], and hence he deduced the proposition that the velocities of liquids are as the [[square root]] of the [[Hydraulic head|head]], apart from the resistance of the air and the [[friction]] of the orifice. This theorem was published in 1643, at the end of his treatise ''De motu gravium projectorum'', and it was confirmed by the experiments of [[Raffaello Magiotti]] on the quantities of water discharged from different ajutages under different pressures (1648).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Blaise Pascal===
In the hands of [[Blaise Pascal]] hydrostatics assumed the dignity of a science, and in a treatise on the equilibrium of liquids (''Sur l’équilibre des liqueurs''), found among his manuscripts after his death and published in 1663, the laws of the equilibrium of liquids were demonstrated in the most simple manner, and amply confirmed by experiments.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Mariotte and Guglielmini===
The theorem of Torricelli was employed by many succeeding writers, but particularly by [[Edme Mariotte]] (1620–1684), whose ''Traité du mouvement des eaux'', published after his death in the year 1686, is founded on a great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]]. In the discussion of some points he committed considerable mistakes. Others he treated very superficially, and in none of his experiments apparently did he attend to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the liquid vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate; but he appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of the water's velocity through friction. His contemporary [[Domenico Guglielmini]] (1655–1710), who was inspector of the rivers and canals at [[Bologna]], had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers to transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as Mariotte observed similar obstructions even in glass pipes where no transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore, regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposed that the filaments of water which graze along the sides of the pipe lose a portion of their velocity; that the contiguous filaments, having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity; and that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to their distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity of water discharged in a given time must, from the effects of friction, be considerably less than that which is computed from theory.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Studies by Isaac Newton===
====Friction and viscosity====
The effects of friction and viscosity in diminishing the velocity of running water were noticed in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], who threw much light upon several branches of hydromechanics. At a time when the [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|Cartesian system of vortices]] universally prevailed, he found it necessary to investigate that hypothesis, and in the course of his investigations he showed that the velocity of any stratum of the vortex is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata which enclose it; and from this it evidently follows that the velocity of a filament of water moving in a pipe is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the filaments which surround it. Taking advantage of these results, [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[France|French]] engineer [[Henri Pitot]] afterwards showed that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Orifices====
The attention of Newton was also directed to the discharge of water from orifices in the bottom of vessels. He supposed a cylindrical vessel full of water to be perforated in its bottom with a small hole by which the water escaped, and the vessel to be supplied with water in such a manner that it always remained full at the same height. He then supposed this cylindrical column of water to be divided into two parts – the first, which he called the "cataract," being an hyperboloid generated by the revolution of an [[hyperbola]] of the fifth degree around the axis of the cylinder which should pass through the orifice, and the second the remainder of the water in the cylindrical vessel. He considered the horizontal strata of this hyperboloid as always in motion, while the remainder of the water was in a state of rest, and imagined that there was a kind of cataract in the middle of the fluid.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

When the results of this theory were compared with the quantity of water actually discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with which the water issued from the orifice was equal to that which a falling body would receive by descending through half the height of water in the reservoir. This conclusion, however, is absolutely irreconcilable with the known fact that jets of water rise nearly to the same height as their reservoirs, and Newton seems to have been aware of this objection. Accordingly, in the second edition of his ''Principia'', which appeared in 1713, he reconsidered his theory. He had discovered a contraction in the vein of fluid (''[[vena contracta]]'') which issued from the orifice, and found that, at the distance of about a diameter of the aperture, the section of the vein was contracted in the subduplicate ratio of two to one. He regarded, therefore, the section of the contracted vein as the true orifice from which the discharge of water ought to be deduced, and the velocity of the effluent water as due to the whole height of water in the reservoir; and by this means his theory became more conformable to the results of experience, though still open to serious objections.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Waves====
Newton was also the first to investigate the difficult subject of the motion of [[wave|waves]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Daniel Bernoulli===
In 1738 [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published his ''Hydrodynamica seu de viribus et motibus fluidorum commentarii''. His theory of the motion of fluids, the germ of which was first published in his memoir entitled ''Theoria nova de motu aquarum per canales quocunque fluentes'', communicated to the Academy of [[St Petersburg]] as early as 1726, was founded on two suppositions, which appeared to him conformable to experience. He supposed that the surface of the fluid, contained in a vessel which is emptying itself by an orifice, remains always horizontal; and, if the fluid mass is conceived to be divided into an infinite number of horizontal strata of the same bulk, that these strata remain contiguous to each other, and that all their points descend vertically, with velocities inversely proportional to their breadth, or to the horizontal sections of the reservoir. In order to determine the motion of each stratum, he employed the principle of the ''conservatio virium vivarum'', and obtained very elegant solutions. But in the absence of a general demonstration of that principle, his results did not command the .confidence which they would otherwise have deserved, and it became desirable to have a theory more certain, and depending solely on the fundamental laws of mechanics. [[Colin Maclaurin]] and [[John Bernoulli]], who were of this opinion, resolved the problem by more direct methods, the one in his ''Fluxions'', published in 1742, and the other in his ''Hydraulica nunc primum detecta'', ''et demonstrata directe ex fundamentis pure mechanicis'', which forms the fourth volume of his works. The method employed by Maclaurin has been thought not sufficiently rigorous; and that of John Bernoulli is, in the opinion of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], defective in clearness and precision.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Jean le Rond d'Alembert===
The theory of Daniel Bernoulli was opposed also by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. When generalizing the theory of [[pendulum]]s of [[Jacob Bernoulli]] he discovered a principle of dynamics so simple and general that it reduced the laws of the motions of bodies to that of their [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. He applied this principle to the motion of fluids, and gave a specimen of its application at the end of his ''Dynamics'' in 1743. It was more fully developed in his ''Traité des fluides'', published in 1744, in which he gave simple and elegant solutions of problems relating to the equilibrium and motion of fluids. He made use of the same suppositions as Daniel Bernoulli, though his calculus was established in a very different manner. He considered, at every instant, the actual motion of a stratum as composed of a motion which it had in the preceding instant and of a motion which it had lost; and the laws of equilibrium between the motions lost furnished him with [[equation]]s representing the motion of the fluid. It remained a desideratum to express by equations the motion of a particle of the fluid in any assigned direction. These equations were found by d'Alembert from two principles – that a rectangular canal, taken in a mass of fluid in equilibrium, is itself in equilibrium, and that a portion of the fluid, in passing from one place to another, preserves the same volume when the fluid is incompressible, or dilates itself according to a given law when the fluid is elastic. His ingenious method, published in 1752, in his ''Essai sur la résistance des fluides'', was brought to perfection in his ''Opuscules mathématiques'', and was adopted by [[Leonhard Euler]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Leonhard Euler===
The resolution of the questions concerning the motion of fluids was effected by means of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[Partial differential equation|partial differential coefficients]]. This calculus was first applied to the motion of water by d'Alembert, and enabled both him and Euler to represent the theory of fluids in formulae restricted by no particular hypothesis.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Pierre Louis Georges Dubuat===
One of the most successful labourers in the science of hydrodynamics at this period was [[Pierre Louis Georges Dubuat]] (1734–1809). Following in the steps of the Abbé [[Charles Bossut]] (''Nouvelles Experiences sur la résistance des fluides'', 1777), he published, in 1786, a revised edition of his ''Principes d'hydraulique'', which contains a satisfactory theory of the motion of fluids, founded solely upon experiments. Dubuat considered that if water were a perfect fluid, and the channels in which it flowed infinitely smooth, its motion would be continually accelerated, like that of bodies descending in an inclined plane. But as the motion of rivers is not continually accelerated, and soon arrives at a state of uniformity, it is evident that the viscosity of the water, and the friction of the channel in which it descends, must equal the accelerating force. Dubuat, therefore, assumed it as a proposition of fundamental importance that, when water flows in any channel or bed, the accelerating force which obliges it to move is equal to the sum of all the resistances which it meets with, whether they arise from its own [[viscosity]] or from the friction of its bed. This principle was employed by him in the first edition of his work, which appeared in 1779. The theory contained in that edition was founded on the experiments of others, but he soon saw that a theory so new, and leading to results so different from the ordinary theory, should be founded on new experiments more direct than the former, and he was employed in the performance of these from 1780 to 1783. The experiments of Bossut were made only on pipes of a moderate declivity, but Dubuat used declivities of every kind, and made his experiments upon channels of various sizes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Nineteenth century==
===Hermann von Helmholtz===
In 1858 [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] published his seminal paper "Über Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen, welche den Wirbelbewegungen entsprechen," in ''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'', vol. 55, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–55. So important was the paper that a few years later [[P. G. Tait]] published an English translation, "On integrals of the hydrodynamical equations which express vortex motion", in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', vol. 33, pp.&amp;nbsp;485–512 (1867). In his paper Helmholtz established his three "laws of vortex motion" in much the same way one finds them in any advanced textbook of [[fluid mechanics]] today. This work established the significance of [[vorticity]] to fluid mechanics and science in general.

For the next century or so ''vortex dynamics'' matured as a subfield of fluid mechanics, always commanding at least a major chapter in treatises on the subject. Thus, [[Horace Lamb|H. Lamb's]] well known ''Hydrodynamics'' (6th ed., 1932) devotes a full chapter to [[vorticity]] and vortex dynamics as does [[George Batchelor|G. K. Batchelor's]] ''[https://archive.is/20130112165003/http://www.cambridge.org/uk/series/sSeries.asp?code=CML&amp;srt=T Introduction to Fluid Dynamics]'' (1967). In due course entire treatises were devoted to vortex motion. [[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré's]] ''Théorie des Tourbillons'' (1893), [http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=80970 H. Villat's] ''Leçons sur la Théorie des Tourbillons'' (1930), [[Clifford Truesdell|C. Truesdell's]] ''The Kinematics of Vorticity'' (1954), and [[P. G. Saffman|P. G. Saffman's]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070314022441/http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/email.asp?isbn=0521477395 Vortex Dynamics]'' (1992) may be mentioned. Early on individual sessions at scientific conferences were devoted to [[vortices]], vortex motion, vortex dynamics and vortex flows. Later, entire meetings were devoted to the subject.

The range of applicability of Helmholtz's work grew to encompass [[Atmospheric science|atmospheric]] and [[oceanographic]] flows, to all branches of [[engineering]] and [[Applied Science|applied science]] and, ultimately, to [[superfluid]]s (today including [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s). In modern fluid mechanics the role of vortex dynamics in explaining flow phenomena is firmly established. Well known vortices have acquired names and are regularly depicted in the popular media: [[hurricane]]s, [[tornado]]es, [[waterspout]]s, aircraft trailing vortices (e.g., [[wingtip vortices]]), drainhole vortices (including the bathtub vortex), [[smoke ring]]s, underwater bubble air rings, cavitation vortices behind ship propellers, and so on. In the technical literature a number of vortices that arise under special conditions also have names: the [[Von Kármán vortex street|Kármán vortex street]] wake behind a bluff body, [[Taylor vortex|Taylor vortices]] between rotating cylinders, [[Görtler vortices]] in flow along a curved wall, etc.

===Gaspard Riche de Prony===
The theory of running water was greatly advanced by the researches of [[Gaspard Riche de Prony]] (1755–1839). From a collection of the best experiments by previous workers he selected eighty-two (fifty-one on the velocity of water in conduit pipes, and thirty-one on its velocity in open canals); and, discussing these on physical and mechanical principles, he succeeded in drawing up general formulae, which afforded a simple expression for the velocity of running water.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Johann Albert Eytelwein===
[[Johann Albert Eytelwein|J. A. Eytelwein]] of [[Berlin]], who published in 1801 a valuable compendium of hydraulics entitled ''Handbuch der Mechanik und der Hydraulik'', investigated the subject of the discharge of water by compound pipes, the motions of jets and their impulses against plane and oblique surfaces; and he showed theoretically that a [[Water wheel|water-wheel]] will have its maximum effect when its circumference moves with half the velocity of the stream.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette and others===
[[Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette|JNP Hachette]] in 1816–1817 published memoirs containing the results of experiments on the spouting of fluids and the discharge of vessels. His object was to measure the contracted part of a fluid vein, to examine the phenomena attendant on additional tubes, and to investigate the form of the fluid vein and the results obtained when different forms of orifices are employed. Extensive experiments on the discharge of water from orifices (''Expériences hydrauliques'', Paris, 1832) were conducted under the direction of the French government by J. V. Poncelet (1788–1867) and [[Joseph Aimé Lesbros|J. A. Lesbros]] (1790–1860).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

P. P. Boileau (1811–1891) discussed their results and added experiments of his own (''Traité de la mesure des eaux courantes'', Paris, 1854). K. R. Bornemann re-examined all these results with great care, and gave formulae expressing the variation of the coefficients of discharge in different conditions (''Civil Ingénieur,'' 1880). [[Julius Weisbach]] (1806–1871) also made many experimental investigations on the discharge of fluids.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The experiments of [[James Bicheno Francis|J. B. Francis]] (''Lowell Hydraulic Experiments'', Boston, Mass., 1855) led him to propose variations in the accepted formulae for the discharge over weirs, and a generation later a very complete investigation of this subject was carried out by [[Henri-Émile Bazin]]. An elaborate inquiry on the flow of water in pipes and channels was conducted by [[Henry Darcy|Henry G. P. Darcy]] (1803–1858) and continued by Bazin, at the expense of the French government (''Recherches hydrauliques'', Paris, 1866).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Andreas Rudolf Harlacher and others===
German engineers have also devoted special attention to the measurement of the flow in rivers; the ''Beiträge zur Hydrographie des Königreiches Böhmen'' (Prague, 1872–1875) of [[Andreas Rudolf Harlacher]] contained valuable measurements of this kind, together with a comparison of the experimental results with the formulae of flow that had been proposed up to the date of its publication, and important data were yielded by the gaugings of the [[Mississippi]] made for the United States government by [[Andrew Atkinson Humphreys]] and [[Henry Larcom Abbot]], by Robert Gordon's gaugings of the [[Irrawaddy River]], and by Allen J. C. Cunningham's experiments on the [[Ganges]] canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967596679|title=Rivers and canals, Volume 1, Rivers : with statistics of the traffic on inland waterways|last=1839–1907|first=Vernon-Harcourt, Leveson Francis,|isbn=1108080596|location=Cambridge|oclc=967596679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friction of water, investigated for slow speeds by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]], was measured for higher speeds by [[William Froude]] (1810–1879), whose work is of great value in the theory of ship resistance (''Brit. Assoc. Report.'', 1869), and stream line motion was studied by [[Osborne Reynolds|Professor Osborne Reynolds]] and by [[Henry Selby Hele-Shaw|Professor Henry S. Hele-Shaw]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Developments in vortex dynamics===
'''Vortex dynamics''' is a vibrant subfield of fluid dynamics, commanding attention at major scientific conferences and precipitating workshops and symposia that focus fully on the subject.

A curious diversion in the history of vortex dynamics was the [[Aether theories|vortex atom theory]] of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later [[Lord Kelvin]]. His basic idea was that atoms were to be represented as vortex motions in the ether. This theory predated the [[Bohr model|quantum theory]] by several decades and because of the scientific standing of its originator received considerable attention. Many profound insights into vortex dynamics were generated during the pursuit of this theory. Other interesting corollaries were the first counting of simple knots by [[P. G. Tait]], today considered a pioneering effort in [[graph theory]], [[topology]] and [[knot theory]]. Ultimately, [[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin's]] vortex atom was seen to be wrong-headed but the many results in vortex dynamics that it precipitated have stood the test of time. [[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin]] himself originated the notion of [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] and proved that in an [[Euler equations|inviscid fluid]] circulation around a material contour would be conserved. This result {{emdash}} singled out by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in "Zum hundertjährigen Gedenktag von Lord Kelvins Geburt, Naturwissenschaften, 12 (1924), 601–602," (title translation: "On the 100th Anniversary of Lord Kelvin's Birth"), as one of the most significant results of [[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin's]] work provided an early link between fluid dynamics and topology.

The history of vortex dynamics seems particularly rich in discoveries and re-discoveries of important results, because results obtained were entirely forgotten after their discovery and then were re-discovered decades later. Thus, the integrability of the problem of three point vortices on the plane was solved in the 1877 thesis of a young Swiss applied mathematician named [[Walter Gröbli]]. In spite of having been written in [[Göttingen]] in the general circle of scientists surrounding [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]], and in spite of having been mentioned in Kirchhoff's well known lectures on [[theoretical physics]] and in other major texts such as Lamb's ''Hydrodynamics'', this solution was largely forgotten. A 1949 paper by the noted applied mathematician [[John Lighton Synge|J. L. Synge]] created a brief revival, but Synge's paper was in turn forgotten. A quarter century later a 1975 paper by [[E. A. Novikov]] and a 1979 paper by [[Hassan Aref|H. Aref]] on [[chaotic advection]] finally brought this important earlier work to light. The subsequent elucidation of chaos in the four-vortex problem, and in the advection of a passive particle by three vortices, made Gröbli's work part of "modern science".

Another example of this kind is the so-called "localized induction approximation" (LIA) for three-dimensional vortex filament motion, which gained favor in the mid-1960s through the work of Arms, Hama, Betchov and others, but turns out to date from the early years of the 20th century in the work of Da Rios, a gifted student of the noted Italian mathematician [[Tullio Levi-Civita|T. Levi-Civita]]. Da Rios published his results in several forms but they were never assimilated into the fluid mechanics literature of his time. In 1972 H. Hasimoto used Da Rios' "intrinsic equations" (later re-discovered independently by R. Betchov) to show how the motion of a vortex filament under LIA could be related to the non-linear [[Schrödinger equation]]. This immediately made the problem part of "modern science" since it was then realized that vortex filaments can support solitary twist waves of large amplitude.

The '''Inertial number''' &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; quantifies the significance of dynamic effects in a [[granular material]]. It measures the ratio of inertial forces of grains to imposed forces: a small value corresponds to the quasi-static state, while a high value corresponds to the inertial state or even the "dynamic" state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Discrete numerical simulation, quasistatic deformation and the origins of strain in granular materials | last1=Combe | first1=G. | last2=Roux | first2=J.-N. |conference=3ème Symposium International sur le Comportement des sols et des roches tendres | location=Lyon | date=22–24 September 2003 |pages=1071–1078 (2003)|arxiv=0901.3842|bibcode=2009arXiv0901.3842C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On dense granular flows|first=G.D.R. |last=Midi|journal=[[European Physical Journal E|EPJ E]]|pages=341–365 (2004)|volume=14|doi=10.1140/epje/i2003-10153-0|url=http://epje.edpsciences.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/epje/abs/2004/08/epje03211/epje03211.html|arxiv=cond-mat/0312502|bibcode=2004EPJE...14..341M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Discrete numerical simulation and the mechanical behavior of granular materials|author=Roux J.-N., Chevoir F.|journal=BULLETIN DES LABORATOIRES DES PONTS ET CHAUSSÉES - 254|year=2005|pages=109–138|url=http://navier.enpc.fr/rheophysique/pdf/Granulaires3.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Radjaï | first1=F. | last2=Dubois | first2=F.| title = Discrete-Element Modeling of Granular Materials| publisher = ISTE Ltd and John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc | date=8 March 2011 | chapter= Chapter 8 - Dimensional Analysis and Control Parameters | isbn = 1-84821-260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\dot\gamma d}{\sqrt{P/\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear rate]], &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; the average particle diameter, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density.

Generally three regimes are distinguished:
* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;: [[Quasistatic process|quasi static flow]]
* &lt;math&gt;10^{-3}&lt;I&lt;10^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;: dense flow
* &lt;math&gt;I&gt;10^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;: collisional flow

One model of dense granular flows, the [[M(I) rheology|μ(I) rheology]], asserts that the [[coefficient of friction]] ''μ'' of a granular material is a function of the inertial number only.

The '''January 8–13, 2011 North American Blizzard''' was a major [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] nor'easter and winter storm, and a [[New England]] [[blizzard]]. The storm also affected portions of the Southeastern regions of the United States. This storm came just two weeks after a previous major blizzard severely affected most of these same areas in [[December 2010 North American blizzard|December 2010]]. It was the second significant snowstorm to affect the region during the 2010–11 North American winter storm season.

==Meteorological history==
The storm took on a similar track as the storm that had crippled the region in December 2010. The storm formed as a low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico, which interacted with an upper level low pressure system that dropped down from central Canada. Like the previous storm, it was fueled by a great amount of southern stream energy. In mid-Atlantic states, the track of the storm was over 50 miles east of the previous one; besides, the storm was a fast-moving system. As a result, snowfall totals in these areas were not expected to reach those of the December 2010 blizzard two weeks earlier. However, the storm dumped over 2 feet of snow in some areas in New England before it moved out to sea on Thursday.

==Impact==
From January 8 through January 10, the storm dropped a swath of snow and ice from eastern [[Texas]], and eastward across portions of [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[the Carolinas]]. Significant snows and ice fell in these regions causing significant travel emergencies and accidents. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest in the world had only seen around 30 flights take off. Many flights were canceled however the airport did not close. Icy conditions were reported around the Atlanta and Birmingham as numerous traffic accidents were reported.

Meanwhile, a second system swung southeastward from [[Alberta, Canada]], delivering light amounts of snow to [[the Dakotas]], the [[Upper Midwest]] and the [[Great Lakes]] regions.  Energy from the two systems combined off the coast of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]] late on January 10, forming the storm that delivered over 2 feet of snow to New England on January 12.

The storm affected portions of [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], much of [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Massachusetts]] overnight late Tuesday into Wednesday, January 12, 2011. Although the storm was expected to intensify to become a blizzard, New York City was spared from the worst. The city's public schools remained open. By Wednesday morning, Central Park had received 9.1 inches of snow; however, a lot of the areas in central and eastern Long Island had seen 15 to 20 inches of snow before it all ended. In [[Edison, New Jersey]], there was a reported snowfall total of 10.2 inches of snow.&lt;ref name="snowfall in nyc and L.I."&gt;[http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=OKX&amp;product=PNS National Weather Service Forecast Office: Snowfall Reports for the Current Storm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut bore the brunt of the storm, with many locations checking in with snowfall totals of 20 to 30 inches.&lt;ref name="snowfall in nyc and L.I." /&gt;  Heavy snow caused the roof of an apartment building in [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] to collapse, forcing the evacuation of 10 residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/new_london_cty/roof-collapse-at-norwich-apartment-bldg, Roof Collapses at Norwich Apartment Building, WTNH-TV, January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The storm forced [[Connecticut State Police|state troopers]] to close a 50-mile stretch of [[Connecticut Turnpike|Interstate 95]] in southwest Connecticut due to numerous [[tractor trailer|trucks]] becoming stuck on the highway in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/fairfield_cty/stuck-trucks-clog-95-for-hours Stuck trucks clog I-95 for Hours, WTNH TV, January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The storm also caused the bubble covering the Cheshire Community Pool in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]] to collapse, forcing its closure for the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrecordjournal.com/cheshire/article_1fe6f1b4-1e8f-11e0-a91e-001cc4c002e0.html Cheshire Pool bubble collapses]&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest amount of snowfall was reported at [[Savoy, Massachusetts]], with 40.5 inches. The storm also caused widespread airport delays and school closings in the region. Also, isolated amounts of more than 2 feet occurred in eastern Massachusetts. In [[Wilmington, MA]], [[Winchester, MA]] and [[Lexington, MA]], amounts of 24 inches occurred, with Winchester reporting 24.2 inches.

The [[Edgewood Yacht Club]] was completely destroyed by a fire at the height of the storm. The elements made it extremely difficult for the fire to be put out. There were no injuries from the fire, although it is still unknown what caused the fire to start.

This blizzard together with blizzards later in the month is estimated to have led to a loss of 150,000 jobs in the United States for January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lahart|first=Justin|title=Job Report Muddies Outlook|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704709304576123862334939594|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=February 5, 2011|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the first African-American to win the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2004, for her successful campaign for relocating people who lived in a community close to a chemical plant in [[Norco, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=goldman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/100 |title=North America 2004.

"Margie believes in the community leading the way," says Dr. Beverly Wright, director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice.

[[Image:Aqua aura.jpg|thumb|Aqua aura, crystals coated with gold fumes]]
[[Image:Flame Aura.jpg|thumb|A flame aura pendant set in silver.]]

'''Metal-coated crystals''' are natural [[crystal]]s, such as [[quartz]], whose surface has been coated with metal to give them an iridescent metallic sheen. Crystals treated this way are used as [[gemstone]]s and for other decorative purposes. Possible coatings include [[gold]] (resulting in a stone called '''aqua aura'''), [[indium]], [[titanium]], [[niobium]] and [[copper]]. Other names for crystals treated so include '''angel aura''', '''flame aura''', '''opal aura''' or '''rainbow quartz'''.

Aqua aura is created in a vacuum chamber from quartz crystals and gold vapour by [[vapour deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Dictionary of Geology By Cindy Jones - Page 16 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=12u5FkbIUdMC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22%222aqua+aura%22%222+-healing&amp;ei=qynVR5P7FoOssgP0t4z2Aw&amp;sig=HsEDip23colt4cIg9wweA_UIXzU Google Books Link])&lt;/ref&gt; The quartz is heated to 871 °C (1600 °F) in a [[vacuum]], and then gold vapor is added to the chamber. The gold atoms fuse to the crystal's surface, which gives the crystal an iridescent metallic sheen. 
When viewed under a gemological microscope in diffused direct transmitted light, aqua aura displays the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;Gems: Their Sources, Descriptions and Identification By Robert Webster, Michael O'Donoghue ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwcM5H-wHNoC&amp;pg=PT28&amp;dq=%22%222aqua+aura%22%222+-healing&amp;lr=&amp;ei=zCrVR-XPNYWwtgPVwpj2Aw&amp;sig=5JwZQlpMhKZLCPmHvjEzHQuo4o0#PPA725,M1 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;

*diffused dark outlines of some facet junctions
*a patchy blue colour distribution on some facets
*white facet junctions, irregular white abrasions and surface pits, where the treatment either did not "take" or had been abraded away.

Rainbow quartz have been treated with a combination of titanium and gold. Titanium molecules are bonded to the quartz by the natural electrostatic charge of the crystal in a process known as [[magnetron ionization]]. The brilliant color of flame aura is the result of [[optical interference]] effects produced by layers of titanium.  Since only electricity is used to deposit the titanium layers and create these colors, very little heat is involved and the integrity of the crystal is maintained. The crystal does not become brittle or prone to breakage as with other treatments.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

'''Methernitha''' refers to two related entities, both founded by Paul Baumann&amp;nbsp;— '''Methernitha Christian Alliance''' and '''Methernitha Cooperative'''. One is a religious group, and the other is a community in [[Linden, Switzerland]], based on the group's principles.

==Organizations==

===The religious group===
The Methernitha Christian Alliance exists as a loose association of members who subscribe to the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Members do not have organized meetings, nor do they necessarily live in the same area. Current members are distributed throughout Switzerland and other countries. The Alliance was founded in the 1950s by a small group of Christian oriented people whose goal was to live according to the teachings of the Bible. Eventually the group founded a commune in Linden in the [[canton of Bern]].

===The community===
Originally based on the principles of the Methernitha Christian Alliance, the Methernitha Cooperative is now more philosophically inclusive and in 1960 was registered with the Swiss Commercial Register as a legal entity. The organisation was laid down in Articles of Association and adheres to the Rules of the [[Swiss Federation]].
 
The Cooperative is a residential joint venture work group operated on a democratic basis. Administration staff are chosen from the members in a  general meeting. It has its own television studios that transmit self-produced programs.  The commune also has its own school and nursing home, and a "club house", which is the center for worship and their historical archives.

Members are still Swiss citizens, and the Cooperative pays all relevant taxes and social security to the government.

==Beliefs==
Methernitha is a Christian group, but it is non-evangelical, refraining from attempts to win new converts. Members do not indulge in alcohol, tobacco or recreational drugs or money.

==Free energy==
The Methernitha Cooperative claimed to have developed years ago a [[Perpetual motion|free-energy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carolina Hehenkamp |title=Methernitha — A Community That Runs on Free Energy and Spiritual Values |url=http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/feb2/methnith.htm |work= |publisher=''Spiritofmaat'' |date=2 February 2002 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; device called the Testatika:

:"This wonder-machine is fueled from nature, nothing else. Nature is the greatest source of power as well as knowledge which man has, and it still conceals many secrets, which are only revealed to those, who approach and tie in with them with highest  respect and responsibility&amp;nbsp;... To understand nature and to perceive its voice, man is obliged to experience silence and solitude, and it was there, where the knowledge about this technology was obtained."

==Criticism==
In France, the religious group was criticized by an anti-cult association [[ADFI]], which considered it a [[cult]] ("secte" in French-language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UNADFI |title=Association spirituelle ou entreprise plutôt lucrative ? |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/methern1.htm |publisher=''Prevensectes'' |language=French | year=1992 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Paul Baumann, the founder of the community, was sentenced to six years imprisonment for sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Baumann, Jörg Stolz |title=Eine Schweiz, viele Religionen: Risiken und Chancen des Zusammenlebens |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oKIptxbTiwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA295&amp;dq=methernitha&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=methernitha&amp;f=false |page=295 |language=German |year=2007 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Scotland}}
The '''Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning''' is a [[junior minister]]ial post in the [[Scottish Government]]. As a result, the Minister does not attend the [[Government of the 4th Scottish Parliament|Scottish Cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_1 Scotland Act (1998)], ''Only those appointed under Section 47 of the Scotland Act "attend" Cabinet. Junior ministers are appointed under Section 49 and may be "present".''&lt;/ref&gt; The minister supports the [[Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government]], who has overall responsible for the portfolio.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;

The current Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning is [[Kevin Stewart (Scottish politician)|Kevin Stewart]] MSP, who was appointed on 18 May 2016. The minister is responsible for housing, local government, planning, building standards, [[Business Improvement District]]s, community planning, homelessness, regeneration, and fuel poverty.&lt;ref name=june2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/minister-local-government-housing-planning/|title=Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning|date=27 June 2018|accessdate=27 June 2018|publisher=Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011, the position of '''Minister for Local Government and Planning''' was created; the portfolio changed in November 2014 following a reshuffle by [[Nicola Sturgeon]] when she became [[First Minister of Scotland]]. The post was rebranded at that point to '''Minister for Local Government and Community Empowerment'''.

In September 2012, the junior post of Minister for Housing and Welfare was announced, with a portfolio intended to reflect the important role of housing in aiding economic recovery and the challenges that face those in poverty.[4] In May 2016, Nicola Sturgeon reshuffled junior ministers and the post joined local government and housing in a new '''Minister for Local Government and Housing''' role. Planning was added to the title in June 2018.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;

The '''Munich air disaster''' occurred on 6 February 1958 when [[British European Airways]] Flight 609 crashed on its third attempt to take off from a [[slush]]-covered runway at [[Munich-Riem Airport]], West Germany. On the plane was the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] [[association football|football]] team, nicknamed the "[[Busby Babes]]", along with supporters and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1958 |title=Video: Britain Mourns. Soccer Champs Die In Plane Crash, 1958/02/10 (1958) |url=https://archive.org/details/1958-02-10_Britain_Mourns |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty of the 44 on the aircraft died at the scene. The injured, some unconscious, were taken to the [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]] in Munich where three more died, resulting in 23 fatalities with 21 survivors.

The team was returning from a [[1957–58 European Cup|European Cup]] match in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], having eliminated [[Red Star Belgrade]] to advance to the semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the "Elizabethan"-class [[Airspeed Ambassador]]'s range. After refuelling, pilots [[James Thain]] and [[Kenneth Rayment]] twice abandoned take-off because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would get too far behind schedule, Captain Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By then, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form at the end of the runway. After the aircraft hit the slush, it ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway and the left wing was torn off after hitting a house. Fearing the aircraft might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers while Manchester United [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Harry Gregg]] helped pull survivors from the wreckage.

An investigation by West German airport authorities originally blamed Thain, saying he did not de-ice the aircraft's wings, despite eyewitness statements to the contrary. It was later established that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway, which slowed the plane too much to take off. Thain was cleared in 1968, ten years after the incident.

Manchester United were trying to become the third club to win three successive English league titles; they were six points behind League leaders [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] with 14 games to go. They also held the [[1957 FA Charity Shield|Charity Shield]] and had just advanced into their second successive [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] semi-finals. The team had not been beaten for 11 matches. The crash not only derailed their title ambitions that year but also virtually destroyed the nucleus of what promised to be one of the greatest generations of players in English football history. It took 10 years for the club to recover, with Busby rebuilding the team and winning the European Cup in [[1967–68 European Cup|1968]] with a new generation of "Babes".

In April 1955, UEFA established the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], a football competition for the champion clubs of UEFA-affiliated nations, to begin in the 1955–56 season;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Champions League – History |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/index.html |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the English league winners, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], were denied entry by [[the Football League]]'s secretary, [[Alan Hardaker]], who believed not participating was best for English football.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the English league was won by Manchester United, managed by [[Matt Busby]]. The Football League again denied their champions entry, but Busby and his chairman, [[Harold Hardman]], with the help of [[the Football Association]]'s chairman [[Stanley Rous]], defied the league and United became the first English team to play in Europe.&lt;ref name="white_105"&gt;White, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team – known as the "[[Busby Babes]]" for their youth – reached the semi-finals, beaten there by the eventual winners, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Winning the First Division title again that season meant qualification for the [[1957–58 European Cup|1957–58]] tournament, and their cup run in 1956–57 meant they were one of the favourites to win. Domestic league matches were on Saturdays and European matches midweek, so, although air travel was risky, it was the only choice if United were to fulfil their league fixtures,&lt;ref&gt;Crick et al., p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; which they would have to do if they were to avoid proving Alan Hardaker right.&lt;ref name="white_105"/&gt;

After overcoming [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and [[Dukla Prague]] in the preliminary and first round respectively, United were drawn with [[Red Star Belgrade]] of [[Yugoslavia]] for the quarter-finals. After beating them 2–1 at [[Old Trafford]] on 14 January 1958, the club was to travel to Yugoslavia for the return leg on 5 February. On the way back from Prague in the previous round, fog over England prevented the team from flying back to Manchester, so they flew to [[Amsterdam]] before taking the ferry from the [[Hook of Holland]] to [[Harwich]] and then the train to Manchester. The trip took its toll on the players and they drew 3–3 with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]] three days later.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eager not to miss Football League fixtures, and not to have a difficult trip again, the club chartered a [[British European Airways]] plane from Manchester to Belgrade for the away leg against Red Star.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The match was drawn 3–3 but it was enough to send United to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[takeoff]] from [[Belgrade]] was delayed for an hour after [[outside forward|outside right]] [[Johnny Berry]] lost his passport,&lt;ref&gt;Crick et al., p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and the plane landed in Munich for refuelling at 13:15 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="white_119"&gt;White, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft and crew===
The aircraft was a six-year-old [[Airspeed Ambassador|Airspeed Ambassador 2]], built in 1952 and delivered to BEA the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Woodley |title=History of British European Airways 1946–1974 |year=2006 |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Aviation |location=Barnsley |page=182 |isbn=1-84415-186-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot, Captain [[James Thain]], was a former RAF [[flight lieutenant]]. Originally a [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|sergeant]] (later a [[Warrant officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer]]), he was given an emergency commission in the RAF as an [[acting pilot officer]] on probation in April 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36534 |date=30 May 1944 |page=2479 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[pilot officer]] on probation in September that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36830 |date=8 December 1944  |page=5627 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to flight lieutenant in May 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38323 |date=15 June 1948 |page=3514 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a permanent commission in the same rank in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=39669 |date=14 October 1952  |page=5392 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the RAF to join BEA.

The co-pilot, Captain [[Kenneth Rayment]], was also a former RAF flight lieutenant and a [[Second World War]] [[flying ace]]. After joining the RAF in 1940, he was promoted to sergeant in September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35343 |date=11 November 1941 |page=6507 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned as a war substantive pilot officer a year later,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35747 |date=16 October 1942 |page=4489 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to war substantive [[flying officer]] in May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36033 |date=2 June 1943|page=2460 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shot down five German fighters, one Italian plane and a [[V-1 flying bomb]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] in July 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36108 |date=27 July 1943 |page=3384 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to flight lieutenant in September 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36165 |date=10 September 1943 |page=4018 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the RAF in 1945, he joined [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] in Cairo, before joining BEA in 1947. He had had experience with [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Viking]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]] and the Ambassador "Elizabethan" class.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikekemble.com/manutd/munich3.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
[[File:Airspeed Ambassador G-ALZU Burning At Munich 1958.jpg|thumb|left|The Airspeed Ambassador ''G-ALZU'' burning at Munich]]
Thain had flown the "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador (registration G-ALZU) to Belgrade but handed the controls to Rayment for the return.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; At 14:19 GMT, the control tower at Munich was told the plane was ready to take off and gave clearance for take-off, expiring at 14:31.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Rayment abandoned the take-off after Thain noticed the port [[Supercharger|boost pressure]] gauge fluctuating as the plane reached full power and the engine sounded odd while accelerating.&lt;ref name="morrin_98"&gt;Morrin, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; A second attempt was made three minutes later, but called off 40 seconds into the attempt&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; because the engines were running on an over-rich [[Carburettor|mixture]], causing them to over-accelerate, a common problem for the "Elizabethan".&lt;ref name="morrin_98"/&gt; After the second failure, passengers retreated to the airport lounge.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, it had started to snow heavily, and it looked unlikely that the plane would be making the return journey that day. Manchester United's [[Duncan Edwards]] sent a telegram to his landlady in Manchester. It read: "All flights cancelled, flying tomorrow. Duncan."&lt;ref name="barnes_16"&gt;Barnes et al., p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thain told the station engineer, Bill Black, about the problem with the boost surging in the port engine, and Black suggested that since opening the throttle more slowly had not worked, the only option was to hold the plane overnight for retuning. Thain was anxious to stay on schedule and suggested opening the throttle even more slowly would suffice. This would mean that the plane would not achieve take-off velocity until further down the runway, but with the runway almost {{convert|2|km|mi}} long, he believed this would not be a problem. The passengers were called back to the plane 15 minutes after leaving it.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the players were not confident fliers, particularly [[Billy Whelan|Liam Whelan]], who said, "This may be death, but I'm ready". Others, including Duncan Edwards, [[Tommy Taylor]], [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]], [[Eddie Colman]] and [[Frank Swift]], moved to the back of the plane, believing it safer.&lt;ref name="white_119"/&gt; Once everyone was on board, Thain and Rayment got the plane moving again at 14:56.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; At 14:59, they reached the runway holding point, where they received clearance to line up ready for take-off.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; On the runway, they made final cockpit checks and at 15:02, they were told their take-off clearance would expire at 15:04.&lt;ref name="morrin_108"&gt;Morrin, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots agreed to attempt take-off, but that they would watch the instruments for surging in the engines. At 15:03, they told the control tower of their decision.&lt;ref name="morrin_108"/&gt;

[[File:1958-02-10 Britain Mourns. Soccer Champs Die In Plane Crash - small unedited.ogv|thumb|American newsreel footage reporting the crash]]
Rayment moved the throttle forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower with the message "Zulu Uniform rolling".&lt;ref name="morrin_109"&gt;Morrin, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments.&lt;ref name="morrin_109"/&gt; At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, and he pulled back marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again.&lt;ref name="morrin_109"/&gt; Once the plane reached {{convert|117|kn|km/h}}, he announced "[[V speeds#V1|V1]]", at which it was no longer safe to abort take-off, and Rayment listened for the call of "[[V speeds#V2|V2]]" ({{convert|119|kn|km/h}}), the minimum required to get off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around 117 knots before suddenly dropping to {{convert|112|kn|km/h}}, and then {{convert|105|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="morrin_110"&gt;Morrin, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Rayment shouted "Christ, we won't make it!",&lt;ref name="morrin_110"/&gt; as Thain looked up to see what lay ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane skidded off the end of the runway, crashed into the fence surrounding the airport and across a road before its port wing was torn off as it caught a house, home to a family of six.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The father and eldest daughter were away and the mother and the other three children escaped as the house caught fire.&lt;ref name="morrin_113"&gt;Morrin, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the plane's tail was torn off before the left side of the cockpit hit a tree.&lt;ref name="morrin_113"/&gt; The right side of the fuselage hit a wooden hut, inside which was a truck filled with tyres and fuel, which exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Munich air disaster: a timeline |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2008/01/17/060208_munich_timeline_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Manchester |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty passengers died on board, and three died later in hospital.

On seeing flames around the cockpit, Thain feared that the aircraft would explode and told his crew to evacuate the area. The [[stewardess]]es, Rosemary Cheverton and Margaret Bellis, were the first to leave through a blown-out emergency window in the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]], followed by radio officer Bill Rodgers.&lt;ref name="morrin_115"&gt;Morrin, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Rayment was trapped in his seat by the crumpled fuselage and told Thain to go without him. Thain clambered out of the galley window.&lt;ref name="morrin_115"/&gt; On reaching the ground, he saw flames growing under the starboard wing, which held {{convert|500|impgal|L}} of fuel. He shouted to his crew to get away and climbed back into the aircraft to retrieve two handheld fire extinguishers, stopping to tell Rayment he would be back when the fires had been dealt with.&lt;ref name="morrin_115"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in the cabin, [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Harry Gregg]] was regaining consciousness, thinking that he was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt blood on his face and "didn't dare put [his] hand up. [He] thought the top of [his] head had been taken off, like a hard boiled egg."&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just above him, light shone into the cabin, so Gregg kicked the hole wide enough for him to escape. He also managed to save some passengers.

==Investigation==
The crash was originally blamed on pilot error, but it was later found to have been caused by slush towards the end of the [[runway]], slowing the aircraft and preventing [[V speeds|safe flying speed]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; During take-off, the aircraft had reached {{convert|117|kn|km/h}}, but, on entering the slush, dropped to {{convert|105|kn|km/h}}, too slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with [[Conventional landing gear|tail-wheel]] [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]s had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|aircraft's centre of gravity]],&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Aircraft with tailwheel undercarriages have the main undercarriage – about which the aeroplane [[Rotation (aviation)|rotates on take-off]] – positioned ahead of the aircraft's centre of gravity, allowing the aircraft to be flown off by application of up-elevator should deceleration be applied to the mainwheels on take-off when close to flying speed. On aircraft with a nosewheel, the main wheels are positioned behind the centre of gravity, causing a nose-down [[torque|moment]] (force) should undue drag occur at the mainwheels, even if the nosewheel is already off the ground. This nose-down force reduces the elevator authority and makes it more difficult to keep the nosewheel off the ground, whereas the tailwheel undercarriage aeroplane already has its tailwheel off the ground at this point, and applying up elevator will usually lower the tail sufficiently for the aircraft to lift-off. On the nosewheel-equipped aircraft, the additional drag of the nosewheel in the slush reduces speed even more, as once the mainwheels have entered slush and initiated a downward force on the nose, the aeroplane has three wheels in contact with the slush, rather than just two. The tailwheel-equipped aeroplane upon entering slush may be 'hauled off' at close to safe flying speed, whereas the nosewheel one may be prevented from reaching it, or have its speed reduced by the additional drag of the nosewheel. As the slush drag further slows the aeroplane, this can make it impossible to raise the nosewheel off the runway, so the aircraft is unable to rotate. On a tailwheeled aircraft, the slush drag force is usually insufficient to prevent rotation, providing sufficient airspeed is reached, whereas on a nosewheeled aeroplane, it may force the nosewheel back onto the runway, or, depending on the airspeed achieved, even prevent it from being raised at all. In the Munich case, the drag of the slush slowed the Ambassador – which had twin-wheeled nose and mainwheel undercarriage units – sufficiently to make take-off impossible, while insufficient runway remained for the aircraft to be stopped safely.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with [[Tricycle gear|nose wheel landing-gear]] and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of operating limits for the amount of slush build-up permitted on runways.{{Citation needed|date = February 2013}}

Despite this conclusion, the German airport authorities took legal action against Captain Thain, as the one pilot who had survived the crash. They claimed he had taken off without clearing the wings of ice, which caused the crash, despite several witnesses stating that no ice had been seen.&lt;ref name="Mayday"&gt;[http://www.discoverychannel.ca/episodeList.aspx?sid=12966 MAYDAY: SEASON 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219135535/http://www.discoverychannel.ca/episodeList.aspx?sid=12966 |date=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De-icing the aircraft was the captain's responsibility, while the state of the airport's runways was the responsibility of the airport authorities, among whom there was widespread ignorance of the danger of slush on runways for aircraft such as the Ambassador.

The basis of the German authorities' case relied on the icy condition of the wings hours after the crash and a photograph of the aircraft (published in several newspapers) taken shortly before take-off, that appeared to show snow on the upper wing surfaces. When the original [[negative (photography)|negative]] was examined, no snow or ice could be seen, the "snow" in the original having been due to the sun reflecting off the wings, which was clarified when examining the negative rather than the published pictures which had been produced from a copy negative.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The witnesses were not called to the German inquiry and proceedings against Thain dragged on until 1968, when he was finally cleared of any responsibility for the crash. As the official cause, British authorities recorded a build-up of melting snow on the runway which prevented the "Elizabethan" from reaching the required take-off speed. Thain, having been dismissed by BEA shortly after the accident and never re-engaged, retired and returned to run his poultry farm in [[Berkshire]]. He died of a heart attack at the age of 53 in August 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201496.html death notice] in ''[[Flight International]]''. 14 August 1975, p. 210. Retrieved 4 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
20 people, including seven of Manchester United's players, died at the scene of the crash. The 21st victim, [[Frank Swift]], the journalist and former [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] goalkeeper, died on his way to hospital. [[Duncan Edwards]] died from his injuries on 21 February at the [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]] in Munich, and the final death toll reached 23 several days later when co-pilot Ken Rayment died as a result of serious head injuries.&lt;ref name="barnes_16"/&gt; [[Johnny Berry]] and [[Jackie Blanchflower]] were both injured so severely that they never played again.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Busby was seriously injured and had to stay in hospital for more than two months after the crash, and was read his [[Anointing of the Sick|Last Rites]] twice.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al., p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged from hospital, he went to Switzerland to recuperate in [[Interlaken]]. At times, he felt like giving up football entirely, until he was told by his wife, Jean, "You know Matt, the lads would have wanted you to carry on."&lt;ref name="morrin_155"&gt;Morrin, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; That statement lifted Busby from his depression, and he returned by land to Manchester, before watching his team play in the [[1958 FA Cup Final]].&lt;ref name="morrin_155"/&gt;

Meanwhile, there was speculation that the club would fold, but a threadbare United team completed the 1957–58 season, with Busby's assistant [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] standing in as manager; he had not travelled to Belgrade as he was in Cardiff managing the Welsh national team at the time. A team largely made up of [[Reserve team|reserve]] and [[Youth system|youth team]] players beat [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 3–0 in the first match after the disaster. The programme for that match showed simply a blank space where each United player's name should have been. With seven players dead (Duncan Edwards died just over 24 hours later), and with only Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes fit to play out of the surviving players, United were desperate to find replacements with experience, so Murphy signed [[Ernie Taylor (footballer born 1925)|Ernie Taylor]] from [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stan Crowther (footballer)|Stan Crowther]] from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Three players, [[Derek Lewin]], [[Bob Hardisty]] and [[Warren Bradley (footballer)|Warren Bradley]], were transferred to United on short-term contracts by [[Non-League football|non-League]] club [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]]. Bradley was the only one of the three players to play for the first team, and the only one to sign a permanent contract. The remaining places in the team were filled by reserve players including [[Shay Brennan]] and [[Mark Pearson (footballer)|Mark Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvertiserseries.co.uk/news/9583397.Marking_club_s_125_year_history/ Marking club's 125-year history] The Advertiser, 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the crash, Manchester United's fierce rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (who would later be managed by Busby's good friend [[Bill Shankly]]) offered United five loan players to help them put a side together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Graves |title=Liverpool and Manchester United: the times the teams and fans put rivalry aside |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-manchester-united-times-teams-12035393 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |publisher=Trinity Mirror Merseyside |date=17 October 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were changes in the backroom staff at the club too, following the deaths of secretary [[Walter Crickmer]] and coaches [[Tom Curry]] and [[Bert Whalley]].&lt;ref name="morrin_146"&gt;Morrin, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; United [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Les Olive]], still registered as a player at the time of the disaster, retired from playing and took over from Crickmer as club secretary,&lt;ref name="morrin_146"/&gt; while another former United goalkeeper, [[Jack Crompton]], took over coaching duties after United chairman [[Harold Hardman]] had negotiated with Crompton's then-employers [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for his release.&lt;ref name="morrin_146"/&gt;

United only won one league game after the crash, causing their title challenge to collapse and they fell to ninth place in the league.&lt;ref name="1957-58"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Endlar |title=1957/58 |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season1958.html |publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk |accessdate=10 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They did manage to reach the final of the [[FA Cup]], however, losing 2–0 to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]],&lt;ref name="1957-58"/&gt; and even managed to beat [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] at [[Old Trafford]] in the semi-finals of the European Cup, only to lose 4–0 at the [[San Siro]].&lt;ref name="1957-58"/&gt; Real Madrid, who went on to win the trophy for the third year running, suggested that Manchester United be awarded the trophy for that year – a suggestion supported by [[Red Star Belgrade]] – but this failed to materialise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Richards |title=World Laments Manchester Loss |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KZRlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EooNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3483,1146085&amp;dq=manchester-united&amp;hl=en |work=The Vancouver Sun |page=22 |date=7 February 1958 |accessdate=23 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busby resumed managerial duties the next season (1958–59), and eventually built a second generation of Busby Babes, including [[George Best]] and [[Denis Law]], that ten years later won the [[1967–68 European Cup|European Cup]], beating [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Bill Foulkes]] were the only two crash survivors who lined up in that team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1968: Manchester United win European Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_4464000/4464446.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 May 1968 |accessdate=10 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fund for dependents of victims of the crash was established in March, and chaired by the Chairman of the FA, [[Arthur Drewry]].&lt;ref&gt;'[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', Manchester, 1 April 1958, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The fund had raised [[Pound sterling|£]]52,000 (equivalent to £{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|52000|1958|r=0}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}) by the time of its disbursement in October 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Our own Reporter, ''The Manchester Guardian'', Manchester, 11 October 1958, 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}

==Memorials==

===Old Trafford===
[[File:Munich plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|Commemorative plaque in the Munich Tunnel at Old Trafford|alt=A plaque with words enclosed in a square box, underneath which is a square metal inside a circle.]]
The first memorials at [[Old Trafford]] to the lost players and staff were unveiled on 25 February 1960. The first, a plaque in the shape of the stadium with the image of a green pitch, inscribed with the names of the victims in black and gold glass, was placed above the entrance to the directors' box. Above the plaque was a teak carving of a player and a supporter, heads bowed either side of a wreath and a football inscribed with the date "1958". The plaque was designed by Manchester architect J. Vipond and constructed by Messrs Jaconello (Manchester) Ltd. at a cost of £2,100,&lt;ref name="red_news"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Munich Plaque at Old Trafford |url=http://www.munich58.co.uk/memorials/plaque/plaque_history.asp |publisher=Munich58.co.uk |year=2005 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;br /&gt;Transcribed from a 2005 issue of Manchester United fanzine ''[[Red News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and unveiled by Matt Busby.&lt;ref name="white_14"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=John |title=The United Miscellany |publisher=Carlton Books |year=2007 |location=London |isbn=978-1-84442-745-1 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unveiled that day was a memorial to the members of the press who died at Munich, which consisted of a bronze plaque that named the eight lost journalists. It was unveiled by Munich survivor [[Frank Taylor (journalist)|Frank Taylor]] on behalf of the Football Writers' Association. The original plaque was stolen in the 1980s and replaced by a replica now located behind the counter in the press entrance.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt; The final memorial was the Munich clock, a simple two-faced clock paid for by the Ground Committee and attached to the south-east corner of the stadium, with the date "6 Feb 1958" at the top of both faces and "Munich" at the bottom. The clock has remained in the same position since it was first installed.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt; The clock was unveiled on 25 February 1960 by Dan Marsden, the chairman of the Ground Committee.&lt;ref name="white_14"/&gt;

When the stadium was renovated in the mid-1970s, the plaque had to be moved from the directors' entrance to allow the necessary changes. The plaque could not be removed without damaging it, so the old memorial was walled up within the Main Stand and a new memorial was made, simpler than the original, now consisting simply of a slate pitch with the names inscribed upon it, and installed in 1976.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt;

A third version of the memorial, more like the original than the second in that it included the stands around the slate pitch and the figures above it, was installed in 1996, coinciding with the erection of the statue of Matt Busby, who had unveiled the original memorial.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt; This third version was constructed by stonemasons Mather and Ellis from Trafford Park, and the second was put into storage. It is currently awaiting new display panels before being placed into the club museum's Munich display.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt; The third plaque and the statue of Busby were originally located on the north side of the East Stand, but the statue was moved to the front of the East Stand and the plaque to the south side of the stand after the stand's expansion in 2000.&lt;ref name="red_news"/&gt;

===Munich===
[[File:Gedenkkreuz.JPG|thumb|left|Wooden memorial|alt=A memorial stone erected next to a road curb. Nearby is a metal pole topped by a written sign.]]
There are also two memorials in Germany. First, in the Munich suburb of [[Trudering]], on the corner of Karotschstraße and Emplstraße, there is a small wooden memorial depicting Jesus on the Cross, decorated by a stone trough filled with flowers. The trough bears a plaque with the inscription: "Im Gedenken an die Opfer der Flugzeugkatastrophe am 6.2.1958 unter denen sich auch ein Teil der Fußballmannschaft von Manchester United befand, sowie allen Verkehrstoten der Gemeinde Trudering" (''In memory of the victims of the air disaster of 6 February 1958 including members of the football team of Manchester United as well as all the traffic victims from the municipality of Trudering'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Memorial at Munich Airport |url=http://www.munich58.co.uk/memorials/munichairport/index.asp |publisher=Munich58.co.uk |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gedenkstein Manchester United Übersicht.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial stone]]
On 22 September 2004, a dark blue granite plaque set in a sandstone border was unveiled in the vicinity of the old Munich Airport on the corner of Rappenweg and Emplstraße, just metres from the wooden memorial.&lt;ref name="new_memorial"&gt;{{cite web |title=New memorial to be unveiled at Munich Airport |url=http://www.munich58.co.uk/memorials/munichairport/20040922.asp |publisher=Munich58.co.uk |year=2004 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a design in the shape of a football pitch, it reads, in both English and German, "In memory of all those who lost their lives here in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photo 3 of 13 |url=http://www.munich58.co.uk/apps/photoalbummanager/photo.asp?itemID=256 |publisher=Munich58.co.uk |date=September 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath is a plaque expressing United's gratitude to the municipality of Munich and its people. The new memorial was funded by Manchester United themselves and the unveiling was attended by club officials, including chief executive [[David Gill (executive)|David Gill]], manager [[Alex Ferguson]] and director Bobby Charlton, a survivor of the disaster himself.&lt;ref name="new_memorial"/&gt; On 24 April 2008, the Munich city council decided to name the site where the memorial stone is placed "Manchesterplatz" (''Manchester Square'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Straßenneubenennung Manchesterplatz |url=http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/kom/03vermessung/strassen/strassenneu2008/232459/manchesterplatz.html |work=muenchen.de |publisher=City of Munich |accessdate=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 57th anniversary of the crash, 6 February 2015, Sir Bobby Charlton and [[FC Bayern Munich]] chairman [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] opened a new museum exhibit commemorating the disaster at the German club's stadium, the [[Allianz Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathan |last=Thomas |title=Sir Bobby opens Bayern's Munich exhibit |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2015/Feb/Sir-Bobby-Charlton-opens-Munich-exhibit.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=8 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgrade===
There is a small display of artefacts in the Majestic Hotel, where the team stayed after the match. These include a menu card signed by 14 of the players, including the eight who were killed, a photograph taken at the meal and a match ticket. The menu card was acquired by the then British ambassador to Yugoslavia and was auctioned by his son in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Babes' autographs fetch £12,000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5406908.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40th anniversary===
In late 1997, [[John Doherty (footballer)|John Doherty]] (a former United player who had left the club shortly before the disaster)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Doherty |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-doherty-400395.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached club chairman [[Martin Edwards]] on behalf of the Manchester United Former Players' Association to request a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] for those victims of the Munich disaster – both the survivors and the dependants of the ones who were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards was hesitant, but a benefit match was eventually sanctioned for a date as close to the 40th anniversary of the disaster as possible. Red Star Belgrade and Bayern Munich were touted as possible opponents for the match, and fans purchased tickets without the opponents even having been decided.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the preparations, former United player [[Eric Cantona]], who had retired from football to pursue a career in film in 1997, expressed an interest in returning to Manchester United for a farewell match. Edwards took the opportunity to combine the two events into one.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Cantona's acting career, his schedule meant that he would not be available in February and the match was moved to 18 August, with the opposition to be a European XI chosen by Cantona. Martin Edwards was criticised for turning the match into a publicity stunt, while Elizabeth Wood, the divorced wife of Munich survivor [[Ray Wood]], compared the treatment of the Munich victims to that of "dancing bears at the circus". Nevertheless, the match earned £47,000 for each of the victims' families, while Eric Cantona recouped over £90,000 in expenses directly from the testimonial fund, rather than from the club.&lt;ref&gt;Morrin, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The club has also received criticism from some quarters for its poor treatment of the survivors: [[Johnny Berry]] was forced to leave the flat he rented from the club to make way for a new player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Syed |title=Survivors who felt left behind by club's rise from the ashes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article3300283.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February 1998, United played Bolton Wanderers at [[Old Trafford]] in the [[Premier League]] a day after the 40th anniversary of the disaster. The match kicked off at 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm to allow a minute's silence to be observed at 3:04&amp;nbsp;pm. Representatives from both teams laid floral tributes to those who lost their lives, with crash survivor and United director Bobby Charlton joined by Bolton president [[Nat Lofthouse]] in leading out the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Guy |last=Hodgson |date=7 February 1998 |title=Football: Bolton add to solemnity of occasion at Old Trafford |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/football-bolton-add-to-solemnity-of-occasion-at-old-trafford-1143418.html |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |location=London |accessdate=1 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service was held at Old Trafford on 6 February 2008. At the conclusion of the service, the surviving members of the 1958 team were the guests of honour at a ceremony to rename the tunnel under the stadium's South Stand as the "Munich Tunnel", which features an exhibition about the Busby Babes.&lt;ref name="bbc_honours"&gt;{{cite news |title=Football honours Munich victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7228670.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 February 2008 |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2008, the [[England national football team]] took on [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].

On 10 February 2008, at the derby match between Manchester United and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at Old Trafford, both teams were led onto the pitch by a lone [[Bagpipes|piper]] playing "[[The Red Flag (song)|The Red Flag]]", and the managers – Alex Ferguson and [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] – each laid a wreath in the centre circle.

Manchester City won 2–1 thanks to first half goals from [[Darius Vassell]] and debutant [[Benjani Mwaruwari|Benjani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Man Utd 1–2 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7223971.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans in attendance were given commemorative scarves – in red and white for the United fans, and blue and white for the City fans – which were held up during the silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=Moving silence at OT |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Feb/Moving-silence-at-OT.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==

===Music===
Several musical tributes to the Munich air disaster have been recorded, the earliest being the song "The Flowers of Manchester". Written by an anonymous author, later revealed to be Eric Winter, the editor of the magazine ''Sing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://theflowersofmanchester.co.uk/history/ |publisher=theflowersofmanchester.co.uk |accessdate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the song was recorded and released by Liverpool folk band [[The Spinners (UK band)|The Spinners]] on their 1962 debut album "''Quayside Songs Old and New''".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester-born singer [[Morrissey]] also released a song called "''Munich Air Disaster, 1958''" as a B-side to "''[[Irish Blood, English Heart]]''" in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Irish Blood, English Heart (CD2) (Single) |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0001Z2RGE/ |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared on his live album, ''[[Live at Earls Court]]'', in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Live at Earls Court (Specially Packaged) (Limited Edition) |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0007WD89G |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 2009 B-sides compilation, ''[[Swords (album)|Swords]]''.

Most recently, the English band [[The Futureheads]] named their album ''[[News and Tributes]]'' in honour of the disaster. The title track pays tribute to those who lost their lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Betty |last=Clarke |title=The Futureheads, News and Tributes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/26/popandrock.shopping6 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the verse:
:Cut down in their prime,
:In silence, on that day,
:February 58, they got what they need,
:From Belgrade and back home to sleep

===Film===
Barry Navidi, producer of the 2004 film ''[[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|The Merchant of Venice]]'', was reported to be working on a script for a Hollywood film about the Munich air crash. The ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' reported on 22 April 2005 that the survivors had not been consulted and were concerned about how accurate the film would be.&lt;ref name="hince"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Hince |title=Munich film row |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/155/155860_munich_film_row.html |work=Manchester Evening News  |location=Manchester |date=22 April 2005 |accessdate=10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Foulkes said that, if done right, the film could become a "tribute to the Busby Babes which could be seen for generations to come"; however, he expressed concerns about the accuracy of the film, given the filmmakers' lack of first-hand sources about what actually happened in Munich.&lt;ref name="hince"/&gt; Fellow survivor [[Harry Gregg]] was more concerned about the portrayal of the players, particularly those who died, and whether their families' feelings would be respected.&lt;ref name="hince"/&gt;

[[John Doherty (footballer)|John Doherty]], a player who had left United only a few months earlier, was less restrained, saying that "the only reason anyone would want to make a film like this is to make money" and that "while there may be a slight hint of truth in the film, it will be mainly untruths... Unless you were there, how could you know what conversations took place?".&lt;ref name="hince"/&gt;

===Television===
On 10 January 2006, the [[BBC]] showed a drama/documentary retelling the story in the series ''[[Surviving Disaster]]''. The programme was met with criticism from former United winger [[Albert Scanlon]], who claimed that it was full of inaccuracies despite the production having consulted him about the content of the documentary. Errors in the programme included the depiction of [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] giving a pre-match team talk in Belgrade, despite him being in Cardiff at the time, and the plane being shown as only half full when nearly every seat was occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survivor's anger over Munich crash film |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/197/197906_survivors_anger_over_munich_crash_film.html |work=Manchester Evening News  |date=7 January 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2008, the 50th anniversary of the crash, several television channels showed programmes about it:
*[[Yesterday (TV channel)|UKTV History]] aired the BBC co-produced drama documentary ''Surviving Disaster'' to mark the 50th anniversary of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Munich Aircrash: Disaster Season |url=http://uktv.co.uk/yesterday/stepbystep/aid/598424 |work=Yesterday |publisher=UKTV |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[MUTV (Manchester United F.C.)|MUTV]] aired a segmented documentary called ''Munich Remembered'', aired throughout the day with memories of players, staff and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MUTV Schedule: 6 Feb |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2008/Feb/MUTV-Schedule-6-Feb.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[BBC]] showed as part of its One Life series a documentary following United goalkeeper Harry Gregg retracing his route from England to Belgrade to Munich. He met and talked with some of the first rescuers who had arrived on the scene. He also met Vera Lukić, the pregnant mother whom he had rescued and Zoran, the son she bore two months later.&lt;ref name="greatest_save"/&gt;

Since the anniversary, two television programmes have been made about the disaster:
*A 2011 made-for-television film ''[[United (TV drama)|United]]'', written by [[Chris Chibnall]] and directed by [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]] for the [[BBC]], tells the story of the crash and the subsequent rebuilding of Manchester United as a footballing force. The story was seen largely through the eyes of coach [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], who became ''de facto'' manager of the team while Busby recovered from the crash. The role of Murphy was played by [[David Tennant]]. The film gained generally good reviews, especially for its evocation of the period and for Tennant's acting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/24/sam-wollaston-doctor-who-united |title= TV review: ''Doctor Who''; ''United'' |work=The Guardian |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8467086/Jim-White-Jimmy-Murphys-central-part-in-the-resurrection-of-Manchester-United-is-the-key-reason-to-watch-United.html |title=Jim White: Jimmy Murphy's central part in the resurrection of Manchester United is the key reason to watch ''United'' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated at the [[Prix Europa]] 2011 Awards as "Best European TV Production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prix-europa.de/en/prix_europa_2011/nominees/nominees_television/ |title= Prix Europa 2011: Nominees |publisher= Prix Europa |accessdate= 16 September 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111029194821/http://www.prix-europa.de/en/prix_europa_2011/nominees/nominees_television/ |archive-date= 29 October 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, criticised by Sandy Busby, the son of Matt Busby, who said he thought the film was "very poorly done", and was very critical of the film's portrayal of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-13181651 |title=Sir Matt Busby's son 'disgusted' at United TV film|publisher=BBC |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday / Air Crash Investigation]]'' covered the crash in [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 11 (2011)|episode 77 (season 11, #5)]], first broadcast in December 2011.&lt;ref name="Mayday"/&gt; The episode covers the background of the flight, then investigates what caused the fatal crash.

===Other===
The [[University of Salford]] honoured Munich victim Eddie Colman by naming one of its halls of residence after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eddie Colman and John Lester Courts |url=http://www.accommodation.salford.ac.uk/page/eddie_colman_john_lester |publisher=University of Salford |accessdate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colman was born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] in 1936. There is also a network of small roads in [[Newton Heath]] named after the players who lost their lives in Munich, including Roger Byrne Close, David Pegg Walk, Geoff Bent Walk, Eddie Colman Close, Billy Whelan Walk, Tommy Taylor Close and Mark Jones Walk. Among those roads is an old people's home named after Duncan Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Conn |title=FC United homage to history as they prepare for future at Newton Heath |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/apr/21/fc-united-supporter-owned-clubs |work=The Guardian |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards was also honoured with street names in his home town of [[Dudley]]; there is a small close off Stourbridge Road named Duncan Edwards Close,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duncan Edwards- 50 years on |url=http://www.dudleynews.co.uk/news/2005880.0/ |work=Dudley News  |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, the Dudley Southern Bypass was renamed Duncan Edwards Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duncan Edwards Way given go-ahead |url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/welcome/news-in-dudley/2008-news-archive/october-2008/duncan-edwards-way-given-go-ahead |publisher=dudley.gov.uk |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110230627/http://www.dudley.gov.uk/welcome/news-in-dudley/2008-news-archive/october-2008/duncan-edwards-way-given-go-ahead |archivedate=10 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bradley |title=New road signs have been installed to honour Dudley-born football hero Duncan Edwards |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2008/12/29/new-road-signs-have-been-installed-to-honour-dudley-born-football-hero-duncan-edwards-97319-22563891/ |work=Birmingham Mail |publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The road bridge over the [[Luas]] tram line at Fassaugh Road, [[Cabra, Dublin]] 7 is named after [[Liam Whelan]].

'''Mária Telkes''' (December 12, 1900 – December 2, 1995) was a Hungarian-American scientist and inventor who worked on [[solar energy]] technologies.&lt;ref name=NIHoF&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Telkes|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=468|website=National Inventors Hall of Fame|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], Telkes moved from Hungary to the United States after completing her Ph.D. in [[physical chemistry]].

==Career==

Telkes worked as a biophysicist in the United States; and, from 1939 to 1953, she was involved in solar energy research at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Telkes is known for creating the first thermoelectric power generator in 1947, designing the first solar heating system for the Dover Sun House in [[Dover, Massachusetts]] with architect [[Eleanor Raymond]],&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"&gt;{{cite book| last =Denzer| first =Anthony| authorlink =| title =The Solar House: Pioneering Sustainable Design| publisher =Rizzoli| series =| volume =| edition =| year =2013| location =| pages =| language =| url =http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| doi =| id =| isbn =978-0847840052| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130726200811/http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| archivedate =2013-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, Anne. Solar Power. Gareth Stevens, Inc. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and the first thermoelectric refrigerator in 1953 using the principles of semiconductor thermoelectricity.

She was a prolific inventor of practical thermal devices, including a miniature desalination unit ([[solar still]]) for use on lifeboats, which used solar power and condensation to collect potable water. The still saved the lives of airmen and sailors who would have been without water when abandoned at sea.&lt;ref name=NIHoF/&gt;

One of her specialties were phase-change materials, including molten salts to store thermal energy. One of her materials of choice was [[Glauber's salt]].

Telkes is considered one of the founders of solar thermal storage systems, earning her the nickname "the Sun Queen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Scientists |author=Elizabeth H. Oakes |title=Maria Telkes |page=714 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4381-1882-6 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uPRB-OED1bcC |page=714}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to Texas in the 1970s and consulted with a variety of start-up solar companies, including Northrup Solar, which subsequently became ARCO Solar, and eventually BP Solar.

There are a number of schools named after her, "Maria Telkes" in South Carolina, "Telkes Middle School" in San Francisco, and "Telkes Maria High School" in Ohio.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

== Awards ==
* 1952 – Society of Women Engineers Award
* 1977 – American Solar Energy Society, Charles Greeley Abbot Award
* 2012 – Induction into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]]

'''Noflan''' is a [[flame retardant]] chemical. It was developed in the 1980s by the [[Moscow State Textile University]] and the [[Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics]] in [[Moscow]], with the aim of fire-proofing the fabric used in Soviet spacecraft. In the 1990s the technology was commercialised and licensed to [[Firestop Chemicals]].

==Composition==

As [[halogen]]s and [[antimony]] containing flame retardant result in unwanted degradation, alternatives have been under research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20104">{{Hatnote|For the Shia Islamic belief, see [[the Occultation]]. For the social phenomenon, see [[social occultation]].}}[[File:Occultation.jpg|thumb|200px|In this July 1997 still frame captured from video, the bright star [[Aldebaran]] has just reappeared on the dark limb of the waning [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] in this predawn occultation.]]

An '''occultation''' is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer. The term is often used in [[astronomy]], but can also refer to any situation in which an object in the foreground blocks from view (occults) an object in the background. In this general sense, occultation applies to the visual scene observed from low-flying aircraft (or [[computer-generated imagery]]) when foreground objects obscure distant objects dynamically, as the scene changes over time.

== Occultations by the Moon ==
[[File:Occultation.ogv|thumb|Occultation of a star by the Moon]]

The term occultation is most frequently used to describe those relatively frequent occasions when the [[Moon]] passes in front of a [[star]] during the course of its orbital motion around the Earth. Since the Moon, with an [[angular speed]] with respect to the stars of 0.55 [[Minute of arc#Symbols, abbreviations and subdivisions|arcsec]]/s or 2.7 µrad/s, has a very thin atmosphere and stars have an [[Angular diameter#Use in astronomy|angular diameter]] of at most 0.057 [[arcsecond]]s or 0.28 µrad, a star that is occulted by the Moon will disappear or reappear in 0.1 seconds or less on the Moon's edge, or limb. Events that take place on the Moon's dark limb are of particular interest to observers, because the lack of glare allows these occultations to more easily be observed and timed.

The Moon's orbit is inclined to the [[ecliptic]] (see [[orbit of the Moon]]), and any stars with an ecliptic latitude of less than about 6.5 degrees may be occulted by it. There are three first magnitude stars that are sufficiently close to the ecliptic that they may be occulted by the Moon and by planets – [[Regulus]], [[Spica]] and [[Antares]].&lt;ref name="planets"&gt;{{cite web |title=Occultations of bright stars by planets between 0 and 4000 |url=http://www.pierpaoloricci.it/dati/occpiastelle_eng.htm |accessdate=2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occultations of [[Aldebaran]] are presently only possible by the Moon, because the planets pass Aldebaran to the north. Neither planetary nor lunar occultations of [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] are currently possible. However, in the far future, occultations of Pollux will be possible, as they were in the far past. Some [[deep-sky object]]s, such as the [[Pleiades]], can also be occulted by the Moon.

[[File:OccultJupiter 6-7-2005 6-07PM Nelson NZ.jpg|thumb|200px|Jupiter (the bright object in the upper right) a few minutes before being occulted by the Moon on 16 June 2005]]

Within a few kilometres of the edge of an occultation's predicted path, referred to as its northern or southern limit, an observer may see the star intermittently disappearing and reappearing as the irregular limb of the Moon moves past the star, creating what is known as a [[grazing lunar occultation]]. From an observational and scientific standpoint, these "grazes" are the most dynamic and interesting of lunar occultations.

The accurate timing of lunar occultations is performed regularly by (primarily amateur) astronomers. Lunar occultations timed to an accuracy of a few tenths of a second have various scientific uses, particularly in refining our knowledge of lunar topography. Photoelectric analysis of lunar occultations have also discovered some stars to be very close visual or spectroscopic [[binary star|binaries]]. Some angular diameters of stars have been measured by timing of lunar occultations, which is useful for determining [[effective temperature]]s of those stars. Early radio astronomers found occultations of radio sources by the Moon valuable for determining their exact positions, because the long wavelength of radio waves limited the resolution available through direct observation. This was crucial for the unambiguous identification of the radio source [[3C 273]] with the optical quasar and its jet,&lt;ref name="HazardMackeyShimmins63" /&gt; and a [[fundamental astronomy|fundamental]] prerequisite for [[Maarten Schmidt]]'s discovery of the cosmological nature of [[quasars]].

Several times during the year, someone on Earth can usually observe the Moon occulting a planet.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm this site] for information.&lt;/ref&gt; Since planets, unlike stars, have significant angular sizes, lunar occultations of planets will create a narrow zone on Earth from which a partial occultation of the planet will occur. An observer located within that narrow zone could observe the planet's disk partly blocked by the slowly moving moon. The same mechanic can be seen with the Sun, where observers on Earth will view it as a [[solar eclipse]]. Therefore, a total solar eclipse is effectively the same event as the Moon occulting the Sun.

== Occultation by planets ==

{{main|Planetary transits and occultations}}

Stars may also be occulted by planets. Occultations of bright stars are rare. In 1959, [[Venus]] occulted [[Regulus]], and the next occultation of a bright star (also Regulus by Venus) will be in 2044.&lt;ref name="planets"/&gt; [[Uranus]]'s rings were first discovered when that planet occulted a star in 1977. On 3 July 1989, [[Saturn]] passed in front of the 5th magnitude star [[Sagittarius (constellation)|28 Sagittarii]]. [[Pluto]] occulted stars in 1988, 2002, and 2006, allowing its tenuous atmosphere to be studied via [[atmospheric limb sounding]].

=== Mutual planetary occultations ===

In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears larger than the more distant one, the event is called a mutual planetary occultation.

=={{anchor|Occultations by asteroids}} Occultations by minor planets ==

An [[#top|occultation]] occurs when a [[minor planet]] (an [[asteroid]], [[Distant minor planet|distant object]], or [[dwarf planet]]) passes in front of a [[star]] (occults a star), temporarily blocking its light (as seen from [[Earth]]).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; These occultations are useful for measuring the size and position of minor planets much more precisely than can be done by any other means. A cross-sectional profile of the shape of an asteroid can even be determined if a number of observers at different, nearby, locations observe the occultation. Occultations have also been used to estimate the diameter of [[trans-Neptunian object]]s such as {{mpl-|55636|2002 TX|300}}, [[28978 Ixion|Ixion]], and [[20000 Varuna|Varuna]].

In addition, mutual occultation/eclipsing events can occur between a minor planet and its [[Minor-planet moon|satellite]]. A [[Minor-planet moon#List of minor planets with moons|large number of these minor-planet moons]] have been discovered analyzing the photometric [[light curve]]s of rotating  minor planets and detecting a second, superimposed brightness variation, from which an [[orbital period]] for the satellite (secondary), and a secondary-to-primary diameter-ratio (for the [[Binary asteroid|binary system]]) can often be derived.

==== Asteroids ====
* On 12 March 2009 there were 8 asteroid occulations, including [[85 Io]], [[247 Eukrate]], [[1585 Union]], [[201 Penelope]], [[70 Panopaea]], [[980 Anacostia]], [[2448 Sholokhov]], [[1746 Brouwer]], and [[191 Kolga]]. Any one of these would be expected to occult at a time and place on the globe, at a certain magnitude, and with a certain star.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;
* According to the 1998 European Asteroidal Occultation Results from Euraster, [[39 Laetitia]] was observed by over 38 observatories in one occultation on 3 March 1998, which resulted in many chords being determined.&lt;ref name=euraster /&gt; The star [[Regulus]] was occulted by the asteroid [[163 Erigone]] in the early morning of 20 March 2014.&lt;ref name=IOTA2006 /&gt; This was the brightest occultation of an asteroid ever predicted to occur over a populated area. As the [[main belt asteroid]] passed in front of the star its 67-mile-wide (100&amp;nbsp;km) shadow swept across [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and Suffolk counties, all of New York City and the [[Hudson River Valley]], with the center of the shadow path following a line roughly connecting New York City, White Plains, Newburgh, Oneonta, Rome and Pulaski before crossing into Canada near Belleville and [[North Bay, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=IOTA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Solex/&gt; Bad weather obscured the occultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occultations.org/regulus2014/ |title=Volunteer observers invited to time the March 20, 2014 Occultation of Regulus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The occultation of dwarf planet Makemake on 23 April 2011.ogv|thumb|This animation shows the path of the shadow of the dwarf planet [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] during an occultation of a faint star in April 2011. Note: the actual shape of the shadow on Earth will not be exactly round as shown here. This video is to illustrate the phenomenon.]]

==== Distant objects ====
* Preliminary results of a 6 November 2010 occultation by the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] of a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 17 [http://www.wikisky.org/?ra=1.6527583999999989&amp;de=-4.353371999999999&amp;zoom=10&amp;show_grid=1&amp;show_constellation_lines=1&amp;show_constellation_boundaries=1&amp;show_const_names=0&amp;show_galaxies=1&amp;show_box=1&amp;box_ra=1.6527584&amp;box_de=-4.353372&amp;box_width=50&amp;box_height=50&amp;img_source=DSS2 star] in the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]] placed an upper limit on Eris's diameter of 2320&amp;nbsp;km, making it almost the same size as Pluto.&lt;ref name=occult /&gt; Due to their slower movement through the night sky, occultations by TNOs are far less common than by asteroids in the main-belt.
* The dwarf planet [[Haumea]] was observed in a stellar transit on 21 January 2017, identifying a ring.
* On 3 June 2017, a star was occulted by the Kuiper belt object {{mpl|2014 MU|69}}, the first such occultation detected.&lt;ref name="First KBO Occultation" /&gt; The multi-faceted campaign involved cooperation from the Argentinian government (including local governments – a major highway was closed for two hours, and street lights were turned off, in order to preclude light pollution), three spacecraft, 24 portable ground-based telescopes, and NASA's SOFIA airborne observatory in "the most challenging stellar occultation in the history of astronomy," in an effort spanning six months. &lt;ref name="NASA's New Horizons Team Strikes Gold in Argentina"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20170719 |title=NASA's New Horizons Team Strikes Gold in Argentina |date=2017-07-19 |website=New Horizons: NASA's Mission to Pluto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double occultations ==

The Moon or another celestial body can occult multiple celestial bodies at the same time. Because of its relatively large [[angular diameter]], the Moon at any given time occults an indeterminate number of stars. However, an event when the Moon occults two bright objects (e.g. two planets or a bright star and a planet) simultaneously is extremely rare and can be seen only from a small part of the world. The last event of such type was on 23 April 1998 when the Moon occulted Venus and Jupiter for observers on [[Ascension Island]].

== Artificial occultations ==

The ''Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS)'' was a proposed [[satellite]] that would work in conjunction with a [[telescope]] to detect [[planet]]s around distant stars. The satellite consists of a large, very lightweight sheet, and a set of maneuvering thrusters and navigation systems. It would maneuver to a position along the line of sight between the telescope and a nearby star. The satellite would thereby block the radiation from the star, permitting the orbiting planets to be observed.&lt;ref name="Copi-2000" /&gt;

The proposed satellite would have a dimension of {{convert|70|x|70|m|ft}}, a mass of about 600&amp;nbsp;kg, and maneuver by means of an [[ion drive]] engine in combination with using the sheet as a light sail. Positioned at a distance of 100,000&amp;nbsp;km from the telescope, it would block more than 99.998% of the starlight.

There are two possible configurations of this satellite. The first would work with a [[space telescope]], most likely positioned near the [[Earth]]'s {{L2}} [[Lagrangian point]]. The second would place the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit about the Earth, and work in conjunction with a ground telescope. At the [[apogee]] of the orbit, the satellite would remain relatively stationary with respect to the ground, allowing longer exposure times.

An updated version of this design is called the [[Starshade]], which uses a [[sunflower]]-shaped [[coronagraph]] disc. A comparable proposal was also made for a satellite to occult bright X-ray sources, called an ''X-ray Occulting Steerable Satellite'' or XOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hea.cwru.edu/xoss/ |title=The X-ray Occulting Steerable Satellite (XOSS) |publisher=CASE |accessdate=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organic molecular tracers''', also referred to as organic molecular markers, are compounds or compound classes of interest in the field of [[air quality]] because they can help identify [[particulate]] emission sources, as they are relatively unique to those sources.  This approach is generally applied to particulate matter under 2.5μm in diameter because of the formation mechanisms and the health risks associated with this size regime.&lt;ref name="pope"&gt;

Use of organic tracers has become more common as measurement quality has improved, costs have decreased, and compounds that were historically good tracers, such as [[lead]], have decreased in ambient concentrations due to various factors including government regulation.

==Requirements==
In order to be used as a tracer, a compound must be emitted preferentially by some sources and not by others, giving the emission source a relatively unique chemical makeup.  The compound must react slowly enough in the atmosphere that it is chemically conserved from the emission source to the receptor site where an ambient sample may be taken.  Additionally, a tracer species should not be formed in the atmosphere and it should not volatilize during transport so that mass balance is maintained.&lt;ref name="cass"&gt;

==Examples==
Samples have been analyzed from many known biogenic and anthropogenic emissions sources such as [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[gasoline]] vehicles, [[cigarette]] smoke, road dust, vegetative detritus, wood smoke, and meat cooking.  Examples of some results of preferential emissions from sources include hopanes, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] and [[sterane]]s

==Analytic use==
Chemical analysis of ambient and source samples is performed using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]], and the chemical profile of the emission sources can be compared to an ambient sample using chemical mass balance techniques to identify the ambient mass contribution from each pollution source. This approach assumes that an ambient air sample has particulate matter contributions from a linear combination of emission sources.
If the chemical compositions of local sources are not available, source apportionment models such as [[positive matrix factorization]] and [[principal components analysis]] can be used by employing statistical methods to identify emissions sources from time series of ambient samples.

[[File:Cerro Grande de la Compañia 193.jpg|thumbnail]]
'''Pukara de La Compañia''' is an archaeological site containing the remains of a [[promaucae]] fortress, later used by the [[Incas]], located on the large hill overlooking the village of La Compañia, a  village in the commune of [[Graneros]], Chile. It is the southernmost building which remains of the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornejo|first=Luis|title=los inka y sus aliados diaguitas en el extremo austral del tawantinsuyu|pages=88-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such it is an important landmark on what is known as "[[The Chilean Inca Trail]]", and has been declared a [[National Monuments of Chile|National Monument]] by the Chilean government.

== History==
[[File:TawantinSuyu QullaSuyu.png|right|thumb|[[Qullasuyu]], [[Inca]] [[Suyu (Inca Empire)|suyu]] where the pukara was located.]] 
There are three main historical periods during which the site was occupied:
*Between the years 1380 and 1450 A.D., the hill was apparently occupied by local [[promaucaes]] or [[picunche]]s during their resistance to the [[Inca]] invasion.
*Most of the structures and remains of the hill date to the  Inca occupation, namely between the years 1430 and 1450 A.D, approximately.
*Once again the  local indigenous population occupied the fortress during their resistance to the Spanish [[conquest of Chile|conquest]]. The evidence of this event is its documentation in Spanish  [[chronicle]]s which later guided [[archeologist]]s there, allowing them to rediscover the Pukara only a few decades ago.

== Architecture ==
=== Description ===
The remains of the pukara consist of the bases of 7 circular structures, a major construction and other nearby buildings that may have been observation posts. In addition, the flat summit of the hill is surrounded by defensive perimeter walls.

=== Current situation ===
Pukara La Compañia was declared a [[Chile National Monument]] by Decree No. 1191, dated 11 March 1992. Nonetheless, the site lacks suitable access for tourists, and is neither maintained nor adequately protected by the authorities. This lack of respect for the archaeological heritage of the pukara is the evident in the installation of a large [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] of [[cellular telephony]] on the summit of the hill. The installation of this antenna, carried out in 1997, consisted of building an access road and movement of earth, which destroyed {{convert|4|m|ft|0}} of one of the defensive walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stehberg|first=Ruben|title=LOGROS Y FRACASOS EN LA ETAPA DE RECUPERACIÓN DE UN PATRIMONIO ARQUEOLÓGICO E HISTÓRICO VULNERADO: EL CASO DE LA FORTALEZA CERRO GRANDE DE LA COMPAÑÍA|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0717-73562004000400050&amp;script=sci_arttext|publisher=Chungara (Sep 2004)|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">A '''Quality Protocol''' is a national end of waste criteria developed by the Waste Protocols Project, a joint initiative between the [[Environment Agency]] and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). It is funded by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra), the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] (WAG) and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]] (NIEA) as a [[business resource efficiency activity]] (BREW). 

== Description ==
A Quality Protocol sets out criteria for the production of a product from a specific waste type. Compliance with these criteria is considered sufficient to ensure that the fully recovered product may be used without harm to human health or the environment and therefore without the need for waste management controls. In addition, the Quality Protocol indicates how compliance may be demonstrated and points to best practice for the use of the fully recovered product. The Quality Protocol further aims to provide increased market confidence in the quality of products made from waste and so encourage greater recovery and recycling.

The purpose of the Quality Protocol is to provide a uniform control process for producers, from which they can reasonably state and demonstrate that their product has been fully recovered and is no longer a waste. It also provides purchasers with a quality-managed product to common aggregate standards, which increases confidence in performance. Also, the framework created by the Protocol provides a clear audit trail for those responsible for ensuring compliance with Waste Management Legislation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggregain.org.uk/quality/quality_protocols/index.html The Quality Protocol], www.aggregain.org.uk, retrieved 16.04.07&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on producing protocols for eight other waste streams should be issued for public consultation in Summer 2007. This includes waste vegetable oil, flat glass, non-packaging plastics, tyres, contaminated soils, pulverised fuel ash and blast furnace slag. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsrecycle.com/legislation/news.jsp?story=6720 Plans for recycled wood quality protocol abandoned], [[www.letsrecycle.com]], retrieved 16.04.07&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Railroad Commission of [[Texas]]''' ('''RRC'''; also sometimes called the ''Texas Railroad Commission'', ''TRC'') is the state agency that regulates the [[oil industry|oil and gas industry]], gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) industry, and surface coal and uranium mining. Despite its name, it ceased regulating railroads in 2005.&lt;ref name="rrc-about-name"&gt;{{citation |year=2010 |title=Who regulates railroads in Texas? ''...Don't let our name throw you off track.'' |publisher=RRC, Railroad Commission of Texas |url=http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/railroads/ |accessdate=2015-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established by the [[Texas Legislature]] in 1891, it is the state's oldest regulatory agency and began as part of the [[Efficiency Movement]] of the [[Progressive Era]]. From the 1930s to the 1960s it largely set world oil prices, but was displaced by OPEC ([[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]]) after 1973.  In 1984, the federal government took over transportation regulation for railroads, trucking and buses, but the Railroad Commission kept its name. With an annual budget of $79&amp;nbsp;million, it now focuses entirely on oil, gas, mining, [[propane]], and pipelines, setting allocations for production each month.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Prindle, "Railroad Commission," [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mdr01 ''Handbook of Texas Online'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rrc-about-history"&gt;{{citation |year=1991 |title=Railroad Commission: An Informal History Compiled for Its Centennial (April 1991) |publisher=RRC, Railroad Commission of Texas |url=http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/history/history-1866-1939/ |accessdate=2015-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-member commission was initially appointed by the governor, but an amendment to the state's constitution in 1894 established the commissioners as elected officials who serve overlapping six-year terms, like the sequence in the [[U.S. Senate]].  No specific seat is designated as chairman; the commissioners choose the chairman from among themselves. Normally the commissioner who faces reelection is the chairman for the preceding two years. The current commissioners are [[Christi Craddick]] since December 17, 2012, [[Ryan Sitton]] since January 5, 2015, and [[Wayne Christian]] since January 9, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Railroad Commissioners Past through Present|url=http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/commissioners/commissioner-list/|website=Texas Railroad Commission|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commissioners|url=http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/commissioners/|website=Texas Railroad Commission|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Attempts to establish a railroad commission in Texas began in 1876. After five legislative failures, an amendment to the state constitution providing for a railroad commission was submitted to voters in 1890. The amendment's ratification and the 1890 election of Governor [[James S. Hogg]], a liberal Democrat, permitted the legislature in 1894 to create the '''Railroad Commission,''' giving it jurisdiction over operations of railroads, terminals, wharves, and express companies. It could set rates, issue rules on how to classify freight, require adequate railroad reports, and prohibit and punish discrimination and extortion by corporations. George Clark, running as an independent "[[Bourbon Democrats|Jeffersonian Democratic]]"  candidate for governor in 1892, denounced the TRE as, "Wrong in principle, undemocratic, and unrepublican Commissions do no good. They do harm. Their only function is to harass. I regard it as essentially foolish and essentially vicious."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/railroad/early/page2.html for quote]&lt;/ref&gt;  Clark lost the 1892 election to Hogg but a federal judge ruled the TRC illegal; the judge in turn was overruled by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The governor appointed the first members; the first elections to the commission were held in 1893, with three commissioners serving six-year, overlapping terms. The TRC did not have jurisdiction over interstate rates, but Texas was so large that the in-state traffic it regulated was of dominant importance.

[[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] (1818–1903), the first head of the TRC (1891–1903), had been the most outspoken advocate in Congress of bills to regulate railroads in the 1880s. He feared the corruption caused by railroad monopolies and considered their control a moral challenge. As chairman of the TRC, he changed his views when he became acquainted with the realities of the complex forces affecting railroad management.  Reagan turned to the [[Efficiency Movement]] for ideas, establishing a pattern of regulatory practice that TRC used for decades. He believed that the agency should pursue two main goals: to protect consumers from unfair railway practices and excessive rates, and to support the state's overall economic growth. To find the optimal rates that met these goals he focused the TRC on the collection of data, direct negotiation with railway executives, and compromises with the parties involved. The agency did not have the legal authority to set rates, nor did it have the resources to spend much of its time in court battles. The carrot was far more important than the stick.  Freight rates continued to decline dramatically. In 1891, a typical rate was 1.403 cents per ton mile. By 1907 the rate was 1.039 cents – a decline of 25%. However the railroads did not have rates high enough for them to upgrade their equipment and lower costs in the face of competition from pipelines, cars and trucks, and the Texas railway system began a slow decline.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Nash, "The Reformer Reformed: John H. Reagan and Railroad Regulation." ''Business History Review'' 1955 29(2): 189–196. {{ISSN|0007-6805}}  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3111386 in Jstor]; Ben H. Procter, "Reagan,  John Henninger," [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fre02 ''Handbook of Texas Online'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Segregation===
From the 1890s through the 1960s, the Texas Railroad Commission found it difficult to enforce fully [[Jim Crow segregation legislation]]. Because of the expense involved, Texas railroads often allowed wealthier blacks to mix with whites, rather than provide separate cars, dining facilities, and even depots. In addition, West Texas authorities often refused to enforce Jim Crow laws because few [[African Americans]] resided there. In the 1940s, the railroad commission's enforcement of segregation laws began collapsing further, in part because of the great number of African American soldiers that were transported during World War II.  The trains were integrated in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Osborn, "Curtains for Jim Crow: Law, Race, and the Texas Railroads," ''[[Southwestern Historical Quarterly]]'' 2002 105(3): 392–427. {{ISSN|0038-478X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion to oil==
The agency's reach expanded as it took over responsibility for regulating oil pipelines (in 1917), oil and gas production (1919), natural gas delivery systems (1920), bus lines (1927), and trucking (1929). It grew from  12 employees in 1916 to 69 in 1930 and 566 in 1939.  It does not have jurisdiction over investor owned utility companies; that falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Public Utility Commission of Texas]].&lt;ref name="Childs, 1990"&gt;Childs,  (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Who has jurisdiction over natural gas rates (Texas Natural Gas Rates Frequently Asked Questions) |publisher= RRC, Railroad Commission of Texas |url=http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about/faqs/gasratesfaqs.php |accessdate=2013-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crisis for the [[petroleum industry]] was created by the [[East Texas oil field|East Texas oil boom of the 1930s]], as prices plunged to 25&amp;nbsp;cents a barrel. The traditional TRC policy of negotiating compromises failed; the governor was forced to call in the state militia to enforce order. Texas oilmen decided they preferred state to federal regulation, and wanted the TRC to give out quotas so that every producer would get higher prices and profits. Pure Oil Company opposed the first statewide oil prorationing order, which was issued by the TRC in August 1930. The order, which was intended to conserve oil resources by limiting the number of barrels drilled per day, was seen by small producers like Pure as a conspiracy between government and major companies to drive them out of business and foster monopoly in the oil industry.&lt;ref name="Childs, 1990"/&gt;

[[Ernest O. Thompson]] (1892–1966), head of the TRC from 1932 to 1965, took charge of the agency and indeed the oil industry by appealing to an ideal of Texas' role in the global oil order—the civil religion of Texas oil. He cajoled, harangued, and browbeat recalcitrant producers into compliance with the TRC's prorationing orders. The [[New Deal]] allowed the TRC to set national oil policy.&lt;ref&gt;George N. Green, "Thompson, Ernest Othmer," [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth18 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  As late as the 1950s the TRC controlled over 40% of United States crude production and approximately half of estimated national proved reserves.  It served as a model in the creation of [[OPEC]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon M. Griffin, chief engineer of the TRC during World War II, developed the formula for prorationing to keep production flowing for the military.

Because it needed access to the Texas headquarters of the various oil companies, it became a long term tenant at the [[Milam Building]].&lt;ref name="Saporito"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/print-edition/2014/10/17/milam-building-stands-tall-on-skyline.html |title=Milam Building stands tall on skyline |date=October 17, 2014 |first1=Susan |last1=Saporito |location=San Antonio |newspaper=[[San Antonio Business Journal]] |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Regulation was a practical rather than ideological affair. The TRC typically worked with the regulated industries to improve operations, share best practices, and address consumer complaints. Radical activities like rate setting to favor shippers or producers or consumers, and heated court battles, were the exception rather than the rule.

Within the oil and gas industry, it took into account production in other states, in effect bringing total available supply, (including imports, which were small) within the principle of prorationing to market demand.  Allowable oilfield production was calculated as follows:  estimated market demand, minus uncontrolled additions to supply, gave the Texas total; this was then prorated among fields and wells in a manner calculated to preserve equity among producers, and to prevent any well from producing beyond its [[Maximum Efficient Rate]] (MER). Scheduled allowables are expressed in numbers of calendar days of permitted production per month at MER.&lt;ref&gt;The "Maximum Efficient Rate" is an engineering determination of the theoretical optimum rate of flow of crude oil from each well in a pool that will not endanger ultimate recovery from the pool by a too rapid release of underground pressures. MER depends on the character of the oil-bearing structure and the nature of the natural drive – whether water pressure, a gas cap, or gas in solution in the crude oil. Engineers look at indices like the pressure at the bottom of the well ("bottom-hole pressure") or the ratio of gas to oil in the crude produced.

The Water Recycling Rules are intended to encourage Texas hydraulic fracturing operators to conserve water used in the hydraulic fracturing process for oil and gas wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beveridge &amp; Diamond PC|title=New Hydraulic Fracturing Water Recycling Rules Published in Texas Register|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-hydraulic-fracturing-water-recycling-rules-published-texas-register|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
As of January 2017, the commission members are [[Christi Craddick]] (Chairman), [[Ryan Sitton]], and [[Wayne Christian]]. All three members are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Craddick was elected for a six-year seat in the 2012 general election.  Sitton was elected for a six-year term in the 2014 general election.  Christian was elected for a six-year term in the 2016 general election.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/commissioners/ Texas RRC – Commissioners]" Railroad Commission of Texas.  January 3, 2017.  Retrieved on June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective October 1, 2005, as a result of House Bill 2702 the rail oversight functions of the Railroad Commission were transferred to the [[Texas Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rrc.texas.gov/divisions/rail_moved/index.html?%2Frail.html RRC: Former Rail Division]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}." Railroad Commission of Texas. June 2, 2008. Retrieved on September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional name of the Commission was not changed despite the loss of its titular regulatory duties.&lt;ref name="rrc-about-name" /&gt;

==Court cases involving the Commission==
The [[Shreveport Rate Case]], also known as ''[[Houston E. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. United States]]'', 234 U.S. 342 (1914) arose from the Railroad Commission's setting railroad freight rates unequally. Because of the low intrastate rates, shippers in eastern Texas tended to ship their wares to [[Dallas]] (in Texas), rather than to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], although Shreveport was considerably closer to much of [[eastern Texas]].  The Railroad Commission's (and the railroad's) position was that only the state could regulate commerce within a state, and that the federal government had no power so to do.  The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government's ability to regulate [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] necessarily included the ability to regulate intrastate "operations in all matters having a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic" and to ensure that "interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms".

The Railroad Commission has also figured prominently in two major [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court cases]] on the [[Abstention doctrine|doctrine of abstention]]:
* ''[[Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co.]]'', a 1941 case in which the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that it was appropriate for federal courts to abstain from hearing a case to allow state courts to decide substantial constitutional issues that touch upon sensitive areas of state social policy, specifically the race of railroad employees.
* ''[[Burford v. Sun Oil Co.]]'', a 1943 case in which the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction may abstain from hearing the case where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex and unclear area of state law which is of special significance to the state, where there is comprehensive state administrative/regulatory procedure, and where the federal issues cannot be decided without delving into state law.

In [[energy conservation|conservation]] and [[energy economics]], the '''rebound effect''' (or '''take-back effect''') is the reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of [[natural resource|resource]] use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken.

While the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any [[natural resource]] or other input, such as [[Labor (economics)|labor]]. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant.&lt;ref name=Grubb&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Grubb| given=M.J.| title=Energy efficiency and economic fallacies| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=783–785 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if a 5% improvement in vehicle [[fuel efficiency]] results in only a 2% drop in fuel use, there is a 60% rebound effect (since {{frac|(5-2)|5}} = 60%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wang|first = Zhaohua|last2 = Han|first2 = Bai|last3 = Lu|first3 = Milin|date = 2016|title = Measurement of energy rebound effect in households: Evidence from residential electricity consumption in Beijing, China|url = |journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume = 58|pages = 852–861|doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'missing' 3% might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before.

The existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial. However, debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations.&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/3B43125E-EEBD-4AB3-B06EA914C30F7B3E/| title = The rebound effect: An assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency| author = Steven Sorrell | year = 2007 | publisher= UK Energy Research Centre| accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect, there are five different rebound effect (RE) types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Saunders|first = Harry D.|date = 2008|title = Fuel conserving (and using) production functions|url = |journal = Energy Economics|volume = 30|issue = 5|pages = 2184–2235|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2007.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Super conservation (RE &lt; 0): the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings – the rebound effect is negative. This occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs.
#Zero rebound (RE = 0): The actual resource savings are equal to expected savings – the rebound effect is zero.
#Partial rebound (0 &lt; RE &lt; 1): The actual resource savings are less than expected savings – the rebound effect is between 0% and 100%. This is sometimes known as 'take-back', and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets.
#Full rebound (RE = 1): The actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage – the rebound effect is at 100%.
#Backfire (RE &gt; 1): The actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings – the rebound effect is higher than 100%. This situation is commonly known as the [[Jevons paradox]].

In order to avoid the rebound effect, [[environmental economics|environmental economists]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same.&lt;ref name=Wackernagel/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Jevons paradox|Khazzoom-Brookes postulate}}

The rebound effect was first described by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]'', where he observed that the invention in Britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses. This ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell. According to Jevons, "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |at=Chapter VII |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ0.html |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most contemporary authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature. Although Khazzoom did not use the term, he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product.&lt;ref name=Khazzoom&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Khazzoom| given=Daniel J.| title=Economic implications for mandated efficiency in standards for household appliances.| journal= The Energy Journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1980 | pages=21–40 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol1-no4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the [[price elasticity of demand]] for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in [[garden lighting]] after the introduction of energy-saving [[Light Emitting Diode]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C. M.|last2=Kuester|first2=Theres|last3=Sánchez de Miguel|first3=Alejandro|last4=Baugh|first4=Kimberly|last5=Jechow|first5=Andreas|last6=Hölker|first6=Franz|last7=Bennie|first7=Jonathan|last8=Elvidge|first8=Christopher D.|last9=Gaston|first9=Kevin J.|last10=Guanter|first10=Luis|title=Artificially lit surface of Earth at night increasing in radiance and extent|journal=Science Advances|date=22 November 2017|volume=3|issue=11|pages=e1701528|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1701528|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101195115/http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archivedate=2018-01-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the [[Jevons paradox]]).

Khazzoom's thesis was criticized heavily by Michael Grubb&lt;ref name=Grubb/&gt; and [[Amory Lovins]]&lt;ref name=Lovins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovins|first1=Amory B.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: Another View|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol9-no2-10|JSTOR=41970456}} And: {{cite journal|last1=Henly|first1=John|last2=Ruderman|first2=Henry|last3=Levine|first3=Mark D.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: A Follow-up|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|pages=163–170|JSTOR=41970457}}&lt;/ref&gt; who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market, and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption. Developing Khazzoom's idea further, and prompting heated debate in the Energy Policy journal at that time, Len Brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Brookes| given=L.| title=The greenhouse effect: the fallacies in the energy efficient solution| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=199–201 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90145-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use. For improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, the improvement must come at a greater economic cost. Commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates, he concludes that, "the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts, and the validity and cost of solutions."&lt;ref name=Brookes/&gt;

===Khazzoom-Brookes postulate===
In 1992, economist Harry Saunders coined the term "[[Khazzoom-Brookes postulate]]" to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use (the modern day equivalent of the [[Jevons paradox]]). He modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neo-classical growth models, and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions. In the conclusion of his paper, Saunders stated that:&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Saunders| given=Harry| title=The Khazzom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth| journal=Energy Journal |volume=13 | year=1992 | pages=131–148 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol13-no4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the absence of efficiency gains, energy use will grow in lock step with economic growth (energy intensity will stay fixed) when energy prices are fixed. … Energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means: by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs; and by increasing economic growth, which pulls up energy use. … These results, while by no means proving the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate, call for prudent energy analysts and policy makers to pause a long moment before dismissing it.}}

This work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in framing the problem of the rebound effect. It also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect.  The two tightly held positions are:
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement; as such, energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term.
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back. However, even in the long term, energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings.

Even though many studies have been undertaken in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (to alleviate the impacts of [[climate change]]). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase [[oil]] and [[coal]] consumption, and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, over the long run.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|last2=Roy|first2=Robin|date=2007|title=Technological innovation, energy efficient design and the rebound effect|url=|journal=Technovation|volume=27|issue=4|pages=194–203|doi=10.1016/j.technovation.2006.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of effects==
The full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Sorrell|first = Steve|last2 = Dimitropoulos|first2 = John|date = 2008|title = The rebound effect: Microeconomic definitions, limitations and extensions|url = |journal = Ecological Economics|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 636–649|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Direct rebound effect: An increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use. This is caused by the [[substitution effect]].
# Indirect rebound effect: The lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good. This is caused by the [[income effect]].
# Economy wide effect: The fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods, creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth.
In the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates.

===Direct and indirect effects===
[[Image:Efficiencyreboundgraph.png|thumb|right|400px|Direct and Indirect Effects]]

For cost reducing resource efficiency, distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in Figure 1 below.  The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis.  An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing.  This shifts the household budget line rightwards.  The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income.  The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2.  The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect.  The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2.  The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; In the manufacturing sector, it has been estimated that there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.

The rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=RS20981/&gt; Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect.  Evaluation methods rely on quasi-experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity estimates]] to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services.

Research has found that in [[developed countries]], the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% in residential space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name=RS20981&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228115335/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archivedate = 2007-12-28 |last1=Gottron|first1=Frank | title = Energy Efficiency and the Rebound Effect: Does Increasing Efficiency Decrease Demand? | date=2001|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greening|first1=Lorna A. |last2=Greene|first2=David L.|last3=Difiglio|first3=Carmen|title=Energy efficiency and consumption — the rebound effect — a survey|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/ucei/policy/EPE-014 | title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966-2001 | first1 = Kenneth A. |last1=Small | first2=Kurt |last2= Van Dender | date = 21 September 2005 | publisher= University of California Energy Institute: Policy &amp; Economics | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freire-González | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Empirical evidence of direct rebound effect in Catalonia | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 2309–2314 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=Steve|last2=Dimitropoulos|first2=John|last3=Sommerville|first3=Matt|date=2009|title=Empirical estimates of the direct rebound effect: A review|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1356–1371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in [[developing economies]].&lt;ref name=Roy2000&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Roy| given=Joyashree| title=The rebound effect: some empirical evidence from India| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=433–438 |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antal|first1=Miklós|last2=van den Bergh|first2=Jeroen C.J.M.|title=Re-spending rebound: A macro-level assessment for OECD countries and emerging economies|journal=Energy Policy|date=2014|volume=68|pages=585–590|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect effects from conservation ===
[[Image:Conservationreboundgraph.png|thumb|400px| Figure2: change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation]]

For conservation measures, indirect effects closely approximate the total economy-wide effect.  Conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods. Figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good (QT to QT`), and more of all other goods (QO to QO`).  The [[resource consumption]] or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect.

Although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure, this view is gradually being eroded.&lt;ref name=Lovins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schipper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schipper|first1=Lee|last2=Grubb|first2=Michael|title=On the rebound?

===Economy wide effects===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
Even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of [[economic growth]]. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to [[stagflation]] ([[recession]] and [[inflation]]) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.

To model the scale of this effect, economists use computational general equilibrium (CGE) models.  While CGE methodology is by no means perfect, results indicate that economy-wide rebound effects are likely to be very high, with estimates above 100% being rather common.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; One simple CGE model has been made available online for use by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D|title=A Calculator for Energy Consumption Changes Arising from New Technologies|journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1515/1538-0653.1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income level variation===

Research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Paul|last2=Blundell|first2=Richard|last3=Micklewright|first3=John|title=Modelling Household Energy Expenditures Using Micro-Data|journal=The Economic Journal|date=1989|volume=99|issue=397|page=720|doi=10.2307/2233767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Boardman|first2=Brenda|title=Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes.

This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Sung H.|last2=Oreszczyn|first2=Tadj|last3=Ridley|first3=Ian|title=The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the space heating fuel consumption in English dwellings|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=2006|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1171–1181|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos/&gt; In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.

The size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments &lt;ref name=Antal/&gt; and case studies. One case study was undertaken in rural India to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme.&lt;ref name=Roy2000/&gt; Households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine.  The scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting.  The results were surprising, with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80%, and total direct and indirect rebound above 100%.  Because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost, operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day, with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps.  Also, more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages.

===Rebounds with respect to time===

The individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of the rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result in an increase in demand for a service.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binswanger|first1=Mathias|title=Technological progress and sustainable development: what about the rebound effect?|journal=Ecological Economics|date=2001|volume=36|issue=1|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jalas&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Jalas| given=Mikko| title=A time use perspective on the materials intensity of consumption | journal=Ecological Economics|volume=41 | year=2002 | pages=101–123 | doi =10.1016/s0921-8009(02)00018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger/&gt; While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect.  Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates.  For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.

==Suggested solutions==
In order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use, the [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=Wackernagel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = Mathis | last2 = Rees | first2 = William  | year = 1997 | title = Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: economics from an ecological footprint perspective | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 3–24 | doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved through, for example, the imposition of a [[ecotax|green tax]], a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] program, higher [[fuel tax]]es or the proposed "restore" approach where part of the savings is directed back to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency, especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected, such as street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|page=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">'''Resource intensity''' is a measure of the [[resource]]s (e.g. [[water]], [[energy]], [[Raw material|material]]s) needed for the production, processing and disposal of a unit of [[good (economics)|good]] or [[service (economics)|service]], or for the completion of a process or activity; it is therefore a measure of the [[resource efficiency|efficiency of resource use]]. It is often expressed as the [[quantity]] of resource embodied in unit cost e.g. litres of water per $1 spent on product. In national economic and [[sustainability accounting]] it can be calculated as units of resource expended per unit of [[GDP]]. When applied to a single person it is expressed as the resource use of that person per unit of consumption. Relatively high resource intensities indicate a high price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP; low resource intensity indicates a lower price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentzen, J.  (ed) 2008. ''Resource intensity, knowledge and development: insights from Africa and South America.'' HSRC Press, South Africa. {{ISBN|978-07969-2213-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resource productivity]] and resource intensity are  key concepts used in [[sustainability measurement]] as they measure attempts to decouple the connection between resource use and [[environmental degradation]]. Their strength is that they can be used as a metric for both economic and environmental cost. Although these concepts are two sides of the same coin, in practice they involve very different approaches and can be viewed as reflecting, on the one hand, the efficiency of resource production as outcome per unit of resource use (resource productivity) and, on the other hand, the efficiency of [[resource consumption]] as resource use per unit outcome (resource intensity). The sustainability objective is to maximize resource productivity while minimizing resource intensity.

'''Semiheavy water''' is the result of replacing one of the [[hydrogen atom|protium]] in [[Properties of water|light water]] to [[deuterium]]. It exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen atom|protium]], &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) and deuterium (D or &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, in [[dynamic equilibrium]].
In regular water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is D). By comparison, [[heavy water]] D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O occurs at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e., one in 6,400&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This makes semiheavy water far more common than "normal" heavy water.

The freezing point of semiheavy water is close to the freezing point of heavy water. (3.8°C)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10762">{{Short description|Hot desert wind in Western Asia and other regions}}
{{about|the desert wind|other uses|Simoom (disambiguation)|and|Simoun (disambiguation)}}

'''Simoom''' ({{lang-ar|سموم}} ''samūm''; from the root {{lang|ar|س م م}} ''s-m-m'', {{lang|ar|سم}} "to poison") is a strong, dry, dust-laden wind. The word is generally used to describe a [[list of local winds|local wind]] that blows in the [[Sahara]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and the deserts of [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Its temperature may exceed {{convert|54|C}} and the humidity may fall below 10%. Alternative spellings include '''samoon''', '''samun''', '''simoun''', and '''simoon'''. Another name used for this wind is '''samiel''' ([[Persian language|Persian]] ''samyeli'').  Simoom winds have an alternative type occurring in the region of [[Central Asia]] known as "Garmsil" (гармсель).

The name means "poison wind" and is given because the sudden onset of simoom may also cause [[heat stroke]]. This is attributed to the fact that the hot wind brings more heat to the body than can be disposed of by the [[evaporation]] of [[Hyperthermia|perspiration]].

''[[The Nuttall Encyclopædia]]'' described the simoom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The storm moves in [[cyclone]] (circular) form, carrying clouds of dust and sand, and produces on humans and animals a suffocating effect.&lt;ref&gt;: [[James Wood (encyclopaedist)|Wood, James]], ed. (1907). "Simoom". ''[[The Nuttall Encyclopædia]]''. London and New York: Frederick Warne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 19th-century account of simoom in [[Egypt]] reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Egypt is also subject, particularly during the spring and summer, to the hot wind called the "samoom," which is still more oppressive than the [[khamsin|khamasin]] winds, but of much shorter duration, seldom lasting longer than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. It generally proceeds from the south-east or south-south-east, and carries with it clouds of dust and sand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward William Lane|Lane, Edward William]] (1973 [1860]). ''An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians''. With a new introduction by John Manchip White. New York: Dover Publications. P. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In North America ==
It has been alleged that a "simoom" occurred on June 17, 1859 in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] and [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Local historian Walker Tompkins wrote that 
during the morning, the temperature hovered around the normal {{convert|24|to|27|C}}, but around 1 PM, strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]] to the north. By 2 PM, the temperature supposedly reached {{convert|56|C}}. This temperature was said to have been recorded by an official U.S. coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore, in the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. At 5 PM, the temperature had reportedly dropped to {{convert|50|C}}, and by 7 PM, the temperature was back to a normal {{convert|25|C}}. Tompkins provided a supposed quote from a U.S. government report saying, "Calves, rabbits and cattle died on their feet. Fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side; all vegetable gardens were ruined. A fisherman in a rowboat made it to the [[Goleta Beach|Goleta Sandspit]] with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace."&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, Walker A. (1966). ''Goleta: The Good Land''. Goleta Am-Vets Post No. 55, 1966; Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 66-23873. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also according to Tompkins, local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick [[adobe]] walled houses that were the standard construction at the time.

However, experts contest this account. UCSB Professor Joel Michaelsen, for instance, said: “I have never found any outside source to validate Tompkins' story, and I am highly skeptical of its veracity. I don't doubt that strong hot, dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures - but in the 110 F - 115 F range at most. The 133 F just isn't physically reasonable, as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast. Last Monday's weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave, and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below Tompkins' figure. Stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit, but not nearly that much. Add to all that meteorologically-based skepticism Tompkins' well-known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his 'histories,' and I think you have a strong case for discounting this one.”&lt;ref&gt;Bill Norrington, [http://geog.ucsb.edu/events/department-news-word/771/goleta-s-great-simoon-of-1859/ GOLETA'S "GREAT SIMOON" OF 1859], UCSB Department of Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteorologist Christopher C. Burt wrote about the alleged incident: "There is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in Santa Barbara. Some later sources say it was made on a U.S. coastal geo-survey vessel. If that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off Santa Barbara in June are never warmer than about 70°F and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air. This report is singular and there is physical evidence (burnt crops and dead animals) that something amazing happened here this day, but the temperature record is impossible to validate."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher C. Burt, [https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/hottest-reliably-measured-air-temperatures-on-earth.html The hottest reliably measured air temperatures on Earth]. ''Weather Underground''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Figurative use of the word or phenomenon ==

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]" (1833) features a storm off the coast of Java, wherein "every appearance warranted me [the protagonist-narrator] in apprehending a Simoom."

In the political essay "Chartism", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argues that even the poorest of men who have resigned themselves to misery and toil cannot resign themselves to injustice because they retain an innate sense that a higher (divine) justice must govern the world: "Force itself, the hopelessness of resistance, has doubtless a composing effect against inanimate Simooms, and much other infliction of the like sort, we have found it suffice to produce complete composure. Yet one would say a permanent Injustice even from an Infinite Power would prove unendurable by men."

''[[Walden]]'' (1854), by [[Henry David Thoreau]], references a simoom; he uses it to describe his urge to escape something most unwanted. "There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me—some of its virus mingled with my blood. No—in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way."

In his 1854 novel ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'', [[Charles Dickens]] in describing the oppressive midsummer heat of the sooty, smoky factories of Coketown, writes, "The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom; and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert" (book 2, chapter 1). In ''[[American Notes]]'' Dickens also describes "that injurious [political] Party Spirit" as "the Simoom of America, sickening and blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach." (p.&amp;nbsp;93 in the 1913 Chapman &amp; Hall, Ltd. edition, online from Project Gutenberg).

In [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897), Lucy, describing the appearance of Dracula in her room, writes in her journal entry on September 17 that "a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoom in the desert."

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1914), there is a reference to "Stephen's heart [withering] up like a flower of the desert that feels the simoom coming from afar."

In Sinclair Lewis' novel ''[[Main Street]]'' (1920), there is a reference to "Aunt Bessie's simoom of questioning."

In keeping with its tradition of naming its aircraft engines after winds, the [[Wright Aeronautical]] R-1200 of 1925 was called the Simoon.

A simoon strikes during chapter 2 of the [[film serial]] ''[[Tarzan the Tiger]]'' (1929).

In ''Making a President'' (1932), [[H. L. Mencken]] refers to "a veritable simoon of hiccups."

In [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[Post Captain (novel)|Post Captain]]'' (1972), Diana Villiers' mentally troubled cousin, Edward Lowndes, upon learning that Doctor Maturin is a naval surgeon, remarks, "Very good—you are ''upon'' the sea but not ''in'' it: you are not an advocate for cold baths. The sea, the sea! Where should we be without it? Frizzled to a mere toast, sir; parched, desiccated by the simoom, the dread simoom."
 
A song titled "Simoon" features on the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s epoymously titled [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|album]] that was released in 1978.  Also, [[The Creatures]] have a song called "Simoom" on their 1989 album ''[[Boomerang (The Creatures album)|Boomerang]]''.

In the film ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996) there is a scene in which Count László Almásy regales Katharine Clifton with histories of named winds, one of them being the "Simoon." Alluding to the records of Herodotus, Almásy tells Katharine that there was once a certain Arabic people who deemed the "Simoon" so evil that they marched out to meet it ranked as an army, "their swords raised."

In the collectible card game [[Magic: the Gathering]], card named "Simoon" first appeared in the Visions expansion set on a fictional continent of [[Jamuraa]]. This card saw play in the [[sideboard (cards)|sideboard]] of contemporary Type II decks and was especially effective against the popular Five Colours Green decks that heavily relied on small creatures with toughness of 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">'''Sodium bismuth titanate''' or '''bismuth sodium titanium oxide''' (NBT or BNT) is a solid inorganic compound of [[sodium]], [[bismuth]], [[titanium]] and [[oxygen]] with the [[chemical formula]] of Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This compound adopts the [[perovskite structure]].

==Synthesis==
Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is not a naturally occurring [[mineral]] and several synthesis routes to obtain the compound have been developed. It can be easily prepared by solid state reaction between [[Sodium carbonate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Bismuth oxide|Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] at temperatures around 850&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Structure==
{{main|Perovskite (structure)}}
The exact room-temperature crystal structure of sodium bismuth titanate has been a matter of debate for several years. Early studies in the 1960s using [[X-ray diffraction]] suggested Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to adopt either a pseudo-cubic or a [[rhombohedral]] crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Smolenskii, G. |author2=Isupov, V. |author3=Agranovskaya, A. |author4=Krainik, N. | title =New ferroelectrics of complex composition. | journal =Sov. Phys. Solid State |year =1961| volume = 2 | pages =2651–2654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, based on the high-resolution single-crystal [[X-ray diffraction]] data, a [[monoclinic]] structure (space group Cc) was proposed. On heating, Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transforms at 533 ± 5 K to a [[tetragonal]] structure (space group P4bm) and above 793 ± 5 K to cubic structure (space group Pm{{overline|3}}m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zvirgzds, J.A. |author2=Kapostin, P.P. |author3=Zvirgzde, J.V. |author4=Kruzina, T.V. | title =X-ray study of phase transitions in ferroelectric Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| journal =Ferroelectrics |year =1982 | volume =40| pages = 75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">'''Taylor dispersion''' is an effect in [[fluid mechanics]] in which a [[shear flow]] can increase the effective [[diffusivity]] of a species. Essentially, the shear acts to smear out the concentration distribution in the direction of the flow, enhancing the rate at which it spreads in that direction.&lt;ref name=Probstein&gt;{{cite book | author=Probstein R | title=Physicochemical Hydrodynamics | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite book | author=Chang, H.C., Yeo, L. | title=Electrokinetically Driven Microfluidics and Nanofluidics | year=2009 | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices.| url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook| year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-11903-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is named after the British fluid dynamicist [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]].

The canonical example is that of a simple diffusing species in uniform
[[Poiseuille flow]] through a uniform circular pipe with no-flux
boundary conditions.

==Description==

We use ''z'' as an axial coordinate and ''r'' as the radial
coordinate, and assume axisymmetry. The pipe has radius ''a'', and
the fluid velocity is:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u} = w\hat{\boldsymbol{z}} = w_0 (1-r^2/a^2) \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[concentration]] of the diffusing species is denoted ''c'' and its
[[diffusivity]] is ''D''. The concentration is assumed to be governed by
the linear [[advection-diffusion equation|advection–diffusion equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} c = D \nabla^2 c&lt;/math&gt;

The concentration and velocity are written as the sum of a cross-sectional average (indicated by an overbar) and a deviation (indicated by a prime), thus:

: &lt;math&gt; w(r) = \bar{w} + w'(r)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c(r,z) = \bar{c}(z) + c'(r,z)&lt;/math&gt;

Under some assumptions (see below), it is possible to derive an equation just involving the average quantities:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \bar{c}}{\partial t} + \bar{w} \frac{\partial \bar{c}}{\partial z} = D \left( 1 + \frac{a^2 \bar{w}^2}{48 D^2} \right) \frac{\partial^2 \bar{c}}{\partial z ^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Observe how the effective diffusivity multiplying the derivative on the right hand side is greater than the original value of diffusion coefficient, D. The effective diffusivity is often written as:

: &lt;math&gt; D_{\mathrm{eff}} = D \left( 1 + \frac{1}{192}\mathit{Pe}_d^{2} \right)\, , &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Pe}_d=d\bar{w}/D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Péclet number]], based on the channel diameter &lt;math&gt;d = 2a&lt;/math&gt;. The effect of Taylor dispersion is therefore more pronounced at higher Péclet numbers.

The assumption is that &lt;math&gt;c' \ll \bar{c}&lt;/math&gt; for given &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, which is the case if the length scale in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction is long enough to smoothen out the gradient in the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; direction. This can be translated into the requirement that the length scale &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction satisfies:
: &lt;math&gt;L \gg \frac{a^2}{D} \bar w = \frac{\mathit{Pe}_d\, d}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dispersion is also a function of channel geometry. An interesting phenomena for example is that the dispersion of a flow between two infinite flat plates and a rectangular channel, which is infinitely thin, differs approximately 8.75 times. Here the very small side walls of the rectangular channel have an enormous influence on the dispersion.

While the exact formula will not hold in more general circumstances, the mechanism still applies, and the effect is stronger at higher Péclet numbers. Taylor dispersion is of particular relevance for flows in [[porous medium|porous media]] modelled by [[Darcy's law]].

A '''traction network''' or '''traction power network''' is an electricity grid for the supply of [[Railway electrification system|electrified rail networks]]. The installation of a separate traction network generally is only done if the railway in question uses [[alternating current]] (AC) with a frequency lower than that of the national grid, such as in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

Alternatively, the three-phase alternating current of the power grid can be converted in [[Traction current converter plant|substations]] by rotary transformers or static inverters into the voltage and type of current required by the trains. For railways which run on [[direct current]] (DC), this method is always used, as well as for railways which run on single-phase AC of decreased frequency, as in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. In these areas there are no '''traction current networks'''.

== History ==
{{Main|Utility frequency#History}}
Separate power for traction apart from industrial power always has historic roots. There is no reason today to apply different frequencies or current types than for transmission and for industrial usage. However, the advantage with DC traction was the easier transmission with single copper wires to the feeder points. The advantage with AC traction is the easier transmission over long distances to the feeder points. Beyond these parameters and securing former investment, no evidence exists to stay with different current schemes in networks.

== Applications ==
Dedicated [[traction current]] lines are used when railways are supplied with low-frequency alternating current (AC). The traction current supply line is connected to substations along the line of the railway and is usually run separately from the overhead [[catenary wire]] from which the locomotives are fed.

In countries in which the electric trains run with direct current or with single-phase alternating current with the frequency of the general power grid, the required conversion of the current is performed in the substations, so again no traction current lines are required.

Traction current supply lines are not usually laid parallel to the railway line, in order to allow a shorter line length and to avoid unnecessary influences to the electrical system near the railway line; this also is applied to the current supply of some rapid-transit railways operating with alternating current in Germany.

It is also possible to lay out the traction current supply on special cross beams right on the overhead wire [[Lattice tower|pylons]] above the catenary wire. Because the overhead line pylons have a smaller cross section than traction current supply masts, the cross beams cannot be too wide, so the standard arrangement of four conductor cables in one level cannot be used.  In this case, a two-level arrangement is used, or with two electric circuits for double-railed lines the overhead line pylons for both directions are equipped with cross beams for their own traction current system of two conductor cables each.

In densely populated areas, there are pylons which carry circuits for both traction current and for three-phase alternating current for general power.  Such lines are found where right of ways are rare.  In particular the parallel route of 110&amp;nbsp;kV and 220&amp;nbsp;kV three-phase AC is common. The use of 380&amp;nbsp;kV power lines on the same pylon requires 220&amp;nbsp;kV [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] for the traction current line, because in case the 380&amp;nbsp;kV line fails, [[voltage spike]]s can occur along the traction current line, which the 110&amp;nbsp;kV insulators cannot handle.

As a rule, traction current lines use single conductors, however for the supply of railways with high traffic and in particular for the supply of high speed railway lines, two [[Bundle conductor|bundle conductors]] are used.

==Around the World==

===Austria===
The [[Mariazellerbahn|Mariazeller]] railway in [[Lower Austria]] operates on single phase AC at a 25&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] [[utility frequency]]. The railway has its own traction current lines with an operating voltage of 27&amp;nbsp;kV. These lines are mounted on the pylons of the overhead wire over the catenary wire.

===Germany===
[[Image:Umformerwerk-Karlsruhe_Zweiphasen-Abspannmasten.jpg|thumb|Pylons in a [[Electrical_substation#Converter_substations|converter plant]]]]
In [[Germany]], single conductors are usually used for traction current lines but, for the [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] train, two bundle conductors are used. The traction current supply lines from the nuclear power station [[Neckarwestheim]] to the traction current switching station at [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant|Neckarwestheim]] and from there to the central [[Electrical substation|substation]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Zazenhausen]] are implemented as  a four-bundle conductor circuit.

===Scandinavia===
In [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and some areas of the former [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Three-phase electric power|three phase AC-current]] is converted into single phase AC with a frequency of 16.7 cycles per second at the substations. Unlike in Western Germany, there are no dedicated power plants for railway electricity. All power comes from general electricity suppliers. Although in this region there is, in principle, no requirement for traction power lines, there is a 132 kV-single AC power grid for railway power supply in Central Sweden (see [[Electric power supply system of railways in Sweden]]). In Norway, there is a small 55 kV single phase AC network for power supply of trains in the South, fed by [[Hakavik Power Station]]. A further power station, at Kjofossen feeds single phase AC directly in the overhead wire. In [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is used for the main lines (if electrified) and the electricity comes from general suppliers. As such, much simpler equipment than in Sweden and Norway is needed for conversion.

===South Africa===
In the Republic of [[South Africa]] there are extensive AC and DC traction schemes, including 50 kV and 25&amp;nbsp;kV AC single phase systems. Electrification in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] was stimulated by the takeover of the South African Railways' system by the Electricity Supply Commission (now [[Eskom]]) based on the [[Colenso Power Station]].

=== United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Network Rail]] 750&amp;nbsp;V DC [[railway electrification system|electrification system]] in the southeast of England is supplied with power from an extensive 33&amp;nbsp;kV power distribution network.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Areas with traction power networks==
* [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Germany]] (except Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt), total length 7,959&amp;nbsp;km
* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Austria]] (separate traction power network for the [[Mariazeller Bahn]])
* [[Electric power supply system of railways in Sweden|Central Sweden]]
* [[Electric power supply system of railways in Norway|Southern Norway east of Oslo]]
* [[United States of America|USA]] (Amtrak's former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] lines between [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Harrisburg|Harrisburg, PA]] running with single phase 25&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, see also [[Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system]])
* [[South Africa]]
* [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] (dedicated high voltage transmission wires between former [[Newport A Power Station, Victoria|Newport A Power Station]] and traction substations. However these lines are operated with three phase AC)

==Characteristics ==
Traction current lines are used to power the railway systems of countries which use alternating current of a lower frequency than the public supply. This is typically the case in the German-speaking countries of Europe. For example, 16.7&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] AC is used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

A specific example is the Mariazeller narrow gauge railway in Austria, operating with single phase AC with a frequency of 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, which has its own traction current lines with an operating voltage of 27&amp;nbsp;kV. These lines are mounted on the pylons of the overhead wire over the lines.

The [[voltage]]s used for traction current lines are 110&amp;nbsp;[[volt|kV]] in Germany and Austria and 66&amp;nbsp;kV or 132&amp;nbsp;kV in Switzerland.

Traction current lines are operated symmetrically against [[ground (electricity)|earth]]. In the case of 110&amp;nbsp;kV lines, for example, each conductor has a voltage of 55&amp;nbsp;kV against earth. The grounding is made in larger substations and in power stations for traction current, using [[transformer]]s for the cancellation of the [[earth leakage current]]. As is the case for all symmetrical powerlines there are also at traction power lines twisting points. A traction powerline for one circuit has usually two conductors. Since most traction current lines possess two electric circuits, four conductors are on the [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s as a rule (in contrast with three-phase alternating current lines, whose number of conductors are an integral multiple of three).

==Routing of traction current lines==
Traction current lines are not usually laid parallel to the railway line, so as to minimise the line length and to avoid unnecessary influences of electrical system near the railway line. However, there are cases where this practice is not followed (for example, the current supply of some rapid-transit railways operating with alternating current in Germany). In this case, the traction current line is laid on special cross beams of the overhead wire pylons above the overhead line. Because overhead line pylons possess a smaller cross section than traction current masts, these cross beams have to be quite narrow, so the arrangement of four conductor cables in one level, which is standard at traction current lines, cannot be used. Where four conductors are needed, one approach is to employ a two-level arrangement of conductor cables. Alternatively, in cases of double-tracked railway lines, the overhead line pylons for both driving directions are equipped with cross beams for the traction current system (two conductor cables).

In densely populated areas, where rights of way are rare, it is common to find pylons which carry electric circuits for traction current as well as those for three-phase alternating current. The latter can be 110&amp;nbsp;kV,  220&amp;nbsp;kV, or, in some cases, 380&amp;nbsp;kV three phase AC lines. In such cases, the traction current lines must use [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s which can cope with the maximum [[peak-to-peak]] voltage which can occur between the lines.

Traction current lines are implemented as a rule as single leaders. For the supply of railways with much rail traffic and in particular for the power supply of high speed railway lines such as the German ICE (Inter City Express) trains, conductors of two bundles are used. The traction current lines from the [[nuclear power station]] at [[Neckarwestheim]] to the traction current switching station at Neckarwestheim, and from the traction current switching station at Neckarwestheim to the central substation in [[Stuttgart]] [[Zazenhausen]] are implemented as four-bundle conductors.

Traction current lines are always equipped with an earth conductor. In some cases, two earth conductors are used: for example in, Germany, in cases where the traction current line is carried on pylons together with three phase AC current, like the line to the nuclear power station at Neckarwestheim. Similarly, in  Austria there are some traction current lines equipped with two earth ropes.

==Alternatives to traction current lines==
In [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and some areas of the [[German Democratic Republic|former GDR]] three phase AC-current from the public grid is converted into single phase AC current with a frequency of 16.7 Hz in substations close to the railways. In these regions there are no traction current lines.

Also in countries in which the electric trains run with direct current or with single phase AC current with the frequency of the general power grid, the required conversion of the current is performed in the substations, so that in these countries no traction current lines are needed.

Ancient coiled helical or spiral shaped wire objects resembling springs have been discovered in the Balkans and across Europe by archaeological teams.  Such objects dating from as far back as 4000 BC, the beginning of the first Bronze Age, abound in museums and collections.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum In New York&lt;/ref&gt;   Wire coiled objects, possibly designed as rings or jewelry, nevertheless, exhibit the properties of extension or compression springs.

Three technologies drove the development of coiled springs in the mid-1500s, enabled by advances in the quality of steel; these were time-pieces (e.g., clocks and portable watches), firearms (e.g., cannons and pistols), and vehicles (e.g., coaches and carriages). The latter emerged in 16th century Hungary.  Sir William Felton's Treatise on Carriages 1793&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Felton - Treatise On Carriages 1793&lt;/ref&gt; and George Thrupp's History of Coaches 1877 &lt;ref&gt;George Thrupp History Of Carriages 1877&lt;/ref&gt; give examples of evolving applications of springs in transportation that directly transferred to furniture.

Germany and Sweden were known even in fifteen century Europe as being the best steel because indigenous iron had .05-.07% carbon which is excellent spring grade iron for steel.

1690, Sir Ambrose Crowley used German Syrian steel for quality watch springs.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blakey, 1780, The Art Of Making Watch Springs translated by M. L. Wayman&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Robert Hooke &lt;ref&gt;Sir Robert Hooke Lecture on Spring Bodies 1678&lt;/ref&gt;wrote his Lecture on Springs in 1678. In it he explains how anyone can take well formed wire of various compositions and wind it around a form to create a spring. His work demonstrated the phenomenon known today as Hooke's Law -- which characterizes springs as providing a restoring force proportional to the extent of their deformation.

Clive Edwards, furniture historian wrote that, "One of the most tantalizing questions in eighteenth century furniture is that of springing. Commonly thought to have been a nineteenth century innovation, there is evidence of earlier use. The initial demands for springs appear to have come from the coach builders and the second came from furniture-makers. Coach builders were seeking to improve the ride of vehicles as well as to improve upon the interior comfort seats for passengers." &lt;ref&gt;Clive D. Edwards, Eighteenth Century Furniture, 1996, Manchester University Press, Page 116&lt;/ref&gt; The English guild category is known as "The Worshipful Company Of Furniture Makers" but in sixteenth through nineteenth century times this trade was known as cabinet-makers.

The common nexus was the iron workers and blacksmith shops that were developing carriage springs and supplying hardware parts for cabinet-makers.

George Thrupp illustrates a coil spring used in a carriage presented to the French Academy in 1703.

1706, Henry Mills received Great Britain&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent 376 year 1706&lt;/ref&gt; patent 376 "For A New Mathematical Instrument For New Sorts Of Springs...And That The New Invented Springs Are Made And Contrived of several forms-semicircular, circular, angular, oval, or other forms..." These spring were lighter weight, a set weighing only 20 pounds versus other coach springs in use that weighed 120 pounds per set. These were helical extension springs also known as "worm" springs due to the spiral nature.

1762; Richard Tredwell, Great Britain Patent of Rotherham in the County of York received a patent for a leaf spring for carriages, and, again, in 1763, Richard Tredwell received Great Britain Patent &lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent 792 for year 1763&lt;/ref&gt;792 for "Springs For Carriages". There are four pages in this patent and the fourth page clearly shows nine iterations of helical suspension or worm springs and the patent clearly states it is "my new method of making and constructing springs for hanging of coaches. Coil compression springs would not be used for hanging a carriage. Mr. Tredwell's patent had no contribution to upholstery spring developments.

1780, William Blakey, an expert clock historian wrote The Art Of Making Watch Springs (translated by M Wayman) who said that, "The art of making watch and clock springs could possibly be, of all mechanical operations, the one which provides the greatest amount of knowledge of the physical properties of steel. In the process of discovering the qualities of iron which are essential in order to convet it into steel, the artisan cannot avoid recognizing the different qualities of metal, such as its hardness, its malleability, its elasticity, etc." He also said it was  not easy to ascribe a date in the discovery of steel and its qualities--but this began when clocks and watches were being perfected.&lt;ref&gt;The Ferrous Metallurgy Of Early Clocks And Watches In Post Medieval Steel, British Museum Occasional Paper 136, 2000 pages 13-26&lt;/ref&gt;

1822; &lt;ref&gt;Austria Patent Office refer to Technical University where all pre-1850 patents are kept&lt;/ref&gt;Georg Junigl of Vienna, &lt;ref&gt;Technical University of Austria&lt;/ref&gt;Austria received a "privilidg" which was an Austrian legal term for a patent for a wire spring used in combination with upholstery filling. This patent was announced in the April 24, 1822 edition 94, page 1, column 1, item 3 that Mr. Junigl a bourgeoisie upholsterer of Vienna had been granted the patent. He died in 1840 according to the Vienna, Austria newspaper.

1826, Samuel Pratt of New Bond Street, in the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square in the County of Middlesex received Great Britain Patent 5418 &lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent 5418 of 1826&lt;/ref&gt;for "Beds, Bedsteads, Couches, Seats and Other Articles of Furniture. This patent used coiled shaped springs in an arrangement to minimize for furniture for a nautical sailing vessel.

1828, Samuel Pratt &lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent 5668 for year 1828&lt;/ref&gt;received Great Britain Patent 5668 for "Elastic Beds And Cushions" which was to be an improvement in compression spring arrangements in furniture. Page 5 of the patent depicts two hour-glass shaped wire coil compression springs in both circular and tri-angular shapes.

1833,  August Boschow, a Viennese upholsterer, received an Austrian "privileg"(patent) that was published in the Vienna, Austrian newspaper on June 26, 1833. Mr. Boschow's invented a new type of a “clock” spring designed for use in carriages, chairs, and beds; the spring supported the human body in a sitting or lying supine position.

1834, John Saville Crofton &lt;ref&gt;John Saville Crofton book in British Library&lt;/ref&gt;published a book entitled The London Upholsterer's Companion The Art Of Spring Stuffing. Mr Crofton a veteran of the upholstery trade describes using nine circular steel coil springs 7" high and 3-1/2" wide made of number 8 charcoal wire for upholstering easy chairs. His book also describes spring upholstered sofas, beds, mattresses, pillows, and carriage and coach seats also made of circular coil spring of lighter gauges of wire. Mr Crofton notes that coil spring have been in the trade a number of years indicating the original date of the practice is unknown and this work in the British Library has been unheeded in history accounts on this topic. Crofton wrote on page 34 of his book in the chapter about "Easy Chairs, Spring-stuffing":
{{quote|"In manufacturing spring-stuffed seats, it is necessary to web and bottom on the under side and action of the springs. The seat represented in the design requires none springs--seven inches high, and three and a half over, and these springs be made from No. 8 charcoal wire; sew them firmly to the seat, equi-distant, but not too near each other; having done this, tie them together, using the greatest precaution in doing so, in the first place, that they may be made to assist in action; and, in the next, that they may be kept perpendicular and act freely, upon which most essentially depend on the ease of the seat, and the durability and style of workmanship; then fasten the ends of the twine, with which the springs are tied, to the frame of the chair."&lt;ref&gt;John Saville Crofton, ''The Upholsterer's Companion The Art Of Spring Stuffing'', 1834, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; }}
       
Charcoal wire was an early nineteenth century term that designated crucible manufacturing process for making better quality steel for drawing spring wire.

The hand-tire style of crafting springs by tieing each to adjacent springs is a method that dates back as far as Crofton writes--and probably much earlier as he indicates. Modern upholstery methods may still refer to "hand tied" springs or "eight-way hand-tied springs" which are closely related to Crofton's method as described.

1834 Crofton also informs that the upholsterer could make their own springs by obtaining wire and bending it around a wooden mold or purchasing springs by the hundred weight.

1843 Holland &amp; Sons offered upholstered chair, sofas, and other articles with descriptions such as "putting spring in frames", "spring stuffed", "double spring stuffed", and "spring stuffed cushions.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria And Albert Museum records of Holland &amp; Sons, 1843 Pages 50 and 53 and 1844 page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the evidence from the clock, carriage, and furniture trade it is likely that upholstery springs may have been in use by local craftsmen before the eighteenth century, certainly existed in the eighteenth century, became normal by the beginning of the nineteenth century, and all types of springs were being developed and commonly used by mid-nineteenth century as both the British and American patent records clearly document. Patents do not necessarily mean first use but can only be used to evaluate and estimate trends.

1849, T. E. Warren &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent Office&lt;/ref&gt;of the United States Of America received patent 6740 &lt;ref&gt;Clive D. Edwards furniture historian&lt;/ref&gt;which a complex leaf spring used in seating and was utilized by the American Chair Company for seating on trains.&lt;ref&gt;Clive D. Edwards Encyclopedia Of Furnishings Textiles, Floor Coverings, and Home Furnishing Practices 1200-1950, 2007, page 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technical University of Austria&lt;/ref&gt;

1850, Alexander Oechslin received an Austrian patent for an “improvement in spiral spring upholstery.”&lt;ref&gt;Technical University of Austria&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Between 1855 and 1900 hundreds of wire spring patents were issued in Great Britain and the United States for seating and bedding. These British can be viewed in a Master Abridgement of British Patents in Class 52 1855-1900.
 
Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing,&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institute of American History Washburn &amp; Moen Records&lt;/ref&gt; one of America's first wire drawing companies founded in 1834, manufactured wire for a range of products from piano wire to telegraph wire, barbed wire, and wire for coil springs. Between 1837 and 1847, Washburn’s wire quality dictated that all iron billets 12’ by 1-1/8” were imported from Sweden specifically for drawing wire; once in the United States, the billets were rolled into rods at mills in Troy, New York, Fall River, Massachusetts, or Windsor Locks, Connecticut.The Smithsonian Institute and Library of Congress retains portions of their historical records.&lt;ref&gt;Historical American Engineering Record, Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing Company, Smithsonian Institution American History Museum Records, page 1-20&lt;/ref&gt;

1869, Timothy Rose and Platt Buell&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent Office&lt;/ref&gt; received an American patent number 97,705 for a coil bed spring.

1871, Edwin Bushnell of Poughkeepsie. New York received an&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent Office&lt;/ref&gt; American patent number 4,616 for "An Improvement In Spring Mattresses.
Prior to the early 1900s, springs were used as bed bases or box springs; these spring sets were not covered with fabrics. There were no "innerspring" mattresses manufactured until after 1900. Bushnell's patent has been cited &lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institute of American History Archive Center, Simmons Company Records, written history by Grant G. Simmons refers to Bushnell patent as first spring mattress to his knowledge- it is incorrect as proven by patents and Crofton, Heal &amp; Sons Illustrated catalog of 1853&lt;/ref&gt;as an innerspring but it was an under bed spring---which in the mid-1800s was also called a mattress or base layer of a bed.

Mr. Crofton's work of 1834 and Mr. Felton's work of 1793 in light of archeological finds and great works such as Sir Robert Hooke's Lecture on Springs clearly indicates that coil springs came into use in the 17th or 18th centuries. The time, location, and inventors are unknown.

'''Wasli''', also referred to as '''wasli paper''', is a type of  handmade [[paper]] used specifically for painting [[portrait miniature|miniature]]s. It was devised in [[India]], in the 10th century, and figures widely in [[Mughal painting|Mughal-era painting]].

[http://www.pacificasiamuseum.org/_on_view/exhibitions/beyond_page.aspx Recent uses of Wasli] (hand-prepared paper of varying thickness) range from classical/traditional way of painting with opaque water colors to building structures of varying kinds. 

Miniature Painting is a term used for making opaque/translucent water color paintings/illustrations on a small scale inspired from, [[Persian miniature|Persian]], or [http://www.123himachal.com/pahari_painting.html Pahari miniature] schools and  Wasli is used as a canvas for making [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]].

Wasli word came out of a Persian word Vasl which means Union, of coming together, oneness, etc.

Wasli is an [[Acid-free paper]] and it has archival qualities. Paper eating insects can not eat it because of a poison copper sulphate/Neela Thootha used in the making of this paper. The glue to paste sheets together is also acid free made out of cooking flour. 
To use it for miniature paintings this layered paper is burnished with either smooth glass or a sea shell. This way the paper is shiny, smooth and have minimal perceptible grain.
    

A sheet of wasli is created by gluing together several layers of paper, then polishing them by hand until they are shiny and smooth, with minimal perceptible [[wood grain|grain]].[http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Mocul/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3h_Nx9_SzcPIwP_IB8DA6MQN6MgP39LQ09_U_2CbEdFAGG3mnQ!/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_OFLO9FH20ORL002TF2RNO91IV4_WCM&amp;WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/MoculCL/scultureofpakistan/saartsofpakistan/ghulam+rasul]

A '''Wireless powerline sensor''' hangs from an [[overhead power line]] and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the [[Sensor node|sensor]] does not contact anything but a single live [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], no high-voltage isolation is needed.  The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy [[Energy harvesting|scavenged]] from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured.&lt;ref name="yang"/&gt; Overhead power line monitoring helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.&lt;ref name="harvest"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = X. | last2 = Keutel | first2 = T. | last3 = Baldauf | first3 = M. | last4 = Kanoun | first4 = O. | title = Energy harvesting for a wireless-monitoring system of overhead high-voltage power lines | doi = 10.1049/iet-gtd.2012.0152 | journal = IET Generation, Transmission &amp; Distribution | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–107 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Yi Yang | last2 = Divan | first2 = D. | last3 = Harley | first3 = R.

[[File:WirelessPowerline Sensor.JPG|thumb|Closeup of overhead powerline sensor hanging from one phase of a 4160 volt powerline]]
In the photos on the right, an antenna on the sensor transmits data to a communication device attached to a nearby utility pole.  The communication device gets power from the 240 Volt utility line in a residential neighborhood.  The device has two antennas.  One antenna collects data from the sensors, and the other antenna forwards the data to the electrical utility control center over cell phone service.

In some systems, powerline sensors may transmit information on the high voltage conductor itself rather than by transmission of a radio signal.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wnet"/&gt;

==Measurements==
The primary purpose of a powerline sensor is to measure current, however, some sensors can either directly measure or derive other data such as:

*Conductor temperature
*Ambient temperature
*Inclination or the amount of line sagging
*Wind movement
*Electric fields
*Power Generation
*Distribution and Consumption of electricity

[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in New South Wales]]
A '''working animal''' is an animal, usually [[domestication|domesticated]], that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks. They may be close members of the family, such as [[guide dog]]s or other [[assistance dog]]s, or they may be animals trained to provide [[tractive force]], such as [[draft horse]]s or logging elephants. The latter types of animals are called  '''draft animals''' ('''draught animals''') or '''beasts of burden'''. Most working animals are either [[service animal]]s or draft animals. They may also be used for [[milk]]ing or [[herding]], jobs that require human training to encourage the animal to cooperate. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather.

The history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors.  Around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often [[breed|bred]] for different uses and conditions, especially horses and [[working dog]]s. Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins and some [[Asian elephant]]s.
[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|300px|Traditional farming methods using oxen]]
People have found uses for a wide variety of abilities in animals, and even industrialized societies use many animals for work. People use the strength of horses, elephants, and [[ox]]en to pull carts and move logs. Law enforcement uses the keen sense of smell of dogs to search for drugs and explosives, and others use dogs to find game or search for missing or trapped people. People use various animals—[[camel]]s, [[donkey]]s, horses, dogs, etc.—for transport, either for riding or to pull wagons and sleds. Other animals, including dogs and [[monkey]]s, help blind or disabled people.

On rare occasions, wild animals are not only tamed, but [[animal training|trained]] to perform work—though often solely for novelty or entertainment, as such animals tend to lack the trustworthiness and mild temper of true domesticated working animals.  Conversely, not all domesticated animals are working animals.  For example, while cats may catch mice, it is an instinctive behavior, not one that can be trained by human intervention. Other domesticated animals, such as sheep or rabbits, may have agricultural uses for meat, [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[wool]], but are not suitable for work.  Finally, small domestic pets, such as most small birds (other than certain types of [[Carrier pigeon|pigeon]]) are generally incapable of performing work other than providing companionship.

==Roles and specializations==
===Transportation===
[[File:Chatillon treuil carriere Auboin 2.jpg|thumb|The horse-drawn [[winch]] of a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] (France)]]
Some animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging.  Such animals are grouped as a '''draught''' or '''draft animal'''.  Others may be used as [[pack animal]]s, for  [[animal-powered transport]], the movement of people and goods. Some animals are ridden by people on their backs and are known as “mounts”; Alternatively, one or more animals in [[Horse harness|harness]] may be used to pull vehicles.

====Riding animals or mounts====&lt;!-- this section name is used in one or more redirects (Riding animal); change only after careful consideration --&gt;
They include [[equine]]s such as horses, [[donkey]]s, and [[mule]]s; [[bovine]]s such as [[cattle]], [[water buffalo]], and [[yak]]s, and [[elephant]]s and [[camel]]s. [[Dromedaries|Dromedary camels]] are in arid areas of Australia, North Africa and the Middle East; the less common [[Bactrian camel]] inhabits [[Central Asia|central]] and East Asia; both are used as working animals.  On occasion, [[reindeer]], though usually driven, may be ridden.

Certain wild animals have been tamed and used for riding, usually for novelty purposes, including the [[zebra]] and the [[ostrich]].  Some [[mythical creature]]s are believed to act as divine mounts, such as [[garuda]] in [[Hinduism]] and the winged horse [[Pegasus]] in [[Greek mythology]].

====Pack animals====
[[File:Lloyd the Llama.jpg|thumb|right|A pack [[llama]]]]
{{Main article|Pack animal}}
Pack animals may be of the same species as mounts or harness animals, though animals such as horses, mules, donkeys,  reindeer and both types of camel may have individual bloodlines or [[breed]]s that have been [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] for packing. Additional species are only used to carry loads, including [[llama]]s in the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]].

Domesticated [[cattle]] and yaks are also used as pack animals. Other species used to carry cargo include dogs and [[pack goat]]s.

====Harness animals====
[[File:Mule in Morocco.JPG|thumb|right|Donkey used to pull a wheeled vehicle in Morocco]]
An intermediate use is to [[horse harness|harness]] animals, singly or in [[team]]s, to pull (or haul) [[sled]]s, wheeled vehicles or [[plough]]. 
*[[Oxen]] are slow but strong, and have been used in a yoke since ancient times: the earliest surviving vehicle, Puabi's Sumerian sledge, was ox-drawn; an acre was originally defined as the area a span of oxen could plow in a day. The [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] and [[carabao]], domesticated water buffalo, pull wagons and ploughs in Southeast Asia and the [[Philippines]].
*[[Draft horse|Draught or draft horses]] are commonly used in harness for heavy work.  Several breeds of medium-weight horses are used to pull lighter wheeled carts, carriages and buggies when a certain amount of speed or style is desirable.
* [[Mule]]s are considered tough and strong, with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse [[mare]] used to produce the mule [[foal]].  Because they are a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal and usually are infertile, separate breeding programs must also be maintained.
*[[Pony|Ponies]] and [[donkey]]s are often used to pull carts and small wagons. Historically, ponies were commonly used in mining to pull ore carts.
*Dogs are used for pulling light carts or, particularly, sleds (e.g. [[sled dog]]s such as huskies) for both recreation and working purposes.
*Goats also can perform light harness work in front of carts
*[[Reindeer]] are used in the [[Arctic]] and sub-Arctic Nordic countries and Siberia. During [[World War II]], the [[Red Army]] deployed [[deer transportation battalion]]s on the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://murman.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=1072121&amp;cid=7| script-title=ru:Оленьи батальоны на Мурманском рубеже |publisher =Мурман| author=Андрей Зайцев|language=Russian|date=8 May 2013|accessdate =5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twenty-first century, Russian soldiers continue to train with reindeer sleds in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian soldiers train in sub-zero temperatures with reindeer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35487449|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=BBC|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional festive legend, [[Santa Claus's reindeer]] pull a sleigh through the night sky to help [[Santa Claus]] deliver gifts to children on [[Christmas Eve]].
*Elephants are still used for logging in South-east Asia.
*Less often, camels and llamas have been trained to harness.  According to [[Juan Ignacio Molina]] the Dutch captain [[Joris van Spilbergen]] observed the use of [[llama|chiliquenes]] (a llama type) by native [[Mapuche]]s of [[Mocha Island]] as [[plough|plough animals]] in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;''The Geographical, Natural and Civil History of Chili'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4oIAAAAQAAJ Pages 15 and 16, Volume II]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assorted wild animals have, on occasion, been tamed and trained to harness, including zebras and even moose.

{{See also|Driving (horse)}}
===Guard animals===
As some domesticated animals display extremely protective or territorial behaviour, certain breeds and species can be utilised to guard property, including [[guard dog|dogs]], [[guard goose|geese]] and [[guard llama|llamas]].

===Powering fixed machinery===
[[Image:LaDigueCopra1.jpg|thumb|right|An [[ox]]-powered [[Copra]] press]]
Working draught animals may power fixed machinery using a [[Treadmill#Treadmills_for_power|treadmill]] and have been used throughout history to power a winch to raise water from a well. [[Turnspit dog]]s were formerly used to power [[roasting jack]]s for roasting meat.

===Searching and retrieving===

====Hunting====
[[File:Working cocker spaniel.jpg|thumb|right|A dog working as a retriever]]
As predatory species are naturally equipped to catch prey, this is a further use for animals and birds. This can be done either for sustenance, sport, or to reduce the population of [[Pest (organism)|undesired animals]] that are considered harmful to crops, livestock or the environment.
* [[Hound]]s and other dogs are used to kill and fetch prey. Certain breeds have been bred for this task such as [[Pointer (dog)|pointers]] and [[setter]]s.
* [[Cat#Domestication|Mousers]] (domestic cats used for hunting small rodents and birds) are one of the oldest working animals having protected food supplies from pests since the foundation of human agriculture.
* [[Caracal]]s are sometimes used as hunting animals in some parts of the Middle East, although they are normally kept as pets.
* [[Cheetah#Taming|Cheetahs]] that have been tamed but not domesticated have been used by humans for chasing down prey.
* [[Ferret]]s prey on creatures living in burrows, such as rabbits.
* In [[falconry]], birds of prey are used as hunters in the air.
* Aquatic birds, such as [[cormorant]]s in China, can be used to catch fish.

====Humans====
*[[Search and rescue dog]]s, with their highly developed sense of smell, are used to locate humans, such as escaped prisoners or people lost in remote areas. They are used also to find people who are trapped, such as in avalanches or collapsed buildings.
*Searchers use horses in remote areas to cover large areas of rugged terrain. The horse's natural awareness of their surroundings often alerts human handlers to the presence of something unusual, including lost hikers or hunters. Like some dogs, some horses are trained to follow scent. The use of horses in search and rescue is known as [[Mounted search and rescue]].

====Truffles====
*Dogs and pigs, with a better sense of smell than humans, can assist with gathering by finding valuable products, such as [[truffle]]s (a very expensive subterranean fungus).  Frenchmen typically use [[truffle hog]]s, while Italians  mainly use dogs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Contraband====
*[[Detection dogs]], commonly employed by law enforcement authorities, are trained to use their [[sense]]s to detect [[illegal drug]]s, [[explosive]]s, currency, and [[contraband]] electronics such as illicit mobile phones, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kplu/news.newsmain/article/0/1/1533129/KPLU.Local.News/Dogs.Used.to.Sniff.Out.Cell.Phones.in.NW.Prisons|title=KPLU: Dogs Used to Sniff Out Cell Phones in NW Prisons|last=Jenkins|first=Austin|date=22 July 2009|publisher=Publicbroadcasting.net|accessdate=11 November 2010|archivedate=19 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919141516/http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kplu/news.newsmain/article/0/1/1533129/KPLU.Local.News/Dogs.Used.to.Sniff.Out.Cell.Phones.in.NW.Prisons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense most used by detection dogs is [[olfaction|smell]], hence such dogs are also commonly known as 'sniffer dogs'.

===Interfacing and organization===

====Assistance animals====
{{main article|Service animal}}
*The best-known example is the [[guide dog]] or seeing eye dog for blind people.  See also [[service dog]].  [[Miniature horse]]s are also occasionally used for this purpose as well.
*Trained African monkeys and dogs have been taught to provide other functions for impaired people, such as opening mail and minor household tasks of the same like.

====Herding====

*A very close working relationship exists between a [[Stockman (Australia)|stockman]] or [[shepherd]], a [[herding dog]], and the herd (or mob) of sheep or cattle.  Cattle and sheep herders in other parts of the world also use various dog breeds.  See [[Mountain dog]]s.
*Certain breeds of horses also have an innate "cow sense" that allows them to effectively carry a rider to the right place at the right time to [[muster (livestock)|muster]] (gather or round up) livestock. See [[stock horse]]; [[cutting horse]]

===Military animals===
{{main article|Military animal}}
The defensive and offensive capabilities of animals (such as fangs and claws)  can be used to protect or to attack humans.
* The [[guard dog]] barks or attacks, to warn of an intruder
* [[War elephant]]s were trained for battle in ancient times and are still used for military transport today.
*[[Horses in warfare|Military uses of horses]] have changed over the millennia but still continue, including for [[police horse|police]] work.
* Dolphins and sea lions carry markers to attach to [[naval mine|mine]]s as well as patrolling harbors.  
* On land, dogs can be trained to find [[landmine]]s. [[Rat]]s, which are lighter and less of a risk to set the mines off, have recently been used more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0210_040210_minerats.html Bees, Giant African Rats Used to Sniff Landmines.] In ''National Geographic'', 10 February 2004. Webpage found 12 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Detection rats such as those trained by [[APOPO]] can also be taught to identify diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apopo.org/ APOPO], Dutch organization that raises and trains detection rats for worldwide use. See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20051231054016/http://www.herorat.org/ HeroRAT].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Homing pigeon]]s transport material, usually messages on small pieces of paper, by air.

==Legal status==
In some jurisdictions, certain working animals are afforded greater legal rights than other animals. One such common example is [[police dog]]s, which are often afforded additional protections and the same memorial services as human officers.
