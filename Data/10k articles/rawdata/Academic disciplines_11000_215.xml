      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7853">The '''actuarial present value''' ('''APV''') is the [[expected value]] of the [[present value]] of a contingent [[cash flow]] stream (i.e. a series of payments which may or may not be made). Actuarial present values are typically calculated for the benefit-payment or series of payments associated with [[life insurance]] and [[life annuity|life annuities]]. The probability of a future payment is based on assumptions about the person's future mortality which is typically estimated using a life table.

== Life insurance ==

[[Whole life insurance]] pays a pre-determined benefit either at or soon after the insured's death. The symbol ''(x)'' is used to denote "a life aged ''x''" where ''x'' is a non-random parameter that is assumed to be greater than zero. The actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance issued to ''(x)'' is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; in [[actuarial notation]]. Let ''G&gt;0'' (the "age at death") be the [[random variable]] that models the age at which an individual, such as ''(x)'', will die. And let ''T'' (the future lifetime random variable) be the time elapsed between age-''x'' and whatever age ''(x)'' is at the time the benefit is paid (even though ''(x)'' is most likely dead at that time). Since ''T'' is a function of G and x we will write ''T=T(G,x)''. Finally, let ''Z'' be the present value random variable of a whole life insurance benefit of 1 payable at time ''T''. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\,Z=v^T=(1+i)^{-T} = e^{-\delta T} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the effective annual interest rate and δ is the equivalent [[force of interest]].

To determine the actuarial present value of the benefit we need to calculate the [[expected value]] &lt;math&gt;\,E(Z)&lt;/math&gt; of this random variable ''Z''. Suppose the death benefit is payable at the end of year of death. Then ''T(G, x) := [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]](G - x)'' is the number of "whole years" (rounded upwards) lived by ''(x)'' beyond age ''x'', so that the actuarial present value of one unit of insurance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} A_x  &amp;=  E[Z]   =  E[v^T]  \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^{t}  Pr[T = t]  =  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1}  Pr[T(G, x) = t+1]   \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} Pr[t &lt; G - x \leq t+1 \mid G &gt; x] \\
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} \left(\frac{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}{Pr[G&gt;x]}\right)\left(\frac{Pr[x+t&lt;G\leq x+t+1]}{Pr[G&gt;x+t]}\right) \\ 
 &amp;=  \sum_{t=0}^\infty v^{t+1} {}_t p_x \cdot q_{x+t}  \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}_t p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x)'' survives to age ''x+t'', and &lt;math&gt;\,q_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''(x+t)'' dies within one year.

If the benefit is payable at the moment of death, then ''T(G,x): = G - x'' and the actuarial present value of one unit of whole life insurance is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x\! = E[v^T] = \int_0^\infty v^t f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty v^t\,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] of ''T'', &lt;math&gt;\,_tp_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; surviving to age &lt;math&gt;x + t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[force of mortality]] at time &lt;math&gt;x+t&lt;/math&gt; for a life aged &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

The actuarial present value of one unit of an ''n''-year term insurance policy payable at the moment of death can be found similarly by integrating from 0 to ''n''.

The actuarial present value of an n year pure [[Endowment policy|endowment]] insurance benefit of 1 payable after n years if alive, can be found as

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nE_x = Pr[G &gt; x + n]v^n = \,_np_xv^n &lt;/math&gt;

In practice the information available about the random variable ''G'' (and in turn ''T'') may be drawn from life tables, which give figures by year. For example, a three year term life insurance of $100,000 payable at the end of year of death has actuarial present value

:&lt;math&gt;

100,000 \,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 100,000 \sum_{t=1}^{3} v^{t} Pr[T(G,x) = t]

&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose that there is a 90% chance of an individual surviving any given year (i.e. ''T'' has a [[geometric distribution]] with parameter ''p = 0.9'' and the set ''{1, 2, 3, ...}'' for its support). Then

:&lt;math&gt;Pr[T(G,x)=1]=0.1, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=2]=0.9(0.1)=0.09, \quad Pr[T(G,x)=3]=0.9^2(0.1) = 0.081,&lt;/math&gt;

and at interest rate 6% the actuarial present value of one unit of the three year term insurance is

:&lt;math&gt;

\,A_{\stackrel 1 x :{\overline 3|}} = 0.1(1.06)^{-1} + 0.09(1.06)^{-2} + 0.081(1.06)^{-3} = 0.24244846,

&lt;/math&gt;

so the actuarial present value of the $100,000 insurance is $24,244.85.

In practice the benefit may be payable at the end of a shorter period than a year, which requires an adjustment of the formula.

== Life annuity ==

The actuarial present value of a [[life annuity]] of 1 per year paid continuously can be found in two ways:

'''Aggregate payment technique''' (taking the expected value of the total [[present value]]):

This is similar to the method for a life insurance policy. This time the random variable ''Y'' is the total present value random variable of an annuity of 1 per year, issued to a life aged ''x'', paid continuously as long as the person is alive, and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\overline{a}_{\overline{T(x)|}} = \frac{1-(1+i)^{-T}}{\delta} = \frac{1-v^T(x)}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T=T(x)'' is the future lifetime random variable for a person age ''x''. The expected value of ''Y'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} f_T(t)\,dt = \int_0^\infty \overline{a}_{\overline{t|}} \,_tp_x\mu_{x+t}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Current payment technique''' (taking the total present value of the function of time representing the expected values of payments):

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{a}_x =\int_0^\infty v^{t} [1-F_T(t)]\,dt= \int_0^\infty v^{t} \,_tp_x\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''t'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the random variable ''T''.

The equivalence follows also from integration by parts.

In practice life annuities are not paid continuously. If the payments are made at the end of each period the actuarial present value is given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^t [1-F_T(t)] = \sum_{t=1}^\infty v^t \,_tp_x. &lt;/math&gt;

Keeping the total payment per year equal to 1, the longer the period, the smaller the present value is due to two effects:

*The payments are made on average half a period later than in the continuous case.
*There is no proportional payment for the time in the period of death, i.e. a "loss" of payment for on average half a period.

Conversely, for contracts costing an equal lumpsum and having the same [[internal rate of return]], the longer the period between payments, the larger the total payment per year.

== Life insurance as a function of the life annuity ==

The APV of whole-life insurance can be derived from the APV of a whole-life annuity-due this way:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-iv \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

This is also commonly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\,A_x = 1-d \ddot{a}_x&lt;/math&gt;

In the continuous case,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x = 1-\delta \overline{a}_x.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the annuity and life insurance are not whole life, one should replace the insurance with an n-year endowment insurance (which can be expressed as the sum of an n-year term insurance and an n-year pure endowment), and the annuity with an n-year annuity due.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">{{Wiktionary|barycenter}}

The '''barycenter''' (or '''barycentre'''; from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|βαρύς}} ''heavy'' + {{lang|grc|κέντρον}} ''centre''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[center of mass]] of two or more bodies that [[orbit]] each other and is the point about which the bodies orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a [[two-body problem]].

If one of two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another, the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object. In this case, rather than the two bodies appearing to orbit a point between them, the less massive body will appear to orbit about the more massive body, while the more massive body might be observed to wobble slightly. This is the case for the [[Lunar theory|Earth–Moon system]], in which the barycenter is located on average {{convert|4671|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center, 75% of the Earth's radius of {{convert|6378|km|mi|abbr=on}}. When the two bodies are of similar masses, the barycenter will generally be located between them and both bodies will follow an orbit around it. This is the case for [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], as well as for many [[binary asteroid]]s and [[binary star]]s. When the less massive object is far away, the barycenter can be located outside the more massive object. This is the case for [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and the [[Sun]]; despite the Sun being thousandfold more massive than Jupiter, their barycenter is slightly outside the Sun due to the relatively large distance between them.&lt;ref name="MacDougal" /&gt;

In astronomy, '''barycentric coordinates''' are non-rotating coordinates with the origin at the barycenter of two or more bodies. The [[International Celestial Reference System]] is a barycentric coordinate system centered on the [[Solar System]]'s barycenter.

In [[geometry]], the term ''barycenter'' is synonymous with [[centroid]], the geometric center of a geometric figure.
&lt;!-- 
#transferred lead-content#
is the point between two objects where they balance each other. For example, it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies [[orbit]] each other. When a [[natural satellite|moon]] orbits a [[planet]], or a planet orbits a [[star]], both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that is not at the center of the primary (the larger body). For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the [[Earth]], but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately {{convert|1710|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface of the Earth ({{convert|4661|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Earth's center, about 74% of Earth's radius), where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]].

== Two-body problem ==
{{main|Two-body problem}}
[[File:Barycentric view of Pluto and Charon 29 May-3 June by Ralph in near-true colours.gif|thumb|230px|Barycentric view of the [[Pluto]]–[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system as seen by ''[[New Horizons]]'']]

The barycenter is one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] of each body. This is an important concept in the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. If ''a'' is the distance between the centers of the two bodies (the semi-major axis of the system), ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the primary's orbit around the barycenter, and {{nowrap|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the semi-major axis of the secondary's orbit. When the barycenter is located ''within'' the more massive body, that body will appear to "wobble" rather than to follow a discernible orbit. In a simple two-body case, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = a \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{a}{1 + \frac{m_1}{m_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where :
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[distance]] from body 1 to the barycenter
:''a'' is the distance between the centers of the two bodies
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[mass]]es of the two bodies.

:{{note label|pluto|A|A}} The Earth has a perceptible "wobble". Also see [[tide]]s.
:{{note label|pluto|B|B}} [[Pluto]] and Charon are sometimes considered a [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] because their barycenter does not lie within either body.&lt;ref name="Olkin-2015" /&gt;
:{{note label|wobble|C|C}} The Sun's wobble is barely perceptible.
:{{note label|jupiter|D|D}} The Sun orbits a barycenter just above its surface.&lt;ref name="NASA2005" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Inside or outside the Sun? ===
[[File:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|Motion of the [[Solar System]]'s barycenter relative to the Sun]]

If {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} — which is true for the Sun and any planet — then the ratio {{sfrac|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} approximates to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{R_1} \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the barycenter of the Sun–planet system will lie outside the Sun only if:

:&lt;math&gt;{a \over R_\odot} \cdot {m_\mathrm{planet} \over m_\odot} &gt; 1 \; \Rightarrow \; {a \cdot m_\mathrm{planet}} &gt; {R_\odot \cdot m_\odot} \approx 2.3 \times 10^{11} \; m_\oplus \; \mbox{km} \approx 1530 \; m_\oplus \; \mbox{AU}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, where the planet is massive ''and'' far from the Sun.

If Jupiter had [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit ({{convert|57900000|km|AU|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), the Sun–Jupiter barycenter would be approximately 55,000&amp;nbsp;km from the center of the Sun ({{nowrap|{{sfrac|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ≈ 0.08}}). But even if the Earth had [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris']] orbit ({{convert|68|AU|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), the Sun–Earth barycenter would still be within the Sun (just over 30,000&amp;nbsp;km from the center).

To calculate the actual motion of the Sun, you only need to consider the motions of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). The contributions of all other planets, dwarf planets, etc. are negligible. If the four giant planets were on a straight line on the same side of the Sun, the combined center of mass would lie about 1.17 solar radii or just over 810,000&amp;nbsp;km above the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name=Meeus1997/&gt;

The calculations above are based on the mean distance between the bodies and yield the mean value ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But all celestial orbits are elliptical, and the distance between the bodies varies between the [[apsis|apses]], depending on the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], ''e''. Hence, the position of the barycenter varies too, and it is possible in some systems for the barycenter to be ''sometimes inside and sometimes outside'' the more massive body. This occurs where:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-e} &gt; \frac{r_1}{R_1} &gt; \frac{1}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the Sun–Jupiter system, with ''e''&lt;sub&gt;Jupiter&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.0484, just fails to qualify: {{nowrap|1.05 &lt; 1.07 &gt; 0.954}}.

== Relativistic corrections ==

In [[classical mechanics]], this definition simplifies calculations and introduces no known problems. In [[general relativity]], problems arise because, while it is possible, within reasonable approximations, to define the barycenter, the associated coordinate system does not fully reflect the inequality of clock rates at different locations. Brumberg explains how to set up barycentric coordinates in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Brumberg" /&gt;

The coordinate systems involve a world-time, i.e. a global time coordinate that could be set up by [[telemetry]]. Individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard, because they are subject to differing [[gravitational potential]]s or move at various velocities, so the world-time must be slaved to some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system. This time standard is called [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]], or TCB.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">'''Beam's Eye View''' (or '''BEV''') is an imaging technique used in [[radiation therapy]] for the quality assurance and planning of External Beam Radiation Therapy treatments. These are primarily used to ensure that the relative orientation of the patient and the treatment machine are correct. The BEV image will typically contain the images of the patient's anatomy and the beam modifiers (such as jaws or Multi-Leaf Collimators (or MLCs)).

==Generation of Beam's Eye Views==
* Physical Construction:
**  BEV's can be generated by exposing a high energy film (similar to [[photographic film]]) or an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) with the treatment beam itself after it passes through the patient and any beam modifiers (such as blocks). Although this type of image is an excellent indication of the basic quality of the treatment plan, the quality of film images can be poor.
** A BEV can be created using a radiation therapy simulator which mimics the treatment geometry (couch angle, gantry angle, etc.) using an [[X-ray]] source instead of the higher energy treatment source. The jaws and blocks can be imaged on the same film as the patient's landmarks.
* Artificial Reconstruction: The BEV can be created using a [[Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph]] (or DRR) that is created from a computed tomography (or CT) data set. This image would contain the same treatment plan information, but the patient image is reconstructed from the CT image data using a physics model.

{{Chaos magic}}'''Chaos magic''', also spelled '''chaos magick''', is a contemporary [[Magick (paranormal)#Modern_Western_occultism|magical practice]]. It was initially developed in [[England]] in the 1970s, drawing heavily from the philosophy of [[artist]] and [[occultist]] [[Austin Osman Spare]].&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book |last=Chryssides |first=George D. |author-link=George Chryssides |title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition=2 |page=78 |isbn=978-0-8108-6194-7 |ref=refChryssides}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as "success magic" or "results-based magic", chaos magic claims to emphasize the attainment of specific results over the [[symbol]]ic, [[Ritual|ritualistic]], [[Theology|theological]] or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions.&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult |last=Drury |first=Nevill |author-link=Nevill Drury |publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers| year=2011 |orig-year=2002 |isbn=9781780283623 |url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bmg8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |page=86 |ref = refDrury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos magic has been described as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied [[postmodernism]]&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements |last=Clarke |first=Peter |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |publisher=Routledge  |pages=105–106 |isbn=9781134499700 |ref = refClarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or [[Epistemology|knowability]] of objective truth.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt; Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and frequently borrowing from other [[Magick (paranormal)#20th century|magical traditions]], [[religious movements]], [[popular culture]] and various strands of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; 

Early leading figures include [[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]].&lt;ref name=Drury/&gt;

==Concept and terminology==

Chaos magic differs from other occult traditions such as [[Thelema]] or [[Wicca]] in that it rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the ''belief'' of the practitioner.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1987| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oHY_FdJD6kkC| ref = refCarroll2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic thus takes an explicitly agnostic position on whether or not magic exists as a supernatural force, with many chaos magicians expressing their acceptance of a psychological model as one possible explanation.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown when the term "chaos magic" first emerged, with the earliest texts on the subject referring only to "magic" or "the magical art" in general. Furthermore, they often claimed to state principles universal to magic, as opposed to a new specific style or tradition, describing their innovations as efforts to rid magic of superstitious and religious ideas.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}
&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Results| author = Sherwin, Ray| publisher = Revelations 23 Press| year = 1992| isbn = 9781874171003| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zmIiMQAACAAJ| ref = refSherwin1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''chaos'' was first used in connection with magic by Peter J. Carroll in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978), where it is described as "the 'thing' responsible for the origin and continued action of events."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; Carroll goes on to say that "It could as well be called '[[God]]' or '[[Tao]]', but the name 'Chaos' is virtually meaningless and free from the [[anthropomorphic]] ideas of [[religion]]."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

== Beliefs and general principles ==

[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|The Sigil of Chaos, a commonly used symbol of chaos magic]]

=== Results-based magic ===

Other magical traditions like [[Wicca]], [[Qabalah]] or the [[Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|Golden Dawn system]] combine techniques for bringing about change with "beliefs, attitudes, a conceptual model of the universe (if not several), a moral ethic, and a few other things besides."&lt;ref name=Hine1&gt;{{cite book | title = Condensed Chaos: An Introduction to Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150664| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Condensed_Chaos.html?id=_eKuSQAACAAJ| ref = refHine1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic grew out of the desire to strip away all of these extraneous elements, leaving behind only the techniques for effecting change; hence the emphasis is on actually ''doing'' things – i.e., experimenting with different techniques, rather than memorising complex rules, symbols and correspondences – and then retaining those techniques that appear to produce results.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=White1&gt;{{cite book | title = Pieces of Eight: Chaos Magic Essays and Enchantments| author = White, Gordon | year = 2016| ref = refWhite1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "pick'n'mix/D.I.Y" approach means that the working practices of different chaos magicians often look drastically different, with many authors explicitly encouraging readers to invent their own magical style.&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fries1&gt;{{cite book | title = Seidways| author = Fries, Jan | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 1997| isbn = 1-869928-36-9| ref = refFries1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1&gt;{{cite book | title = Understanding Chaos Magic| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Capall Bann Publishing| year = 1996| isbn = 1-898307-93-8| ref = refHawkins1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belief as a tool ===

The central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the "meta-belief" that "belief is a tool for achieving effects".&lt;ref name=Carroll1&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Kaos| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1992| isbn = 9780877287421| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M_GRhTdT4YgC| ref = refCarroll1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like [[Qabalah]], the [[Enochian|Enochian system]], [[astrology]] or the [[I Ching]] are treated as maps or "symbolic and linguistic constructs" that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no [[Universality_(philosophy)|absolute]] or [[Objectivity_(philosophy)|objective truth]] value in themselves&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a position referred to by religious scholar [[Hugh Urban]] as a "rejection of all fixed models of reality",&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Urban |year=2006 |title=Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wVBx9yriTUC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=240–243 |isbn=9780520932883 |ref=refUrban}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often summarised with the phrase "nothing is true everything is permitted".&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of English Magic| author1 = Carr-Gomm, Philip | author2 = Heygate, Richard | publisher = The Overlook Press| year = 2010| isbn = 9781590207604| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FXUjCQAAQBAJ| ref = refCarr-Gomm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll1/&gt;

Some commentators have traced this position to the influence of [[postmodernism]] on contemporary occultism.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm/&gt; Another influence comes from the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], who believed that belief itself was a form of [[Energy_(psychological)|"psychic energy"]] that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This "free belief" could then be directed towards new aims.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Pleasure: The Psychology of Ecstasy| author = Spare, Austin Osman | publisher = Lulu Press| year = 2013| isbn = 9781105502996| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7lLCAAAQBAJ| ref = refSpare1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = Morrison, Grant| chapter = Pop Magic!| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refMorrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted the influence of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who wrote of the occult:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.&lt;ref name=Crowley1&gt;{{cite book | title = Book 4| author = Crowley, Aleister | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1980| isbn = 9780877285137| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_Q69RL7mJv0C| ref = refCrowley1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kia and Chaos ===

Within the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate ''desire'' to something Spare termed [[Kia_(magic)|"Kia"]] (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the "passage" of the unconscious – hence the need for complex systems of symbolism. Provided there was enough "free belief" to feed them, these desires would then grow, unconsciously, into "obsessions", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book | title = Austin Osman Spare: The Life and Legend of London's Lost Artist| author = Baker, Phil| publisher = Strange Attractor| year = 2011| isbn = 9781907222016| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQu4twAACAAJ| ref = refBaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter J. Carroll inherited this model from Spare, but used the term "Kia" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: "the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed "Chaos". In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later chaos magicians have stressed that this basic operating process can be explained in multiple different ways, from within different paradigms. For example:

* Within a spirit model, the job of a [[shaman]] is to communicate their intentions to their spirit helpers, who then work magic on their behalf. 
* Within an energy model, a magician might direct their own [[qi|qi/ch'i]] towards specific aims.
* Within a psychological model, a magician uses symbols to condition their unconscious to work towards their goals.
* Within an information model, a magician transmits information to an underlying matrix or field in order to produce specific effects.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UD&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/model.html|title = Models of Magic|author = Frater U.'.D.'.|date = 1991|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 6, 2018| ref = refUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

Since chaos magic is built around an experimental, D.I.Y. approach that involves stripping all magical techniques down to their barest essence, any practice from any magical tradition can be incorporated under the banner of chaos magic: from [[satanism|Satanic]] ritual, to [[wicca|Wiccan]] [[sabbats]], to [[energy healing]], to [[tantra|Tantric practices]], etc. However, there are a few techniques that have been specifically developed by chaos magicians, and are unique to the tradition.

=== Gnostic state ===

Most chaos magic techniques involve something called the gnostic state, or [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]]. This is described as an [[altered state of consciousness]] in which a person's mind is focused on [[Samadhi|only one point]], thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out.&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt; The gnostic state is used to bypass the "filter" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

Since it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a "brief 'no-mind' state" in which to work magic.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Three main types of gnosis are described:&lt;ref name=Vitimus&gt;{{cite book |last=Vitimus |first=Andrieh |title=Hands-on Chaos Magic: Reality Manipulation Through the Ovayki Current |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7387-1508-7| ref = refVitimus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Inhibitory gnosis]]''' is a form of deep [[meditation]] into a [[trance]] state of [[mind]]. This type of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] uses slow and regular [[breath]]ing techniques, absent thought processes, [[progressive muscle relaxation]], self-induction and [[self-hypnosis]] techniques. Means employed may also include [[fasting]], [[sleeplessness]], [[sensory deprivation]] and [[hypnotic]] or trance-inducing drugs.

* '''Ecstatic gnosis''' describes a mindlessness reached through intense [[arousal]]. It is aimed to be reached through [[sexual arousal|sexual excitation]], intense [[emotion]]s, [[flagellation]], [[dance]], [[drum]]ming, [[chanting]], [[sensory overload]], [[hyperventilation]] and the use of disinhibitory or hallucinogenic drugs.

* '''Indifferent vacuity''' was described by [[Phil Hine]] and [[Jan Fries]] as a third method. Here the intended spell is cast parenthetically, so it does not raise much thought to suppress – "doodling sigils while listening to a talk which is boring, but you have to take notes on", for example.&lt;ref name=Fries2&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Magick: A Handbook of Freestyle Shamanism |first=Jan |last=Fries |authorlink=Jan Fries |publisher=[[Mandrake of Oxford]] |year=1992 |isbn=1-869928-57-1| ref = refFries2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;

=== Sigils ===

[[File:Sigil shoal.svg|thumb|A shoal of [[sigil_(magic)|sigils]]]]


A [[Sigil_(magic)|sigil]] is a picture or glyph that represents a particular desire or intention. They are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of [[monogram]]. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to "launch" or "charge" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; To quote Ray Sherwin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: there should be "a deliberate striving to forget it", in Spare's words.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;

In the [[Medieval era]], a ''sigil'' was a symbol associated with a particular [[angel]] or [[demon]], which could be used to ritually summon the relevant being.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;{{cite book|title=The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment: A Compendium of Tools &amp; Techniques for Growth &amp; Transformation |author1=Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn|author2=Slate, Joe H. |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2011 |isbn=9780738729862|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OzIvEjvCj1sC|ref = refWeschcke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spare turned this practice on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply [[Complex_(psychology)|complexes]] in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilisation.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a [[servitor (chaos magic)|servitor]].&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marik2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/servitors.html|title = Servitors: Part Two of Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms|author = Marik|date = 1998|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refMarik2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of "group mind", then it is referred to as an [[egregore]].&lt;ref name=Rysen&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/fen-egre.html|title = The Fluid Continuum --or-- What the f***'s an Egregore?|author = Rysen, Fenwick |date = 1999|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refRysen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/gegregor.html|title = Egregore Definition Compilation|author = Emerson, Gabriel|date = 1997|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refEmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. [[Grant Morrison]] coined the term ''hypersigil'' to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His [[comic book]] series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' was intended as such a hypersigil.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Morrison has also argued that modern [[Logo|corporate logos]] like "the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph" are a form of viral sigil:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon White developed the technique of ''shoaling'', which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for "money", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help "shift the probability" towards the overall aim.&lt;ref name=White4&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2012/03/ultimate-sigil-magic-guide/|title = Sigils Reboot: How to get Big Magic from Little Squiggles|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2010/06/shoaling-making-sigil-magic-more-awesome-since-2010/|title = Shoaling: Making Sigil Magic more Awesome Since 2010|author = White, Gordon|date = 2010|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite2}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also developed the technique of the ''robofish'', which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to "lead" the rest of the shoal.&lt;ref name=White3&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2011/07/magic-secrets-as-taught-by-robot-fish/|title = Magic Secrets as Taught by Robot Fish|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cut-up technique ===

The cut-up technique is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name=Cran&gt;{{cite book|title= Collage in Twentieth-Century Art, Literature, and Culture: Joseph Cornell, William Burroughs, Frank O’Hara, and Bob Dylan|author= Cran, Rona|publisher= Routledge|year= 2016|isbn= 9781317164296|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFU3DAAAQBAJ|ref = refCran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the chaos magic organisation [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] in the early 1990s&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/172802/magical_universe_william_s_burroughs/|title = The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs|author = Stevens, Matthew Levi|date = 2013|website = Reality Sandwich|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refStevens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ashejournal.com/2015/03/16/magick-and-photography/|title = Magick and Photography|author = Grant, Douglas|date = 2015|website = Ashe Journal|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refGrantD}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating "the cut ups are not for artistic purposes".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cambridge Companion to the Beats| author = Harris, Oliver| chapter = William S. Burroughs: Beating Postmodernism| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2017| editor = Belletto, Steven | isbn = 9781107184459| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NYXuDQAAQBAJ| ref = refHarris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs used his cut-ups for "political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration"&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to "break down the barriers that surround consciousness".&lt;ref name=Burroughs&gt;{{cite book | title = The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs| author = Burroughs, William S.| publisher = Penguin UK| year = 2012| isbn = 9780141903583| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DivGjW-qEv8C| ref = refBurroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Burroughs himself stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I've made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.&lt;ref name=Burroughs/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Bowie]] compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the [[I Ching]] or [[Tarot]].&lt;ref name=Doggett&gt;{{cite book | title = The Man who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s| author = Doggett, Peter| publisher = Random House| year = 2011| isbn = 9781847921451| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KC5yOXoyXioC| ref = refDoggett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other chaos magicians have elaborated on the basic technique. [[Genesis P-Orridge]], who studied under Burroughs, describes it as a way to "identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated."&lt;ref name=P-Orridge&gt;{{cite book | title = THEE PSYCHICK BIBLE: Thee Apocryphal Scriptures ov Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and Thee Third Mind ov Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth| author = P-Orridge, Genesis Breyer| publisher = Feral House| year = 2010| isbn = 9781932595949| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X1FjCwAAQBAJ| ref = refP-Orridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]] suggested various magical ways to use the cut-up technique, such as cutting together two people to form a love spell.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web |url = https://chaotopia.co.uk/cutupcoll.html|title = Cut Up and Collage in Magic|author = Lee, Dave|date = 1989|website = Chaotopia!|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synchromysticism ===

[[Synchromysticism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[synchronicity]] and [[mysticism]], is "the art of realising meaningful coincidences in the seemingly mundane with mystical or esoteric significance".&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/1377/the_cryptic_cosmology_synchromysticism/ |title = The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism |author = Valis | date = 2008 | website = Reality Sandwich | access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refValis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Life of Movies: Schizophrenic and Shamanic Journeys in American Cinema |author= Horsley, Jason |publisher=McFarland|year=2009 |isbn= 9780786454624 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SRDvgD-SADAC |ref = refHorsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were clear that the "results" to be attained through their techniques consisted of synchronicities, with Carroll stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for ''deliberately engineering synchronicities''.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;{{cite book | title = Octavo: A Sorceror-Scientist's Grimoire (Roundworld Edition) | author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781906958176 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x6UUTwEACAAJ | ref = refCarroll4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2013/04/twilight-language-the-quest-for-the-grail/|title = Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail |author = White, Gordon|date = 2013|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refWhite6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and influences (1974-1982) ===

[[File:Austin_Osman_Spare.jpg|thumb|[[Austin Osman Spare]], whose ideas formed the basis of chaos magic. Photo taken 1904.]]

Chaos magic was first developed in England in the mid-1970s, at a time when British occultism was dominated by [[Wicca]] and [[Thelema]].&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Although both of these traditions incorporate magical elements, they are both religions, and as such contain devotional elements, [[liturgy]] and [[dogma]]. Chaos magic grew out of the desire of some occultists to strip away these extrinsic details and distill [[Magic_(paranormal)|magic]] down to a set of tried-and-tested techniques for causing effects to occur in reality.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is "Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master."&lt;ref name=Carroll3&gt;{{cite book | title = Psybermagick: Advanced Ideas in Chaos Magick: Revised Edition| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2008| isbn = 9781935150657| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mxLHPAAACAAJ| ref = refCarroll3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]] are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although [[Phil Hine]] points out that there were others "lurking in the background, such as the ''Stoke Newington Sorcerors''"&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a group which included [[Charles Brewster]] (Frater Choronzon).&lt;ref name=IOT&gt;{{cite book| title = The Secrets of the Illuminates of Thanateros| author = IOT| publisher = The Illuminates of Thanateros| year = 2002| url = http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf| ref = refIOT| access-date = 2018-06-10| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060917214610/http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf#| archive-date = 2006-09-17| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll was a regular contributor to ''[[The New Equinox]]'', a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

1978 was perhaps the seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both ''Liber Null'' by Carroll and ''The Book of Results'' by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic – and the establishment of [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] (IOT), the first chaos magic organization.&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;

[[Austin Osman Spare]] is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Specifically, Spare developed the use of [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]s and the use of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] to empower these. Most basic sigil work recapitulates Spare's technique, including the construction of a phrase detailing the magical intent, the elimination of duplicate letters, and the artistic recombination of the remaining letters to form the sigil. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, many consider him to be the grandfather of chaos magic because of his repudiation of traditional magical systems in favor of a technique based on gnosis.

[[Aleister Crowley]] was a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his [[syncretic]] approach to magic, and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; Other early influences include [[Discordianism]], the [[punk subculture|punk]] movement, [[postmodernism]] and the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; [[Lionel Snell]] was also publishing writing on Spare in the mid-1970s, and became drawn into the burgeoning chaoist movement. Snell's book ''[[SSOTBME]]'' (1974) also came to influence the early chaos magicians.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

However, despite these influences, it's clear from their early writings that the first chaos magicians were attempting to recover a sort of universal [[shamanism]] by stripping away any accumulated cultural gloss. Carroll makes this clear in ''Liber Null'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is echoed in Snell's description of Spare as a "master shaman" who brought into the world a new form of "shamanistic sorcery".&lt;ref name=Snell1&gt;{{cite web |url = https://fulgur.co.uk/austin-osman-spare/exploring-spares-magic|title = Exploring Spare's Magic|author = Snell, Lionel|date = 1987|website = Fulgur|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refSnell1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early development and spread (1982-1994) ===

New chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in [[Yorkshire]], where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called ''The Sorceror's Apprentice'', owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called ''The Lamp of Thoth'', which published articles on chaos magic, and his ''Sorceror's Apprentice Press'' re-released both ''Liber Null'' and ''The Book of Results'', as well as ''Psychonaut'' and ''The Theatre of Magic''.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; ''The Circle of Chaos'', which included [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], was formed in Yorkshire in 1982.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baph&gt;{{cite web |url = https://theblogofbaphomet.com/2012/12/08/an-audience-with-dave-lee/|title = An Audience with Dave Lee|author1 = Vayne, Julian|author2=Dee, Steve|author3=Wyrd, Nikki|date = 2012|website = The Blog of Baphomet|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refBaph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as ''The Cardinal Rites of Chaos'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;

[[Ralph Tegtmeier]] (Frater U.D.), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of "ice magick", translated ''Liber Null'' into German.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2&gt;{{cite book | title = Chaonomicon| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Lulu| year = 2017| isbn = 9780244916633| ref = refHawkins2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order. He was excommunicated in 1990 over the "Ice Magic Wars".&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; Lola Babalon established the first American IOT temple in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt;

As chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin's circle began publishing on the topic. [[Phil Hine]], who practiced chaos magic alongside [[Tantra]] and [[Wicca]], published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet.&lt;ref name=Gyrus&gt;{{cite web |url = https://dreamflesh.com/interview/phil-hine/|title = Chaos and Beyond|author = Gyrus|date = 1997|website = Dreamflesh|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refGyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wiccanrede.org/2010/12/interview-with-phil-hine/|title = Before, Chaos, and After|author = Blackwell, Christopher|date = 2010|website = Wiccan Rede|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refBlackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaq D. Hawkins, from California, wrote an article on chaos magic for ''Mezlim'' magazine, coming into contact with Sherwin and other IOT members in the process. Hawkins later wrote the first chaos magic book intended for a general readership.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; In 1992, [[Jan Fries]] published ''Visual Magick'', introducing his own blend of "freestyle shamanism", which has had influence on chaos magic.&lt;ref name=Fries&gt;{{cite book | title = Visual Magick: A Practical Guide to Trance, Sigils and Visualization Techniques| author = Fries, Jan| publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 2000|isbn = 9781869928575| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsfSAAAACAAJ| ref = refFries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Genesis P-Orridge]] established [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] (TOPY), an art collective and magical order.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; P-Orridge had studied magic under [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]] in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic movement]].&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = P-Orridge, Genesis| chapter = Magick Squares and Future Beats| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refP-Orridge2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the [[Acid House]] and [[Industrial music]] scenes.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; They were also partially responsible for introducing the techniques of Burroughs and Gysin to the chaos magic stream&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; – but this influence also ran the other way, with Burroughs (who already practiced magic and was experimenting with Spare's sigil technique)&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD/&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; being inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

=== Pop culture: (1994-early 2000s) ===

From the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of [[pop culture]] in addition to that of "authentic" magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The [[symbol of chaos]], for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref name=Nozedar&gt;{{cite book | title = Secret Signs and Symbols: The Ultimate A-Z Guide from Alchemy to the Zodiac| author = Nozedar, Adele | publisher = HarperCollins UK| year = 2008| isbn = 9780007264452| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=an67pzmMJb4C | ref = refNozedar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preluded by [[Kenneth Grant]] – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of [[H._P._Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft's]] fictional [[Cthulhu mythos]] into his own magical writings&lt;ref name=Lavenda&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dark Lord: H.P. Lovecraft, Kenneth Grant and the Typhonian Tradition in Magic| author = Levenda, Peter | publisher = Nicolas-Hays, Inc.| year = 2013| isbn = 9780892542079| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DPQ9TUaEKjMC | ref = refLavenda}}&lt;/ref&gt; – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft's work, such as the [[Great Old Ones]]. Hine, for example, published ''The Pseudonomicon'' (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.&lt;ref name=Hine3&gt;{{cite book | title = The Pseudonomicon| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150640| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EC5hQwAACAAJ | ref = refHine3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, by the mid-1990s, chaos magic itself was beginning to leak into pop culture. Many of the writers and artists who produced strips for British [[sci-fi]] [[comic]] [[2000_AD_(comics)|2000ad]] also practiced chaos magic – among them [[Pat Mills]],&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chaos-in-the-uk-from-the-klf-to-reclaim-the-streets/ |date=April 7, 2017 |title=Chaos in the UK: From the KLF to Reclaim the Streets |last=Clutterbuck |first=Brenton |website=Historia Discordia |access-date=June 12, 2018 |ref=refClutterbuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Talbot]],&lt;ref name=Thorpe&gt;{{cite web |url = http://awfullybigblogadventure.blogspot.com/2014/05/comics-anarchy-chaos-magick-and-george.html|title = Comics, anarchy, chaos magick and George Orwell|author = Thorpe, David|date = 2014|website = An Awfully Big Blog Adventure|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Skinner]],&lt;ref name=Molcher&gt;{{cite book | title = 2000 AD: The Creator Interviews - Volume 01| author = Molcher, Michael | publisher = 2000 AD Books| year = 2015| isbn = 9781849973236| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eb7XAAAAQBAJ | ref = refMolcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dave Thorpe]]&lt;ref name=Thorpe/&gt; – and many included frequent references to chaos magic in their work. Mills, for example, created the characters of [[Nemesis the Warlock]] and [[ABC_Warriors#Deadlock|Deadlock]], both of whom practiced "khaos magick".&lt;ref name=talkingcomicssite&gt;{{cite web |url = https://talkingcomicssite.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/nemesis-and-deadlock-a-magickal-partnership/|title = Nemesis and Deadlock: A Magickal Partnership|author = talkingcomicssite|date = 2017|website = talkingcomicssite|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = reftalkingcomicssite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Morrison]], who began practicing chaos magic at 19,&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arthurmag.com/2007/02/01/interview-with-grant-morrison-from-the-pages-of-arthur-magazine/|title = One Nervous System’s Passage Through Time|author = Babcock, Jay|date = 2004|website = Arthur|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refBabcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the series [[Zenith_(comics)|''Zenith'']] for 2000ad. ''Zenith'' frequently featured chaos magic themes, as well as a distinct Lovecraftian influence, and the [[Cthulhu mythos]]-inspired monsters of the story were copied straight from the illustrations of ''Liber Null''&lt;ref name=Sarkos&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sarkos.tumblr.com/post/71301152131/just-random-info-the-old-ones-and-the-mysterious|title = The Old Ones and the mysterious Brian Ward|author = Sarkos|date = 2013|website = Hate:Wreck:Peril|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refSarkos}}&lt;/ref&gt; – leading to the threat of a lawsuit from Peter Carroll.&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck/&gt;

From 1994 to 2000, Morrison wrote ''[[The Invisibles]]'' for [[DC_Comics|DC Comics']] [[Vertigo_(DC_Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a "hypersigil": "a dynamic miniature model of the magician's universe, a hologram, microcosm or 'voodoo doll' which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of 'real' life."&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Both ''The Invisibles'' and the activities of Morrison himself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining his views on chaos magic in the "Pop Magic!" chapter of ''A Book of Lies'' (2003)&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; a [[Disinformation_(company)|Disinfo Convention]] talk,&lt;ref name=Metzger2&gt;{{cite book | title = Disinformation: The Interviews: Uncut &amp; Uncensored| author = Metzger, Richard | publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2002| isbn = 9781609259365| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SdpAB7sbkZwC | ref = refMetzger2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the documentary ''[[Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods]]''.&lt;ref name=Thill&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2010/11/grant-morrison-talking-with-gods-review/|title = Review: Talking With Gods Bows Down to Comics Immortal Grant Morrison|author = Thill, Scott|date = 2010|website = Wired.com|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThill}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morrison's particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions ([[Hermes]], [[Mercury_(mythology)|Mercury]], [[Thoth]], [[Ganesh]], etc.) are nothing more than different cultural "glosses" for more universal "big ideas"&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like [[The Flash]], or [[Metron_(comics)|Metron]], or [[Madonna_(entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt;

=== Post-chaos magic: 2010s ===

Over the course of the past decade, chaos magic has experienced a shift away from the pop cultural interpretation that typified the Lovecraft/Morrison era. Jason Miller has argued that contemporary occultism has entered a "post-chaos" phase, in which chaos magicians are increasingly initiating into "very old lineage traditions", partially triggered by the realisation that "imaginary gods and spirits or fictional characters ''do not'' seem to have the same effect as traditional ones".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inominandum.com/blog/post-chaos-magic-1st-in-a-series/|title = Post Chaos Magic: 1st in a series.|author = Miller, Jason|date = 2012|website = Strategic Sorcery Blog|access-date = June 13, 2018| ref = refMiller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hine has spoken of his disillusionment with the idea that all magic "can be formulated in terms of 'techniques' and that the theoretical underpinnings or cultural-historical context" do not matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...something you’ll sometimes see advocates of CM asserting is that singing [[rune]] charms and repeating [[Hindu]] [[mantras]] are essentially the same procedure – the focus being on the repetition of a word or phrase – in order to enter an altered state of consciousness. So mantras are something that gets chanted – and the chanting (i.e. the iteration) is what’s important – not the content or the context.

This, to me, is a kind of [[reductionism]]. It predicates a [[universalism|universal explanation]] – that the ‘technique’ of iterative speech is enacted in order to establish an [[altered state of consciousness]] in the practitioner – and subordinates all instances which apparently look as though that’s what’s going on – to it. So for an advocate of CM, there would be little practical difference between, say, chanting a [[rune]] poem, repeating the [[Gayatri]] mantra, or singing a [[sea shanty]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for "breathing new life" into Western occultism, thereby saving it from "being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality" – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of "initiatory knowledge": i.e., "teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated", present in all traditional schools of magic.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book | title = Advanced Magick for Beginners| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = Karnac Books| year = 2008| isbn = 9781904658412| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1lT7R6QD16oC | ref = refChapman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman has gone on to develop his own system, using the techniques of chaos magic to achieve the aims of [[Thelema]], such as attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]], or the Crossing of [[Abyss_(Thelema)|the Abyss]].&lt;ref name=Chapman2&gt;{{cite book | title = Three Steps to Heaven: How to Practice Magick| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = The Baptist's Head| year = 2009 | ref = refChapman2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon White, meanwhile, has developed a distinctive blend of chaos magic technique and [[animism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the western esoteric tradition can be said to have an underlying belief system it is a form of Animism; that the world or the universe is in some sense a living thing... However you conceive of their 'true' nature, magic requires full engagement with [[Fetishism|fetishes]] and sacred ground and window areas such as [[Crossroads_(mythology)|crossroads]]. It also works best when you grant agency to objects or entities beyond human consciousness, and particularly so with living systems... It is more useful for the magician to consider living systems not as some unaware little eddies in a universal consciousness field, but as 'outposts' of the spirit world.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Cirrus cloud thinning''' is a proposed form of [[climate engineering]]. [[Cirrus cloud]]s are high cold ice that, like other [[cloud]]s, both reflect [[sunlight]] and absorb warming [[infrared radiation]]. However, they differ from other types of clouds in that, on average, infrared absorption outweighs sunlight reflection, resulting in a net warming effect on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Joonsuk|last2=Yang|first2=Ping|last3=Dessler|first3=Andrew E.|last4=Gao|first4=Bo-Cai|last5=Platnick|first5=Steven|title=Distribution and Radiative Forcing of Tropical Thin Cirrus Clouds|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=December 2009|volume=66|issue=12|pages=3721–3731|doi=10.1175/2009JAS3183.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, thinning or removing these clouds would reduce their heat trapping capacity, resulting in a cooling effect on Earth's [[climate]]. This could be a potential tool to reduce [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=David L.|last2=Finnegan|first2=William|title=Modification of cirrus clouds to reduce global warming|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=2009|volume=4|issue=4|page=045102|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrus cloud thinning is an alternative category of climate engineering, in addition to [[solar radiation management]] and [[greenhouse gas removal]].

==Basic principles==

Typical cirrus clouds may be susceptible to modification to reduce their lifetime and [[Optical depth|optical thickness]], and hence their net positive [[radiative forcing]] (in contrast to the typical low, warm liquid clouds). Material to seed such modification could be delivered via [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] or by aircraft. Scientists believe that cirrus clouds in the high [[latitude]] upper [[troposphere]] are formed by homogeneous [[freezing]], resulting in large numbers of small [[ice crystals]]. If effective [[ice nuclei]] were introduced into this environment, the cirrus may instead form by heterogeneous freezing. If the concentration of ice nuclei is seeded such that the resulting cloud particle density is less than that for the natural case, the cloud particles should grow larger due to less water vapor competition and attain higher settling velocities. By seeding with [[aerosol]]s, ice crystals could grow rapidly and deplete water vapor, suppress nucleation and any growth of ice crystals by homogeneous nucleation. The net effect would be a reduced optical thickness and a reduced cloud lifetime, allowing more infrared radiation to be emitted at the top of the atmosphere, as the ice particles sediment out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=Trude|last2=Kristjánsson|first2=Jón Egill|last3=Muri|first3=Helene|last4=Pfeffer|first4=Melissa|last5=Barahona|first5=Donifan|last6=Nenes|first6=Athanasios|title=Cirrus cloud seeding has potential to cool climate|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|date=15 January 2013|volume=40|pages=178–182|doi=10.1029/2012GL054201|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40..178S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less upper tropospheric water vapor and infrared radiation in the atmosphere would consequently cool the climate.

[[Bismuth(III) iodide|Bismuth tri-iodide]] (BiI3) has been proposed as the seeding material, as it is effective as ice nuclei for temperatures colder than -10&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009"/&gt; non-toxic and relatively inexpensive compared to e.g. [[silver iodide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruppacher|first1=Hans R.|last2=Klett|first2=James D.|title=Microphysics of clouds and precipitation|date=1997|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-0-306-48100-0|edition=2nd rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seeding aerosols would need to be added regularly, as it would sediment out along with the large ice crystals.

== Current research ==

In contrast to solar radiation management techniques, which would be most effective during the day time at lower latitudes, cirrus cloud thinning would be most effective at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles, where the background concentrations of aerosol are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=T.|last2=Herger|first2=N.|title=Cirrus cloud susceptibility to the injection of ice nuclei in the upper troposphere|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2014|volume=119|issue=5|pages=2375–2389|doi=10.1002/2013JD020816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloud-aerosol-climate interactions important for cirrus cloud thinning are not well understood. Factors that related to the heterogeneous freezing process are uncertain, as ice growth kinetics are not well documented. Vertical velocities are essential for the activation of ice nuclei, but remain uncertain due to lack of observations. Heterogeneous freezing may already be common in cirrus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cziczo|first1=D. J.|last2=Froyd|first2=K. D.|last3=Hoose|first3=C.|last4=Jensen|first4=E.

There are significant uncertainties associated with not only ice nucleation processes in cirrus clouds and the fraction of nucleation that occurs via heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing, but also its representation in climate models. “Over-seeding” might lead to warming, as opposed to the desired cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storelvmo|first1=T.|last2=Kristjansson|first2=J.

The '''Committee on Standards in Public Life''' (CSPL) is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] of the United Kingdom Government, established in 1994 to advise the Prime Minister on ethical standards of public life.

==Organisation==

The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an independent advisory [[non-departmental public body]], with a secretariat and budget provided by the [[Cabinet Office]]. It is responsible for:&lt;ref name="About the committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about | title=Committee on Standards in Public Life/About | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* advising the Prime Minister on ethical issues relating to standards in public life
* conducting broad inquiries into standards of conduct
* making recommendations as to changes in present arrangements
* promoting the [[#The Seven Principles of Public life|7 principles of public life]].

The Committee does not investigate individual allegations of misconduct, that being the role of the relevant regulator.
 
The Committee is made up of the chair, five independent members appointed by the Prime Minister following open competition, and three political members appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the leaders of the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party.&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Membership | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the Committee members were [[Paul Bew|Lord Bew]] (Chair), The [[Lord Alderdice]], The Rt Hon [[Dame Margaret Beckett]] DBE MP, [[Sheila Drew Smith]] OBE, [[Patricia Moberly]], [[Richard Thomas (lawyer)|Richard Thomas]] CBE, and [[Dame Angela Watkinson]] DBE MP.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Members | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Committee was initially established in October 1994 by the Prime Minister, [[John Major]], in response to concerns that conduct by some politicians was unethical—-for example, during the [[cash-for-questions affair]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 terms of reference===
The Committee's original terms of reference were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04888.pdf House of Commons Library, ''Committee on Standards in Public Life'', SN/PC/04888, 11 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of [[public office]], including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life.}}

The term "public office" was defined to include [[minister (government)|ministers]], civil servants and advisers; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and UK Members of the [[European Parliament]];&lt;ref&gt;See {{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/31457667/Libero_mandato_e_compravendita_di_parlamentari_garanzie_e_patologia_delle_immunit%C3%A0 Giampiero Buonomo, ''Libero mandato e “compravendita” di parlamentari: garanzie e patologia delle immunità'', Questione giustizia, 16 febbraio 2017, p. 4/12].&lt;/ref&gt; Members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies and of national health service bodies; non-ministerial office holders; members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly funded functions; and elected members and senior officers of [[local authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). pp. 417–418.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First report, 1995 ===
The Committee's First Report&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1995). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 established ''The Seven Principles of Public Life'', also known as the "Nolan principles". They were:&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;
*'''[[Altruism|Selflessness]]''' – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.
*'''[[Integrity]]''' – Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.

*'''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]]''' – In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit and facts not on personal judgements
*'''[[Accountability]]''' – Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.
*'''[[Openness]]''' – Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.
*'''[[Honesty]]''' – Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.
*'''[[Leadership]]''' – Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.

===1997 terms of reference===
In November 1997, [[Tony Blair]] extended the Committee's terms of reference: "To review issues in relation to the funding of political parties, and to make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements."&lt;ref name="2011-14"&gt;Annual Report 2010–11 (2011). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 terms of reference===
On 5 February 2013, the Committee's terms of reference were clarified in two ways – (1): ‘…in future the Committee should not inquire into matters relating to the devolved legislatures and governments except with the agreement of those bodies’, and (2): ‘…the Committee’s remit to examine “standards of conduct of all holders of public office” [encompasses] all those involved in the delivery of public services, not solely those appointed or elected to public office.'&lt;ref name="Terms of reference"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/terms-of-reference | title=Terms of reference | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 clarification===
The terms of reference were further clarified on 28 February 2013 to explain that the Committee "can examine issues relating to the ethical standards of the delivery of public services by private and voluntary sector organisations, paid for by public funds, even where those delivering the services have not been appointed or elected to public office.”

==The Seven Principles of Public life==
The ''Seven Principles of Public Life'' have been amended over the years. They are currently (2015) worded as follows:&lt;ref name="2015 principles"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2 | title=The 7 principles of public life | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Altruism|Selflessness]]''' – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest.
*'''[[Integrity]]''' – Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.
*'''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]]''' – Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.
*'''[[Accountability]]''' – Holders of public office are accountable to the public for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.
*'''[[Openness]]''' – Holders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.
*'''[[Honesty]]''' – Holders of public office should be truthful
*'''[[Leadership]]''' – Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and be willing to challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious or mythological cosmology===
{{See also|Religious cosmology}}

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[Creation myth|creation]] and [[eschatology]].

===Philosophical cosmology===
{{See also|Cosmology (philosophy)}}

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C. L. |title=Genesis 1:26-7 As a statement of humanity's divine parentage |date=8 February 2010 |journal=The Journal of Theological Studies |pages=1–15 |volume=61 |issue=1 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jts/article/61/1/1/1673983 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

| [[Hindu cosmology]]
| [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BC)
| Cyclical or oscillating, Infinite in time
| One cycle of existence is around 311 trillion years and the life of one universe around 8 billion years. This Universal cycle is preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes. Includes an infinite number of universes at one given time.

|-
|  [[Jain cosmology]]
|  [[Jain Agamas]] (written around 500 AD as per the teachings of [[Mahavira]] 599–527 BC)
|  Cyclical or oscillating, eternal and finite 
|  Jain cosmology considers the ''[[loka]]'', or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to [[Jainism]], is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

|-
| [[Babylonian astronomy#Cosmology|Babylonian cosmology]]
| [[Assyro-Babylonian literature|Babylonian literature]] (c. 3000 BC)
| Flat earth floating in infinite "waters of chaos"
| The Earth and the [[Heaven]]s form a unit within infinite "waters of chaos"; the earth is flat and circular, and a solid dome (the "firmament") keeps out the outer "chaos"-ocean.
|-
| [[Eleatics|Eleatic cosmology]]
| [[Parmenides]] (c. 515 BC)
| Finite and spherical in extent
| The Universe is unchanging, uniform, perfect, necessary, timeless, and neither generated nor perishable. Void is impossible. Plurality and change are products of epistemic ignorance derived from sense experience. Temporal and spatial limits are arbitrary and relative to the Parmenidean whole.

|-
| [[Atomism|Atomist universe]]
| [[Anaxagoras]] (500–428&amp;nbsp;BC) &amp; later [[Epicurus]]
| Infinite in extent
| The universe contains only two things: an infinite number of tiny seeds ([[atom]]s) and the void of infinite extent. All atoms are made of the same substance, but differ in size and shape. Objects are formed from atom aggregations and decay back into atoms. Incorporates [[Leucippus]]' principle of [[causality]]: "nothing happens at random; everything happens out of reason and necessity". The universe was not ruled by [[gods]].{{citation needed|reason=Ancient Greeks typically believed that nothing was random *because* there were gods – for instance, when you elected a leader by drawing straws, the person 'randomly' elected leader was the one chosen by the gods!  The random selection was intended to minimize human influence on the outcome of the election, not to eliminate the influence of mount olympus – which would have been considered impossible, by typical Greek thinkers at least.  Perhaps Anaxagoras was atypical in *that* way, as well as atypical in believing in some primitive version of the atomic theory, but methinks not.|date=January 2013}}

| [[Philolaus]] (d. 390 BC)
| Existence of a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe.
| At the center of the Universe is a central fire, around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and [[planet]]s revolve uniformly. The Sun revolves around the central fire once a year, the stars are immobile. The earth in its motion maintains the same hidden face towards the central fire, hence it is never seen. First known non-geocentric model of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Carl B.

| [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian universe]]
| [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Geocentric]], static, steady state, finite extent, infinite time

| Aristarchean universe
| [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] (circa&amp;nbsp;280&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Heliocentric]]
| Earth rotates daily on its axis and revolves annually about the sun in a circular orbit. Sphere of fixed stars is centered about the sun.
|-
| [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]]
| [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD)
| Geocentric (based on Aristotelian universe)
| Universe orbits around a stationary Earth. Planets move in circular [[epicycles]], each having a center that moved in a larger circular orbit (called an eccentric or a deferent) around a center-point near Earth. The use of [[equant]]s added another level of complexity and allowed astronomers to predict the positions of the planets. The most successful universe model of all time, using the criterion of longevity. [[Almagest]] (the Great System).
|-
| Aryabhatan model
| [[Aryabhata]] (499)
| Geocentric or Heliocentric
| The [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] and the planets move in [[elliptical orbit]]s around either the Earth or Sun; uncertain whether the model is geocentric or heliocentric due to planetary orbits given with respect to both the Earth and Sun.
|-
| Medieval universe

| Finite in time
| A universe that is finite in time and has a beginning is proposed by the [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]], who argues against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Logical arguments supporting a finite universe are developed by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]] [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Saadia Gaon]], and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]] [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]].

| Various modifications to Ptolemaic model and Aristotelian universe, including rejection of [[equant]] and [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics]] at [[Maragheh observatory]], and introduction of [[Tusi-couple]] by [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Al-Tusi]]. Alternative models later proposed, including the first accurate [[Moon|lunar]] model by [[Ibn al-Shatir]], a model rejecting stationary Earth in favour of [[Earth's rotation]] by [[Ali Kuşçu]], and planetary model incorporating "circular [[inertia]]" by [[Al-Birjandi]].

| [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600)
| Infinite extent, infinite time, homogeneous, isotropic, non-hierarchical
| Rejects the idea of a hierarchical universe. Earth and Sun have no special properties in comparison with the other heavenly bodies. The void between the stars is filled with [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], and matter is composed of the same [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, and air), and is atomistic, animistic and intelligent.
|-
|Keplerian
| [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630)
| Heliocentric with elliptical planetary orbits

Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.

| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s

'''DNA banking''' is the secure, long term storage of an individual’s [[genetic material]]. [[DNA]] is most commonly extracted from [[blood]], but can also be obtained from [[saliva]] and other [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. DNA banks allow for conservation of genetic material and comparative analysis of an individual's genetic information. Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict [[genetic disorders]], as used in preventative genetics or [[gene therapy]], and prove that person's identity, as used in the [[criminal justice system]]. There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) and [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reactions]] (PCR).
 
==Uses==

DNA banking is used to conserve genetic material, especially that of organisms that face [[extinction]]. This is a more prominent issue today due to [[deforestation]] and [[climate change]], which serve as a threat to [[biodiversity]]. The genetic information can be stored within [[lambda phage]] and plasma vectors. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) DNA Bank, for example, collects the DNA of agricultural organisms, such as rice and fish, for scientific research. Most DNA provided by DNA banks is used for studies to attempt to develop more productive or more environmentally friendly agricultural species. Some DNA banks also store the DNA of rare or [[endangered species]] to ensure their survival.&lt;ref&gt;Meurant, Gerard (2012). Conservation of Plant Genes : Dna Banking and in Vitro Biotechnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA bank can be used to compare and analyze DNA samples. Comparison of DNA samples allowed scientists to work on the [[Human Genome Project]], which maps out many of the genes on human DNA. It has also led to the development of preventative genetics. Samples from the DNA bank have been used to identify patterns and determine which genes lead to specific disorders. Once people know which genes lead to disorders, people can take steps to lessen the effects of that disorder. This can occur through adjustments in lifestyle, as demonstrated in [[preventive healthcare]], or even through gene therapy. DNA can be banked at any time during a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banks were introduced to the criminal justice system in the 1980s. This system makes it possible to rule out or confirm the verdict of a suspect based on their personal genetic code. Once an individual’s DNA is stored, it remains in the system permanently; allowing law enforcement to identify and track criminals more easily. There is some controversy about this topic as some individuals believe the storage of citizen's DNA is an invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Krimsky, S., &amp; Simoncelli, T. (2011). Genetic justice: DNA data banks, criminal investigations, and civil liberties. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA banking capsules are also starting to be used for retaining the DNA of the deceased, a service offered by some funeral homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-dna-collection-after-death-20150814-story.html |date=23 August 2015 |author=Jessica Inman |title=DNA collection allows mourning to memorialize the dead |work=Orlando Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==

Scientists are capable of retrieving genetic information from [[hair]], [[skin]], blood, [[sperm]], tissue, and saliva as long as the sample contains intact DNA. [[Nucleotide sequences]] between humans differ by only 0.1%. Even so, this 0.1% includes approximately three million bases.  DNA can be analyzed through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The RFLP process was introduced in 1988. Restriction enzymes digest portions of the DNA, leaving short fragments. These fragments are sorted through gel [[electrophoresis]]. The gel demonstrates the length of the fragments allowing specialists to determine whether the fragments came from the same  person. PCR is more commonly used today because it more efficient and requires smaller samples of genetic samples. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

There are various organizations founded for the purpose of storing and analyzing DNA sample. For example, the [[UK Biobank]] contains DNA samples of 500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 when their samples were taken in the years 2006-2010 .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/what-happens-when-you-put-500000-peoples-dna-online/543747/|title=What Happens When You Put 500,000 People's DNA Online|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2017-11-06|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609184/uk-biobank-supercharges-medicine-with-gene-data-on-500000-brits/|title=UK Biobank supercharges medicine with gene data on 500,000 Brits|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=2017-11-15|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[machine learning]], particularly in the creation of [[artificial neural networks]], '''ensemble averaging''' is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Frequently an ensemble of models performs better than any individual model, because the various errors of the models "average out."

== Overview ==
Ensemble averaging is one of the simplest types of [[committee machine]]s. Along with [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], it is one of the two major types of static committee machines.&lt;ref name="haykin"&gt;Haykin, Simon. Neural networks : a comprehensive foundation. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River  N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to standard network design in which many networks are generated but only one is kept, ensemble averaging keeps the less satisfactory networks around, but with less weight.&lt;ref name="hashem"&gt;Hashem, S. "Optimal linear combinations of neural networks." Neural Networks 10, no. 4 (1997): 599&amp;ndash;614.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of ensemble averaging relies on two properties of artificial neural networks:&lt;ref name="naft"&gt;Naftaly, U., N. Intrator, and D. Horn. "Optimal ensemble averaging of neural networks." Network: Computation in Neural Systems 8, no. 3 (1997): 283&amp;ndash;296.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In any network, the bias can be reduced at the cost of increased variance
# In a group of networks, the variance can be reduced at no cost to bias

Ensemble averaging creates a group of networks, each with low bias and high variance, then combines them to a new network with (hopefully) low bias and low variance. It is thus a resolution of the [[bias-variance dilemma]].&lt;ref name="geman"&gt;Geman, S., E. Bienenstock, and R. Doursat. "Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma." Neural computation 4, no. 1 (1992): 1&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of combining experts has been traced back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemen, R. T. "Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography." International Journal of Forecasting 5, no. 4 (1989): 559&amp;ndash;583.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The theory mentioned above gives an obvious strategy: create a set of experts with low bias and high variance, and then average them. Generally, what this means is to create a set of experts with varying parameters; frequently, these are the initial synaptic weights, although other factors (such as the learning rate, momentum etc.) may be varied as well. Some authors recommend against varying weight decay and early stopping.&lt;ref name="naft" /&gt; The steps are therefore:
# Generate ''N'' experts, each with their own initial values. (Initial values are usually chosen randomly from a distribution.)
# Train each expert separately.
# Combine the experts and average their values.
Alternatively, [[domain knowledge]] may be used to generate several ''classes'' of experts. An expert from each class is trained, and then combined.

A more complex version of ensemble average views the final result not as a mere average of all the experts, but rather as a weighted sum. If each expert is &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the overall result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\alpha}) = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \alpha_j y_j(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of weights. The optimization problem of finding alpha is readily solved through neural networks, hence a "meta-network" where each "neuron" is in fact an entire neural network can be trained, and the synaptic weights of the final network is the weight applied to each expert. This is known as a ''linear combination of experts''.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

It can be seen that most forms of neural networks are some subset of a linear combination: the standard neural net (where only one expert is used) is simply a linear combination with all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = 0&lt;/math&gt; and one &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=1&lt;/math&gt;. A raw average is where all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal to some constant value, namely one over the total number of experts.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

A more recent ensemble averaging method is negative correlation learning,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Liu and X. Yao, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608099000738 Ensemble Learning via Negative Correlation] Neural Networks, Volume 12, Issue 10, December 1999, pp. 1399-1404. {{doi|10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by Y. Liu and X. Yao. Now this method has been widely used in [[evolutionary computing]].

== Benefits ==
* The resulting committee is almost always less complex than a single network which would achieve the same level of performance&lt;ref&gt;Pearlmutter, B. A., and R. Rosenfeld. "Chaitin&amp;ndash;Kolmogorov complexity and generalization in neural networks." In Proceedings of the 1990 conference on Advances in neural information processing systems 3, 931. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The resulting committee can be trained more easily on smaller input sets&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;
* The resulting committee often has improved performance over any single network&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;
* The risk of [[overfitting]] is lessened, as there are fewer parameters (weights) which need to be set&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;

The exact cover problem is a kind of [[constraint satisfaction problem]].

An exact cover problem can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]] or a [[bipartite graph]].

[[Knuth's Algorithm X]] is an [[algorithm]] that finds all solutions to an exact cover problem. DLX is the name given to Algorithm X when it is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

The standard exact cover problem can be generalized slightly to involve not only "exactly one" constraints but also "at-most-one" constraints.
 
Finding [[Pentomino]] tilings and solving [[Sudoku]] are noteworthy examples of exact cover problems.
The [[N queens problem]] is a slightly generalized exact cover problem.

== Formal definition ==

Given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of [[subset]]s of a set ''X'', an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies two conditions:
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]], i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; are [[pairwise disjoint]]. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at most one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; is ''X'', i.e., the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; [[cover (topology)|cover]] ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in ''at least one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

In short, an exact cover is "exact" in the sense that each element in ''X'' is contained in ''exactly one'' subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, an exact cover of ''X'' is a subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; that [[partition of a set|partitions]] ''X''.

For an exact cover of ''X'' to exist, it is necessary that:
* The union of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is ''X''. In other words, each element in ''X'' is contained in at least one subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[empty set]] ∅ is contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, then it makes no difference whether or not it is in any exact cover.
Thus it is typical to assume that:
* The empty set is not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one element.

=== Basic examples ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''N'', ''O'', ''P'', ''E''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} such that:
* ''N'' = { },
* ''O'' = {1, 3},
* ''P'' = {2, 3}, and
* ''E'' = {2, 4}.

The subcollection {''O'', ''E''} is an exact cover of ''X'', since the subsets ''O'' = {1, 3} and ''E'' = {2, 4} are disjoint and their union is ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The subcollection {''N'', ''O'', ''E''} is also an exact cover of ''X''.
Including the empty set ''N'' = { } makes no difference, as it is disjoint with all subsets and does not change the union.

The subcollection {''E'', ''P''} is not an exact cover of ''X''.
The intersection of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2}, is not empty:
The subsets ''E'' and ''P'' are not disjoint.
Moreover, the union of the subsets ''E'' and ''P'', {2, 3, 4}, is not ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4}:
Neither ''E'' nor ''P'' covers the element 1.

On the other hand, there is no exact cover—indeed, not even a cover—of ''Y'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} because &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {1, 2, 3, 4} is a proper subset of ''Y'':
None of the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains the element 5.

=== Detailed example ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets
of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Then the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element in ''X'' is contained in exactly one of the subsets:
* ''B'' = {1, 4};
* ''D'' = {3, 5, 6}; or
* ''F'' = {2, 7}.

Moreover, {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is the only exact cover, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because ''A'' and ''B'' are the only subsets containing 1, an exact cover must contain ''A'' or ''B'', but not both.
If an exact cover contains ''A'', then it doesn't contain ''B'', ''C'', ''E'', or ''F'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''A''.
Then ''D'' is the only remaining subset, but the collection {''A'', ''D''} doesn't cover the element 2.
In conclusion, there is no exact cover containing ''A''.
On the other hand, if an exact cover contains ''B'', then it doesn't contain ''A'' or ''C'', as each of these subsets has an element in common with ''B''.
Because ''D'' is the only remaining subset containing 5, ''D'' must be part of the exact cover.
If an exact cover contains ''D'', then it doesn't contain ''E'', as ''E'' has an element in common with ''D''.
Then ''F'' is the only remaining subset, and the collection {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is indeed an exact cover.
See the [[Knuth's Algorithm X#Example|example]] in the article on [[Knuth's Algorithm X]] for a matrix-based version of this argument.

== Representations ==

An exact cover problem is defined by the [[binary relation]] "contains" between subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and elements in ''X''.
There are different equivalent ways to represent this relation.

=== Standard representation ===

The standard way to represent the relation "contains" is to list the elements in each subset.

For example, the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above uses this standard representation:
* ''A'' = {1, 4, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''C'' = {4, 5, 7};
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;};
* ''E'' = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and
* &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt; = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;}.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

=== Inverse representation ===

The relation "contains" between subsets and elements can be [[converse relation|converted]], listing the subsets in which each element is contained. 

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by listing the subsets each element is contained in:
* 1 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 2 is an element of ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 3 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E'';
* 4 is an element of ''A'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''B''&lt;/span&gt;, ''C'';
* 5 is an element of ''C'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;;
* 6 is an element of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''D''&lt;/span&gt;, ''E''; and
* 7 is an element of ''A'', ''C'', ''E'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;.

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, as the highlighting makes clear.

When solving an exact cover problem, it is often useful to switch between the standard and inverse representations.
is an element of

=== Matrix and hypergraph representations ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by an [[incidence matrix]].  

The matrix includes one row for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and one column for each element in ''X''.
The entry in a particular row and column is 1 if the corresponding subset contains the corresponding element, and is 0 otherwise.
As each row represents the elements contained in the corresponding subset and each column represents the subsets containing the corresponding element, an incidence matrix effectively provides both the standard and inverse representations.

In the matrix representation, an exact cover is a selection of rows such that each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a 6×7 incidence matrix:&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] in his paper "Dancing Links" gives this example, as equation (3), only with the rows reordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., each column contains a 1 in exactly one selected row, as the highlighting makes clear.

In turn, the incidence matrix can be seen also as describing a [[hypergraph]].  The hypergraph includes one node for each element in ''X'' and one edge for each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;; each node is included in exactly one of the edges forming the cover.

=== Graph representation ===

The relation "contains" can be represented by a [[bipartite graph]].

The vertices of the graph are divided into two disjoint sets, one representing the subsets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and another representing the elements in ''X''.
If a subset contains an element, an edge connects the corresponding vertices in the graph.

In the graph representation, an exact cover is a selection of vertices corresponding to subsets such that each vertex corresponding to an element is connected to exactly one selected vertex.

For example, the relation "contains" in the [[#Detailed example|detailed example]] above can be represented by a bipartite graph with 6+7 = 13 vertices:

[[File:Exact-cover-bigraph-highlighted.svg|none|300px]]

Again, the subcollection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} is an exact cover, since each element is contained in exactly one selected subset, i.e., the vertex corresponding to each element in ''X'' is connected to exactly one selected vertex, as the highlighting makes clear.

== Equivalent problems ==

Although the canonical exact cover problem involves a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', the logic does not depend on the presence of subsets containing elements.
An "abstract exact cover problem" arises whenever there is a [[heterogeneous relation]] between two sets ''P'' and ''Q'' and the goal is to select a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' such that each element in ''Q'' is related to ''exactly one'' element in ''P*''.
In general, the elements of ''P'' represent choices and the elements of ''Q'' represent "exactly one" constraints on those choices.

More formally, given a binary relation ''R'' &lt;math&gt;\subseteq &lt;/math&gt; ''P'' × ''Q'' between sets ''P'' and ''Q'', one can call a subset ''P*'' of ''P'' an "abstract exact cover" of ''Q'' if each element in ''Q'' is ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;-related to exactly one element in ''P*''. Here ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[converse relation|converse]] of ''R''.

In general, ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''Q'' to ''P*'', which maps each element in ''Q'' to the unique element in ''P*'' that is ''R''-related to that element in ''Q''.
This function is [[onto]], unless ''P*'' contains the "empty set," i.e., an element which isn't ''R''-related to any element in ''Q''.

In the canonical exact cover problem, ''P'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''Q'' is the set ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "contains" between subsets and elements, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "is contained in" from elements to selected subsets.

== Exact hitting set ==

In [[mathematics]], given a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a set ''X'', an '''exact hitting set''' ''X*'' is a subset of ''X'' such that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains ''exactly one'' element in ''X*''. One says that each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; '''is hit by''' exactly one element in ''X*''.

In [[computer science]], the '''exact hitting set problem''' is a [[decision problem]] to find an exact hitting set or else determine none exists.

The exact hitting set problem is an abstract exact cover problem.
In the [[#Equivalent problems|notation above]], ''P'' is the set ''X'', ''Q'' is a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'', ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in" between elements and subsets, and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; restricted to ''Q'' × ''P*'' is the function "contains" from subsets to selected elements.

Whereas an exact cover problem involves selecting subsets and the relation "contains" from subsets to elements, an exact hitting set problem involves selecting elements and the relation "is contained in" from elements to subsets.
In a sense, an exact hitting set problem is the inverse of the exact cover problem involving the same set and collection of subsets.

=== Exact hitting set example ===

As in the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; = {''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that:
* ''A'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4, 7};
* ''B'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 4};
* ''C'' = {4, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 7};
* ''D'' = {3, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, 6};
* ''E'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 3, 6, 7}; and
* ''F'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, 7}.

Then ''X*'' = {1, 2, 5} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

Moreover, {1, 2, 5} is the only exact hitting set, as the following argument demonstrates:
Because 2 and 7 are the only elements that hit ''F'', an exact hitting set must contain 2 or 7, but not both.
If an exact hitting set contains 7, then it doesn't contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 7.
Then there are no more remaining elements, but {7} is not an exactly hitting set, as it doesn't hit ''B'' or ''D''.
In conclusion, there is no exact hitting set containing 7.
On the other hand, if an exact hitting set contains 2, then it doesn't contain 3, 6, or 7, as each of these elements are contained in some subset also containing 2.
Because 5 is the only remaining element that hits ''D'', the exact hitting set must contain 5.
If an exact hitting set contains 5, then it doesn't contain 4, as both hit ''C''.
Because 1 is the only remaining element that hits ''A'', the exact hitting set must contain 1.
Then there are no more remaining elements, and {1, 2, 5} is indeed an exact hitting set.

Although this example involves the same collection of subsets as the detailed exact cover example above, it is essentially a different problem. In a sense, the exact hitting set problem is the inverse (or transpose or converse) of the corresponding exact cover problem above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D'' !! ''E'' !! ''F''
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|-

|-
! &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
| 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0
|-
! 6
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
! 7
| 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1
|}

=== Dual example ===

But there is another exact hitting set problem that is essentially the same as the [[#Detailed example|detailed exact cover example]] above, in which numbered elements become subsets and lettered subsets become elements, effectively inverting the relation between subsets and element.

For example, as the subset ''B'' contains the elements 1 and 4 in the exact cover problem, the subsets ''I'' and ''IV'' contain the element ''b'' in the dual exact hitting set problem.

In particular, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; =  {''I'', ''II'', ''III'', ''IV'', ''V'', ''VI'', ''VII''} be a collection of subsets of a set ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f''} such that:
* ''I'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''II'' = {''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''III'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''IV'' = {''a'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''b''&lt;/span&gt;, ''c''}
* ''V'' = {''c'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;}
* ''VI'' = {&lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''d''&lt;/span&gt;, ''e''}
* ''VII'' = {''a'', ''c'', ''e'', &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;''f''&lt;/span&gt;}

Then ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} is an exact hitting set, since each subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains (is hit by) exactly one element in ''X*'', as the highlighting makes clear.

The exact hitting set ''X*'' = {''b'', ''d'', ''f''} here is essentially the same as the exact cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}^*&lt;/math&gt; = {''B'', ''D'', ''F''} above, as the matrix representation makes clear:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
! !! ''I'' !! ''II'' !! ''III'' !! ''IV'' !! ''V'' !! ''VI'' !! ''VII''
|-
! ''a''
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1

| &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; || 0 || 0 || 0

|}

== Finding solutions ==

[[Knuth's Algorithm X|Algorithm X]] is the name [[Donald Knuth]] gave for "the most obvious trial-and-error approach" for finding all solutions to the exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt; Technically, Algorithm X is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]], [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]], [[depth-first]], [[backtracking]] [[algorithm]].

When Algorithm X is implemented efficiently using [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[Dancing Links]] technique on a computer, Knuth calls it DLX. DLX uses the matrix representation of the problem, implemented as a series of [[doubly linked list]]s of the 1s of the matrix: each 1 element has a link to the next 1 above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself. (Technically, because the lists are circular, this forms a torus). Because exact cover problems tend to be sparse, this representation is usually much more efficient in both size and processing time required. DLX then uses the [[Dancing Links]] technique to quickly select permutations of rows as possible solutions and to efficiently backtrack (undo) mistaken guesses.&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;

== Generalizations ==

In a standard exact cover problem, each constraint must be satisfied exactly once.
It is a simple generalization to relax this requirement slightly and allow for the possibility that some "primary" constraints must be satisfied by ''exactly one'' selection but other "secondary" constraints can be satisfied by ''at most one'' selection.

As Knuth explains, a generalized exact cover problem can be converted to an equivalent exact cover problem by simply appending one row for each secondary column, containing a single 1 in that column.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth explains this simple generalization in his paper "Dancing Links," in particular, in explaining the tetrastick and [[N queens problem|N queens]] problems.&lt;/ref&gt; If in a particular candidate solution a particular secondary column is satisfied, then the added row isn't needed.
But if the secondary column isn't satisfied, as is allowed in the generalized problem but not the standard problem, then the added row can be selected to ensure the column is satisfied.

But Knuth goes on to explain that it is better working with the generalized problem directly, because the generalized algorithm is simpler and faster:
A simple change to his Algorithm X allows secondary columns to be handled directly.

The [[N queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem, as the constraints corresponding to the diagonals of the chessboard have a maximum rather than an exact queen count.

== Noteworthy examples ==

Due to its NP-completeness, any problem in NP can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to exact cover problems, which then can be solved with techniques such as Dancing Links.
However, for some well known problems, the reduction is particularly direct.
For instance, the problem of tiling a board with [[pentominoes]], and solving [[Sudoku]] can both be viewed as exact cover problems.

=== Pentomino tiling ===

{{main|Pentomino}}

The problem of tiling a 60-square board with the 12 different free [[pentominoes]] is an example of an exact cover problem, as [[Donald Knuth]] explains in his paper "Dancing links."&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{cite arxiv | author = [[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] | title = Dancing links | year = 2000 | eprint = cs/0011047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the problem of tiling with pentominoes an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed:

:{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18
|-
| 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28
|-
| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38
|-
| 41 || 42 || 43 ||    ||    || 46 || 47 || 48
|-
| 51 || 52 || 53 ||    ||    || 56 || 57 || 58
|-
| 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68
|-
| 71 || 72 || 73 || 74 || 75 || 76 || 77 || 78
|-
| 81 || 82 || 83 || 84 || 85 || 86 || 87 || 88
|}

The problem involves two kinds of constraints:
: '''Pentomino:''' For each of the 12 pentominoes, there is the constraint that it must be placed exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding pentominoes: F I L P N T U V W X Y Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Solomon W. | authorlink = Solomon W. Golomb |author2=Warren Lushbaugh | title = Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and Packings | edition = 2nd | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-691-02444-8 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''Square:''' For each of the 60 squares, there is the constraint that it must be covered by a pentomino exactly once. Name these constraints after the corresponding squares in the board: ''ij'', where ''i'' is the rank and ''j'' is the file.

Thus there are 12+60 = 72 constraints in all.

As both kinds of constraints are "exactly one" constraints, the problem is an exact cover problem.

The problem involves many choices, one for each way to place a pentomino on the board.
It is convenient to consider each choice as satisfying a set of 6 constraints: 1 constraint for the pentomino being placed and 5 constraints for the five squares where it is placed.

In the case of an 8×8 chessboard with the 4 central squares removed, there are 1568 such choices, for example:
* {F, 12, 13, 21, 22, 32}
* {F, 13, 14, 22, 23, 33}
* …
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {I, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
* …
* {L, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42}
* {L, 12, 22, 32, 42, 43}
* …

One of many solutions of this exact cover problem is the following set of 12 choices:
* {I, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
* {N, 16, 26, 27, 37, 47}
* {L, 17, 18, 28, 38, 48}
* {U, 21, 22, 31, 41, 42}
* {X, 23, 32, 33, 34, 43}
* {W, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46}
* {P, 51, 52, 53, 62, 63}
* {F, 56, 64, 65, 66, 75}
* {Z, 57, 58, 67, 76, 77}
* {T, 61, 71, 72, 73, 81}
* {V, 68, 78, 86, 87, 88}
* {Y, 74, 82, 83, 84, 85}

This set of choices corresponds to the following solution to the pentomino tiling problem:

[[File:Pentomino Puzzle Solution 8x8 Minus Center.svg|none|300px]]

A pentomino tiling problem is more naturally viewed as an exact cover problem than an exact hitting set problem, because it is more natural to view each choice as a set of constraints than each constraint as a set of choices.

Each choice relates to just 6 constraints, which are easy to enumerate. On the other hand, each constraint relates to many choices, which are harder to enumerate.

Whether viewed as an exact cover problem or an exact hitting set problem, the matrix representation is the same, having 1568 rows corresponding to choices and 72 columns corresponding to constraints.
Each row contains a single 1 in the column identifying the pentomino and five 1s in the columns identifying the squares covered by the pentomino.

Using the matrix, a computer can find all solutions relatively quickly, for example, using [[Dancing Links]].

=== Sudoku ===

{{pad|1.2em}}''Main articles: [[Sudoku]], [[Sudoku solving algorithms]]''

The problem in [[Sudoku]] is to assign numbers (or digits, values, symbols) to cells (or squares) in a grid so as to satisfy certain constraints.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints:
: '''Row-Column:'''  Each intersection of a row and column, i.e, each cell, must contain exactly one number.
: '''Row-Number:'''  Each row must contain each number exactly once
: '''Column-Number:'''  Each column must contain each number exactly once.
: '''Box-Number:'''  Each box must contain each number exactly once.

While the first constraint might seem trivial, it is nevertheless needed to ensure there is only one number per cell.  Intuitively, placing a number into a cell prohibits placing that number in any other cell sharing the same column, row, or box and also prohibits ''placing any other number'' into the now occupied cell.  

Solving Sudoku is an exact cover problem.

More precisely, solving Sudoku is an exact [[hitting set]] problem, which is equivalent to an exact cover problem, when viewed as a problem to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.
In the notation above for the (generalized) exact cover problem, ''X'' is the set of possibilities, ''Y'' is a set of constraint sets, and ''R'' is the binary relation "is contained in."

Each possible assignment of a particular number to a particular cell is a '''possibility''' (or candidate).
When Sudoku is played with pencil and paper, possibilities are often called pencil marks.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, in which each of 9×9 cells is assigned one of 9 numbers, there are 9×9×9=729 possibilities.
Using obvious notation for rows, columns and numbers, the possibilities can be labeled
: R1C1#1, R1C1#2, …, R9C9#9.

The fact that each kind of constraint involves exactly one of something is what makes Sudoku an exact hitting set problem.
The constraints can be represented by '''constraint sets'''.
The problem is to select possibilities such that each constraint set contains (i.e., is hit by) exactly one selected possibility.

In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints sets corresponding to the four kinds of constraints:

: '''Row-Column:''' A row-column constraint set contains all the possibilities for the intersection of a particular row and column, i.e., for a cell. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and column 1, which can be labeled R1C1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and column 1 but different numbers:
::  R1C1 = { R1C1#1, R1C1#2, R1C1#3, R1C1#4, R1C1#5, R1C1#6, R1C1#7, R1C1#8, R1C1#9 }.

: '''Row-Number:''' A row-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular row and number. For example, the constraint set for row 1 and number 1, which can be labeled R1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for row 1 and number 1 but different columns:
:: R1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R1C4#1, R1C5#1, R1C6#1, R1C7#1, R1C8#1, R1C9#1 }.

: '''Column-Number:''' A column-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular column and number. For example, the constraint set for column 1 and number 1, which can be labeled C1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for column 1 and number 1 but different rows:
:: C1#1 = { R1C1#1, R2C1#1, R3C1#1, R4C1#1, R5C1#1, R6C1#1, R7C1#1, R8C1#1, R9C1#1 }.

: '''Box-Number:''' A box-number constraint set contains all the possibilities for a particular box and number. For example, the constraint set for box 1 (in the upper lefthand corner) and number 1, which can be labeled B1#1, contains the 9 possibilities for the cells in box 1 and number 1:
:: B1#1 = { R1C1#1, R1C2#1, R1C3#1, R2C1#1, R2C2#1, R2C3#1, R3C1#1, R3C2#1, R3C3#1 }.

Since there are 9 rows, 9 columns, 9 boxes and 9 numbers, there are 9×9=81 row-column constraint sets, 9×9=81 row-number constraint sets,  9×9=81 column-number constraint sets,  and 9×9=81 box-number constraint sets: 81+81+81+81=324 constraint sets in all.

In brief, the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant is an exact hitting set problem with 729 possibilities and 324 constraint sets.
Thus the problem can be represented by a 729×324 matrix.

Although it is difficult to present the entire 729×324 matrix, the general nature of the matrix can be seen from several snapshots:

The [http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm complete 729×324 matrix] is available from Bob Hanson.

Note that the set of possibilities R''x''C''y''#''z'' can be arranged as a 9×9×9 cube in a 3-dimensional space with coordinates ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.
Then each row R''x'', column C''y'', or number #''z'' is a 9×9×1 "slice" of possibilities; each box B''w'' is a 9x3×3 "tube" of possibilities; each row-column constraint set R''x''C''y'', row-number constraint set R''x''#''z'', or column-number constraint set C''y''#''z'' is a 9x1×1 "strip" of possibilities; each box-number constraint set B''w''#''z'' is a 3x3×1 "square" of possibilities; and each possibility R''x''C''y''#''z'' is a 1x1×1 "cubie" consisting of a single possibility.
Moreover, each constraint set or possibility is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the component sets.
For example, R1C2#3 = R1 ∩ C2 ∩ #3, where ∩ denotes set intersection.

Although other Sudoku variations have different numbers of rows, columns, numbers and/or different kinds of constraints, they all involve possibilities and constraint sets, and thus can be seen as exact hitting set problems.

=== ''N'' queens problem ===
 {{main|N queens problem}}
 {{Expand section|date=July 2008}}

The [[N queens problem|''N'' queens problem]] is an example of a generalized exact cover problem.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; The problem involves four kinds of constraints:
: '''Rank:''' For each of the ''N'' ranks, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''File:''' For each of the ''N'' files, there must be exactly one queen.
: '''Diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 diagonals, there must be at most one queen.
: '''Reverse diagonals:''' For each of the 2''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 reverse diagonals, there must be at most one queen.

Note that the 2''N'' rank and file constraints form the primary constraints, while the 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 diagonal and reverse diagonals form the secondary constraints. Further, because each of first and last diagonal and reverse diagonals involves only one square on the chessboard, these can be omitted and thus one can reduce the number of secondary constraints to 4''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. The matrix for the ''N'' queens problem then has ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rows and 6''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6 columns, each row for a possible queen placement on each square on the chessboard, and each column for each constraint.

In [[paleontology]], a '''fern spike''' is the occurrence of abundant [[fern]] [[spore]]s in the [[fossil record]], usually immediately (in a [[Geologic time scale|geological]] sense) after an [[extinction event]].  The spikes are believed to represent a large, temporary increase in the number of ferns relative to other terrestrial [[plant]]s after the [[extinction]] or [[thinning]] of the latter, probably because fern [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is more rapid over large geographic areas, since single-celled fern spores are more easily distributed by the wind than are seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plants: Evolution and Diversity|author1=Ingrouille, M. |author2=Eddie, B. |page=163|isbn=113945546X|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fern spikes are most associated with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0963:CTCIAA&gt;2.3.CO;2 | last1 = Schultz | first1 = P.H. | last2 = D'Hondt | first2 = S. | year = 1996 | title = Cretaceous-Tertiary (Chicxulub) impact angle and its consequences | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/963 | journal = Geology | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 963–967 |bibcode = 1996Geo....24..963S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1064706 | last1 = Vajda | first1 = V. | last2 = Raine | first2 = J.I. | last3 = Hollis | first3 = C.J. | year = 2001 | title = Indication of global deforestation at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary by New Zealand fern spike | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5547/1700 | journal = Science | volume = 294 | issue = 5547| pages = 1700–1702 | pmid = 11721051 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.1700V }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have been found at other events such as at the [[Triassic]]-[[Jurassic]] boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-1951(93)90359-R | last1 = Fowell | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Olsen | first2 = P.E. | year = 1993 | title = Time calibration of Triassic-Jurassic microfloral turnover, eastern North-America | url = | journal = [[Tectonophysics (journal)|Tectonophysics]] | volume = 222 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–369 |bibcode = 1993Tectp.222..361F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1065522 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3588">The '''Friedrich Loeffler Institute''' (FLI), is the National Institute for [[Animal Health]] of [[Germany]]. The institute was founded in 1910 and named for its founder [[Friedrich Loeffler]] in 1952. The FLI is situated on the Isle of [[Riems]], which belongs to the City of [[Greifswald]]. Riems is a very small island that can be reached via a dam, which can be closed off in case of an outbreak. Due to these circumstances, Riems posed the perfect location for one of the most modern animal health research facilities in the world.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute is directly subordinated to the German [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany)|Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]]. Its main subject is the thorough study of livestock health and other closely related subjects including molecular biology, virus diagnostics, immunology, and epidemiology. Federal laws of Germany hold the FLI responsible for national and international animal disease control; it also poses the international reference lab for several viral diseases. The institute publishes its research, and cooperates with other national and international institutions and researchers.

Among the animal diseases under research are for instance [[foot and mouth disease]], [[mad cow disease]], and [[avian influenza]].

Currently, 330 people work for the FLI, and an additional 140 will be employed upon completion of the construction work. Until 2010, the 100th anniversary of the Institute, the FLI is expected to be the most up-to-date animal health research center in Europe. 260 Million [[Euro]]s are spent by the Federal Government to build new laboratories and barns.

As part of this extension, in 2010 the Riems Institute completed [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety level 4]] laboratory facilities, which enable research activities on the most dangerous of viruses -- one of four such facilities in Germany.

==Organisation==
The FLI's president is Thomas C. Mettenleiter, who also teaches at the nearby [[University of Greifswald]]. The FLI consists of the following eleven institutions at seven different locations, some of which are to be relocated to Riems by 2010:

* [[Riems]]:
** Institute of Infectology (IMED)
** Institute of Molecular Virology and Cell Biology (IMVZ)
** Institute of Diagnostic Virology (IVD)
** Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases (INNT)
** Institute of Immunology (IfI)
*[[Braunschweig]]
** Institute for Animal Food
*[[Celle]]:
** Institute for Animal Protection and Animal Husbandry
* [[Jena]]:
** Institute for Bacterial Infections and Zoonoses (IBIZ)
** Institute for Molecular Pathogenesis (IMP).
*[[Mariensee (Neustadt am Rübenberge)|Mariensee]]
**Institute for Farm Animal Genetics
* [[Tübingen]]:
** Institute of Immunology - this lab was closed in 2011
* [[Wusterhausen/Dosse|Wusterhausen]]:
** Institute for Epidemiology (IfE)

'''GenMAPP''' (Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler) is a free, [[open-source software|open-source]] [[bioinformatics]] software tool designed to visualize and analyze [[genomic]] data in the context of pathways ([[metabolic pathways|metabolic]], [[Cell signaling networks|signaling]]), connecting gene-level datasets to biological processes and disease. First created in 2000, GenMAPP is developed by an open-source team based in an academic research laboratory. GenMAPP maintains databases of gene identifiers and collections of pathway maps in addition to visualization and analysis tools.  Together with other public resources, GenMAPP aims to provide the research community with tools to gain insight into biology through the integration of data types ranging from genes to proteins to pathways to disease.

==History==

GenMAPP was first created in 2000 as a prototype software tool in the laboratory of [http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/conklin/ Bruce Conklin] at the [http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu J. David Gladstone Institutes] in [[San Francisco]] and continues to be developed in the same non-profit, academic research environment. The first release version of GenMAPP 1.0 was available in 2002 [1], supporting analysis of [[DNA microarray]] data from [[homo sapiens|human]], [[mus musculus|mouse]], [[rattus norvegicus|rat]] and [[saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]]. In 2004, GenMAPP 2.0 was released, combining the previously accessory programs MAPPFinder [2] and MAPPBuilder, and expanding support to additional species. GenMAPP 2.1 was released in 2006 with new visualization features and support for a total of eleven species.

==Usage==

GenMAPP was developed by biologists and is focused on pathway visualization for bench biologists. Unlike many other computational [[systems biology]] tools, GenMAPP is not designed for cell/systems modeling; it focuses on the immediate needs of bench biologists by enabling them to rapidly interpret [[genomic]] data with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.
GenMAPP is implemented in [[Visual Basic]] 6.0 and is available as a stand-alone application for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, including [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] or [[Parallels Workstation]] on a Mac. The program is freely available for [http://www.genmapp.org/login/loginerror.php?ReferPage=/download-genmapp2.php download] and includes an automatic update feature that allows rapid and reliable distribution of updates to the program and documentation.

==Content and Features==

GenMAPP builds and maintains gene databases for a variety of key [[model organism]]s:

* human - ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
* mouse - ''[[Mus musculus]]''
* rat - ''[[Rattus norvegicus]]''
* yeast - ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''
* zebrafish - ''[[Danio rerio]]''
* worm - ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''
* fruit fly - ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''
* dog - ''[[Canis familiaris]]''
* cow - ''[[Bos taurus]]''
* mosquito - ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''
* ''E.coli'' - ''[[Escherichia coli]]''
&lt;br /&gt;
GenMAPP provides tools to create, edit and annotate biological pathway maps.
[[Image:GenMAPP MAPP2.jpg|left]]{{clear}}
GenMAPP allows users to visualize and analyze their data in the context of pathway collections and the [[Gene Ontology]].

Pathways and associated data can be exported for the web as HTML.  See examples:

The law and algorithm were introduced in a semi-tutorial by Srinivas M. Aji and [[Robert McEliece|Robert J. McEliece]] with the same title.&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

==Introduction==

''"The distributive law in mathematics is the law relating the operations of multiplication and addition, stated symbolically, &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the monomial factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is distributed, or separately applied, to each term of the binomial factor &lt;math&gt; b + c &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the product &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;"'' -  Britannica&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=distributive law|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166204/distributive-law|work=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it can be observed from the definition, application of distributive law to an arithmetic expression reduces the number of operations in it. In the previous example the total number of operations reduced from three (two multiplications and an addition in &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;) to two (one multiplication and one addition in &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) &lt;/math&gt;). Generalization of distributive law leads to a large family of [[fast algorithms]]. This includes the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[Viterbi algorithm]].

This is explained in a more formal way in the example below:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum \limits_{c,d,e \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b) \, g(a, \, d, \, e) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued functions, &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d,e \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|A|=q&lt;/math&gt; (say)

Here we are "marginalizing out" the independent variables (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) to obtain the result. When we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that for each &lt;math&gt;q^{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; terms due to the triplet &lt;math&gt;(c,d,e)&lt;/math&gt; which needs to take part in the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; with each step having one addition and one multiplication. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;2\cdot q^2 \cdot q^3 = 2q^5&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of the above function is &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we apply the distributive law to the RHS of the equation, we get the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}   \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b ) \cdot \sum _{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\,d,\,e) &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt; can be described as a product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{1}(a,b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\, d, \,e )&lt;/math&gt;

Now, when we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; additions in &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; each and there are &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications when we are using the product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;q^3 + q^3 + q^2 = 2q^3 + q^2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of calculating &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;O(n^{5})&lt;/math&gt;.  This shows by an example that applying distributive law reduces the computational complexity which is one of the good features of a "fast algorithm".

==History==

Some of the problems that used distributive law to solve can be grouped as follows

1. Decoding algorithms&lt;br&gt;
A GDL like algorithm was used by Gallager's for decoding low density parity-check codes. Based on Gallager's work Tanner introduced the [[Tanner graph]] and expressed Gallagers work in message passing form. The tanners graph also helped explain the  [[Viterbi algorithm]].

It is observed by Forney that Viterbi's maximum likelihood decoding of [[convolutional codes]] also used algorithms of GDL-like generality.

2. [[Forward-backward algorithm]]&lt;br&gt;
The forward backward algorithm helped as an algorithm for tracking the states in the [[markov chain]]. And this also was used the algorithm of GDL like generality

3. [[Artificial intelligence]]&lt;br&gt;
The notion of [[junction tree]]s has been used to solve many problems in AI. Also the concept of [[bucket elimination]] used many of the concepts.

==The MPF problem==

'''MPF or marginalize a product function''' is a general computational problem which as special case includes many classical problems such as computation of discrete [[Hadamard transform]], [[maximum likelihood decoding]] of a [[linear code]] over a memory-less [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[matrix chain multiplication]]. The power of the GDL lies in the fact that it applies to situations in which additions and multiplications are generalized.
A [[commutative semiring]] is a good framework for explaining this behavior. It is defined over a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with operators "&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;.&lt;/math&gt;" where &lt;math&gt;(K,\, +)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(K,\, .)&lt;/math&gt; are a [[commutative monoid]]s and the distributive law holds.

Let &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_1 \in A_1, \ldots, p_n \in A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set and &lt;math&gt;|A_i| = q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;i = 1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;S = \{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \, \subset \{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let
&lt;math&gt; A_{S}  = A_{i_1} \times \cdots \times A_{i_r} &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; p_{S} = (p_{i_1},\ldots, p_{i_r})&lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; q_{S} = |A_{S}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A  = A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p = \{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{S_{j}\}_{j=1}^M &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_{j} \subset \{1, ...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a function is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[commutative semiring]]. Also, &lt;math&gt; p_{S_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; are named the ''local domains'' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''local kernels''.

Now the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta : \mathbf A \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as :
&lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{1}, ...\,, p_{n}) = \prod_{i=1}^M \alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

''Definition of MPF problem'': For one or more indices &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ...\,, M&lt;/math&gt;, compute a table of the values of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;-''marginalization'' of the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}:A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}(p_{S_{i}}) \, = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_{S_{i}^c} \in A_{S_{i}^c}} \beta(p)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{i}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \{1,...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_i(p_{S_i})&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; ''objective function'', or the ''objective function'' at &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. It can observed that the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function in the obvious way needs &lt;math&gt;Mq_1 q_2 q_3\cdots q_{n}&lt;/math&gt; operations. This is because there are &lt;math&gt;q_1 q_2\cdots q_n&lt;/math&gt; additions and &lt;math&gt;(M-1)q_1 q_2...q_n&lt;/math&gt; multiplications needed in the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function. The GDL algorithm which is explained in the next section can reduce this computational complexity.

The following is an example of the MPF problem. 
Let &lt;math&gt;p_{1},\,p_{2},\,p_{3},\,p_{4},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5}&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_{1} \in A_{1}, p_{2} \in A_{2}, p_{3} \in A_{3}, p_{4} \in A_{4}, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5} \in A_{5}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;M=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{\{1,2,5\},\{2,4\},\{1,4\}, \{2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The given functions using these variables are &lt;math&gt;f(p_{1},p_{2},p_{5})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(p_{3},p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and we need to calculate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, \, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha(p_1, \, p_4) =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_2 \in A_2,\, p_3 \in A_3, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1,\, p_2,\, p_5 ) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{2}) = \sum\limits_{p_1 \in A_1,\, p_3 \in A_3,\, p_4 \in A_4, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1, \, p_2, \, p_5) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4) &lt;/math&gt;

Here local domains and local kernels are defined as follows: 
{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(f(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_{2}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;g(p_{2}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;3^{rd}&lt;/math&gt; objective function and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;4^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function.

Let us consider another example where &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4},r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4} \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is a real valued function. Now, we shall consider the MPF problem where the commutative semiring is defined as the set of real numbers with ordinary addition and multiplication and the local domains and local kernels are defined as follows:

{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;f(r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_1, r_1\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_1 r_1}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_2, r_2\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_2 r_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_3, r_3\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_3 r_3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_4, r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_4 r_4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2, p_3, p_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now since the global kernel is defined as the product of the local kernels, it is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4, r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4) = f(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}&lt;/math&gt;

and the objective function at the local domain &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4) = \displaystyle\sum \limits_{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4} f(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4) \cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can see that the computation of [[Hadamard transform]] is a special case of the MPF problem. More examples can be demonstrated to prove that the MPF problem forms special cases of many classical problem as explained above whose details can be found at&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

== GDL: an algorithm for solving the MPF problem ==

If one can find a relationship among the elements of a given set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then one can solve the MPF problem basing on the notion of [[belief propagation]] which is a special use of "message passing" technique. The required relationship is that the given set of local domains can be organised into a [[junction tree]]. In other words, we create a graph theoretic tree with the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the vertices of the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any two arbitrary vertices say &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; and there exists an edge between these two vertices, then the intersection of corresponding labels, viz &lt;math&gt;S_{i}\cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, is a subset of the label on each vertex on the unique path from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example,

Example 1: Consider the following nine local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above given set of local domains, one can organize them into a junction tree as shown below:

[[File:An example of a junction tree on a given set.png|center|An example of a junction of tree]]

Similarly If another set like the following is given

Example 2: Consider the following four local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then constructing the tree only with these local domains is not possible since this set of values has no common domains which can be placed between any two values of the above set. But however if add the two dummy domains as shown below then organizing the updated set into a junction tree would be possible and easy too.

5.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{1},p_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{2},p_{3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for these set of domains, the junction tree looks like shown below:
[[File:Example of junction tree.png|center|Another example of a junction tree]]

===Generalized distributive law (GDL) algorithm===
Input: A set of local domains.&lt;br /&gt;
Output: For the given set of domains, possible minimum number of operations that is required to solve the problem is computed. &lt;br /&gt;
So, if &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge in the junction tree, then a message from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a set/table of values given by a function: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;A_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. To begin with all the functions i.e. for all combinations of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the given tree, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be identically &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and when a particular message is update, it follows the equation given below.

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}(p_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}})&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p_{S_{i}\setminus S_{j}}\in A_{S_{i} \setminus S_{j}}} \alpha _{i} (p_{S_{i}}) \prod_{{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i},{k \neq j}} \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(1)
 &lt;/math&gt;
    
where &lt;math&gt;v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;v_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is an adjacent vertex to &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; in tree.

Similarly each vertex has a state which is defined as a table containing the values from the function &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt;, Just like how messages initialize to 1 identically, state of &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be local kernel &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;, but whenever &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}&lt;/math&gt; gets updated, it follows the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i})  =   \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Basic working of the algorithm===
For the given set of local domains as input, we find out if we can create a junction tree, either by using the set directly or by adding dummy domains to the set first and then creating the junction tree, if construction junction is not possible then algorithm output that there is no way to reduce the number of steps to compute the given equation problem, but once we have junction tree, algorithm will have to schedule messages and compute states, by doing these we can know where steps can be reduced, hence will be discusses this below.

== Scheduling of the message passing and the state computation ==

There are two special cases we are going to talk about here namely ''Single Vertex Problem'' in which the objective function is computed at only one vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{0}&lt;/math&gt;  and the second one is ''All Vertices Problem'' where the goal is to compute the objective function at all vertices.

Lets begin with the '''single-vertex problem''', GDL will start by directing each edge towards the targeted vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. Here messages are sent only in the direction towards the targeted vertex. Note that all the directed messages are sent only once. The messages are started from the leaf nodes(where the degree is 1) go up towards the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The message travels from the leaves to its parents and then from there to their parents and so on until it reaches the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; will compute its state only when it receives all messages from all its neighbors. Once we have the state, We have got the answer and hence the algorithm terminates.

For Example, Lets consider a junction tree constructed from the set of local domains given above i.e. the set from example 1, &lt;br /&gt;Now the Scheduling table for these domains is (where the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\text{Round                      Message or State Computation} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \alpha_{8}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \Sigma_{p_{2}} \alpha_{9}(p_{2},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3.\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) = \alpha_{5}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4.\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{6}(p_{1},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5.\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) = \alpha_{7}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6.\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{4}(p_{3},p_{4}).\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}).\mu_{9,4}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7.\mu_{3,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{1}} \alpha_{3}(p_{2},p_{1}).\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}).\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8.\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{3}} \alpha_{2}(p_{3},p_{2}).\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}).\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;9.\sigma_{1}(p_{2}) = \alpha_{1}(p_{2}).\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}).\mu_{3,1}(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the complexity for Single Vertex GDL can be shown as

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt;  arithmetic operations&lt;br /&gt;
Where (Note: The explanation for the above equation is explained later in the article )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. number of vertices adjacent to v).

To solve the '''All-Vertices''' problem, we can schedule GDL in several ways, some of them are parallel implementation where in each round, every state is updated and every message is computed and transmitted at the same time. In this type of implementation the states and messages will stabilizes after number of rounds that is at most equal to the diameter of the tree. At this point all the all states of the vertices will be equal to the desired objective function.

Another way to schedule GDL for this problem is serial implementation where its similar to the  Single vertex problem except that we don't stop the algorithm until all the vertices of a required set have not got all the messages from all their neighbors and have compute their state. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the number of arithmetic this implementation requires is at most &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v \in V} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations.

==Constructing a junction tree==

The key to constructing a junction tree lies in the local domain graph &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a weighted complete graph with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots ,v_M&lt;/math&gt; i.e. one for each local domain, having the weight of the edge  &lt;math&gt;e_{i,j} : v_i \leftrightarrow v_j&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\omega_{i,j} = |S_{i} \cap S_{j}|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;x_{k} \in S_{i} \cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, then we say &lt;math&gt;x_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in&lt;math&gt;e_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;. Denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (the weight of a maximal-weight spanning tree of &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^{*} = \Sigma ^M_{i=1}|S_{i}| - n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of elements in that set. For more clarity and details, please refer to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085443/http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }} The Junction Tree Algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~cs691t/SS02/lectures/week7.PDF The Junction Tree Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;'T'&lt;/math&gt; be a junction tree with vertex set &lt;math&gt;'V'&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt;. In this algorithm, the messages are sent in both the direction on any edge, so we can say/regard the edge set E as set of ordered pairs of vertices. For example, from Figure 1 &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows

: &lt;math&gt;E = \{(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(4,2),(2,4),(5,2),(2,5),(6,3),(3,6),(7,3),(3,7),(8,4),(4,8),(9,4),(4,9)\}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; above gives you all the possible directions that a message can travel in the tree.

The schedule for the GDL is defined as a finite sequence of subsets of&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Which is generally represented by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;E_{1},E_{2},E_{3},\ldots, E_{N}&lt;/math&gt;}, Where &lt;math&gt;E_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of messages updated during the &lt;math&gt;N^{th}&lt;/math&gt; round of running the algorithm.

Having defined/seen some notations, we will see want the theorem says,
When we are given a schedule &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\{ E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots, E_N\}&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding [[Trellis (graph)|message trellis]] as a finite directed graph with Vertex set of  &lt;math&gt;V \times \{0,1,2,3,\ldots, N\}&lt;/math&gt;, in which a typical element is denoted by &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;t \in \{0,1,2,3,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, Then after completion of the message passing, state at  vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; will be the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective defined in

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i}) = \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_{k}\cap S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;nowiki&gt;iff&lt;/nowiki&gt; there is a path from &lt;math&gt;v_i(0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_j(N)&lt;/math&gt;

== Computational complexity ==

Here we try to explain the complexity of solving the MPF problem in terms of the number of mathematical operations required for the calculation. i.e. We compare the number of operations required when calculated using the normal method (Here by normal method we mean by methods that do not use message passing or junction trees in short methods that do not use the concepts of GDL)and the number of operations using the generalized distributive law.

Example: Let us consider the simplest case where we need to compute the following expression &lt;math&gt;ab+ac&lt;/math&gt;.

To evaluate this expression naively requires two multiplications and one addition. The expression when expressed using the distributive law can be written as &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)&lt;/math&gt; a simple optimization that reduces the number of operations to one addition and one multiplication.

Similar to the above explained example we will be expressing the equations in different forms to perform as few operation as possible by applying the GDL.

As explained in the previous sections we solve the problem by using the concept of the junction trees. The optimization obtained by the use of these trees is comparable to the optimization obtained by solving a semi group problem on trees. For example, to find the minimum of a group of numbers we can observe that if we have a tree and the elements are all at the bottom of the tree, then we can compare the minimum of two items in parallel and the resultant minimum will be written to the parent. When this process is propagated up the tree the minimum of the group of elements will be found at the root.

The following is the complexity for solving the junction tree using message passing

We rewrite the formula used earlier to the following form. This is the eqn for a message to be sent from vertex ''v'' to ''w''

: &lt;math&gt;\mu _{v,w} (p_{v \cap w}) =  \sum _{p _{v \setminus w} \in A _{S(v) \setminus S(w)}} \alpha _{v} (p _{v})  \prod _{u adj v _{u \neq v}} \mu _{u,v} (p _{u \cap v})&lt;/math&gt;            ----message equation
 
Similarly we rewrite the equation for calculating the state of vertex v as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v(p_v) =  \alpha_v (p_v) \prod_{u \operatorname{adj} v} \mu _{v,w} (p _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

We first will analyze for the single-vertex problem and assume the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have one edge from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v _{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Suppose we have an edge &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; we calculate the message using the message equation. To calculate &lt;math&gt;p _{u \cap v}&lt;/math&gt; requires

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} (d(v)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

(We represent the &lt;math&gt;|A _{S(v) \ S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;q _{v \setminus w}&lt;/math&gt;.)

But there will be many possibilities for &lt;math&gt;x _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; q _{v \cap w} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} | A _{S(v) \cap S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; possibilities for &lt;math&gt;p _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the entire message will need

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w})(q _{v \setminus w} -1)  = q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w}) q _{v \setminus w}. (d(v) -1) = (d(v) -1) q _v&lt;/math&gt;
multiplications

The total number of arithmetic operations required to send a message towards &lt;math&gt;v_0 &lt;/math&gt;along the edges of tree will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum _{ v \neq v0} (q_v - q _{v \cap w})&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{ v \neq v0}  (d(v) - 1) q_v&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

Once all the messages have been transmitted the algorithm terminates with the computation of state at &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;  The state computation requires &lt;math&gt;d(v_0) q _0&lt;/math&gt; more multiplications.
Thus number of calculations required to calculate the state is given as below

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (d(v) -1) q _{v} + d(v _{0})q _{v _{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications

Thus the grand total of the number of calculations is

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (T) = \sum _{v \in V} d(v)q _{v} - \sum _{e \in E} q _{e}&lt;/math&gt; ----&lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; is an edge and its size is defined by &lt;math&gt;q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above gives us the upper bound.

If we define the complexity of the edge &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (e) = q _{v} + q _{w} - q _{v \cap w} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(T) = \sum _{e \in E} \chi (e)&lt;/math&gt;

We now calculate the edge complexity for the problem defined in Figure 1 as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,2) = q_2 + q_2 q_3 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,4) = q_3 q_4 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,5) = q_3 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,8) = q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,9) = q_2 q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,3) = q _2 + q_2 q_1 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,7) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 - q_1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,6) = q_1 q _4 + q _1 q_2 - q _1&lt;/math&gt;

The total complexity will be &lt;math&gt; 3 q _{2}q _{3} + 3q _{3}q _{4}+ 3 q _{1}q _{2}+q _{2}q _{4} + q _{1}q _{4} - q _{1} - q _{3} - q _{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is considerably low compared to the direct method. (Here by direct method we mean by methods that do not use message passing. The time taken using the direct method will be the equivalent to calculating message at each node and time to calculate the state of each of the nodes.)

Now we consider the all-vertex problem where the message will have to be sent in both the directions and state must be computed at both the vertexes. This would take &lt;math&gt; O( \sum _{v} d(v) d(v) q _{v}) &lt;/math&gt; but by precomputing we can reduce the number of multiplications to &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the vertex. Ex : If there is a set &lt;math&gt;(a _{1}, \ldots ,a _{d})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; numbers. It is possible to compute all the d products of &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt; a _{i}&lt;/math&gt; with at most &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications rather than the obvious &lt;math&gt; d(d-2) &lt;/math&gt;. 
We do this by precomputing the quantities 
&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_1, b_2= b_1 \cdot a_2 = a_1 \cdot a _2, b _{d-1} = b _{d-2} \cdot a_{d-1} = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_d = a_d, c_{d-1} = a_{d-1} c_d = a _{d-1} \cdot a_d, \ldots , c_2 = a _2 \cdot c_3 = a _2 a_3 \cdots a_d&lt;/math&gt; this takes &lt;math&gt; 2 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications. Then if &lt;math&gt; m_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the product of all &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt; a_j&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; m_1 = c_2, m_2 = b_1 \cdot c_3&lt;/math&gt; and so on will need another &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications making the total &lt;math&gt; 3 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt;

There is not much we can do when it comes to the construction of the junction tree except that we may have many maximal weight spanning tree and we should choose the spanning tree with the least &lt;math&gt;\chi(T)&lt;/math&gt; and sometimes this might mean adding a local domain to lower the junction tree complexity.

It may seem that GDL is correct only when the local domains can be expressed as a junction tree. But even in cases where there are cycles and a number of iterations the messages will approximately be equal to the objective function. The experiments on Gallager–Tanner–Wiberg algorithm for low density parity-check codes were supportive of this claim.

'''Geoarchaeology''' is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses the techniques and subject matter of [[geography]], [[geology]] and other [[Earth science]]s to examine topics which inform [[archaeology|archaeological]] knowledge and thought. Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect [[archaeological site]]s such as [[geomorphology]], the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] post-deposition. Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying [[soil]] and [[sediments]] as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and  [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index422.html Ghilardi, M. and Desruelles, S. (2008) “Geoarchaeology: where human, social and earth sciences meet with technology”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoarchaeology is  important to society because it  informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediments and the rocks on  the buried sites and artifacts they're researching on. By doing this we are able locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how  "prehistoric" they really are.

==Techniques used in geoarchaeology==

===Column sampling===
Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a [[archaeological section|section]] for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset  and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions.

===Loss on ignition testing===
Loss on ignition testing for [[soil]] [[Soil organic matter|organic]] content.- a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's [[archaeological horizon|horizons]] may not be visible in [[archaeological section|section]] and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an areas potential for [[prehistoric]] surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.

[[Image:Columns.002.png|thumb|right|offset column sampling of the soil profile]]

===Magnetic susceptibility analysis===
The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:
* Site prospection, to identify areas of archaeological potential prior to excavation.
* Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enhancement of magnetic susceptibility of soils on archaeological sites. |journal= Archaeometry |volume=13  |year=1971 |pages=209–219 |author1=Tite, M.S. |author2=Mullins, C. |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1971.tb00043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging).

The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:
* Identify buried soils in depositional sequences.
* Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments etc.

===Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry===
Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62&amp;nbsp;kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650g of PO4,(500g-80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and ‘fixed’, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg PO4 ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn’t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different ‘pools’ in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.
	
Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the ‘molybdate blue’ reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart.

Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape.

===Particle size analysis===
The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the [[stratum|strata]] or [[sediment]] were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as [[till]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]]s, sometimes coarser [[silt]]s) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, [[clay]]s). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.

The results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.

The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples.

===Trace element geochemistry===
Trace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material.

Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to "fingerprint" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.

===Clay mineralogy analysis===
Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Druca, I. C. and Q. H. J. Gwynb (1997), From Clay to Pots: A Petrographical Analysis of Ceramic Production in the Callejón de Huaylas, North-Central Andes, Peru, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', ''25'', 707-718.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ostracod analysis===
Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity  and pH due to human activities.  Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities.  This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnesr.com/images/Bayman_et_al._2004.pdf ^ Manuel R. Palacios-Fest, “Nonmarine ostracode shell chemistry from ancient hohokam irrigation canals in central Arizona: A paleohydrochemical tool for the interpretation of prehistoric human occupation in the North American Southwest” ''Geoarchaeology'', Volume 9 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 29, Published Online: 9 Jan 2007 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological geology==

'''Archaeological geology''' is a term coined by [[Werner Kasig]] in 1980. It is a sub-field of [[geology]] which emphasises the value of earth constituents for human life.

==Overview==
The Gateway "focuses attention on threats stemming from violence to individuals and to societies at risk".&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Gateway: [http://www.humansecuritygateway.info/aboutUs.php About the Human Security Gateway] (accessed 23 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an approach to gathering and categorizing information that is complementary to the "broad" conception of human security;&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' definitions of [[Human Security]], is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the [[Human Security]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; this is the same definition of human security that the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) used in its 1994 ''[[Human Development Report]]''.

==Content==
The Gateway offers users catalogued resources including reports, journal articles, and fact sheets. Its coverage ranges from the global to national (and sub-national) levels. Information is available in English and French, and via presentation formats such as:

The '''Icelandic Elf School''', known as ''Álfaskólinn'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], is a school in Iceland that teaches students and visitors about Icelandic folklore.

The school teaches about the [[hidden people]] and the 13 different kinds of [[elves]] that the school believes inhabit the country of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=VIDEO: Belief in Elves Strong in Iceland | date=2008-12-11 | publisher= | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-elves-video-ap.html | work =National Geographic News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school's headmaster, hidden people "are just the same size and look exactly like human beings, the only difference is that they are invisible to most of us. Elves, on the other hand, aren’t entirely human, they’re humanoid, starting at around eight centimetres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Vincenz | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=To Be or Not to Be; Álfar, Elves, Huldufólk, Fairies and Dwarves: Are They Really All the Same Thing? | date=2009-05-27 | publisher= | url=http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | work=The Reykjavík Grapevine | pages= | accessdate=2009-06-14 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404114957/http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | archivedate=2010-04-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims there are [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fucking-different.de/flash/dl/fuckingDifferent_dialogueList.zip | title = Schwule Elfen | accessdate = 2010-12-11 | last = Frömming | first = Undine | year = 2005 | work = Fucking Different | publisher = Kristian Petersen Filmproduktion | language = German, English | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719025638/http://www.fucking-different.de/flash/dl/fuckingDifferent_dialogueList.zip | archivedate = 2011-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is located in [[Reykjavík]], the country's largest city.

The school is headed by Magnús Skarphéðinsson.  Magnús has a full curriculum, and certificate programs for visitors that can be earned in as little as half a day. However, the school also publishes texts on hidden people, partly for its own use in the classroom. There is also ongoing research on the elves and hidden people of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Douglas | last=McArthur | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Elfschool tries to make a believer out of everyone | date=1996-03-13 | publisher= | url = | work =The Globe and Mail (Canada) | pages =  | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collects stories about trolls, fairies, dwarves, and gnomes, but says that "nearly 70 percent of our stories are about hidden people, because they are most seen here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Barbara | last=Gruber | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Iceland: Searching For Elves And Hidden People | date=June 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2786922,00.html | work =Deutsche Welle | pages = | accessdate = 2009-10-31 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories have been collected for the purpose of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dreams, Darkness and Hidden Spheres : Exploring the Anthropology of the Night in Icelandic Society |journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde|year=2005|first=Adriënne|last=Heijnen|coauthors=|volume=51|issue=|pages=203|id= |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17302753|format=|accessdate=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnús organizes five hour long educational excursions for visitors, and finishes the tour with coffee and pancakes at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Ferðast um huliðsheima | date=1997-06-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.ismennt.is/vefir/ari/alfar/afraedi/alfaskoli1.htm | work =Morgunblaðið | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-30 | language = Icelandic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite never advertising his school, Magnus typically gets 5–10 people per excursion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Alfar og huldufólk flutt út | date=1997-07-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=246906&amp;pageId=3349405&amp;lang=is&amp;q=Álfaskólinn | work =Alþýðublaðið | pages =1 | accessdate = 2009-06-07 | language = Icelandic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening in 1991, over 9,000 people, most of them foreigners, have attended the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Carl | last=Honoré | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=The Hidden Beings Of Iceland | date=2005-07-01 | publisher= | url=http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | work=American Way | pages= | accessdate=2009-06-14 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220181307/http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | archivedate=2009-02-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Álfaskólinn also provides "[[Aura reading|aura readings]]" and "[[Past life regression|past-life explorations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rakoff | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fraud: Essays | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2002 | location = New York, NY | pages = 85 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gjnfDpm6ubIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=fraud&amp;pg=PT98#v=onepage&amp;q=elf%20school&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7679-0631-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the "level of belief in elves" in Iceland is somewhat of a cultural topos, with survey results published in 1975, 1995, 1998, 2006. Interpretations of the survey results vary.
Based on the 2006 figures, Magnús claims that while only 26% of Icelanders believe in elves (summing the responses 'certain' and 'probable'), 80% "do take notice" (including the replies 'possible' and 'unlikely').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Gillian | last=Johnson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Looking for the hidden folk | date=1996-07-26 | publisher= | url =http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=164796&amp;pageId=2240420&amp;lang=en | work =Lögberg-Heimskringla | pages =3 | accessdate = 2009-06-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">'''Imprelis''' is a selective herbicide created by [[DuPont]].  The active ingredient is [[aminocyclopyrachlor]], a synthetic [[auxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Product label: http://www2.dupont.com/Professional_Products/en_US/assets/downloads/pdfs/H65717.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSDS: http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a358053f153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprelis was registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chemical/pesticide-registrations/aminocyclopyrachlor.html&lt;/ref&gt; for sale in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt;  Sale of Imprelis was voluntarily suspended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imprelis-facts.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a week before the EPA required sales stopped.&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/fifra/dupontimprelis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont acknowledged it was killing or damaging evergreen trees, including [[white pine]] and [[Norway spruce]].&lt;ref name="DFP"&gt;Detroit Free Press, May 21, 2012, page A1&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont allegedly knew Imprelis would damage evergreens before seeking EPA approval.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Free Press, Aug 12, 2011, page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont offered to compensate customers whose trees were affected. They asked that a claim be submitted, and said that they would send a claim resolution agreement, which would specify the amount DuPont would pay to settle the claim. By late May 2012, the end of the planting season, many tree owners had not heard from DuPont. Other tree owners who accepted payment agreements with DuPont had not been paid.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

Several hundred tree owners have filed lawsuits with DuPont. They are seeking [[class action]] status.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">'''The International Phytogeographic Excursions''' was a series of international meetings in [[plant geography]] that significantly contributed to exchange of scientific ideas across national and linguistic barriers and also to the rise of Anglo-American plant [[ecology]]. The initiative was taken by the British [[botanist]] [[Arthur Tansley]] at the International Geographic Congress in [[Geneva]] in 1908. Tansley and another early key figure, [[Henry C. Cowles]], were both much-inspired by the new 'ecological plant geography' introduced by [[Eugenius Warming]] and its quest for answering why-questions about plant distribution, as opposed to the traditional, merely descriptive 'floristic plant geography'. 

The '''First International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in the [[British Isles]] in 1911. It was organized by [[Arthur Tansley]] and went through parts of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

The '''Third International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was proposed in 1915, but postponed due to the [[First World War]]. It was finally carried through in 1923 in neutral [[Switzerland]], and as noted by [[John William Harshberger]] is his report in [[Ecology]], the participants from [[Germany]], [[France]] and other nations recently at war, coexisted peacefully. &lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929456 Harshberger, J.

The '''Fourth International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in Scandinavia in 1925 (July 2 to August 24). It formed as a trip through Sweden and Norway starting in [[Lund]] in southernmost [[Sweden]], passing [[Stockholm]], [[Uppsala]] and [[Abisko]], going down through Norway, ending in [[Oslo]]. It was organized by [[G. Einar Du Rietz]] from [[Uppsala University]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1648950 Raber, Oran (1925) The Fourth International Phytogeographic Excursion. Science 62 (1607): 344-345]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rübel, E. (ed.) (1927) Ergebnisse der internationalen pflanzengeographischen Exkursion durch Schweden und Norwegen 1925. Veröffentlichungen des geobotanischen Institutes Rübel in Zürich, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[Eugenius Warming|Warmings]] 'ecological plant geography' had developed into [[plant ecology]] and the excursion programme returned to 'floristic plant geography'. Through the 1930s and after the [[Second World War]], the International Phytogeographic Excursions continued at regular intervals, but now outside the mainstream of [[ecology]]. At the same time, scientific exchange between plant ecologists had found other means.

The '''Fifth International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1928. It was organized by [[Karel Domin]]. &lt;ref&gt;Domin, K.

A '''kludge''' or '''kluge''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ|,_|k|l|uː|dʒ}}) is a [[workaround]] or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain. This term is used in diverse fields such as [[computer science]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[Internet slang]], [[evolutionary neuroscience]], and government. A software kludge (often called "spaghetti code") is frequently the result of hacking. See photo of "A network kludge" at right. 

== Pronunciation and etymology ==
The word has alternate spellings (''[[Wikt:kludge|kludge]]'' and ''[[Wikt:kluge|kluge]]''), pronunciations ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ}} and {{IPAc-en|k|l|uː|dʒ}}, rhyming with ''judge'' and ''stooge'' respectively) and several proposed [[etymologies]].

=== Jackson W. Granholm ===
In the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989), the ''kludge'' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge''' {{IPA|/kluːdʒ/}} Also '''kluge'''. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also ''bodge'' v., ''fudge'' v.]&lt;ref&gt;This ''OED2'' defines these two ''kludge'' [[Cognate (etymology)|cognates]] as ''bodge'' "to patch or mend clumsily" and ''fudge'' "to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in ''Computing'', a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although ''OED'' accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention, examples of its use before the 1960s exist.

A source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm "Fink and Wiggles" (for [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]) as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word "kludge" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.

The word "kludge" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German "klug" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning "smart" or "witty". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word "Kludge" eventually came to mean "not so smart" or "pretty ridiculous". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, "An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole."

It is in this latter sense that "Kludge" is used by computer hardware men. Today "kludge" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that "that's the way computers are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Claims about derivation from the German adjective ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever") are unlikely for the following reasons:
* There is no equivalent usage in German
* Both pronunciations of the word contain the [[soft G|soft "g"]] ({{ipa|[[dʒ]]}}), which is not present in German
* The word emerges in English only in the 20th century

=== Yiddish ===
American [[Yiddish]] speakers use ''{{transl|yi|klug}}'' ({{lang|yi|{{linktext|קלוג}}}}) to mean "too smart by half", the reflected meaning of German ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever").  This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the  pronunciation variation from German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/|title=Yiddish Dictionary Online ייִדיש װערטערבוך אַפֿן װעב|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European surname ===
It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge (be that German, Dutch or Scandinavian). Even if Burling's etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.

This ''OED2'' entry also includes the verb ''kludge'' ("to improvise with a kludge or kludges") and ''kludgemanship'' ("skill in designing or applying kludges").

=== Military jargon ===
The [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of computer programmer slang maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge'''
# /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.
# [TMRC] A ''crock'' that works. (A long-ago ''Datamation'' article by Jackson Granholme {{sic}} similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.")
# v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Jargon File
|author=Eric S. Raymond
|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kludge.html
|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This Jargon File entry notes ''kludge'' apparently derives via British military slang from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''cludge'' or ''cludgie''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=cludgie&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=both SND Cludgie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=4749&amp;startset=1107921&amp;query=CLUDGIE&amp;fhit=cludgie&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=sndn#fhit SND Cludie]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a common toilet", and became confused with U.S. ''kluge'' during or after World War II.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kluge''': /klooj/ [from the German 'klug', clever; poss. related to Polish &amp; Russian 'klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)]
# n. A [[Rube Goldberg]] (or [[Heath Robinson]]) device, whether in hardware or software.
# n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock.
# n. Something that works for the wrong reason.
# vt. To insert a kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way."
# &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute|WPI]]] n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.&lt;ref name="jargon"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This entry notes ''kluge'', which is now often spelled ''kludge'', "was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges". The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment.

''Kluge'' "was common Navy slang in the [[World War II]] era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] "'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function."&lt;ref name="folklore"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Folklore from G. I. Joe, New York Folklore Quarterly
|volume=III, No. 4
|pages=285–297
|author=Agnes Nolan Underwood
|date=Winter 1947
|publisher=New York Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kluge'' as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'',&lt;ref name="folklore"/&gt; but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as "kluge maker". Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.

One day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was&amp;nbsp;– the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.

"Interesting," said the admiral, "but what does it do?" In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went "kluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://our-local.co.uk/index.php?topic=23170.5;wap2|title=Obsolete Occupations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jargon File further includes ''kluge around'' "to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge", ''kluge up'' "to lash together a quick hack to perform a task". After Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paper feeder ===

Another hypothesis dates to 1907, "when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from [[Oslo, Norway]] named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm". In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair&amp;nbsp;— but oh, so clever!" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge "was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for ''hardware'' kluges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/kluge|title=FOLDOC – Computing Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, "[[TMRC]] and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also [[foobar]]). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable [[Building 20]], which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999)." This would explain the term's introduction to the software community.

This explanation points to a Norwegian surname as the source, with no connection to German.

=== Acronym ===

Other suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder-'''g'''oing '''e'''ngineering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The term ''kludge'' would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, ''kluge'' seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while ''kludge'' has only the sense of poorly done.

Cf. German {{lang|de|{{linktext|Kloß}}}} ("clod", diminutive {{lang|de|Klößchen}}), [[Low German|Low Saxon]] ''klut'', ''klute'', Dutch {{lang|nl|kluit}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=Adelung&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=DK01431|title=Wörterbuchnetz – Grammatisch-Kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to Low German diminutive ''klütje'' ("dumpling, clod"), Danish [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutland dial.]] ''klyt'' ("piece of bad workmanship, kludge"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Aage|title=Et par etymologier|journal=Danske Studier|year=1926|pages=90|url=http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1926.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|editor1-first=Gunnar|editor1-last=Knudsen|editor2-first=Marius|editor2-last=Kristensen|publisher=Nordisk Forlag|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Standard [[Danish language|Danish]] {{lang|da|kludder}} ("mess, disorder").

== Industries ==

=== Aerospace engineering ===
In [[aerospace]], a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, "I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV." The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.

The Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it "the kludge".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Computer science ===
In modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a "kludge" (or often a "'''hack'''") is a solution to a problem, doing a task, or fixing a system that is inefficient, inelegant ("hacky") or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To "kludge around something" is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that ''hack'' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Kidder
|first=Tracey
|title=[[The Soul of a New Machine]]
|publisher=Avon
|year=1982
|isbn=978-0-380-59931-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].

Something might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.

An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.

In computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge.

In [[FidoNet]] terminology, ''kludge'' refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.

=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===
{{see also|Evolutionary baggage}}
The ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[evolutionary neuroscience]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].

The neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-674-02478-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]]&amp;nbsp;– when you accelerated or drove uphill, "Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether."

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front. As a result, all kinds of stuff gets in its way, including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]s, one in each eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Other uses ==
In the science fiction television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', genetically engineered human beings called [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]]s use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.

In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s 1985 short story "Press Enter_", the antagonist, a reclusive hacker with unprecedented access to many databases, adopts the identity Charles Kluge.

In a 2012 article, the political scientist Steven Teles used the term "kludgeocracy" to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States. In the paper, Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drives policy makers to accept temporary, imperfect, fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms. &lt;ref name="teles_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teles|first1=Steven M.|title=Kludgeocracy in America|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america|journal=[[National Affairs]] |date=Fall 2017|issue=33|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawler_2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Joseph|title=Steven Teles Explains "Kludgeocracy"|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2012/12/14/steven_teles_explains_kludgeocracy_378.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|agency=Real Clear Policy|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE 21''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flows, waves, sediments and ecology in rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas in two dimensions. It was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]].

==Simulation engines==
MIKE 21 comprises three simulation engines: 

'''Single Grid''': the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent non-linear equations of continuity and conservation of momentum are solved by implicit finite difference techniques with the variables defined on a space-staggered rectangular grid.

'''Multiple Grids''': the Multiple Grids version uses the same simulation engine and numerical approach as the single grid version. However, it provides the possibility of refining areas of special interest within the model area (nesting). All domains within the model area are dynamically linked. 

'''Flexible Mesh''': is an unstructured mesh and uses a cell-centred finite volume solution technique. The mesh is based on linear triangular elements.

==Applications==
MIKE 21 can be used for design data assessment for coastal and offshore structures, optimization of port layout and coastal protection measures, cooling water, desalination and recirculation analysis, environmental impact assessment of marine infrastructures, water forecast for safe marine operations and navigation, coastal flooding and storm surge warnings, inland flooding and overland flow modeling.

[[File:Santa Maria Imbaro - Centro Mario Negri Sud.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The "Mario Negri Sud" in [[Santa Maria Imbaro]]]]
The '''Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research''' ({{lang-it|Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri}}) is a nonprofit research institute dedicated to clinical and [[biomedical research]]. It was made possible by a special bequest of Milan philanthropist [[:it:Mario Negri|Mario Negri]] (1891 – 1960). It was founded in 1961 although it started working in [[Milan]] from 1st Feb 1963. There are branches of the institute in Bergamo, Ranica (BG), and at Santa Maria Imbaro, near Chieti.

Founder and director from 1961 is prof. [[:it:Silvio Garattini|Silvio Garattini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2665">In [[recursion theory]], the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[computability]], a '''maximal set''' is a coinfinite [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable subset]] ''A'' of the [[natural number]]s such that for every further recursively enumerable subset ''B'' of the natural numbers, either ''B'' is [[cofinite]] or ''B'' is a finite variant of ''A'' or ''B'' is not a superset of ''A''. This gives an easy definition within the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of the recursively enumerable sets.

Maximal sets have many interesting properties: they are [[simple set|simple]], [[hypersimple set|hypersimple]], [[hyperhypersimple]] and r-maximal; the latter property says that every recursive set ''R'' contains either only finitely many elements of the complement of ''A'' or almost all elements of the complement of ''A''. There are r-maximal sets that are not maximal; some of them do even not have maximal supersets. Myhill (1956) asked whether maximal sets exist and Friedberg (1958) constructed one. Soare (1974) showed that the maximal sets form an orbit with respect to [[automorphism]] of the recursively enumerable sets under inclusion ([[Modulo (jargon)|modulo]] finite sets). On the one hand, every automorphism maps a maximal set ''A'' to another maximal set ''B''; on the other hand, for every two maximal sets ''A'', ''B'' there is an automorphism of the recursively enumerable sets such that ''A'' is mapped to ''B''.

'''MilkyWay@home''' is a volunteer [[distributed computing]] project in [[astrophysics]] running on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) platform.  Using spare computing power from over 38,000 computers run by over 27,000 active volunteers {{As of|2011|11|lc=on}},&lt;ref name="BOINCstats_MilyWayOverview"&gt;{{cite web | title=MilkyWay@home: Credit overview | author=de Zutter W | url=https://boincstats.com/en/stats/61/project/detail/credit | publisher=boincstats.com|accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MilkyWay@home project aims to generate accurate three-dimensional dynamic models of [[stellar streams]] in the immediate vicinity of the [[Milky Way]]. With [[SETI@home]] and [[Einstein@home]], it is the third computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose. Its secondary objective is to develop and optimize algorithms for distributed computing.

== Purpose and design ==
[[File:Sig07-008.jpg|thumb|Starstreams from three small galaxies circling the bigger galaxy (simulation)]]
MilkyWay@home is a collaboration between the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]'s departments of [[Computer science|Computer Science]] and Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy and is supported by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]]. It is operated by a team that includes astrophysicist [[Heidi Jo Newberg]] and computer scientists  [[Malik Magdon-Ismail]], [[Bolesław Szymański]] and [[Carlos A. Varela]].

By mid-2009 the project's main astrophysical interest is in the [[Sagittarius Stream]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpi.edu/~vickej2/boincPics/sgr.flyaround.mpg Static 3D rendering of the Sagittarius stream] [https://www.webcitation.org/5i9mVIIAi Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; a stellar stream emanating from the [[Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy]] which partially penetrates the space occupied by the Milky Way and is believed{{by whom|date=April 2013}} to be in an unstable orbit around it, probably after a close encounter or collision with the Milky Way&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpi.edu/~vickej2/boincPics/surf.mpg Simulation of the Sagittarius stream development] by Kathryn V. Johnston at Columbia University [https://www.webcitation.org/5i9mxwi36 Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; which subjected it to strong [[galactic tide]] forces. Mapping such interstellar streams and their dynamics with high accuracy is expected{{by whom|date=April 2013}} to provide crucial clues for understanding the structure, formation, evolution, and gravitational potential distribution of the Milky Way and similar galaxies. It could also provide insight on the [[dark matter]] issue. As the project evolves, it might turn its attention to other star streams.

Using data from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], MilkyWay@home divides starfields into wedges of about 2.5 deg. width and applies self-optimizing probabilistic separation techniques (i.e., [[evolutionary algorithm]]s) to extract the optimized tidal streams. The program then attempts to create a new, uniformly dense wedge of stars from the input wedge by removing streams of data. Each stream removed is characterized by six parameters: percent of stars in the stream; the angular position in the stripe; the three spatial components (two angles, plus the radial distance from Earth) defining the removed cylinder; and a measure of width. For each search, the server application keeps track of a population of individual stars, each of which is attached to a possible model of the Milky Way.

== Project details and statistics ==
MilkyWay@home has been active since 2007, and optimized client applications for [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] operating systems became available in 2008. Its screensaver capability is limited to a revolving display of users' [[BOINC]] statistics, with no graphical component. Instead, animations of the best computer simulations are shared through YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/MilkywayAtHomeRPI/playlists Videos of the best-discovered computer simulations of this project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work units that are sent out to clients used to require only 2–4 hours of computation on modern CPUs, however, they were scheduled for completion with a short deadline (typically, three days). By early 2010, the project routinely sent much larger units that take 15–20 hours of computation time on the average processor core, and are valid for about a week from a download. This made the project less suitable for computers that are not in operation for periods of several days, or for user accounts that do not allow BOINC to compute in the background. As of 2018, many GPU-based tasks only require less than a minute to complete on a high-end graphics card.

The project's data throughput progress has been very dynamic recently. In mid-June 2009, the project had about 24,000 registered users and about 1,100 participating teams in 149 countries and was operating at 31.7 Tera[[FLOPS]]. {{As of|2010|01|12}}, these figures were at 44,900 users and 1,590 teams in 170 countries, but average computing power had jumped to 1,382 TFlops,&lt;ref&gt;Data retrieved from [http://www.allprojectstats.com BOINC project statistics page]{{dead link|date=September 2017}} on June 22, 2009, and January 12, 2010, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; which would rank MilkyWay@home second among the [[TOP500]] list of [[supercomputer]]s.  MilkyWay@home is currently{{as of?|date=April 2013}} the 2nd largest distributed computing project behind [[Folding@Home]] which crossed 5,000 TFlops in 2009.

That data throughput massively outpaced new user acquisition is mostly due to the deployment of client software that uses commonly available medium and high performance [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) for numerical operations in Windows and Linux environments. MilkyWay@home [[CUDA]] code for a broad range of [[Nvidia]] GPUs was first released on the project's [https://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/download/code_release/ code release directory] on June 11, 2009 following experimental releases in the MilkyWay@home(GPU) fork of the project. An OpenCL application for AMD Radeon GPUs is also available and currently outperforming the CPU application.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} For example, a task that requires 10 minutes using a [[Radeon HD 2000 series|Radeon HD 3850]] GPU or 5 minutes using an [[Radeon HD 4000 series|Radeon HD 4850]] GPU, requires 6 hours using one core of an AMD [[Phenom II]] processor at 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

MilkyWay@home is a whitelisted [[gridcoin]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gridcoin.us/Guides/whitelist.htm |title=Gridcoin's Whitelist |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=  |publisher= |access-date=November 29, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the second largest manufacturer of gridcoins.

== Scientific results ==
Large parts of the MilkyWay@home project build on the thesis of Nathan Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |title=Maximum Likelihood Fitting of Tidal Streams with Application to the Sagittarius Dwarf Tidal Tails |url=http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/papers/cole-phd-thesis.pdf |last=Cole |first=Nathan |year=2009 |publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cole |first=Nathan |last2=Newberg |first2=Heidi Jo |last3=Magdon-Ismail |first3=Malik |last10=Varela |first10=Carlos |last11=Willett |first11=Benjamin |last12=Wisniewski |first12=James |year=2008 |title=Maximum Likelihood Fitting of Tidal Streams with Application to the Sagittarius Dwarf Tidal Tails |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=683 |issue=2 |pages=750–766 |url=http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/papers/cole-apj-2008.pdf |doi=10.1086/589681|others=''et al.'' |last4=Desell |first4=Travis |last5=Dawsey |first5=Kristopher |last6=Hayashi |first6=Warren |last7=Liu |first7=Xinyang Fred |last8=Purnell |first8=Jonathan |last9=Szymanski |first9=Boleslaw |bibcode=2008ApJ...683..750C|arxiv = 0805.2121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other results have been presented at several astrophysical and computing congresses.&lt;ref&gt;For an up-to-date list, see [https://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/ the project's web portal].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journal of medical ethics, 41''(4), 348-352. doi:10.1136/medethics-2013-101796&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the debate over MBE has focused on their 2012 book supporting it, ''Unfit for the Future? The Need for Moral Enhancement.''&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;

==Defining moral enhancement==

Moral enhancement in general is sometimes distinguished from MBE specifically, such that ME includes any means of moral improvement while MBE only involves biomedical interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014"&gt;Raus, K., Focquaert, F., Schermer, M., Specker, J., &amp; Sterckx, S. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4 On defining moral enhancement: a clarificatory taxonomy]. ''Neuroethics, 7''(3), 263-273. doi:10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Persson and Savulescu have cited [[moral education]] as an example of socially accepted non-biomedical moral enhancement.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

Some also distinguish invasive from non-invasive, intended from resultant, treatment-focused from enhancement-focused, capability-improving from behavior-improving, and passive from active ME interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014" /&gt; [[Vojin Rakić]] has distinguished voluntary from compulsory MBE, claiming that the former is justifiable even if the latter is not.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a"&gt;Rakić, V. (2014a). [http://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2012-100700 Voluntary moral enhancement and the survival-at-any-cost bias]. ''Journal of medical ethics, 40''(4), 246-250. doi:10.1136/medethics-2012-100700&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rakić, V. (2014b). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889249 Voluntary moral bioenhancement is a solution to Sparrow's concerns]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 37-38. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==

Douglas originally suggested MBE as a counter-example to what he called the "[[bioconservative]] thesis," which claims that [[human enhancement]] is immoral even if it is feasible. He argued that enhancements to reduce "counter-moral" racist and aggressive emotional reactions would at least be morally permissible.&lt;ref name = "Douglas 2008" /&gt;

[[Mark Alan Walker]] proposed a "Genetic Virtue Project" to genetically enhance moral traits. Given that personality traits are heritable, and some traits are moral while others are immoral, he suggested increasing moral traits while reducing immoral ones through [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. (2009, September). [http://doi.org/10.2990/28_2_27 Enhancing genetic virtue: A project for twenty-first century humanity?]. ''Politics and the life sciences, 28''(2), 27-47. doi:10.2990/28_2_27&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the fact that human technological progress has advanced faster than human moral psychology can adapt through evolution, Persson &amp; Savulescu point out that humans' capability to cause large-scale destruction has increased exponentially. However, given that humans tend to care only about their immediate acquaintances and circumstances instead of thinking on a larger scale, they are vulnerable to [[Tragedy of the commons|tragedies of the commons]] like climate change and to technologies like nuclear weapons which pose an [[existential threat]] to humanity. Given that moral education and [[liberal democracy]] are insufficient, MBE is needed at least as a supplementary method to solve these problems.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Central issues debated in the MBE literature include whether there is an urgent need for MBE, a sufficient consensus on the definition of morality, some technically feasible and ethically permissible interventions to carry out MBE, no violation of consent in those interventions, and no harmful social side-effects that they produce.&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt;

===Sufficiency of non-biomedical methods===

Terri Murray disputed the claim by Persson &amp; Savulescu that political will and moral education are insufficient to address the major problems facing humanity, claiming that Persson &amp; Savulescu unjustly reify moral dispositions in biology.&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012"&gt;Murray, T. (2012). [https://philosophynow.org/issues/93/The_Incoherence_of_Moral_Bioenhancement The incoherence of moral bioenhancement]. ''Philosophy now, 93'', 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical basis of moral enhancement===

Since the nature of morality has historically caused wide disagreements, several authors have questioned whether it is possible to come up with a sufficiently widely accepted ethical basis for MBE, especially with respect to what qualities should be enhanced.&lt;ref name = "Paulo et al 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, B. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12090 Conceptual and practical problems of moral enhancement]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 233-240. doi:10.1111/bioe.12090&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feasibility===

MBE proponents have been accused of being too speculative, overstating the capabilities of future interventions and describing unrealistic scenarios like enhancing "all of humanity."&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt; One literature review assessed the evidence on seven interventions cited by MBE proponents, finding all of them ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Dubljević, V., &amp; Racine, E. (2017, May 15). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12355 Moral enhancement meets normative and empirical reality: Assessing the practical feasibility of moral enhancement neurotechnologies]. ''Bioethics, 31''(5), 338-348. doi:10.1111/bioe.12355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of individual choice===

Other authors have suggested that unless MBE is based on an individual's choice, it cannot truly be called "moral" enhancement because personal choice is the basis of ethics.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melo‐Martin, I., &amp; Salles, A. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12100 Moral bioenhancement: much ado about nothing?]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 223-232. doi:10.1111/bioe.12100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social equality===

If MBE is more effective for enhancing people that are already moral, then it could increase the gap between moral and immoral people, increasing social inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Ram-Tiktin, E. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889246 The possible effects of moral bioenhancement on political privileges and fair equality of opportunity]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 43-44. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if MBE makes some people morally better, it could unfairly raise the moral standards for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, A. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12251 Moral enhancement and those left behind]. ''Bioethics, 30''(7), 500-510. doi:10.1111/bioe.12251&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petroleum engineering''' is a field of [[engineering]] concerned with the activities related to the production of [[hydrocarbons]], which can be either [[crude oil]] or [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-2|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the [[Upstream (oil industry)|''upstream'']] sector of the oil and gas industry. [[Hydrocarbon exploration|Exploration]], by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. [[Petroleum geology]] and [[geophysics]] focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.

The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, [[formation evaluation]] ([[well logging]]), [[drilling]], [[economics]], [[reservoir simulation]], [[reservoir engineering]], well engineering, [[artificial lift]] systems, completions and [[petroleum production engineering]].

Recruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of physics, chemical engineering and mining engineering. Subsequent development training has usually been done within oil companies.

== Overview ==
The profession got its start in 1914 within the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers]] (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering degree was conferred in 1915 by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum Engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454409/petroleum-engineering#toc64689|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations. Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics, probability analysis, and new technologies like [[horizontal drilling]] and [[enhanced oil recovery]], have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum engineer in recent decades. Automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/topics/?topic=14|title=Drilling Automation|last=|first=|date=December 14, 2017|website=Journal of Petroleum Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2295|title=JPT Flow Sensor Technology Seeks to Replace the Coriolis Meter|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2313|title=JPT Competing Companies Building Robots to Place Receivers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=3209|title=JPT Robot Removes Operators From Extreme Environments|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety. 

Deep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent systems.

The [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) is the largest [[professional society]] for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/memberbasics/documents/ResourceGuide.pdf|title=SPE Member Resource Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/publications/|title=Publications {{!}} The Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members receive a complimentary subscription to the ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' and discounts on SPE's other publications.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/members/benefits.php|title=Professional Membership Benefits {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members also receive discounts on registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"/&gt; SPE provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students. 

According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statics, petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor's degree in engineering, generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well.&lt;ref name="pet eng"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the [[United States]] and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions.

=== Petroleum engineering salaries ===
Petroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest paid engineering disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. SPE annually conducts a [[salary survey]]. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported earning USD $194,649 (including salary and bonus), and the average base pay was USD $151,122.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/oil-and-gas-salary-survey/|title=Oil and Gas Pay {{!}} Salary Survey {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"/&gt; Base pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States where the base pay was USD $174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended to make the best base pay, USD $160,026 for drilling engineers and USD $158,964 for production engineers. Base pay on average ranged from USD $96,382-174,283.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/2017-Salary-Survey-Highlight-Report.pdf|title=2017 SPE Membership Salary Survey Highlight Report-November 2017|last=|first=|date=January 3, 2018|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still significant gender pay gaps, but in 2017 more than half of female respondents reported an increase in base pay received since 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was USD $18,230, or roughly $61.65 per hour.&lt;ref name="pet eng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-5|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same summary projects that there will be 15% job growth in this field from 2016 to 2026.&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"/&gt; Also in 2016, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25-59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-05-17/top-10-college-majors-that-earn-the-highest-salaries|title=Top 10 College Majors That Earn the Highest Salaries|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2018|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[National Association of Colleges and Employers]] survey showed petroleum engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of $125,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naceweb.org/Press/Releases/Top-Paid_Majors_Among_College_Class_of_2010_(3-11-10).aspx |title=NACE: |publisher=Naceweb.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000 to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour. In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/04/jobs-careers-compensation-lead-careers-cx_pm_0604jobs.html |title=America's Best- And Worst-Paying Jobs |publisher=Forbes.com |date= 2007-06-04|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Sub-disciplines ==
Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"/&gt;
* [[Reservoir engineers]] work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
* [[Drilling engineering|Drilling engineers]] manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory, production and injection wells.
* [[Subsurface engineer|Completion engineers]] (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas production. 
* [[Petroleum production engineering|Production engineers]] manage the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate [[artificial lift]] methods; and select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, and water).

{{distinguish|Process engineering|systems engineering process}}
In [[engineering]], a '''process''' is a series of interrelated tasks that, together, transform inputs into outputs.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/EIA-632-1998 Processes for Engineering a System, Appendix A, p66&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks may be carried out by people, nature or machines using various resources; an engineering process must be considered in the context of the agents carrying out the tasks and the resource attributes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Gilb, p392&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems engineering]] normative documents and those related to Maturity Models are typically based on processes, for example, systems engineering processes of the EIA-632 and processes involved in the [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI) institutionalization and improvement approach. Constraints imposed on the tasks and resources required to implement them are essential for executing the tasks mentioned.

== Semiconductor industry ==

Semiconductor process engineers face the unique challenge of transforming raw materials into high-tech devices. Common semiconductor devices include Integrated Circuits (ICs), Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), solar panels, and solid-state lasers. To produce these and other semiconductor devices, semiconductor process engineers rely heavily on interconnected physical and chemical processes. 

A prominent example of these combined processes is the use of ultra-violet photo-lithography which is then followed by wet etching, the process of creating an IC pattern that is transferred onto an organic coating and etched onto the underlying semiconductor chip. Other examples include the ion implantation of dopant species to tailor the electrical properties of a semiconductor chip and the electrochemical deposition of metallic interconnects (electroplating). Process Engineers are generally involved in the development, scaling, and quality control of new semiconductor processes from lab bench to manufacturing floor.

== Chemical engineering ==
{{Main|Chemical process|Process design}}

A chemical process is a series of [[unit operation]]s used to produce a material in large quantities.

In the chemical industry, [[Chemical engineering|chemical engineers]] will use the following to define or illustrate a process:
* [[Process flow diagram|Process Flow Diagram]] (PFD)
* [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] (P&amp;ID)
* Simplified process description
* Detailed process description
* Project management
* [[Process simulation]]

== CPRET ==
The ''Association Française d'Ingénierie Système'' has developed a process definition dedicated to Systems engineering (SE), but open to all domains. 
The CPRET representation integrates the process Mission and Environment in order to offer an external standpoint. Several models may correspond to a single definition depending on the language used (UML or another language).
Note: process definition and modeling are interdependent notions but different the one from the other.

* Process
** A process is a set of transformations of input elements into products: respecting constraints,
** requiring resources,
** meeting a defined mission, corresponding to a specific purpose adapted to a given environment.
* Environment
** Natural conditions and external factors impacting a process.
* Mission
** Purpose of the process tailored to a given environment.

This definition requires a process description to include the Constraints, Products, Resources, Input Elements and Transformations. This leads to the CPRET acronym to be used as name and [[mnemonic]] for this definition.

* Constraints
** Imposed conditions, rules or regulations.
* Products
** All whatever is generated by transformations. The products can be of the desired or not desired type (e.g., the software system and bugs, the defined products and waste).
* Resources
** Human resources, energy, time and other means required to carry out the transformations.
* Elements as inputs
** Elements submitted to transformations for producing the products.
* Transformations
** Operations organized according to a logic aimed at optimizing the attainment of specific products from the input elements, with the allocated resources and on compliance with the imposed constraints.

=== CPRET through examples ===
The purpose of the following examples is to illustrate the definitions with concrete cases. These examples come from the Engineering field but also from other fields to show that the CPRET definition of processes is not limited to the System Engineering context.&lt;!--wouldn't hurt to find a source for these examples--&gt;

'''Examples of processes'''
* An engineering (EIA-632, [[ISO/IEC 15288]], etc.)
* A concert
* A polling campaign
* A certification

'''Examples of environment'''
* Various levels of maturity, technicality, equipment
* An audience
* A political system
* Practices

'''Examples of mission'''
* Supply better quality products
* Satisfy the public, critics
* Have candidates elected
* Obtain the desired approval

'''Examples of constraints'''
* Imposed technologies
* Correct acoustics
* Speaking times
* A reference model (ISO, CMMI, etc.)

'''Examples of products'''
* A mobile telephone network
* A show
* Vote results
* A quality label

'''Examples of resources'''
* Development teams
* An orchestra and its instruments
* An organization
* An assessment team

'''Examples of elements as inputs'''
* Specifications
* Scores
* Candidates
* A company and its practices

'''Examples of transformations'''
* Define an architecture
* Play the scores
* Make people vote for a candidate
* Audit the organization

== Conclusions ==
The CPRET formalized definition systematically addresses the input Elements, Transformations, and Products but also the other essential components of a Process, namely the Constraints and Resources. Among the resources, note the specificity of the Resource-Time component which passes inexorably and irreversibly, with problems of synchronization and sequencing.

This definition states that environment is an external factor which cannot be avoided: as a matter of fact, a process is always interdependent with other phenomena including other processes.

There are waiting points located at [[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] ''N'' = 50, 82, 126, where beta-decay is favored due to low neutron-capture cross sections resulting from the closed shells. The cycle then repeats until the next waiting point, creating yet heavier nuclei of elements up to the [[actinides]]; the natural abundance of these elements results entirely from the ''r''-process. In the [[superheavy element|superheavy]] mass region (''A'' ≥ 270), neutron-induced [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[spontaneous fission]] are expected to become dominant and end the ''r''-process. Most nuclei along the hypothetical ''r''-process path, however, are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoennessen|first=M.|date=2004|title=Reaching the limits of nuclear stability|url=https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~thoennes/personal/papers/rpp67_1187.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=67|pages=1187-1232|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/67/7/R04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''rapid neutron-capture process''', or so-called '''''r''-process''', is a set of nuclear reactions that in [[nuclear astrophysics]] is responsible for the creation ([[nucleosynthesis]]) of approximately half the abundances of the [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] [[Heavy metals|heavier than iron]], usually synthesizing the entire abundance of the two most neutron-rich stable isotopes of each heavy element. Chemical elements heavier than iron typically are enabled by the force between nucleons to be capable of six to ten stable isotopic forms having the same nuclear charge Z but differing in neutron number N, each of whose natural abundances contribute to the natural abundance of the chemical element. Each isotope is characterized by the number of neutrons that it contains.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The nuclear force binds the nucleons into a stable structure but does not endow them with an abundance. The ''r''-process" creates the abundances of each stable nucleus&lt;/ref&gt; The ''r''-process typically synthesizes new nuclei of the heaviest four isotopes of any heavy element, being totally responsible for the abundances of its two heaviest isotopes, which are referred to as ''r-only nuclei''. The most abundant of these contribute to the ''r''-process abundance peaks near atomic weights {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 82}} (elements Se, Br and Kr), {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 130}} (elements Te, I, and Xe) and {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 196}} (elements Os, Ir and Pt).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;An example is the heavy element xenon, which the nuclear force endows with nine stable isotopes, each containing the same nuclear charge number ''Z''=54 but differing neutron numbers ''N'' = 70–82. The ''r''-process contributes to the abundances of the heaviest four isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Xe and &lt;sup&gt;136&lt;/sup&gt;Xe) and is totally responsible for the heaviest two of those. By comparison the [[s-process|''s''-process]] contributes only to xenon's middle five isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, and &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Xe)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''r''-process entails a succession of ''rapid'' [[neutron capture]]s (hence the name) by one or more heavy [[Seed nucleus|seed nuclei]], typically beginning with nuclei in the abundance peak centered on [[iron-56|&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe]]. The captures must be rapid in the sense that the nuclei must not have time to undergo [[radioactive decay]] before another [[neutron]] arrives to be captured, a sequence that is halted only when the increasingly neutron-rich nuclei cannot physically retain another neutron. The ''r''-process therefore must occur in locations where there exists a high density of [[free neutron]]s. Early studies reasoned that 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; free neutrons per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would be required if the temperature were about one billion degrees in order that the waiting points, at which no more neutrons can be captured, be at the atomic numbers of the abundance peaks for ''r''-process nuclei.&lt;ref name="Synthesis of the Elements in Stars"&gt;

A limited ''r''-process-like series of neutron captures occurs to a minor extent in [[thermonuclear weapon]] explosions. These led to the discovery of the elements [[einsteinium]] (element 99) and [[fermium]] (element 100) in nuclear weapon [[fallout]].

The ''r''-process contrasts with the [[s-process|''s''-process]], the other predominant mechanism for the production of heavy elements, which is nucleosynthesis by means of ''slow'' captures of neutrons. The ''s''-process primarily occurs within ordinary stars, particularly [[Asymptotic giant branch|AGB stars]], where the neutron flux is sufficient to cause neutron captures to recur every 10–100 years, much too slow for the ''r''-process, which requires 100 captures per second. The ''s''-process is ''secondary'', meaning that it requires pre-existing heavy isotopes as seed nuclei to be converted into other heavy nuclei by a slow sequence of captures of free neutrons. The ''r''-process scenarios create their own seed nuclei, so they might proceed in massive stars that contain no heavy seed nuclei. Taken together, the ''r''- and ''s''-processes account for almost the entire [[abundance of chemical elements]] heavier than iron. The historical challenge has been to locate physical settings appropriate for their time scales.

==History==
The need for a physical setting providing rapid capture of neutrons was seen from the relative abundances of isotopes of heavy chemical elements given in a table of [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] by [[Hans Suess]] and [[Harold Urey]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did their abundance table reveal larger than average abundances of natural isotopes containing [[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Isotopes with neutron number ''N'' = 50, 82 and 126 numbers of neutrons. These came to be called [[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]].&lt;/ref&gt; of neutrons but also abundance peaks about {{val|10|u=[[atomic mass unit|amu]]}} lighter than those containing magic numbers of neutrons in their structure. They also realized that captures of free neutrons should be part of any explanation because of the lack of electric repulsion between nuclei and chargeless neutrons. This phenomenology suggested that these lighter subsidiary abundance peaks could result from radioactive nuclei having the magic neutron numbers but roughly ten fewer protons. To achieve this would require radioactive neutron-rich isotopes to capture another neutron faster than they can undergo beta decay in order to create abundance peaks that will decay subsequently to [[germanium]], [[xenon]], and [[platinum]], elements prominent in the ''r''-process abundance peaks. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], [[radioactive]] nuclei that would decay into [[isotopes]] of these elements must have closed neutron shells near the [[neutron drip line]], where more neutrons cannot be added. The neutron-capture flow must therefore wait for beta decay at those so-called ''waiting points'', which therefore grow larger in abundance similar to water in a dammed up river. For those hitherto unexplained abundance peaks, which are approximately 10 u lighter than the ''s''-process abundance peaks, to be created by rapid [[neutron capture]] implied that other neutron-rich nuclei would also be synthesized by the same process. That process, rapid neutron capture by neutron-rich isotopes, is called the ''r''-process. A table apportioning the heavy isotopes phenomenologically between ''s''-process and ''r''-process isotopes was published in 1957 in the famous [[B2FH paper|B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH review paper]]&lt;ref name="Synthesis of the Elements in Stars"/&gt; which named the ''r''-process and outlined the physics that guides it. [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]] also published a smaller study about the ''r''-process in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stationary ''r''-process as described by the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper was first demonstrated in a time-dependent calculation at Caltech by Phillip A. Seeger, [[William A. Fowler]] and [[Donald D. Clayton]],&lt;ref name=Seeger&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found that no single temporal snapshot matched the solar ''r''-process abundances, but, that when superposed, did achieve a successful characterization of the ''r''-process abundance distribution. Shorter-time distributions emphasize abundances at atomic weights less than {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 140}}, whereas longer-time distributions emphasized those at atomic weights greater than {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 140}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Seeger|Fowler|Clayton|1965}}. Figure 16 shows the short-flux calculation and its comparison with natural ''r''-process abundances whereas Figure 18 shows the calculated abundances for long neutron fluxes.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent treatments of the ''r''-process reinforced those temporal features. Seeger ''et al.'' were also able to construct more quantitative apportionment between ''s''-process and ''r''-process of the abundance table of heavy isotopes, thereby establishing a more reliable abundance curve for the ''r''-process isotopes than B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH had been able to define. Today, the ''r''-process abundances are determined using their technique of subtracting the more reliable ''s''-process isotopic abundances from the total isotopic abundances and attributing the remainder to ''r''-process nucleosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;See Table 4 in {{harvnb|Seeger|Fowler|Clayton|1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That ''r''-process abundance curve (vs. atomic weight) has provided for many decades the target for theoretical computations of abundances synthesized by the physical ''r''-process.

The creation of free neutrons by electron capture during the rapid collapse to high density of a supernova core along with quick assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the ''r'' process a ''primary nucleosynthesis process'', meaning a process that can occur even in a star initially of pure H and He, in contrast to the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH designation as a ''secondary process'' building on preexisting iron. Primary stellar nucleosynthesis begins earlier in the galaxy than does secondary nucleosynthesis. Alternatively the high density of neutrons within neutron stars would be available for rapid assembly into ''r''-process nuclei if a collision were to eject portions of a neutron star, which then rapidly expands freed from confinement. That sequence could also begin earlier in galactic time than would ''s''-process nucleosynthesis; so each scenario fits the earlier growth of ''r''-process abundances in the galaxy. Each of these scenarios is the subject of active theoretical research.
Observational evidence of the early ''r''-process enrichment of interstellar gas and of subsequent newly formed of stars, as applied to the abundance evolution of the galaxy of stars, was first laid out by James W. Truran in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and subsequent astronomers showed that the pattern of heavy-element abundances in the earliest metal-poor stars matched that of the shape of the solar ''r''-process curve, as if the ''s''-process component were missing. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the ''s''-process had not yet begun to enrich interstellar gas when these young stars missing the ''s''-process abundances were born from that gas, for it requires about 100 million years of galactic history for the ''s''-process to get started whereas the ''r'' process can begin after two million years. These ''s''-process-poor, ''r''-process-rich stellar compositions must have been born earlier than any ''s''-process, showing that the ''r''-process emerges from quickly-evolving massive stars that become supernovae and leave neutron-star remnants that can merge with another neutron star. The primary nature of the early ''r''-process thereby derives from observed abundance spectra in old stars&lt;ref name=Frebel/&gt; that had been born early, when the galactic metallicity was still small, but that nonetheless contain their complement of ''r''-process nuclei.

[[File:Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg|thumb|500px|[[Periodic table]] showing the cosmogenic origin of each element. The elements heavier than iron with origins in supernovae are typically those produced by the ''r''-process, which is powered by supernovae neutron bursts]]

Either interpretation, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a totally satisfactory calculation of ''r''-process abundances because the overall problem is numerically formidable; but existing results are supportive. And in 2017 new data about the ''r''-process was discovered when the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories discovered a merger of two neutron stars ejecting ''r''-process matter.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;

Noteworthy is that the ''r''-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

==Nuclear physics==
Immediately after the severe compression of electrons in a core-collapse supernova, [[beta decay|beta-minus decay]] is blocked. This is because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a [[Fermi energy]] which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay. But nuclear [[Electron capture|capture of those free electrons]] still occurs, and causes increasing [[wiktionary:neutronization|neutronization]] of matter. There results an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay, and as a result a large neutron density (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Synthesis of the Elements in Stars"/&gt;) and high [[temperature]]s. As this re-expands and cools, [[neutron capture]] by still-existing heavy nuclei occurs much faster than [[beta decay|beta-minus decay]]. As a consequence, the ''r''-process runs up along the [[neutron drip line]] and highly-unstable neutron-rich nuclei are created.

Three processes which affect the process of climbing the neutron drip line are; a notable decrease in the neutron-capture [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] at nuclei with closed [[Nuclear shell model|neutron shells]], the inhibiting process of [[photodisintegration]], and the degree of nuclear stability in the heavy-isotope region. This last phenomenon terminates the ''r''-process when its heaviest nuclei become unstable to spontaneous fission, which is currently believed to be in the neutron-rich region of the [[table of nuclides]] when the total number of nucleons approaches 270; even before this, the fission barrier may be low enough that neutron capture might induce fission instead of continuing up the neutron drip line.&lt;ref&gt;

}}, provides a clear technical introduction to these features. More technical can be found in {{Harvnb|Seeger|Fowler|Clayton|1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So, while the [[s-process|''s''-process]] creates an abundance of stable nuclei having closed neutron shells, the ''r''-process in neutron-rich predecessor nuclei creates an abundance of radioactive nuclei about 10 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] below the ''s''-process peaks after their decay back to stability.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 10 of {{Harvnb|Seeger|Fowler|Clayton|1965}} shows this path of captures reaching magic neutron numbers 82 and 126 at smaller values of nuclear charge Z than it does along the stability path&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''r''-process also occurs in thermonuclear weapons, and was responsible for the initial discovery of neutron-rich almost stable isotopes of [[actinide]]s like [[plutonium-244]] and the new elements [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]] (atomic numbers 99 and 100) in the 1950s. It has been suggested that multiple nuclear explosions would make it possible to reach the [[island of stability]], as the affected nuclides (starting with uranium-238 as seed nuclei) would not have time to beta decay all the way to the quickly spontaneously fissioning nuclides at the line of beta stability before they absorbed more neutrons in the next explosion, thus providing a chance to reach neutron-rich [[superheavy element|superheavy]] nuclides like [[copernicium]]-291 and -293 which should have half-lives of centuries or millennia.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev&gt;

==Astrophysical sites==
The most probable candidate site for the ''r''-process has long been suggested to be core-collapse [[supernova]]e (spectral types ''Ib'', ''Ic'' and ''II''), which may provide the necessary physical conditions for the ''r''-process. However, the very low abundance of ''r''-process [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in the interstellar gas limits the amount each can have ejected. It requires either that only a small fraction of supernovae eject ''r''-process nuclei to the [[interstellar medium]], or that each supernova ejects only a very small amount of ''r''-process material. The ejected material must be relatively neutron-rich, a condition which has been difficult to achieve in models,&lt;ref name=Thielemann/&gt; so that astrophysicists remain uneasy about their adequacy for successful ''r''-process yields

Entirely new astronomical data about the ''r'' process was discovered in 2017 when the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories discovered a merger of two neutron stars.&lt;ref name=Abbott/&gt; The localization on the sky of the source of the gravitational waves radiated by the collapse of the two neutron stars into a black hole, but with significant spun off mass of highly neutronized matter, enabled several teams&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discover and study the optical counterpart of the merger, finding spectroscopic evidence of ''r''-process material thrown off by the merging neutron stars.  The bulk of this material seems to consist of two types: hot blue masses of highly radioactive ''r''-process matter of lower-mass-range heavy nuclei  ({{nowrap|''A '' &lt; 140}}) and cooler red masses of higher mass-number ''r''-process nuclei ({{nowrap|''A '' &gt; 140}}) rich in actinides (such as uranium, thorium, californium etc). When released from the huge internal pressure of the neutron star, these ejecta expand and form seed heavy nuclei that rapidly capture free neutrons, and radiate detected optical light for about a week. Such duration of luminosity would not be possible without heating by internal radioactive decay, which is provided by ''r''-process nuclei near their waiting points. Two distinct mass regions ({{nowrap|''A '' &lt; 140}} and {{nowrap|''A '' &gt; 140}}) for the ''r''-process yields have been known since the first time dependent calculations of the ''r''-process.&lt;ref name=Seeger/&gt; Because of these spectroscopic features it has been argued that such nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way has been primarily ejecta from neutron-star mergers rather than from supernovae.&lt;ref name=Kasen/&gt;

These results offer a new possibility for clarifying six decades of uncertainty over the site of origin of ''r''-process nuclei. Confirming relevance to the ''r''-process is that it is radiogenic power from radioactive decay of ''r''-process nuclei that maintains the visibility of these spun off ''r''-process fragments. Otherwise they would dim quickly. Such alternative sites were first seriously proposed in 1974&lt;ref&gt;

==Life==
Christison was born in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Christison, Sir Robert|volume=6|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Prof [[Alexander Christison]] [[FRSE]] (1753–1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-december-1885/18/a-scotch-physicians-autobiography-the-late-sir-rob |title=A Scotch Physician’s Autobiography |journal=[[The Spectator]] |date=19 December 1885 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a twin, his elder brother (by a few minutes) being later Rev. Alexander Christison (1797–1874).&lt;ref&gt;Men of the Time Alaric A Watts&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] before studying Medicine at [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating in 1819.

He then spent a short time in [[London]], studying under [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] and Sir [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]], and in [[Paris]], where he learnt [[analytical chemistry]] from [[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]] and [[toxicology]] from [[Mathieu Orfila]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1822 he returned to Edinburgh as professor of medical [[jurisprudence]], and set to work to organise the study of his subject on a sound basis. On [[poison]]s in particular he speedily became a high authority; his well-known treatise on them was published in 1829, and in the course of his inquiries he did not hesitate to try such daring experiments on himself as taking large doses of [[Calabar bean]] ([[Physostigmine]]). In 1827, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], a position he held until 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=A. Logan|title=Story of a Great Hospital: The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh 1729–1929|date=1937|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attainments in [[medical jurisprudence]] and toxicology procured him the appointment, in 1829, of medical officer to [[the crown]] in [[Scotland]], and from that time until 1866 he was called as a witness in many celebrated criminal cases.

In 1832, Christison gave up the chair of medical jurisprudence and accepted that of medicine and therapeutics, which he held until 1877; at the same time he became professor of clinical medicine, and continued in that capacity until 1855. At this time his address is listed as 3 Great Stuart Street on the Moray Estate, a very large Georgian townhouse in the west end of [[Edinburgh]], a highly desirable area.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83400027&amp;mode=transcription|title=(72) - Scottish Post Office Directories &amp;gt; Towns &amp;gt; Edinburgh &amp;gt; 1805-1834 - Post Office annual directory &amp;gt; 1832-1833 - Scottish Directories|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chairman of a Committee of the General Medical Council he was responsible for the compilation of the first ''[[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia of Great Britain and Ireland]]''. In 1842 he published his ''Dispensatory'', a commentary on the Pharmacopoeia. By his laboratory research, by his writings, by his collections of botanical specimens, Professor Christison became recognised as a world authority on therapeutics, on the manufacture of drugs, and on their presentation to patients.

His fame as a toxicologist and medical jurist, together with his work on the [[pathology]] of the [[kidney]]s and on [[fever]]s, secured him a large private practice, and he succeeded to a fair share of the honors that commonly attend the successful physician, being appointed physician to [[Queen Victoria]] in 1848 and receiving a [[baronet]]cy in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23798 |date=21 November 1871 |page=4795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books which he published were a treatise on ''Granular Degeneration of the Kidneys'' (1839), and a ''Commentary on the Pharmacopoeias of Great Britain'' (1842).

Christison was a strong opposer of women in the field of medicine, a view in Edinburgh eventually undermined by his colleague, [[Patrick Heron Watson]]'s admission of women students to his extra mural surgery classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1033587 | pmid=5325874 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=An Edinburgh surgeon of the Crimean war--Patrick Heron Watson (1832–1907) | year=1966 | journal=Med Hist | pages=166–76 | last1 = Watson | first1 = WB | doi=10.1017/s0025727300010954}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further (still controversial) proposal was his creation of a system of [[Lethal injection]] (through the discovery of [[Physostigmine]] in 1846) for human execution, in place of hanging. For various reasons, although this seems to pre-date its introduction into American use by 40 years, the method never appealed to British sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/notable_fellow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Christison served as Vice President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 1845–1868 and was its President from 1868 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Robert Christison, who retained remarkable physical vigour and activity until extreme old age, died at Edinburgh on 27 January 1882. He is buried in [[New Calton Cemetery]] in a family plot created by his father, Alexander Christison (who is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and only memorialised here), on one of the south-facing terraces.

==Opposition to Women Doctors==
Sir Robert Christison was unequivocally opposed to the notion of women studying medicine and qualifying as doctors and led the campaign against [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] and the [[Edinburgh Seven]]. He was an influential figure both within the University and in the wider civic life of Edinburgh; his opinion was held in high regard.

When the Senatus met on 9 April 1870 to discuss the issue of [[Edith Pechey|Edith Pechey's]] right to a Hope Scholarship having come top of the class in the Chemistry exam, he made his opinions very clear.

He shared the view of many of his contemporaries that Nature intended women to be mothers and housekeepers, and lacked the intellectual ability and stamina of men. Consequently, if women were to enter any learned profession in significant numbers they would lower its standards.

His influence was largely responsible for the eventual decision taken by the University not to allow the women to graduate.

[[James Stansfeld]], who had been very closely associated with the London campaign (following the failure of the Edinburgh campaign) wrote, in his brief history of the events, in 1877:

″Dr Sophia Jex-Blake has made the greatest of all contributions to the end attained. I do not say that she has been the ultimate cause of success. The ultimate cause has been simply this, that the time was at hand. It is one of the lessons of the history of progress that when the time for reform has come you cannot resist it, though if you make the attempt, what you may do is to widen its character or precipitate its advent. Opponents, when the time has come, are not merely dragged at the chariot wheels of progress - they help to turn them. The strongest forces, whichever way it seems to work, does most to aid. The forces of greatest concentration here have been, in my view, on the one hand the Edinburgh University led by Sir Robert Christison, on the other the women claimants led by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake.″
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Shirley|title=Sophia Jex-Blake : a woman pioneer in nineteenth-century medical reform|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0-415-08753-7|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Christison's wife was Henrietta Sophia Brown (1799–1843).

Their children included Sir Alexander Christison, baronet and Dr David Christison MD LLD (1830-1912).

{{short description|Not requiring outside inputs to meet needs}}

'''Self-sustainability''' and '''self-sufficiency''' are overlapping states of being in which a person or organization needs little or no help from, or interaction with, others. Self-sufficiency entails the [[self]] being enough (to fulfill needs), and a self-sustaining entity can maintain self-sufficiency indefinitely. These states represent types of personal or collective [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="Kains" /&gt; On a national scale, a totally self-sufficient [[economy]] that requires little or no trade with the outside world is called an [[autarky]]. Absolute purity of personal self-sufficiency or national autarky is a theoretical concept rather than a reality, but relative degrees are observable in real-world examples. 

Self-sustainability is a type of [[sustainable living]] in which nothing is consumed other than what is produced by the self-sufficient individuals. Examples of attempts at self-sufficiency in [[North America]] include [[simple living]], [[homesteading]], [[off-the-grid]], [[survivalism]], [[DIY ethic]] and the [[back-to-the-land movement]].

Practices that enable or aid self-sustainability include [[autonomous building]], [[permaculture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], and [[renewable energy]]. The term is also applied to limited forms of self-sustainability, for example growing one's own food or becoming economically independent of state [[subsidy|subsidies]]. The self-sustainability of an electrical installation measures its degree of grid independence and is defined as the ratio between the amount of locally produced energy that is locally consumed, either directly or after storage, and the total consumption.&lt;ref name="Silva-Hendrick" /&gt;

A system is self-sustaining (or self-sufficient) if it can  maintain itself by independent effort. The system self-sustainability is:

# the degree at which the system can sustain itself without external support
# the fraction of time in which the system is  self-sustaining

Self-sustainability is considered one of the [[list of system quality attributes|"ilities"]] and is closely related to [[sustainability]] and [[availability]].  In the [[economics]] literature, a system that has the quality of being self-sustaining is also referred to as an [[autarky]].

==Formal definition==

#  Let  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a random variable that denotes the  steady state number of external entities on which the system depends.  Let &lt;math&gt;p(v) &lt;/math&gt; be the probability that the system depends on &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; external entities,  &lt;math&gt;p(v)=P(E=v)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the system self-sustainability,  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,  is &lt;math&gt;S=p(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
#  Let &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; be the expected time during which the system is self-sustaining from time 0 up to time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the system self-sustainability is the steady state fraction of time in which it is self-sustaining,  &lt;math&gt;S=\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} {e_t}/{t}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Political states===

[[Autarky]] exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance. Autarky is not necessarily economic. For example, a military autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country.

===Labor===

According to the Department of Labor of the state of  Idaho, an employed adult shall be considered self-sufficient if the family income exceeds 200% of the Office of Management and Budget poverty income level guidelines.&lt;ref name="labor"&gt;IDAHO Department of Labor (1999). [http://labor.idaho.gov/wia1/policies/wiap7-99.pdf "Definition of Self-sufficiency."] Retrieved on 2010-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer-to-peer swarming===

In peer-to-peer swarming systems, a swarm is self-sustaining if all the  blocks  of its files are available among peers (excluding seeds and publishers).&lt;ref name="p2p"&gt;Menasche, Rocha, de Souza e Silva, Leao, Towsley, Venkataramani (2010).  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0395 "Estimating self-sustainability in peer-to-peer swarming systems"] Retrieved on 2010-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

===Self-sustainability and survivability===

Whereas self-sustainability is a quality of one’s independence,  [[survivability]] applies to the future maintainability of one’s self-sustainability and indeed one’s existence. Many believe that more self-sustainability guarantees a higher degree of survivability. But just as many oppose this, arguing that it is not self-sustainability that is essential for survivability, but on the contrary specialization and thus dependence.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;What and Who is Self-Sufficient? by Katrien Vander Straeten&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the first two  examples presented above.  Among countries, commercial treats are as important as self-sustainability. An [[autarky]] is usually inefficient. Among people, social ties have been shown to be correlated to happiness and success as much as self-sustainability.&lt;ref name="SocialNets"&gt;{{youtube|id=6a_KF7TYKVc|title=Social Networks in Plain English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia ==
For both men and women, [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of schizophrenia onset peaks at multiple points across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For men, the highest frequency of incidence onset occurs in the early twenties and there is evidence of a second peak in the mid-thirties. For women, there is a similar pattern with peaks in the early twenties and middle age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Richard J.|last2=Addington|first2=Jean|last3=Viswanathan|first3=Ananth C.|last4=Lewis|first4=Shôn W.|last5=Cotter|first5=Jack|last6=Yung|first6=Alison R.|last7=Abel|first7=Kathryn M.|date=2016-02-16|title=How Age and Gender Predict Illness Course in a First-Episode Nonaffective Psychosis Cohort|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.14m09369|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|pages=e283–e289|doi=10.4088/jcp.14m09369|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also demonstrated a tertiary peak for women in the early sixties. Men have higher frequency rates of onset than women from the early twenties to middle age, and women have higher frequency rates of onset starting in late middle age. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=David J.|last2=Wessely|first2=Simon|last3=Murray|first3=Robin M.|date=May 1993|title=Sex and Schizophrenia: Effects of Diagnostic Stringency, and Associations with Premorbid Variables|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=05|pages=658–664|doi=10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies of [[prevalence]] rates of schizophrenia estimate that the lifetime likelihood of developing the disorder is 0.3%-0.7%, and did not find evidence of sex differences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGrath|first=J.|last2=Saha|first2=S.|last3=Chant|first3=D.|last4=Welham|first4=J.|date=2008-05-14|title=Schizophrenia: A Concise Overview of Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxn001|journal=Epidemiologic Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxn001|issn=0193-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Sukanta|last2=Chant|first2=David|last3=Welham|first3=Joy|last4=McGrath|first4=John|date=2005-05-31|title=A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=2|issue=5|pages=e141|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|issn=1549-1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical presentation ==
Symptom expression systematically differs between men and women. Women are more likely to experience high levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., low mood, [[anhedonia]], fatigue) at illness onset and over the course of illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Men are more likely to experience more [[Negative symptom|negative symptoms]] than women at illness onset. There is conflicting evidence related to sex differences in the expression of [[positive symptoms]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some studies have found that women are more likely to experience positive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Jill M.|last2=Link|first2=Bruce G.|date=1988-01|title=Gender and the expression of schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|issn=0022-3956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=C.Z.|last2=Wu Qianjin|date=1994-02|title=Popula tion Aging in China: The Demographic Implications|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000944559403000103|journal=China Report|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–51|doi=10.1177/000944559403000103|issn=0009-4455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found no significant sex differences in the expression of positive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Vera A.|last2=Castle|first2=David J.|last3=Jablensky|first3=Assen V.|date=2008-01|title=Do Women Express and Experience Psychosis Differently from Men?

== Course of illness and treatment outcomes ==
Age at illness onset likely contributes to observed sex differences in course of illness and treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Increased negative and [[Schizophrenia|cognitive symptoms]] and poorer overall treatment outcomes are both related to younger age at onset, while fewer negative and cognitive symptoms are associated with older age at onset.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Linda S.|last2=Harrow|first2=Martin|last3=Rosen|first3=Cherise|last4=Faull|first4=Robert|last5=Strauss|first5=Gregory P.|date=2008-11|title=Sex differences in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a 20-year longitudinal study of psychosis and recovery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=6|pages=523–529|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|issn=0010-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with the differences patterns of symptom expression observed in men and women and the relative age of onset for each gender. Men are more likely to experience poorer overall outcomes than women because of the relationship between younger age at onset and symptom severity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Clinical trials examining sex differences in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications found greater rates of symptom reduction in women compared to men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, women are at a greater risk for experiencing weight gain and developing [[metabolic syndrome]] as a result of antipsychotic medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=Donald C.|last2=Sullivan|first2=Lisa M.|last3=McEvoy|first3=Joseph P.|last4=Meyer|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Nasrallah|first5=Henry A.|last6=Daumit|first6=Gail L.|last7=Lamberti|first7=Steven|last8=D'Agostino|first8=Ralph B.|last9=Stroup|first9=Thomas S.|date=2005-12|title=A comparison of ten-year cardiac risk estimates in schizophrenia patients from the CATIE study and matched controls|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|journal=Schizophrenia Research|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–53|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|issn=0920-9964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to sex differences ==

=== Biological factors ===
The steroids and hormones associated with [[Sexual differentiation|sex differentiation]] during [[Prenatal development|fetal development]] have critical effects on neuronal development in humans, and there is evidence that these hormones have implications for sex differences in brain abnormalities observed in adults with schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have revealed more severe brain damage in men diagnosed with schizophrenia than women.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-05|title=Effects of diagnosis, laterality, and gender on brain morphology in schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=152|issue=5|pages=704–714|doi=10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, larger lateral and third ventricles and reduced volumes of critical regions such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[Prefrontal lobe|prefrontal]] cortical regions have been observed in men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These brain abnormalities likely contribute to the observed short-term and long-term memory deficits in men diagnosed with schizophrenia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Han|first1=M.|last2=Huang|first2=X.

=== Social and environmental factors ===

==== Social cognition and social functioning ====
Premorbid [[Social skills|social functioning]] and [[social cognition]], robust predictors of relapse in this population, differ significantly between men and women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsner|first=Michael S.|last2=Arbitman|first2=Marina|last3=Lisker|first3=Alexander|last4=Ponizovsky|first4=Alexander M.|date=2011-10-02|title=Ten-year quality of life outcomes among patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder II.

==== Substance abuse and dependence ====
Substance abuse is also highly correlated with poorer functional outcomes and can significantly influence the course of illness. Current research estimates that 36% of men have a history of illicit substance use versus 16% of women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablensky|first=Assen|last2=McGrath|first2=John|last3=Herrman|first3=Helen|last4=Castle|first4=David|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Evans|first6=Mandy|last7=Carr|first7=Vaughan|last8=Morgan|first8=Vera|last9=Korten|first9=Ailsa|date=2000-04|title=Psychotic Disorders in Urban Areas: An Overview of the Study on Low Prevalence Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=34|issue=2|pages=221–236|doi=10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|issn=0004-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine dependence is also highly prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia.

'''Shalem College''' ({{lang-he|המרכז האקדמי שלם}}, ''HaMerkaz HaAkademi Shalem'') is Israel's first [[liberal arts college]], located in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. Founded in 2013, it aims to be Israel’s answer to America’s Ivy League universities, based on a core curriculum of humanities courses that are mandatory for each student, and around the idea of a vibrant, campus-focused student life.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/jerusalem-vivendi/.premium-1.550962|title=From Moses to Machiavelli, Shalem College sets up shop as Israel’s answer to the Ivy League|author=[[Ilene Prusher]]|publisher=Haaretz|date=Oct 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A privately funded, undergraduate-degree-granting institution, Shalem currently boasts 94 enrolled students. The college is accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]].

==History, academia, and campus life==
[[File:Shalem College building.jpg|thumb|300px|Shalem College Building]]
The [[Shalem Center]], a think tank, founded (and dissolved to become) Shalem College in January 2013, following accreditation by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]].&lt;ref name=forward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/New-college-dedicated-to-the-humanities-opens-in-Jerusalem-328004] "New College Dedicated to the Humanities Opens in Jerusalem," [[Jerusalem Post]], October 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Gordis, the college's founding senior vice president, the idea was always for the center to provide the intellectual building blocks for a college with a strong [[humanities]] program, which [[Ivy League]] graduates in Israel, primarily from Princeton, had been hoping for since the late 1980s. The Center had translated classics such as ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', by [[Thomas Hobbes]], into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

The four-year degree program teaches a broad curriculum similar to those found in American liberal arts colleges. The college believes this contrasts with most universities in Israel, which it says were "founded by European immigrants and patterned on the classic German research university, [and] typically offer narrow training geared toward specific disciplines and careers."&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danielgordis.org/sitefiles/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Shalem-College-FAQs.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about Shalem College|publisher=Shalem Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831060359/http://danielgordis.org/sitefiles/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Shalem-College-FAQs.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college seeks to challenge the conventional Israeli student work ethic, in which many students—who earn their bachelor's degrees after completing military service and study while they are employed—treat class attendance as optional. The college plans to use financial incentives to encourage students to be active in campus life, including incentives to live close to campus.&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/182583/first-american-style-liberal-arts-college-opens-do/?p=all|title=First American-Style Liberal Arts College Opens Doors In Israel This Fall|author=Nathan Jeffay|publisher=The Forward|date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tuesday, each student must fulfill mandatory community service, helping nearby Jewish and Arab neighbors.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

A private, undergraduate degree-granting institution, Shalem College has pioneered the use of required courses for all students alongside a choice of major concentrations. The centerpiece of the college’s academic community, the Core—which includes courses in [[philosophy]], [[history]], the natural and social sciences, [[literature]], and the [[fine arts]]—is unique in its integration of the study of key Western and [[Jewish]] texts. The college follows the [[Great Books]] model, in which students are required to read sources directly, and in the context of small, participatory seminars. The core curriculum includes Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Durkheim and Einstein. Key texts from Jewish tradition are drawn from the Babylonian Talmud, Maimonides, Spinoza and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Sections of the Quran are also compulsory.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; After their first year, students will choose one of the two opening majors: the Interdisciplinary Program in Philosophy and Jewish Thought (IPJ), or Middle East and Islamic Studies (MEIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=6935]"Shalem Center in Jerusalem Recognized as Academic Center," [[Israel HaYom]], January 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other majors in the fields of law, government and diplomacy, economics, and literature are planned to be added as the college matures.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The language of instruction is Hebrew, however, students are required to read extensively in English. Additionally, MEIS students are expected to learn Arabic and IPJ students interested in pursuing graduate study are expected to undertake study of an additional language, such as Greek or German.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

==Students and faculty==
The list of faculty includes the philosopher and ethicist [[Asa Kasher]], co-author of the IDF’s Code of Conduct; the jurist and human-rights activist [[Ruth Gavison]]; the renowned scholar of Jewish thought Shalom Rosenberg; and the noted historian of Zionism Ehud Luz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalem.ac.il/en/academics/faculty/] Faculty list on Shalem College Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguished scholar of the Middle East [[Martin Kramer]] served as the college’s first president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=157391]"Martin Kramer Chosen to Serve as Founding President of Shalem College," [[Jerusalem Post]], October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shalem Center had a reputation for being dominated by immigrants from the United States, but the college has reportedly "broke[n] out of the Anglo mold."&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; The staff and student rosters span the political and religious spectrum, and the college is not affiliated with the ideology of the former research center.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt; Although no Arabs enrolled the first year, the school has made extensive efforts to boost diversity and recruit students from the Arab sector.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Shalem accepts candidates on the basis of exams, intellectual capabilities, and demonstrated commitment to public service. Accepted applicants receive substantial financial aid packages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shalem.ac.il/he/%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%AA/] Scholarship Information, Shalem College Website (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Curriculum==
In the college the Core Curriculum is required of all students, regardless of their major.&lt;ref&gt;http://shalem.ac.il/en/core-program/&lt;/ref&gt;
Students are required to read 72 classics works as part of the Core Curriculum.

The '''Sultanganj Buddha''' is a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]-[[Pala Empire|Pala]] transitional period sculpture, the largest substantially complete copper Buddha figure known from the time. The statue is dated by archaeologists to between 500 and 700 AD. It is 2.3 m high and 1 m wide and weighs over 500&amp;nbsp;kg. It was found in the [[North India]]n town of [[Sultanganj]], [[Bhagalpur district]], [[Bihar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/05/10/sultanganj_buddha_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861 during the construction  of the [[East Indian Railway]].&lt;ref name="Wingfield"&gt;Wingfield, Christopher (2010) Touching the Buddha: Encounters with a charismatic object. In Museum Materialities: Objects, Engagements, Interpretations, ed. Sandra H. Dudley, Routledge: London &amp; New York, pp.53-70. http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415492188/&lt;/ref&gt; It is now held by [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

==Description==
The Sultanganj Buddha was cast in pure, unrefined copper by the ''cire perdue'', or [[list-wax casting|lost wax]], technique. It stands with his right hand raised in ''[[abhayamudra]]'' (a gesture of reassurance or protection), and his left hand is held downwards with palm outwards, said to indicate granting a favour. The end of the monastic robe is held between the thumb and forefinger of this hand in the manner that is still practised by [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monks.

==Discovery and later history==
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha found.jpg|thumb|EB Harris with the Sultanganj Buddha. 1861/1862]]
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Stone statue of Buddha from Sultanganj in the [[British Museum]] Lotus petals inscribed with "[[Ye Dharma Hetu]]" mantra]]
E. B. Harris, the railway engineer who discovered the Buddha during excavations that he carried out on ancient remains near the Sultanganj station that he was constructing, published a detailed account of his work, complete with a site plan and photographs. He describes finding the right foot of the Buddha ten feet under the surface, beneath a floor he considered to have been used to conceal the statue after it had been toppled from its former place.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. B. (1864) Description of Buddhist Remains Discovered at Sooltangunge, London: privately published.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sent the statue to Birmingham, the cost of its transport to England being paid by Samuel Thornton, a Birmingham manufacturer of ironmongery. Thornton, himself a former mayor of Birmingham, offered it to the [[Birmingham City Council|Borough Council]] for their proposed Art Museum in 1864. In Birmingham, a town that boasted a thousand trades, the Art Museum was intended to be an exemplar and inspiration for local metalworkers and other artisans.

Over the years, it has been shown in a number of prominent locations throughout [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (BMAG) and remains an indispensable display item. It was the foundation donation to the collections and is BMAG's most treasured possession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1885A1116&lt;/ref&gt; Harris's report shows him with the Buddha and a number of smaller finds. They included two much smaller standing Buddhas in stone: one is now in the [[British Museum]] and the other in the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]. A stone Buddha head, also from Sultanganj, is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=5098&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39987&amp;plaA=39987-2-11&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/id/19594 Asian Art Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64237/head-of-the-buddha-sculpture-unknown/ Victoria and Albert Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
From 1998 to 2015, the Buddha was the centrepiece of a gallery at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery dedicated to displaying a number of Buddhas and related artefacts, and Birmingham Museum held an annual 'Buddha Day', when West Midlands-based Buddhist groups from a range of traditions would bless the statue.

During 2015, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery worked with representatives of a number of faith groups from the city on the creation of a new 'Faith Gallery', and the Sultanganj Buddha was moved from its previous location. It is now displayed in a new gallery that tells the story of the range of faiths that are practiced in Birmingham.

The '''Test of Economic Literacy''' or '''TEL''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in upper-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE) ) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEL is in its third edition and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from over 100 high schools across the United States.  The TEL has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

'''Toxgnostics''' is part of [[Personalized medicine]] as it describes the guiding principles for the discovery of [[pharmacogenomic]] biomarker tests, also referred to as [[companion diagnostic]] tests, which identify if an individual patient is likely to suffer severe drug toxicity from treatment with a specific therapeutic agent. Once at risk individuals are identified drug toxicity can be prevented using elective dose reduction or prescription of an alternative medication.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics&gt;Church D, Kerr R, Domingo E, Rosmarin D, Palles C, Maskell K, Tomlinson I, Kerr D (2014). "'Toxgnostics': an unmet need in cancer medicine". Nat Rev Cancer (6):440-5. doi:10.1038/nrc3729. {{PMID|24827503}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson R, Newport R, Kerr R, Kerr DJ (2014). "Toxgnostics:predicting and preventing chemotherapy-induced side effects." Personalised Medicine 11 (7):683-685. doi:10.2217/pme.14.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830384Kerr DJ Kerr. "Chemo Safety: Can Biomarkers Help?". Medscape Oncology, Kerr on Oncology. 28 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The majority of toxgnostic studies have been candidate gene studies restricted to the known Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion genes ([[ADME]]) of drug treated patients.  The PharmaADME consortium&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmaadme.org/joomla/ PharmaADME consortium. Michael S. Phillips Ph.D. Retrieved 30 Dec 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; identified 32 core genes containing 184 variants within common pathways that should be included in ADME candidate gene studies of toxicity biomarkers. Toxicity biomarkers that have been clinically validated using this restricted panel of genes include the [[P450 cytochrome]] assay that is currently recommended for routine clinical use of the oral anticoagulant warfarin. Using [[next-generation sequencing]] methods and [[genome-wide association studies]] a more comprehensive toxgnostic approach can be utilized through unbiased analysis of several million variants across the whole human genome, including introns and exons, for pharmacogenomic markers of drug induced toxicity.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;

Cancer drugs have been highlighted as particularly appropriate candidates for toxgnostic studies due to the significant toxicity profiles associated with both targeted therapies&lt;ref&gt;Widakowich C, de Castro G Jr, de Azambuja E, Dinh P, Awada A (2007). "Review: Side Effects of Approved Molecular Targeted Therapies in Solid Cancers". Oncologist (12):1443–1455.{{PMID|18165622}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Walko CM, McLeod H (2009). "Pharmacogenomic progress in individualized dosing of key drugs for cancer patients". Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (6):153-162.
doi:10.1038/ncponc1303.&lt;/ref&gt; Most cancer patients obtain only modest benefit from treatment, whereas toxicity is common and often associated with severe side effects which include considerable morbidity and mortality. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs [[5-fluorouracil]] (5FU) prescribed as [[adjuvant therapy]] following surgical resection of early stage [[colorectal cancer]] benefits only approx. 4% of patients, whereas 30–40% of those treated will suffer severe toxicity such as [[neutropenia]], [[mucositis]], [[hand-foot syndrome]], [[diarrhoea]], and [[stomatitis]], fatal toxicities will kill 0.5-1% of people treated.&lt;ref&gt;Quasar Collaborative Group, Gray R, Barnwell J, McConkey C, Hills RK, Williams NS, Kerr, DJ (2007)"Adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomised study." Lancet 370: 2020–2029. {{PMID|18083404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of toxgnostic screens a number of genetic variants have now been identified that can be used to predict 5FU toxicity prior to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosmarin D, Palles C, Pagnamenta A, Kaur K, Pita G, Martin M, Domingo E, Jones A, Howarth K, Freeman-Mills L, Johnstone E, Wang H, Love S, Scudder C, Julier P, Fernández-Rozadilla C, Ruiz-Ponte C, Carracedo A, Castellvi-Bel S, Castells A, Gonzalez-Neira A, Taylor J, Kerr R, Kerr D, Tomlinson I (2014). Gut. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306571. {{PMID|24647007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genetic variants can be used to identify the individuals predisposed to severe drug toxicity and the dose of 5FU chemotherapy can be reduced to prevent severe toxic side effects. Toxgnostic biomarker tests currently available for use in clinical practice include markers for [[irinotecan]], [[thioguanine]], [[warfarin]] and [[5FU]].

== Toxgnostic principles ==

Toxgnostic studies are defined by four key elements:&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;
# Analysis should be embedded within large, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials (i.e. [[Phase III clinical trials]])
# The phenotype of interest should be clinically relevant and clearly defined using internationally standardized criteria and systematically captured such as the US [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) [[Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events]] (CTCAE) grade 3–5 toxicity.
# Analysis should be unbiased to encompass the maximum relevant genomic diversity, rather than being limited by what is often a superficial understanding of the pathways involved in the [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]] of the agent.
# The performance of individual variants should be compared with that of a combined risk score, which may outperform each individual variant when they are analysed separately.

Appropriate analytical approaches for toxgnostic studies include [[candidate gene]] studies, [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] and [[whole genome sequencing]]. GWAS and whole genome sequencing are the most comprehensive approaches though careful considerations must be applied to the relevance, analysis and interpretation of the results to prevent over-fitting, which produces false-positive results, a proposed GWAS workflow is shown below.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;

[[File:Toxgnostic GWAS discovery pathway.png|center|frame|none|Proposed clinical trial paradigm for discovery of toxgnostics markers through GWAS.]]

== Regulatory oversight of toxgnostic tests ==

Toxicity biomarkers can be co-developed and co-approved with the respective drug as a [[companion diagnostic test]], this requires [[premarket approval]] (PMA). The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) IVD Companion Diagnostic Device guidance issued in draft 14 July 2011 states that a companion diagnostic test can be used to “Identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM262327.pdf |title=Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there are guidleines for the submission of pharmacogenomic studies from the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm126957.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901130414/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126957.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and draft guidance from the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2014/01/WC500160232.pdf |title=Guidance |date=10 January 2014 |website=www.ema.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Travel behavior''' is the study of what people do over [[geography|space]], and how people use [[transport]].

==Questions studied==
The questions studied in travel behavior are broad, and are probed through activity and [[time-use research]] studies, and surveys of travelers designed to reveal attitudes, behaviors and the gaps between them in relation to the sociological and environmental impacts of travel.

* How many [[trip generation|trips]] do people make?
* Where do they go? (What is the [[trip distribution|destination]]?)
* What [[mode choice|mode]] do they take?
* Who accompanies whom?
* When is the trip made? What is the schedule?
* What is the sequence or pattern of trips?
* What [[route assignment|route choices]] do people make?
* Why do people travel? (Why can't people stay at home and [[Telecommuting|telecommute]] or teleshop?)
* To what degree are people aware of the environmental and climate impacts of their travel choices?&lt;ref&gt;Hanna P., Scarles C., Cohen S.A., Adams M. (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Adams7/publication/289247229_Everyday_climate_discourses_and_sustainable_tourism/links/568a8a8308ae1e63f1fbd36d.pdf Everyday climate discourses and sustainable tourism]. Jrnl.  Sust. Tourism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hares A. (2009). [http://www.cstt.nl/userdata/file/PROCEEDINGS%20TTRA2009.pdf The role of climate change in the travel decisions of UK tourists]. CSTT 2009 conf: Transport and Tourism: Challenges, Issues and Conflicts.  pp.141-154. [http://www.cstt.nl/conferences].&lt;/ref&gt;
* To what degree and how do people rationalize the environmental and climate impacts causes by their travel?&lt;ref&gt;Higham J.E.S., Cohen S.A., Cavaliere C.T. (2014). [http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/782524/10/Higham,%20Cohen%20%26%20Cavaliere%202014.pdf Climate Change, Discretionary Air Travel, and the "Flyers' Dilemma"]. Jrnl Trav.

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699713001518]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where changes in travel behavior would be beneficial to society, how might those changes be promoted?&lt;ref&gt;Truong D., Hall C.M. (2015). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160921060118/http://202.191.120.147:8020/greenstone/collect/ebooks/index/assoc/HASH01e2.dir/doc.pdf Promoting voluntary behaviour change for sustainable tourism]. The Routledge handbook of tourism and sustainability. pp.266-280.

Other behavioral aspects of traveling, such as letting people get off before entering a vehicle, [[queue area|queueing]] behavior, etc. (See for example [[Shanghai Metro#Passenger behavior|Passenger behavior in Shanghai]])

==Data==
These questions can be answered descriptively using a [[travel journal|travel diary]], often part of a [[travel survey]] or travel behavior inventory.  Large metropolitan areas typically only do such surveys once every decade, though some cities are conducting panel surveys, which track the same people year after year.

That data is generally used to estimate [[transportation planning]] [[Scientific modelling|models]], so that transport analysts can make predictions about people who haven't been surveyed. This is important in [[forecasting]] [[traffic]], which depends on future changes to road networks, land use patterns, and policies.

Some years ago it was recognized that behavioral research was limited by data, and a special [[data set]] was developed to aid research:  The Baltimore Disaggregate Data Set which is the result an in depth survey,  ca. 1977.  Its title indicates today’s emphasis on disaggregated rather than aggregated data. This particular data set is believed lost.  A small program to preserve and make available on the web these travel behavior surveys, the [[Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive]], is now under way at the University of Minnesota. There is also the National Personal Transportation Survey (later National Household Travel Survey), conducted every five years or so, but with much less spatial detail.

==Travel behavior and activity analysis==
Analysis of travel behavior from the home can answer the question: How does the family participate in modern society. Consider two non-observable extremes.  At one extreme we have the non-specialized household.  It does everything for itself, and no travel is required.  Ultimate specialization is the other extreme; travel is required for all things.  Observed households are somewhere in between.  The “in between” position of households might be thought of as the consequence of two matters.

#	There is social and economic structure – the organization of society.  To participate in this society, the household specializes its occupations, education, social activities, etc.
#	The extent to which members of the household specialize turns on their attributes and resources.

Moore (1964) has observed that increasing specialization in all things is the chief feature of social change. Considering social changes, one might observe that 100 years ago things were less specialized compared to today.  So we would expect lots of change in household travel over the time period.  Data are not very good, but the travel time aspect of what’s available seems contrary to the expectation, travel hasn’t changed much.  For instance, the time spent on the [[journey to work]] may have been stable for centuries (the travel budget hypothesis).  Here are some travel time comparisons from John Robinson (1986).

Most travel behavior analysis concerns [[demand curve|demand]] issues and do not touch very much on [[supply and demand|supply]] issues.  Yet when we observe travel from a home, we are certainly observing some sort of [[market clearing]] process – demand and supply are matched.

==History of travel behavior analysis==
Analytic work on travel behavior can be dated from Liepmann (1945). Liepmann obtained and analyzed 1930s data on worker travel in [[England]].  Many of the insights current today were found by Liepmann:  time spent, ride sharing, etc. Most academics date modern work from advances in mode choice analysis made in the 1970s.  This created much excitement, and after some years an International Association for Travel Behaviour Research emerged.  There are about 150 members of the Association; it holds a conference every three years.  The proceedings of those conferences yield a nice record of advances in the field. The proceedings also provide a record of topics of lasting interest and of changing priorities.  Mode choice received priority early on, but in the main today’s work is not so much on theory as it is on practice.  [[Torsten Hägerstrand|Hagerstrand]] (1970) developed a time and space path analysis, often called the time-space prism.

==Gender Difference In Travel Patterns==
On November 18–20, 2004, Transportation Research Board (TRB) held its third conference in Chicago, Illinois, with an interest in advancing the understanding of women’s issues in transportation. One of the presented studies, conducted by Nobis et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trid.trb.org/view/773080 |title=Gender Differences in Travel Patterns: Role of Employment Status and Household Structure |author=Nobis, C.|author2= B. Lenz. |year=2004 |work=Research on Women's Issues in Transportation, Report of a Conference, Vol. 2: Technical Papers |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that the gender difference in travel patterns is linked to employment status, household structure, child care, and maintenance tasks. They found that travel patterns of men and women are much similar when considering single families; the differences are greater once males and females are compared in multi-person households without children; and are the highest once they live in households with children. Over the past two decades numerous studies have been conducted on travel behavior showing gender as an influential factor in travel decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women’s and Men’s Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropical geography''' refers to the study of places and people in the [[tropics]]. When it first emerged as a discipline, tropical geography was closely associated with [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]] of the [[Colonial empire|European empires]] as contributing scholars tended to portray the [[tropical]] places as "primitive" and people "uncivilised" and "inferior".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. "Illusory Riches": Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''. 21(1), 2000, 6-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of subjects has been discussed within the sub-field during late 18th to early 20th century including zoology, climatology, geomorphology, economics and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, H.R., 1977. ''Tropical geography: An introductory study of the humid tropics'', Macdonald and Evans,p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is now more commonly known as [[development geography]] as [[colonization]] had been replaced by [[economic development]] as the main ideological driver of international and global interactions since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}} Today, many scholars continue to use the term tropical geography to contest the determinism embedded in the term and de-exoticise the tropical countries and their inhabitants.

==Origins==
The origins of tropical geography can be traced back to as early as the fifteenth century when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] first discovered the Caribbean islands in tropical America. Subsequent writings of European explorers, merchants, naturalists, colonists and settlers who traveled to and lived in the tropics were the main sources of the study.

[[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] are some of the significant contributors. It is argued that it is due to their academic reputation and scientific approaches tropical geography was consolidated into an academic discipline widely studied in Europe in spite of the region's vast differences in vegetation, wild lives, climate, geology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. pp9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubled Representations==

The discourse on the tropics and their inhabitants have evolved over time in response to changing patterns of Europe's engagements in the tropics.

A variety of [[environmental determinism]] emerged from the sub-field as colonists and naturalists started representing temperate and tropical people with [[binaries]] like "progressive vs. backward," "civilised vs. primitive," "hard working vs. lazy" and "superior vs. inferior."&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177"&gt;Gilmartin, Mary, 2008. p177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], an invented concept, was convenient and readily applied in attempts to "[link] climatic variation closely to the supposed division of the human species into different 'races'".&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177" /&gt;

As activities of the European empires diversified in the 19th century, travelers and settlers who had experienced deadly tropical diseases and conflicts with the local peoples forged another representation of the tropical world as a place full of "dangers" and "horrors" to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile lands of the tropics were then interpreted as to have  obstacles for human morality and physical well-being preventing their inhabitants from technical, philosophical and artistic innovation. This dramatized and pessimistic representation reinforced Europe's superior position and enhanced the depiction of the tropics as an exotic other to the temperate world.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, V.R., 2004. Topicality Imagined and Experienced. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'', 25(1), 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether tropical geographers found the tropical places and people abundant and dynamic or deadly and barbaric. They understood them as inferior to the temperate and great Western civilizations. As criticized by [[Edward Said]] in his famous work ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', the literature of tropical geography served the interests of European scholars who were living in the temperate world to create an exotic other which in turn helped define themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward W., 2007. "Latent and Manifest Orientalism." ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings.'' pp45-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's tropical geography==

Until the mid 20th century, the imperialist, racist and Euro-centric version of tropical geography was still flourishing as influential works were still being published like ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' by geomorphologist [[Pierre Gourou]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, D. et al., 2009. ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'' 5th ed., Wiley-Blackwell, p.777.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950's onward, [[development geography]] replaced tropical geography as the sub-field of geography.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, J. &amp; Jeffrey, A. 2009. "Imperialism and Postcolonialism". ''Political Geography'' 2nd ed. Sage, London. pp169-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the studied regions were given new terminologies such as the "[[Third World]]" and the "[[global South]]."

Critical geographers argue the replacement of tropical geography by development geography marks the historical turning point of international intervention strategy from [[colonisation]] to [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70"&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Intervention: From Modernisation to Neo-liberalisation." Making Development Geography. Hodder Arnold. p70.&lt;/ref&gt; Though morphed into a different discipline, the ideological roots of tropical geography—superiority, progress, civilization and technological advancement of the West which originated and matured in the [[temperate]] zone—carry on and become the building blocks of mainstream economic development theories.&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70" /&gt;

Paralleled with the rise of critical approaches to other sub-fields of geography, [[development geography]] and tropical geography as academic disciplines have seen a movement away from the mainstream economistic and deterministic view of the tropical world in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Situated Knowledge." ''Making Development geography.'' Hodder Arnold. pp10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers now attend to the influences imperialism, racism and Euro-centrism have had on tropical geography while attempting to bring class, gender, race and religion into the broader picture to better understand the tropical world and its inhabitants.
 
Today the [[academic journal]] ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography. Available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9493 [Accessed November 23, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; continues to be a forum for tropical geographers to introduce and present new research and critique existing literature on the tropical world and people. Different from the historic absence of voices from the tropics, now many of the contributors of the ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'' are of tropical origins and study tropical countries and their citizens with more holistic and inclusive approaches.

'''Washback effect''' refers to the impact of testing on curriculum design, teaching practices, and learning behaviors.&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley &amp; Thompson|title=Washback Effect in Teaching English as an International Language|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/washback_effect_in_teaching_english_as_an_international_language_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of testing can be found in the choices of learners and teachers: teachers may teach directly for specific test preparation, or learners might focus on specific aspects of language learning found in assessments. Washback effect in testing is typically seen as either negative, or positive (sometimes referred to as ''washforward'').&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Washback may be considered harmful to more fluid approaches in [[language education]] where definitions of language ability may be limited; however, it may be considered beneficial when good teaching practices result. Washback can also be positive or negative in that it either maintains or hinders the accomplishment of educational goals. In positive washback, teaching the curriculum becomes the same as teaching to a specific test. Negative washback occurs in situations where there may be a mismatch between the stated goals of instruction and the focus of assessment; it may lead to the abandonment of instructional goals in favor of test preparation.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;

The effect of a test on learning and teaching is a concept discussed as early as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Research into washback can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the influence of tests on teaching and learning was first seen as a potential source of [[bias]] due to the accountability of test [[feedback loop|feedback loops]]. As the results of tests became more important to students ([[gatekeeper|gatekeepers]] to future prospects), teachers (evaluation), schools (funding), and states (lawsuits), test preparation as a function of teaching became essential. Tests were made to be economical, using [[multiple choice|multiple-choice questions]] and focusing on [[psychometrics|psychometric]] validity, but perhaps not measuring more complex abilities. Schools and teachers were accountable for student test performance, and thus focused on the skills and outcomes that the tests measured. Given the dynamic interaction between testing and education, the term systematic validity was used to refer to the ways in which a test leads to changes in instruction intended to develop cognitive skills that are being measured by a test.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Research has shown the variable extent to which washback influences different individuals in different ways, and the difficulty of targeting washback. Significant variability has been noted in the ways that teachers respond to test changes and classroom assessments. Effects may be superficial, indirect, and unpredictable due to individual differences in the way that learning is mediated by teachers, textbook writers, and publishers.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews, Fullilove, &amp; Wong|title=Targeting washback—a case study|journal=System|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=207-223|doi=10.1016/S0346-251X(02)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washback effect in English language assessment==
With [[globalization]], the world has witnessed an increase in [[Internationalization of Higher Education]], which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of international students in the last 25 years. The prominence of English alongside this internationalization process has also seen the use of international tests of English such as [[TOEIC|Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC)]], [[TOEFL|Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)]], and [[IELTS|International English Language Testing System (IELTS)]] as standard tools in the wider learning community. The increasing weight of these tools in education raises questions about the impact of such tests on teaching and learning, with suggestions that language skills are suffering due to the impact of tests. As English as an International Language (EIL) continues to become more stable through the establishment of clearer features of context-driven English, it is inevitable that there will be significant debate on language norms and proficiency regarding teaching and assessment. The field of applied linguistics should expect to see more specific discussion on the recognition of the way language norms are influenced by use and context,&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; but this remains an unsolved problem in the area of [[language assessment]].
