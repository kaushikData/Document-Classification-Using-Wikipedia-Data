'''36''' ('''thirty-six''') is the [[natural number]] following [[35 (number)|35]] and preceding [[37 (number)|37]].

==In mathematics==
36 is both the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of six and a [[triangular number]], making it a [[square triangular number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001110|title=Sloane's A001110 : Square triangular numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest square triangular number other than one, and it is also the only triangular number other than one whose [[square root]] is also a triangular number. It is also a [[circular number]]- a square number that ends with the same integer by itself (6×6=3'''6''').

It is the smallest number ''n'' with exactly eight solutions to the equation [[Euler's phi function|φ]](''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''. Being the smallest number with exactly nine [[divisor]]s, 36 is a [[highly composite number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding up some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 6, 12, and 18) gives 36, hence 36 is a [[semiperfect number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005835|title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This number is the sum of a [[twin prime]] pair (17&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;19), the sum of the cubes of the first three positive [[integer]]s, and also the product of the squares of the first three positive integers.

36 is the number of degrees in the [[interior angle]] of each tip of a regular [[pentagram]].

The [[thirty-six officers problem]] is a [[mathematical puzzle]].

The number of possible outcomes (not summed) in the roll of two distinct [[dice]].

36 is the largest numeric base that some computer systems support because it exhausts the numerals, 0-9, and the letters, A-Z. See [[Base 36]].

The [[truncated cube]] and the [[truncated octahedron]] are [[Archimedean solid]]s with 36 edges.

The number of [[domino tiling]]s of a 4×4 [[checkerboard]] is 36.

Since it is possible to find sequences of 36 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 36 is an [[Erdős–Woods number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A059756|title=Sloane's A059756 : Erdős-Woods numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of the integers from 1 to 36 is [[666 (number)|666]] (see [[number of the beast]]).

== In religion ==
* Jewish tradition holds that the number 36 has had special significance since the beginning of time: According to the [[Midrash]], the light created by God on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]] shone for exactly 36 hours; it was replaced by the light of the [[Sun]] that was created on the Fourth Day.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt; The [[Torah]] commands 36 times to love, respect and protect the stranger.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt; Furthermore, in every generation there are 36 [[Tzadikim Nistarim|righteous people]] (the ''"Lamed Vav Tzadikim"'') in whose merit the world continues to exist.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Thirty-six|author=[[Pinchas Winston]]|isbn=0-9698032-4-9|year=1995|publisher=Mercava Productions|url=http://www.neveh.org/winston/wonder36/default.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern celebration of [[Hanukkah]], 36 candles are kindled in the menorah over the eight days of that holiday (not including the ''shamash'' candle).&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

'''Adjacent Channel Power Ratio''' ('''ACPR''') is [[ratio]] between the total power of [[adjacent channel]] ([[intermodulation]] [[signal]]) to the main channel's power (useful signal).

==Ratio==
The ratio between the total power adjacent channel (intermodulation signal) to the main channel's power (useful signal). There are two ways of measuring ACPR. The first way is by finding 10*log of the ratio of the total output [[power (physics)|power]] to the power in adjacent channel. The second (and much more popular method) is to find the ratio of the output power in a smaller bandwidth around the center of carrier to the power in the adjacent channel. The smaller bandwidth is equal to the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the adjacent channel signal. Second way is more popular, because it can be measured easily.

ACPR is desired to be as low as possible. A high ACPR indicates that significant spectral spreading has occurred.

"'''Analysis Situs'''" is a seminal [[mathematics]] paper that [[Henri Poincaré]] published in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré published five supplements to the paper between 1899 and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré 1899; Poincaré 1900; Poincaré 1902a; Poincaré 1902b; Poincaré 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers provided the first systematic treatment of [[topology]] and revolutionized the subject by using algebraic structures to distinguish between non-[[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] [[topological space]]s, founding the field of [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieudonné 1989: 15–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré's papers introduced the concepts of the [[fundamental group]] and [[simplicial homology]], provided an early formulation of the [[Poincaré duality]] [[theorem]], introduced the [[Euler characteristic|Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] for [[chain complex]]es, and raised several important conjectures, including the celebrated [[Poincaré conjecture]], which was later proven as a theorem. The 1895 paper coined the mathematical term "[[homeomorphism]]".

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[functional analysis]] and [[order theory]], a '''Banach lattice''' &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riesz space]] with a norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space and for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; the implication &lt;math&gt;|x| \le |y| \Rightarrow \|x\| \le \|y\|&lt;/math&gt; holds, where as usual &lt;math&gt;|x| := x \vee -x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples and constructions ==

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, together with its absolute value as a norm, is a Banach lattice.
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; a Banach lattice and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt; the space of bounded, continuous functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty := \sup_{x \in X} \|f(x)\|_Y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a Banach lattice with the pointwise order &lt;math&gt;f \le g :\Leftrightarrow \forall x \in X: f(x) \le g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Boolean operators==
Most [[programming language]]s have the Boolean operators [[Logical disjunction|OR]], [[Logical conjunction|AND]] and [[Negation|''not'']]; in [[C (programming language)|C]] and some newer languages, these are represented by "||" (double pipe character), "&amp;&amp;" (double [[ampersand]]) and "!"

==Examples==

*The expression "5 &gt; 3" is evaluated as '''true'''.
*The expression "3 &gt; 5" is evaluated as '''false'''. 
*"5&gt;=3" and "3&lt;=5" are equivalent Boolean expressions, both of which are evaluated as '''true'''.
*"typeof true" returns "boolean" and "typeof false" returns "boolean"
*Of course, most Boolean expressions will contain at least one variable (X &gt; 3), and often more (X &gt; Y).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">The '''[[Richard Bruck|Bruck]]–[[H. J. Ryser|Ryser]]–[[Sarvadaman Chowla|Chowla]] theorem''' is a result on the [[combinatorics]] of [[block design]]s. It states that if a (''v'', ''b'', ''r'', ''k'', λ)-design exists with ''v = b'' (a [[Block design#Symmetric BIBDs|symmetric block design]]), then: 
* if ''v'' is even, then ''k'' &amp;minus; λ is a square;
* if ''v'' is odd, then the following [[Diophantine equation]] has a nontrivial solution:
*: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; (''k'' &amp;minus; λ)''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;(v&amp;minus;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt; λ ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

The theorem was proved in the case of projective planes in {{Harv|Bruck|Ryser|1949}}. It was extended to symmetric designs in {{Harv|Ryser|Chowla|1950}}.

== Projective planes ==
In the special case of a symmetric design with λ = 1, that is, a [[projective plane]], the theorem (which in this case is referred to as the '''Bruck–Ryser theorem''') can be stated as follows: If a finite projective plane of order ''q'' exists and ''q'' is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 4), then ''q'' must be the sum of two squares.  Note that for a projective plane, the design parameters are ''v'' = ''b'' = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q'' + 1, ''r'' = ''k'' = ''q'' + 1, λ = 1. Thus, ''v'' is always odd in this case.

The theorem, for example, rules out the existence of projective planes of orders 6 and 14 but allows the existence of planes of orders 10 and 12.  Since a projective plane of order 10 has been shown not to exist using a combination of coding theory and large-scale computer search,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Browne, Malcolm W.|authorlink=Malcolm Browne|title=Is a Math Proof a Proof If No One Can Check It?|date=20 December 1988|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/science/is-a-math-proof-a-proof-if-no-one-can-check-it.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the condition of the theorem is evidently not sufficient for the existence of a design.  However, no stronger general non-existence criterion is known.

== Connection with incidence matrices ==
The existence of a symmetric (''v'', ''b'', ''r'', ''k'', λ)-design is equivalent to the existence of a ''v'' × ''v'' [[incidence matrix]] ''R'' with elements 0 and 1 satisfying 

: {{math|1=''R'' ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = (''k'' &amp;minus; λ)''I'' + λ''J''}}

where {{mvar|I}} is the ''v'' × ''v'' identity matrix and ''J'' is the ''v'' × ''v'' all-1 matrix.  In essence, the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem is a statement of the necessary conditions for the existence of a ''rational'' ''v'' × ''v'' matrix ''R'' satisfying this equation.  In fact, the conditions stated in the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem are not merely necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of such a rational matrix ''R''.  They can be derived from the [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] on the rational equivalence of quadratic forms.

'''Chike Obi''' (April 17, 1921 – March 13, 2008) was a Nigerian politician, mathematician and professor.

The [[African Mathematics Union]] suggests that he was the first Nigerian to hold a doctorate in mathematics. Dr. Obi's early research dealt mainly with the question of the existence of periodic solutions of non-linear ordinary differential equations. He successfully used the perturbation technique, and several of his publications greatly helped to stimulate research interest in this subject throughout the world and have become classics in the literature.

Obi is the author of several books and journals on [[mathematics]] and Nigerian politics.

==Early life and education==
Obi was educated in various parts of [[Nigeria]] before reading [[mathematics]] as an external student of the [[University of London]]. Immediately after his first degree, he won a scholarship to do research study at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], followed by doctoral studies at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], United States, becoming in 1950, the first Nigerian to receive a PhD in mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Career as mathematician==
Obi returned to lecture at the premier Nigerian [[University of Ibadan]]. He was soon diverted from this by political activities. After the war, he returned to lecture in 1970 at the [[University of Lagos]] where he quickly rose to the senior academic role of a professor.

He left [[Lagos]] to return to his root in the city of [[Onitsha]], establishing the [[Nanna Institute for Scientific Studies]].

Obi had won the [[Sigvard Eklund Prize]] for original work in differential equation from the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]. He was a [[university]] teacher until his retirement as an [[Emeritus]] [[Professor]] in 1985.

In 1997, Obi claimed to be the third person to solve [[Fermat’s Last Theorem]] after [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/413784.stm|title=World: Africa -  Africa Media Watch|date=6 August  1999|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 August 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also claimed to have found an elementary proof to [[Fermat’s Last Theorem]]. This work was carried out at his [[Nanna Institute for Scientific]] Studies in [[Onitsha]], [[Eastern Nigeria]] and published in Algebras, Groups and Geometries.&lt;ref&gt;C. Obi , "Fermat's Last Theorem", Algebras, Groups and Geometries, Vol. 15, Special issue No. 3, 1998,  p.289-298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/obi-chike-fermat.html|title=Chike Obi and Fermat's Last Theorem|website=www.math.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://waado.org/NigerDelta/Memorials/chike_obi_madunagu.html Professor Chike Obi] The Guardian, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, a review of this proof published in [[Mathematical Reviews]] indicates that it was a false proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/obi-chike-fermat-review.html|title=review of Obi's proof of Fermat's Last Thoerem|website=www.math.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/obi_chike.html|title=Chike Edozien Umuezei Obi, Mathematician of the African Diaspora|website=www.math.buffalo.edu|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in politics and activism==
Obi helped form the Dynamic Party of Nigeria, of which he served as its first secretary-general.&lt;!--{{Cite journal |last = Mphahlele |first = Ezekiel |year = 1960 |title = Nigeria on the Eve of Independence |journal = [[Africa Today]] |volume = 7 |number = 6 |pages = 4–6 |jstor = 4184128 }}--&gt; After the party merged with the larger National Council of Nigerian and Cameroon, Obi was elected as part of the Nigerian delegation that negotiated the country’s path to self-rule at two London conferences in 1957 and 1958.

After [[Nigeria]]’s [[independence]] from Britain in 1960, Obi was elected a [[legislator]] in the Eastern House of Assembly in 1960, he refused to vacate his seat in the national legislature in Lagos, the Speaker of the regional house ordered that Obi be physically removed by security agents. This order was obeyed and Obi decided to commit himself to regional affairs.

In 1962, Obi was arrested and charged with [[treason]] in a closed trial organized by the then national civilian government, who accused him and others, including the main opposition leader at the time, [[Obafemi Awolowo]], of plotting to overthrow the government. He was later released for “want of evidence.”

When the [[Nigerian Civil War]] broke out in 1967, Obi sided with [[Biafra]], working for the rebel leader [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]]. For a brief period in the 1970s when he served in the [[National Revenue Mobilization Commission]].

Obi derided [[religion]] and [[ethnic]] [[extremism]], and the culture of [[Political corruption|corruption]] pervading the Nigerian political class. He was a national newspaper columnist in the 1980s, writing under the title, "I speak For the People."

==Awards==
A visiting professor to the [[University of Rhode Island]], USA, the [[University of Jos]], Nigeria, and the [[Chinese Academy of Science]], Obi was a recipient of the national honour of Commander of the [[Order of the Niger]] (CON) and a Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science.

==Personal life==
When Obi died in 2008 he was survived by his wife until 2010. Obi's wife Belinda died in early 2010 a nurse and they are survived by their four children.

The circle on the right (blue and violet) is H(Y), with the blue being H(Y&amp;#x7C;X). The violet is the [[mutual information]] I(X;Y).]]

In [[information theory]], the '''conditional entropy''' (or '''equivocation''') quantifies the amount of information needed to describe the outcome of a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given that the value of another random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is known. Here, information is measured in [[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]s, [[Nat (unit)|nat]]s, or [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]]s. The ''entropy of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is written as &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt;be the [[Shannon Entropy|entropy]] of the discrete random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on the discrete random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; taking a certain value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have [[probability mass function]] &lt;math&gt;p_Y{(y)}&lt;/math&gt;. The unconditional entropy of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;is calculated as &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y) := \mathbb{E}[\operatorname{I}(Y)]&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^n {\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y_i)\,\mathrm{I}(y_i)} 
= -\sum_{i=1}^n {p_Y(y_i) \log_2{p_Y(y_i)}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(y_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[information content]] of the [[Outcome (probability)|outcome]] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; taking the value &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;. The entropy of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; taking the value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;is defined analogously by [[conditional expectation]]: 

&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X=x) = \mathbb{E}[\operatorname{I}(Y)|X=x]
= -\sum_{i=1}^n {\Pr(Y = y_i|X=x) \log_2{\Pr(Y = y_i|X=x)}}. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt; is the result of averaging &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt; over all possible values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may take.

Given [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variables]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with [[Support (mathematics)|image]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with image &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Y&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional entropy of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the weighted sum of &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt; for each possible value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, using  &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; as the weights:&lt;ref name=cover1991&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-471-06259-6 | year=1991|authorlink1=Thomas M.

\begin{align}
\Eta(Y|X)\ &amp;\equiv \sum_{x\in\mathcal X}\,p(x)\,\Eta(Y|X=x)\\
&amp; =-\sum_{x\in\mathcal X} p(x)\sum_{y\in\mathcal Y}\,p(y|x)\,\log\, p(y|x)\\

&amp; =-\sum_{x\in\mathcal X, y\in\mathcal Y}p(x,y)\log \frac {p(x,y)} {p(x)}. \\
&amp; = \sum_{x\in\mathcal X, y\in\mathcal Y}p(x,y)\log \frac {p(x)} {p(x,y)}. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph is incorrect; the last line is not the KL divergence between any two distributions, since p(x) is [in general] not a valid distribution over the domains of X and Y. The last formula above is the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]], also known as relative entropy. Relative entropy is always positive, and vanishes if and only if &lt;math&gt;p(x,y) = p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is when knowing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tells us everything about &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  ADDED: Could this comment be out of date since the KL divergence is not mentioned above? November 2014 --&gt;
''Note:'' It is understood that the expressions &lt;math&gt;0 \log 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \log c/0&lt;/math&gt; for fixed &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; should be treated as being equal to zero. &lt;!-- because p(x,y) could still equal 0 even if p(x) != 0 and p(y) != 0. What about p(x,y)=p(x)=0? --&gt;

==Properties==
===Conditional entropy equals zero===
&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X)=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the value of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is completely determined by the value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conditional entropy of independent random variables===
Conversely, &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X) = \Eta(Y)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent random variables]].

===Chain rule===
Assume that the combined system determined by two random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[joint entropy]] &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, we need &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information on average to describe its exact state. Now if we first learn the value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have gained &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information. Once &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is known, we only need &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X,Y)-\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt; bits to describe the state of the whole system. This quantity is exactly &lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the ''chain rule'' of conditional entropy:

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X)\, = \, \Eta(X,Y)- \Eta(X).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|17}}

The chain rule follows from the above definition of conditional entropy:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\Eta(Y|X) &amp;= \sum_{x\in\mathcal X, y\in\mathcal Y}p(x,y)\log \left(\frac{p(x)}{p(x,y)} \right) \\[4pt]
 &amp;= -\sum_{x\in\mathcal X, y\in\mathcal Y}p(x,y)\log (p(x,y)) + \sum_{x\in\mathcal X, y\in\mathcal Y}{p(x,y)\log(p(x))} \\[4pt]
 &amp; = \Eta(X,Y) + \sum_{x \in \mathcal X} p(x)\log (p(x) ) \\[4pt]
 &amp; = \Eta(X,Y) - \Eta(X). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, a chain rule for multiple random variables holds:

:&lt;math&gt; \Eta(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n) =
 \sum_{i=1}^n \Eta(X_i | X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|22}}

It has a similar form to [[Chain rule (probability)]] in probability theory, except that addition instead of multiplication is used.

===Bayes' rule===
[[Bayes' rule]] for conditional entropy states
:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X) \,=\, \Eta(X|Y) - \Eta(X) + \Eta(Y).&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof.'' &lt;math&gt;H(Y|X) = H(X,Y) - H(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(X|Y) = H(Y,X) - H(Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Symmetry entails &lt;math&gt;H(X,Y) = H(Y,X)&lt;/math&gt;. Subtracting the two equations implies Bayes' rule.

If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Conditional independence|conditionally independent]] of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X,Z) \,=\, \Eta(Y|X).&lt;/math&gt;

===Other properties===
For any &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
  \Eta(Y|X) &amp;\le \Eta(Y) \, \\
  \Eta(X,Y) &amp;= \Eta(X|Y) + \Eta(Y|X) + \operatorname{I}(X;Y),\qquad \\
  \Eta(X,Y) &amp;= \Eta(X) + \Eta(Y) - \operatorname{I}(X;Y),\, \\
  \operatorname{I}(X;Y) &amp;\le \Eta(X),\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mutual information]] between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

For independent &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(Y|X) = \Eta(Y) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X|Y) = \Eta(X) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Although the specific-conditional entropy &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X|Y=y)&lt;/math&gt; can be either less or greater than &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt; for a given [[random variate]] &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X|Y)&lt;/math&gt; can never exceed &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Conditional differential entropy ==
=== Definition ===
The above definition is for discrete random variables and no more valid in the case of continuous random variables. The continuous version of discrete conditional entropy is called ''conditional differential (or continuous) entropy''. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous random variables with a [[joint probability density function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The differential conditional entropy &lt;math&gt;h(X|Y)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;h(X|Y) = -\int_{\mathcal X, \mathcal Y} f(x,y)\log f(x|y)\,dx dy&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|249}}

=== Properties ===
In contrast to the conditional entropy for discrete random variables, the conditional differential entropy may be negative.

As in the discrete case there is a chain rule for differential entropy:
:&lt;math&gt;h(Y|X)\,=\,h(X,Y)-h(X)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|253}}
Notice however that this rule may not be true if the involved differential entropies do not exist or are infinite.

Joint differential entropy is also used in the definition of the [[mutual information]] between continuous random variables:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X,Y)=h(X)-h(X|Y)=h(Y)-h(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h(X|Y) \le h(X)&lt;/math&gt; with equality if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are independent.&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|253}}

===Relation to estimator error===
The conditional differential entropy yields a lower bound on the expected squared error of an [[Estimator|estimator]]. For any random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, observation &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and estimator &lt;math&gt;\widehat{X}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds:&lt;ref name=cover1991 /&gt;{{rp|255}}
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbb{E}\left[\bigl(X - \widehat{X}{(Y)}\bigr)^2\right] 
 \ge \frac{1}{2\pi e}e^{2h(X|Y)}&lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the [[uncertainty principle]] from [[quantum mechanics]].

==Generalization to quantum theory==
In [[quantum information theory]], the conditional entropy is generalized to the [[conditional quantum entropy]]. The latter can take negative values, unlike its classical counterpart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6330">In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], '''contingency''' is the status of [[proposition]]s that are neither true under every possible [[interpretation (logic)|valuation]] (i.e. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]) nor false under every possible valuation (i.e. [[contradiction]]s). A contingent proposition is neither [[necessarily true]] nor necessarily false. Propositions that are contingent may be so because they contain [[logical connective]]s which, along with the [[truth value]] of any of its [[atomic sentence|atomic]] parts, determine the truth value of the proposition. This is to say that the truth value of the proposition is ''contingent'' upon the truth values of the sentences which comprise it. Contingent propositions depend on the [[fact]]s, whereas [[analytic proposition]]s are true without regard to any facts about which they speak.

Along with contingent propositions, there are at least three other classes of propositions, some of which overlap:
* '''[[Tautology (logic)|Tautological]]''' propositions, which ''must'' be true, no matter what the circumstances are or could be (example: "It is the case that the sky is blue or it is not the case that the sky is blue.").
* '''[[Contradiction]]s''' which must necessarily be untrue, no matter what the circumstances are or could be (example: "It's raining and it's not raining.").
* '''[[Possible worlds|Possible]]''' propositions, which are true or ''could'' have been true given certain circumstances (examples: x&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4; ''There are only three planets''; ''There are more than three planets''). All necessarily true propositions, and all contingent propositions, are also possible propositions.

==Contingency and relativism in rhetoric==
Attempts in the past by [[philosopher]]s and [[rhetoric]]ians to allocate to rhetoric its own realm have ended with attempting to contain rhetoric within the domain of contingent and [[relativism|relative]] matters. [[Aristotle]] explained in [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|''Rhetoric'']], "The duty of rhetoric is to deal with such matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us..."&lt;ref name="aristotle1954"&gt;Aristotle. Rhetoric. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. New York: Random House, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle stresses the contingent because no one deliberates on the necessary or impossible. He believed that the "unavoidable and potentially unmanageable presence of multiple possibilities" or the complex nature of decisions creates and invites rhetoric.&lt;ref name="aristotle1954"/&gt; Aristotle's view challenges the view of [[Plato]], who said that rhetoric had no subject matter except for deceit, and gives rhetoric its position at the pinnacle of political debate.

Contemporary scholars argue that if rhetoric is merely about the contingent, it automatically excludes that which is either necessary or impossible. The "necessary" is that which either must be done or will inevitably be done. The "impossible" is that which will never be done; therefore, it will not be deliberated over. For example, the [[United States Congress]] will not convene tomorrow to discuss something necessary, such as whether or not to hold elections, or something impossible, such as outlawing death. Congress convenes to discuss problems, different solutions to those problems, and the consequences of each solution.

This again raises the question of contingency because that which is deemed necessary or impossible depends almost entirely on [[time]] and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. In [[United States history]], there was a time when even a [[congressman]] who opposed [[slavery]] would conclude that its retraction would be impossible. The same held true for those who favored [[women's suffrage]]. Today in the United States, slavery has been abolished and women have the right to vote. In this way, although rhetoric viewed across time is entirely contingent and includes a broader definition, rhetoric taken moment-by-moment is much more narrow and excludes both the necessary and the impossible. When faced with decisions, people will choose one option at the exclusion of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaonkar, Dilip Parameshwar. "Contingency and Probability." Encyclopedia of Rhetoric. Ed. Thomas O. Sloane. New York: Oxford UP, 2001. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; This inevitably produces unforeseen consequences. Because of these consequences, decision makers must deliberate and choose. Another problem arises when one asks where this knowledge of what issues are "necessary" and "impossible" originates and how the knowledge can be applied to others.

Rhetorician Robert L. Scott answers this problem by asserting that while rhetoric is indeed contingent and relative, it is also [[epistemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert L. "On Viewing Rhetoric As Epistemic." Central States Speech Journal 18 (1967), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Scott, what should be debated is a matter of rhetoric, as individuals make meaning through language and determine what constitutes truth, and therefore, what is beyond question and debate. Theorist [[Lloyd Bitzer]] makes five assumptions about rhetoric in his book ''Rhetoric, Philosophy, and Literature: An Exploration''.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, Lloyd F. "Rhetoric and Public Knowledge." Rhetoric, Philosophy and Literature: An Exploration. Ed. D.M. Burks, p.70. West Lafayette, IN, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Rhetoric is a method for inquiring into and communicating about the contingent.
# This inquiry does not yield certain knowledge, but only opinion.
# The proper mode of working in this realm is deliberation that relies on reasonable judgment.
# This deliberation and decision making is audience centered.
# This engagement with the audience is constrained by time.

The study of contingency and relativism as it pertains to rhetoric draws from [[poststructuralist]] and postfoundationalist theory. [[Richard Rorty]] and [[Stanley Fish]] are leading theorists in this area of study at the intersection of rhetoric and contingency&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R., 1989. Contingency, irony, and solidarity. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''cryptanalytic computer''' is a [[computer]] designed to be used for [[cryptanalysis]], which nowadays involves massive statistical analysis and multiple trial decryptions that since before [[World War II]]  are possible only with automated equipment.  Polish cryptanalysts designed and built automated aids in their work on [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] traffic. Arguably, the first modern computer (digital, electronic, and somewhat programmable) was built for cryptanalytic work at [[Bletchley Park]] (the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]]) during the war. More modern computers were important after World War II, and some machines (like the [[Cray-1]]) are reported{{according to whom|date=March 2012}} to have had machine instructions hardwired in at the request of [[NSA]].

Computers continue to be important in cryptanalysis well into the 21st century. NSA, in fact, is said to have the largest number of installed computers on the planet. Whether or not this is true in an age of [[Google]] computer farms and such remains publicly unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16237">The [[Schwarzschild solution]] describes [[spacetime]] in the vicinity of a non-rotating massive spherically-symmetric object.  Of the solutions to the [[Einstein field equations]], it is considered by some to be one of the simplest and most useful.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  

== Assumptions and notation ==

Working in a [[coordinate chart]] with coordinates &lt;math&gt; \left(r, \theta, \phi, t \right)&lt;/math&gt; labelled 1 to 4 respectively, we begin with the metric in its most general form (10 independent components, each of which is a smooth function of 4 variables). The solution is assumed to be spherically symmetric, static and vacuum. For the purposes of this article, these assumptions may be stated as follows (see the relevant links for precise definitions):

# A [[spherically symmetric spacetime]] is one that is invariant under rotations and taking the mirror image.
# A [[static spacetime]] is one in which all metric components are independent of the time coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (so that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac\partial{\partial t}g_{\mu \nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the geometry of the spacetime is unchanged under a time-reversal &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow -t&lt;/math&gt;.
# A [[Einstein field equation|vacuum solution]] is one that satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt;. From the [[Einstein field equations]] (with zero [[cosmological constant]]), this implies that &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt; since [[Tensor contraction|contracting]] &lt;math&gt; R_{ab}-\tfrac{R}{2} g_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;R = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[Metric signature]] used here is (+,+,+,−).

== Diagonalising the metric ==

The first simplification to be made is to diagonalise the metric. Under the [[coordinate transformation]], &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, \phi, t) \rightarrow (r, \theta, \phi, -t)&lt;/math&gt;, all metric components should remain the same. The metric components &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 4}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 4&lt;/math&gt;) change under this transformation as:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 4}'=\frac{\partial x^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{'\mu}} \frac{\partial x^{\beta}}{\partial x^{'4}} g_{\alpha \beta}= -g_{\mu 4}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 4&lt;/math&gt;)

But, as we expect &lt;math&gt;g'_{\mu 4}= g_{\mu 4}&lt;/math&gt; (metric components remain the same), this means that:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 4}=\, 0&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 4&lt;/math&gt;)

Similarly, the coordinate transformations &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, \phi, t) \rightarrow (r, \theta, -\phi, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, \phi, t) \rightarrow (r, -\theta, \phi, t)&lt;/math&gt; respectively give:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 3}=\, 0&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 3&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 2}=\, 0&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu \ne 2&lt;/math&gt;)

Putting all these together gives:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu }=\, 0 &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; \mu  \ne \nu &lt;/math&gt;)

and hence the metric must be of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\,  g_{11}\,d r^2 + g_{22} \,d \theta ^2 + g_{33} \,d \phi ^2 + g_{44} \,dt ^2&lt;/math&gt;

where the four metric components are independent of the time coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (by the static assumption).

== Simplifying the components ==

On each [[hypersurface]] of constant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, constant &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and constant &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., on each radial line), &lt;math&gt;g_{11}&lt;/math&gt; should only depend on &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (by spherical symmetry). Hence &lt;math&gt;g_{11}&lt;/math&gt; is a function of a single variable:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{11}=A\left(r\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A similar argument applied to &lt;math&gt;g_{44}&lt;/math&gt; shows that:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{44}=B\left(r\right)&lt;/math&gt;

On the hypersurfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and constant &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, it is required that the metric be that of a 2-sphere:

:&lt;math&gt;dl^2=r_{0}^2 (d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta\, d \phi^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing one of these hypersurfaces (the one with radius &lt;math&gt;r_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, say), the metric components restricted to this hypersurface (which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{22}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;) should be unchanged under rotations through &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (again, by spherical symmetry). Comparing the forms of the metric on this hypersurface gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{22}\left(d \theta^2 + \frac{\tilde{g}_{33}}{\tilde{g}_{22}} \,d \phi^2 \right) = r_{0}^2 (d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \,d \phi^2)&lt;/math&gt;

which immediately yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{22}=r_{0}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{33}=r_{0}^2 \sin ^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

But this is required to hold on each hypersurface; hence,

:&lt;math&gt;g_{22}=\, r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{33}=\, r^2 \sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative intuitive way to see that &lt;math&gt;g_{22}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{33}&lt;/math&gt; must be the same as for a flat spacetime is that stretching or 
compressing an elastic material in a spherically symmetric manner (radially), will not increase the angular distance between two points.

Thus, the metric can be put in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=A\left(r\right)dr^2+r^2\,d \theta^2+r^2 \sin^2 \theta \,d \phi^2 + B\left(r\right) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as yet undetermined functions of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero at some point, the metric would be [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] at that point.

== Calculating the Christoffel symbols ==
Using the metric above, we find the [[Christoffel symbols]], where the indices are &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3,4)=(r,\theta,\phi,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The sign &lt;math&gt;'&lt;/math&gt; denotes a total derivative of a function.
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{ik} = \begin{bmatrix}
A'/\left( 2A \right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -r/A &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -r \sin^2 \theta /A &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -B'/\left( 2A \right) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2_{ik} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1/r &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
1/r &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin\theta\cos\theta &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^3_{ik} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1/r &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cot\theta &amp; 0\\
1/r &amp; \cot\theta &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^4_{ik} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; B'/\left( 2B \right)\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
B'/\left( 2B \right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Using the field equations to find ''A(r)'' and ''B(r)'' ==

To determine &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Einstein's field equation|vacuum field equations]] are employed:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha\beta}=\, 0&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;{\Gamma^\rho_{\beta\alpha,\rho}} - \Gamma^\rho_{\rho\alpha,\beta}
+ \Gamma^\rho_{\rho\lambda} \Gamma^\lambda_{\beta\alpha}
- \Gamma^\rho_{\beta\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\alpha}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where a comma is used to set off the index that is being used for the derivative. Only three of these equations are nontrivial and upon simplification become:

&lt;math&gt;4 A' B^2 - 2 r B'' AB + r A' B'B + r B' ^2 A=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r A'B + 2 A^2 B - 2AB - r B' A=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; - 2 r B'' AB + r A' B'B + r B' ^2 A - 4B' AB=0&lt;/math&gt;

(the fourth equation is just &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt; times the second equation), where the prime means the ''r'' derivative of the functions. Subtracting the first and third equations produces:

&lt;math&gt;A'B +A B'=0 \Rightarrow A(r)B(r) =K&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero real constant. Substituting &lt;math&gt;A(r)B(r) \,  =K&lt;/math&gt; into the second equation and tidying up gives:

&lt;math&gt;r A' =A(1-A)&lt;/math&gt;

which has general solution:

&lt;math&gt;A(r)=\left(1+\frac{1}{Sr}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

for some non-zero real constant &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the metric for a static, spherically symmetric vacuum solution is now of the form:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\left(1+\frac{1}{S r}\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d \phi^2)+K \left(1+\frac{1}{S r}\right)dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the spacetime represented by the above metric is [[asymptotically flat]], i.e. as &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the metric approaches that of the [[Minkowski metric]] and the spacetime manifold resembles that of [[Minkowski space]].

== Using the weak-field approximation to find ''K'' and ''S'' ==
[[File:Weak_field_approximation_diagram.svg|thumbnail|300px|This diagram gives the route to find the Schwarzschild solution by using weak field approximation. The equality on the second row gives ''g''&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; = -''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''GM''/''r'', assuming the desired solution degenerates to Minkowski metric when the motion happens far away from the blackhole (''r'' approaches to positive infinity).]]
The geodesics of the metric (obtained where &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; is extremised) must, in some limit (e.g., toward infinite speed of light), agree with the solutions of Newtonian motion (e.g., obtained by [[Lagrange equations]]). (The metric must also limit to [[Minkowski space]] when the mass it represents vanishes.)

&lt;math&gt;0=\delta\int\frac{ds}{dt}dt=\delta\int(KE+PE_g)dt&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;KE&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy and &lt;math&gt;PE_g&lt;/math&gt; is the Potential Energy due to gravity) The constants &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are fully determined by some variant of this approach; from the [[weak-field approximation]] one arrives at the result:

&lt;math&gt;g_{44}=K\left(1 +\frac{1}{Sr}\right) \approx -c^2+\frac{2Gm}{r} = -c^2 \left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the gravitational source and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light. It is found that:

&lt;math&gt;K=\, -c^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{S}=-\frac{2Gm}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;A(r)=\left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(r)=-c^2 \left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

So, the Schwarzschild metric may finally be written in the form:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d \theta^2 +\sin^2 \theta d \phi^2)-c^2 \left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\right)dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note that:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2Gm}{c^2}=r_s&lt;/math&gt;

is the definition of the [[Schwarzschild radius]] for an object of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, so the Schwarzschild metric may be rewritten in the alternative form:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\left(1-\frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\theta^2 +\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)-c^2\left(1-\frac{r_s}{r}\right)dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the metric becomes singular approaching the [[event horizon]] (that is, &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow r_s&lt;/math&gt;). The metric singularity is not a physical one (although there is a real physical singularity at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;), as can be shown by using a suitable coordinate transformation (e.g. the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates|Kruskal–Szekeres coordinate system]]).

== Alternate derivation using known physics in special cases ==
The Schwarzschild metric can also be derived using the known physics for a circular orbit and a temporarily stationary point mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s5-05/5-05.htm|title = Reflections on Relativity|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Brown|first = Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Start with the metric with coefficients that are unknown coefficients of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2 = \left ( {ds \over d\tau} \right )^2 = A(r)\left ( {dr \over d\tau} \right )^2 + r^2\left ( {d\phi \over d\tau} \right )^2 + B(r)\left( {dt \over d\tau} \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Now apply the [[Euler–Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]] to the arc length integral &lt;math&gt;{ J=\int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \sqrt{-\left(\text{d}s/\text{d}\tau\right)^2 }\, \text{d}\tau. }&lt;/math&gt;  Since &lt;math&gt;ds/d\tau&lt;/math&gt; is constant, the integrand can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;(\text{d}s/\text{d}\tau)^2,&lt;/math&gt; because the E-L equation is exactly the same if the integrand is multiplied by any constant.  Applying the E-L equation to &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; with the modified integrand yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl} A'(r)\dot{r}^2 + 2r\dot{\phi}^2 + B'(r)\dot{t}^2 &amp; = &amp; 2A'(r)\dot{r}^2 + 2A(r)\ddot{r} \\ 0 &amp; = &amp; 2r\dot{r}\dot{\phi} + r^2\ddot{\phi} \\ 0 &amp; = &amp; B'(r)\dot{r}\dot{t} + B(r)\ddot{t} \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where dot denotes differentiation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

In a circular orbit &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}=\ddot{r}=0,&lt;/math&gt; so the first E-L equation above is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;2r\dot{\phi}^2 + B'(r)\dot{t}^2 = 0 \Leftrightarrow B'(r) = -2r\dot{\phi}^2/\dot{t}^2 = -2r(d\phi/dt)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law of motion]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M+m)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In a circular orbit, the period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2\pi / (d\phi/dt),&lt;/math&gt; implying

:&lt;math&gt;\left( {d\phi \over dt} \right)^2 = GM/r^3&lt;/math&gt;

since the point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is negligible compared to the mass of the central body &lt;math&gt;M.&lt;/math&gt;  So &lt;math&gt;B'(r) = -2GM/r^2 &lt;/math&gt; and integrating this yields &lt;math&gt;B(r) = 2GM/r + C, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; is an unknown constant of integration.  &lt;math&gt;C &lt;/math&gt; can be determined by setting &lt;math&gt;M=0, &lt;/math&gt; in which case the space-time is flat and &lt;math&gt;B(r)=-c^2. &lt;/math&gt;  So &lt;math&gt;C = -c^2 &lt;/math&gt;  and

:&lt;math&gt;B(r) = 2GM/r - c^2 = c^2(2GM/c^2/r - 1) = c^2(r_s/r - 1). &lt;/math&gt;

When the point mass is temporarily stationary, &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}=0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\phi}=0. &lt;/math&gt; The original metric equation becomes &lt;math&gt;\dot{t}^2 = -c^2/B(r)&lt;/math&gt; and the first E-L equation above becomes &lt;math&gt;A(r) = B'(r)\dot{t}^2 / (2\ddot{r}).&lt;/math&gt;  When the point mass is temporarily stationary, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravity|acceleration of gravity]], &lt;math&gt;-MG/r^2.&lt;/math&gt;  So

:&lt;math&gt;A(r) = \left(\frac{-2MG}{r^2}\right) \left(\frac{-c^2}{2MG/r - c^2}\right) \left(-\frac{r^2}{2MG}\right) = \frac{1}{1 - 2MG/(rc^2)} = \frac{1}{1 - r_s/r}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Alternative form in isotropic coordinates ==

The original formulation of the metric uses anisotropic coordinates in which the velocity of light is not the same in the radial and transverse directions.  [[Arthur Eddington]] gave alternative forms in [[isotropic coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;A S Eddington, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhg0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 "Mathematical Theory of Relativity"], Cambridge UP 1922 (2nd ed.1924, repr.1960), at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhg0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 page 85] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhg0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 page 93].  Symbol usage in the Eddington source for interval s and time-like coordinate t has been converted for compatibility with the usage in the derivation above.&lt;/ref&gt;  For isotropic spherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged, and then (provided &lt;math&gt;r \geq \frac{2 Gm}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Hans Adolph Buchdahl |first=H. A. |last=Buchdahl |title=Isotropic coordinates and Schwarzschild metric |journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics |volume=24 |year=1985 |issue=7 |pages=731–739 |doi=10.1007/BF00670880 |bibcode = 1985IJTP...24..731B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_1 \left(1+\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; , &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;dr = dr_1 \left(1-\frac{(Gm)^2}{4c^4 r_1^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; , &amp;nbsp; and

::&lt;math&gt;\left(1-\frac{2Gm}{c^2 r}\right) = \left(1-\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{2}/\left(1+\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt; 

Then for isotropic rectangular coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;x = r_1\, \sin(\theta)\, \cos(\phi) \quad,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y = r_1\, \sin(\theta)\, \sin(\phi) \quad,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;z = r_1\, \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

The metric then becomes, in isotropic rectangular coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= \left(1+\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{4}(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2) -c^2 dt^2 \left(1-\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{2}/\left(1+\frac{Gm}{2c^2 r_1}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Dispensing with the static assumption - Birkhoff's theorem==

In deriving the Schwarzschild metric, it was assumed that the metric was vacuum, spherically symmetric and [[Static spacetime|static]]. In fact, the static assumption is stronger than required, as [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]] states that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of [[Einstein's field equations]] is [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]]; then one obtains the Schwarzschild solution. Birkhoff's theorem has the consequence that any pulsating star which remains spherically symmetric cannot generate [[gravitational wave]]s (as the region exterior to the star must remain static).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5383">[[File:Edge-dominating-set.svg|right|frame|Examples of edge dominating sets.]]

In [[graph theory]], an '''edge dominating set''' for a graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is a subset ''D''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''E'' such that every edge not in ''D'' is adjacent to at least one edge in ''D''. An edge dominating set is also known as a ''line dominating set''. Figures (a)–(d) are examples of edge dominating sets (thick red lines).

A '''minimum edge dominating set''' is a smallest edge dominating set. Figures (a) and (b) are examples of minimum edge dominating sets (it can be checked that there is no edge dominating set of size 2 for this graph).

== Properties ==

{{see|Dominating set#Independent domination}}

An edge dominating set for ''G'' is a [[dominating set]] for its [[line graph]] ''L''(''G'') and vice versa.

Any [[maximal matching]] is always an edge dominating set. Figures (b) and (d) are examples of maximal matchings.

Furthermore, the size of a minimum edge dominating set equals the size of a [[minimum maximal matching]]. A minimum maximal matching is a minimum edge dominating set; Figure (b) is an example of a minimum maximal matching. A minimum edge dominating set is not necessarily a minimum maximal matching, as illustrated in Figure (a); however, given a minimum edge dominating set ''D'', it is easy to find a minimum maximal matching with |''D''| edges (see, e.g., {{harvnb|Yannakakis|Gavril|1980}}).

== Algorithms and computational complexity ==

Determining whether there is an edge dominating set of a given size for a given graph is an [[NP-complete]] problem (and therefore finding a minimum edge dominating set is an [[NP-hard]] problem). {{harvtxt|Yannakakis|Gavril|1980}} show that the problem is NP-complete even in the case of a [[bipartite graph]] with maximum degree 3, and also in the case of a [[planar graph]] with maximum degree 3.

There is a simple polynomial-time [[approximation algorithm]] with approximation factor 2: find any maximal matching. A maximal matching is an edge dominating set; furthermore, a maximal matching ''M'' can be at worst 2 times as large as a smallest maximal matching, and a smallest maximal matching has the same size as the smallest edge dominating set.

Also the edge-weighted version of the problem can be approximated within factor 2, but the algorithm is considerably more complicated  ({{harvnb|Fujito|Nagamochi|2002}}; {{harvnb|Parekh|2002}}).

{{harvtxt|Chlebík|Chlebíková|2006}} show that finding a better than (7/6)-approximation is NP-hard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6275">The '''Egorychev method''' is a collection of techniques for finding [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] among sums of [[binomial coefficient]]s.  The method relies on two observations.  First, many identities can be proved by extracting coefficients of [[generating function]]s.  Second, many generating functions are convergent power series, and coefficient extraction can be done using the [[Cauchy residue theorem]] (usually this is done by integrating over a small circular contour enclosing the origin).  The sought-for identity can now be found using manipulations of integrals.  Some of these manipulations are not clear from the generating function perspective.  For instance, the integrand is usually a [[rational function]], and the sum of the residues of a rational function is zero, yielding a new expression for the original sum.  The [[residue at infinity]] is particularly important in these considerations.

The main integrals employed by the Egorychev method are:
* First binomial coefficient integral
:: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k} =
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^n}{z^{k+1}} \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;
* Second binomial coefficient integral
:: &lt;math&gt; {n\choose k} =
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{(1-z)^{k+1} z^{n-k+1}} \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;
* Exponentiation integral
:: &lt;math&gt;n^k =
\frac{k!}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{\exp(nz)}{z^{k+1}} \; dz:&lt;/math&gt;
* First Iverson bracket
:: &lt;math&gt;[[0\le k \le n]]
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{1+z+z^2+\cdots+z^n}{z^{k+1}} \; dz
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{z^{n+1}-1}{(z-1)z^{k+1}} \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;
* Second Iverson bracket
:: &lt;math&gt;[[0\le k \le n]]
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{z^{k}}{z^{n+1}}\frac{1}{1-z} \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;

== Example I ==

Suppose we seek to evaluate

:&lt;math&gt;S_j(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n\choose k}
{n+k\choose k} {k\choose j}&lt;/math&gt;

which is claimed to be :&lt;math&gt;(-1)^n {n\choose j}{n+j\choose j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Introduce
:&lt;math&gt;{n+k\choose k}
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n+k}}{z^{k+1}} \; dz&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;{k\choose j}
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+w)^k}{w^{j+1}} \; dw.&lt;/math&gt;

This yields for the sum
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^n}{z}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{w^{j+1}}
\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n\choose k} \frac{(1+z)^k (1+w)^k}{z^k}
\; dw \; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n}}{z}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{w^{j+1}}
\left(1-\frac{(1+w)(1+z)}{z}\right)^n
\; dw \; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n}}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{w^{j+1}}
(-1-w-wz)^n
\; dw \; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^n}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{w^{j+1}}
(1+w+wz)^n
\; dw \; dz.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n}}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\varepsilon} \frac{1}{w^{j+1}}
\sum_{q=0}^n {n\choose q} w^q (1+z)^q
\; dw \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Extracting the residue at &lt;math&gt;w=0&lt;/math&gt; we get
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n}}{z^{n+1}}
{n\choose j} (1+z)^j \; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; {n\choose j}  \frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n+j}}{z^{n+1}}\; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; (-1)^n {n\choose j} {n+j\choose n}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

thus proving the claim.

== Example II ==

Suppose we seek to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n k {2n\choose n+k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Introduce
:&lt;math&gt;{2n\choose n+k} =
\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon}
\frac{1}{z^{n-k+1}}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^{n+k+1}} \; dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that this is zero when &lt;math&gt;k&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; so we may extend &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to
infinity to obtain for the sum

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon}
\frac{1}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^{n+1}}
\sum_{k\ge 0} k \frac{z^k}{(1-z)^k}
\; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon}
\frac{1}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^{n+1}}
\frac{z/(1-z)}{(1-z/(1-z))^2}
\; dz \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|z|=\varepsilon}
\frac{1}{z^{n}}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^n}
\frac{1}{(1-2z)^2}
\; dz.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now put &lt;math&gt;z(1-z)=w&lt;/math&gt; so that (observe that the image of &lt;math&gt;|z|=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; small is another closed circle-like contour which we may certainly deform to obtain another circle &lt;math&gt;|w|=\gamma&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4w}}{2}
\quad\text{and}\quad
(1-2z)^2 = 1-4w&lt;/math&gt;

and furthermore
:&lt;math&gt;dz = -\frac{1}{2}
\times \frac{1}{2} \times (-4) \times (1-4w)^{-1/2} \; dw
=  (1-4w)^{-1/2} \; dw&lt;/math&gt;

to get for the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\gamma}
\frac{1}{w^n} \frac{1}{1-4w}
(1-4w)^{-1/2} \; dw
= \frac{1}{2\pi i}
\int_{|w|=\gamma}
\frac{1}{w^n} \frac{1}{(1-4w)^{3/2}} \; dw.&lt;/math&gt;

This evaluates by inspection to (use the [[Newton binomial]])

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; 4^{n-1} {n-1+1/2\choose n-1}
= 4^{n-1} {n-1/2\choose n-1}
= \frac{4^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} (n-1/2-q) \\
= {} &amp; \frac{2^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} (2n-2q-1)
= \frac{2^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}
\frac{(2n-1)!}{2^{n-1} (n-1)!} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{n^2}{2n} {2n\choose n}
= \frac{1}{2} n {2n\choose n}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the mapping from &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;w=0&lt;/math&gt; determines the choice of
square root. This example also yields to simpler methods but was included here to demonstrate the effect of substituting into the variable of integration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">In [[mathematics]], the '''elliptic gamma function''' is a generalization of the [[Q-gamma function|q-Gamma function]], which is itself the [[q-analog]] of the ordinary [[Gamma function]]. It is closely related to a function studied by {{harvtxt|Jackson|1905}}, and can be expressed in terms of the [[triple gamma function]]. It is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma (z;p,q) = \prod_{m=0}^\infty \prod_{n=0}^\infty
\frac{1-p^{m+1}q^{n+1}/z}{1-p^m q^n z}. &lt;/math&gt;

It obeys several identities:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z;p,q)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(pq/z; p,q)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(pz;p,q)=\theta (z;q) \Gamma (z; p,q)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(qz;p,q)=\theta (z;p) \Gamma (z; p,q)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the [[q-theta function]].

When &lt;math&gt;p=0&lt;/math&gt;, it essentially reduces to the infinite [[q-Pochhammer symbol]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z;0,q)=\frac{1}{(z;q)_\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;
==Multiplication Formula==
Define
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Gamma}(z;p,q):=\frac{(q;q)_\infty}{(p;p)_\infty}(\theta(q;p))^{1-z}\prod_{m=0}^\infty \prod_{n=0}^\infty
\frac{1-p^{m+1}q^{n+1-z}}{1-p^m q^{n+z}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the following formula holds with &lt;math&gt;r=q^n&lt;/math&gt; ({{harvtxt|Felder|Varchenko|2003}}).
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Gamma}(nz;p,q)\tilde{\Gamma}(1/n;p,r)\tilde{\Gamma}(2/n;p,r)\cdots\tilde{\Gamma}((n-1)/n;p,r)=\left(\frac{\theta(r;p)}{\theta(q;p)}\right)^{nz-1}\tilde{\Gamma}(z;p,r)\tilde{\Gamma}(z+1/n;p,r)\cdots\tilde{\Gamma}(z+(n-1)/n;p,r).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11430">'''Evolutionary robotics''' ('''ER''') is a methodology that uses [[evolutionary computation]] to develop [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] and/or hardware for [[autonomous robot]]s. [[Algorithms]] in ER frequently operate on populations of candidate controllers, initially selected from some [[probability distribution|distribution]].  This population is then repeatedly modified according to a [[fitness function]].  In the case of [[genetic algorithm]]s (or "GAs"), a common method in [[evolutionary computation]], the population of candidate controllers is repeatedly grown according to crossover, mutation and other [[genetic algorithm|GA]] operators
and then culled according to the [[fitness function]]. The candidate controllers used in ER applications may be drawn from some subset of the set of [[artificial neural network]]s, although some applications (including SAMUEL, developed at the Naval Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence) use collections of "IF THEN ELSE" rules as the constituent parts of an individual controller.  It is theoretically possible to use any set of symbolic formulations of a [[control law]] (sometimes called a [[policy]] in the [[machine learning]] community) as the space of possible candidate controllers. [[Artificial neural network]]s can also be used for [[robot learning]] outside the context of evolutionary robotics.  In particular, other forms of [[reinforcement learning]] can be used for learning robot controllers.

[[Developmental robotics]] is related to, but differs from, evolutionary robotics. ER uses populations of robots that evolve over time, whereas DevRob is interested in how the organization of a single robot's control system develops through experience, over time.

==History==
The foundation of ER was laid with work at the national research council in Rome in the 90s, but the initial idea of encoding a robot control system into a genome and have [[artificial evolution]] improve on it dates back to the late 80s.

In 1992 and 1993 three research groups, one surrounding [[Dario Floreano|Floreano]] and [[Francesco Mondada|Mondada]] at the [[EPFL]] in [[Lausanne]] and a second involving [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Cliff]], [[Inman Harvey|Harvey]], and [[Phil Husbands|Husbands]] from [[School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences|COGS]] at the [[University of Sussex]] and a third from the University of Southern California involved [[M. Anthony Lewis (roboticist)|M. Anthony Lewis]] and [[Andrew Fagg|Andrew H Fagg]] reported promising results from experiments on artificial evolution of autonomous robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/philh/pubs/evolvingVisguided.pdf|title=Evolving Visually Guided Robots; conference paper presented at SAB92|last1=Cliff|first1=D.|last2=Harvey|first2=I.|year=1992|last3=Husbands|first3=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.45.240&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Genetic programming approach to the construction of a neural network for control of a walking robot"; conference paper presented at ICRA|last=Lewis|first=|last2=Fagg|date=|year=1992|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20|last3=Solidum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this early research triggered a wave of activity in labs around the world trying to harness the potential of the approach.

Lately, the difficulty in "scaling up" the complexity of the robot tasks has shifted attention somewhat towards the theoretical end of the field rather than the engineering end.

==Objectives==
Evolutionary robotics is done with many different objectives, often at the same time. These include creating useful controllers for real-world robot tasks, exploring the intricacies of evolutionary theory (such as the [[Baldwin effect]]), reproducing psychological phenomena, and finding out about biological neural networks by studying artificial ones. Creating controllers via artificial evolution requires a large number of evaluations of a large population. This is very time consuming, which is one of the reasons why controller evolution is usually done in software. Also, initial random controllers may exhibit potentially harmful behaviour, such as repeatedly crashing into a wall, which may damage the robot. Transferring controllers evolved in simulation to physical robots is very difficult and a major challenge in using the ER approach. The reason is that evolution is free to explore all possibilities to obtain a high fitness, including any inaccuracies of the simulation {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. This need for a large number of evaluations, requiring fast yet accurate computer simulations, is one of the limiting factors of the ER approach {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

In rare cases, evolutionary computation may be used to design the physical structure of the robot, in addition to the controller.  One of the most notable examples of this was [[Karl Sims]]' demo for [[Thinking Machines Corporation]].

==Motivation==
Many of the commonly used [[machine learning]] algorithms require a set of [[training set|training examples]] consisting of both a hypothetical input and a desired answer.  In many robot learning applications the desired answer is an action for the robot to take. These actions are usually not known explicitly a priori, instead the [[robot]] can, at best, receive a value indicating the success or failure of a given action taken.  Evolutionary algorithms are natural solutions to this sort of problem framework, as the fitness function need only encode the success or failure of a given controller, rather than the precise actions the controller should have taken.  An alternative to the use of evolutionary computation in robot learning is the use of other forms of [[reinforcement learning]], such as [[q-learning]], to learn the fitness of any particular action, and then use predicted fitness values indirectly to create a controller.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11209">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gelfand representation''' in [[functional analysis]] (named after [[I. M. Gelfand]]) has two related meanings:

* a way of representing [[commutative]] [[Banach algebra]]s as algebras of continuous functions;
* the fact that for commutative [[C*-algebra]]s, this representation is an isometric isomorphism.

In the former case, one may regard the Gelfand representation as a far-reaching generalization of the [[Fourier transform]] of an integrable function. In the latter case, the Gelfand–Naimark representation theorem is one avenue in the development of [[spectral theory]] for [[normal operator]]s, and generalizes the notion of diagonalizing a normal matrix.

== Historical remarks ==
One of Gelfand's original applications (and one which historically motivated much of the study of Banach algebras{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}) was to give a much shorter and more conceptual proof of a celebrated lemma of [[Norbert Wiener]] (see the citation below), characterizing the elements of the [[group algebra]]s ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') and &lt;math&gt;\ell^1({\mathbf Z})&lt;/math&gt; whose translates span dense subspaces in the respective algebras.

For any [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]] ''X'', the space ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') of continuous complex-valued functions on ''X'' which [[vanish at infinity]] is in a natural way a commutative C*-algebra:
* The structure of algebra over the complex numbers is obtained by considering  the pointwise operations of addition and multiplication.
* The involution is pointwise complex conjugation.
* The norm is the [[uniform norm]] on functions.

Note that  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')  is [[unital algebra|unital]] if and only if ''X'' is [[compact space|compact]], in which  case ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is equal to ''C''(''X''), the algebra of all continuous complex-valued functions on ''X''.

== Gelfand representation of a commutative Banach algebra ==
Let ''A'' be a commutative [[Banach algebra]], defined over the field ℂ of complex numbers. A non-zero [[algebra homomorphism]] φ: ''A'' → ℂ is called a ''character'' of ''A''; the set of all characters of ''A'' is denoted by Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;.

It can be shown that every character on ''A'' is automatically continuous, and hence Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subset of the space ''A''* of continuous linear functionals on ''A''; moreover, when equipped with the relative [[Weak topology#The weak-* topology|weak-* topology]], Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; turns out to be locally compact and Hausdorff. (This follows from the [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]].) The space Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is compact (in the topology just defined) if{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and only if the algebra ''A'' has an identity element.

Given ''a'' ∈ ''A'', one defines the function &lt;math&gt;\widehat{a}:\Phi_A\to{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\widehat{a}(\phi)=\phi(a)&lt;/math&gt;. The definition of Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and the topology on it ensure that &lt;math&gt;\widehat{a}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and [[vanish at infinity|vanishes at infinity]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, and that the map &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto \widehat{a}&lt;/math&gt; defines a norm-decreasing, unit-preserving algebra homomorphism from ''A'' to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;). This homomorphism is the ''Gelfand representation of A'', and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Gelfand transform'' of the element ''a''. In general, the representation is neither injective nor surjective.

In the case where ''A'' has an identity element, there is a bijection between Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; and the set of maximal ideals in ''A'' (this relies on the [[Gelfand–Mazur theorem]]). As a consequence, the kernel of the Gelfand representation ''A'' → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;) may be identified with the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''A''. Thus the Gelfand representation is injective if and only if ''A'' is [[Semiprimitive ring|(Jacobson) semisimple]].

=== Examples ===
In the case where ''A'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), the group algebra of '''R''', then Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is homeomorphic to '''R''' and the Gelfand transform of ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') is the [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where ''A'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;), the L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-convolution algebra of the real half-line, then Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is homeomorphic to {''z'' ∈ '''C''': Re(''z'') ≥ 0}, and the Gelfand transform of an element ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[Laplace transform]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}f&lt;/math&gt;.

== The C*-algebra case ==
As motivation, consider the special case ''A'' = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). Given ''x'' in ''X'', let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x \in A^*&lt;/math&gt; be pointwise evaluation at ''x'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x(f) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x&lt;/math&gt; is a character on ''A'', and it can be shown that all characters of ''A'' are of this form; a more precise analysis shows that we may identify Φ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''X'', not just as sets but as topological spaces. The Gelfand representation is then an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;C_0(X)\to C_0(\Phi_A).\ &lt;/math&gt;

=== The spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra ===
{{See also|Spectrum of a C*-algebra}}

The '''spectrum''' or '''Gelfand space''' of a commutative C*-algebra ''A'', denoted ''Â'', consists of the set of ''non-zero'' *-homomorphisms from ''A'' to the complex numbers. Elements of the spectrum are called '''characters''' on ''A''. (It can be shown that every algebra homomorphism from ''A'' to the complex numbers is automatically a [[*-algebra|*-homomorphism]], so that this definition of the term 'character' agrees with the one above.)

In particular, the spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra is a locally compact Hausdorff space: In the unital case, i.e. where the C*-algebra has a multiplicative unit element 1, all characters ''f'' must be unital, i.e. ''f''(1) is the complex number one. This excludes the zero homomorphism. So ''Â'' is closed under weak-* convergence and the spectrum is actually ''compact''. In the non-unital case, the weak-* closure of ''Â'' is ''Â'' ∪ {0}, where 0 is the zero homomorphism, and the removal of a single point from a compact Hausdorff space yields a locally compact Hausdorff space.

Note that ''spectrum'' is an overloaded word.  It also refers to the spectrum σ(''x'') of an element ''x'' of an algebra with unit 1, that is the set of complex numbers ''r'' for which ''x'' - ''r'' 1 is not invertible in ''A''. For unital C*-algebras, the two notions are connected in the following way: σ(''x'') is the set of complex numbers ''f''(''x'') where ''f'' ranges over Gelfand space of ''A''. Together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], this shows that ''Â'' is a subset of the unit ball of ''A*'' and as such can be given the relative weak-* topology. This is the topology of pointwise convergence. A [[net (mathematics)|net]] {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of the spectrum of ''A'' converges to ''f'' [[if and only if]] for each ''x'' in ''A'', the net of complex numbers {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''f''(''x'').

If ''A'' is a [[separable space|separable]] C*-algebra, the weak-* topology is [[metrizable]] on bounded subsets.  Thus the spectrum of a separable commutative C*-algebra ''A'' can be regarded as a metric space. So the topology can be characterized via convergence of sequences.

Equivalently, σ(''x'') is the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of γ(''x''), where γ is the Gelfand representation.

=== Statement of the commutative Gelfand–Naimark theorem ===
Let ''A'' be a commutative C*-algebra and let ''X'' be the spectrum of ''A''. Let 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma:A \to C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;

be the Gelfand representation defined above.

'''Theorem'''. The Gelfand map γ is an isometric *-isomorphism from ''A'' onto ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

See the Arveson reference below.

The spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra can also be viewed as the set of all [[maximal ideal]]s ''m'' of ''A'', with the [[hull-kernel topology]]. (See the earlier remarks for the general, commutative Banach algebra case.) For any such ''m'' the quotient algebra ''A/m'' is  one-dimensional (by the Gelfand-Mazur theorem), and therefore any ''a'' in ''A'' gives rise to a complex-valued function on ''Y''.

In the case of C*-algebras with unit, the spectrum map gives rise to  a contravariant [[functor]] from the category of C*-algebras with unit and unit-preserving continuous *-homomorphisms, to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. This functor is one half of a [[Equivalence of categories|contravariant equivalence]] between these two categories (its [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] being the functor that assigns to each compact Hausdorff space ''X'' the C*-algebra ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')). In particular, given compact Hausdorff spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', then ''C''(''X'') is isomorphic to ''C''(''Y'') (as a C*-algebra) if and only if ''X'' is [[homeomorphic]] to ''Y''.

The 'full' [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] is a result for arbitrary (abstract) [[noncommutative]] C*-algebras ''A'', which though not quite analogous to the Gelfand representation, does provide a concrete representation of ''A'' as an algebra of operators.

== Applications ==

One of the most significant applications is the existence of a continuous ''functional calculus'' for normal elements in C*-algebra ''A'': An element ''x'' is normal if and only if ''x'' commutes with its adjoint ''x*'', or equivalently if and only if it generates a commutative C*-algebra C*(''x''). By the Gelfand isomorphism applied to C*(''x'') this is *-isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions on a locally compact space.  This observation leads almost immediately to:

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''A'' be a C*-algebra with identity and ''x'' an element of ''A''.  Then there is a *-morphism ''f'' → ''f''(''x'') from the algebra of continuous functions on the spectrum σ(''x'') into ''A'' such that
* It maps 1 to the multiplicative identity of ''A'';
* It maps the identity function on the spectrum to ''x''.

This allows us to apply continuous functions to bounded normal operators on Hilbert space.

'''George Barry Purdy''' (20 February 1944 – 30 December 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obittree.com/obituary/us/ohio/cincinnati/tp-white--sons-funeral-home/dr-george-purdy-phd/3389156/|title=Dr. George B. Purdy Phd Obituary - Cincinnati, OH {{!}} ObitTree™|website=obittree.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]] who specialized in [[cryptography]], [[combinatorial geometry]] and [[number theory]]. 
Purdy received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] in 1972, officially under the supervision of [[Paul T. Bateman]],&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt; but his de facto adviser was [[Paul Erdős]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  He was on the faculty in the mathematics department at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] for 11 years, and was appointed the Geier Professor of computer science at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1986.

Purdy had [[Erdős number]] one and coauthored many papers with Paul Erdős, who regarded him as his own student.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He is the "P" in [[G.W. Peck]], a pseudonym for the group of mathematicians that also included [[Ronald Graham]], [[Douglas West (mathematician)|Douglas West]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Fan Chung]], and [[Daniel Kleitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-365X(02)00595-2|last=Peck|first=G. W.|year=2002|title=Kleitman and combinatorics: a celebration|journal=Discrete Mathematics|publisher=Elsevier |volume=257|issue=2–3|pages=193–224|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V00-46TBX9G-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=404a0535417d056b4a18327185af64a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purdy polynomial==
In 1971, Purdy was asked by [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]], the head of [[DARPA]], to develop a secure [[hash function]] to protect passwords on [[ARPANET]]. Purdy developed the so-called '''Purdy polynomial''', which was a polynomial of degree 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; + 17 computed modulo the 64-bit [[prime number|prime]] ''p'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; - 59. The terms of the polynomial could be computed using [[modular exponentiation]]. DARPA was satisfied with the hash function, and also allowed Purdy to publish it in [[Communications of the ACM]]. It was well received around the world, and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] eventually used it in their [[OpenVMS]] operating system. A DEC report said they chose it because it was very secure, and also because the existing standard [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] could not be exported, which meant that an alternative was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passwordresearch.com/papers/paper73.html |title=Research Paper - A High Security Log-In Procedure |publisher=Passwordresearch.com |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361089 |title=A high security log-in procedure |doi=10.1145/361082.361089 |publisher=Dl.acm.org |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenVMS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metacpan.org/module/Authen::Passphrase::VMSPurdy#DESCRIPTION|title=Authen::Passphrase::VMSPurdy – passphrases with the VMS Purdy polynomial system|work=[[CPAN]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a 64-bit version, based on a 64-bit prime, the same size as the one in the paper.

==Purdy's conjecture==

While at Texas A&amp;M, Purdy made an empirical observation about distances between points on two lines.  Suppose that ''n'' points are to be chosen on line ''L'' and another ''n'' points on line ''M''.  If ''L'' and ''M'' are [[perpendicular]] or [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]], then the points can be chosen so that the number of distinct distances determined is bounded by a constant multiply of ''n'', but otherwise the number is much larger. Erdős was very struck by this conjecture and told it to many others, and it was published in a book of unsolved problems by [[William Moser]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;L. Moser and J. Pach, Research problems in discrete geometry, McGill University, Montreal, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the attention of [[György Elekes]], who eventually proved the conjecture as the first application of new tools from [[algebraic geometry]] that he was developing.&lt;ref&gt;''A Combinatorial Problem on Polynomials and Rational Functions'', György Elekes, Lajos Rónyai, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, Volume 89, Issue 1, January 2000, Pages 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; After Elekes's untimely death, [[Micha Sharir]] collected Elekes's notes and published an organized presentation of these algebraic methods, including work of his own. This, in turn,  enabled [[Nets Katz|Katz]] and [[Larry Guth|Guth]] to solve the [[Erdős distinct distances problem]], a 1946 problem of Erdős. Work continues on improvements in Purdy's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinct distances on two lines'', Micha Sharir, Adam Sheffer, [[József Solymosi]], June 4, 2013, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.3081.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2015, Purdy was awarded the [[Joseph Desch#The IEEE Joe Desch Innovation Award|IEEE Joseph Desch Award for Innovation]] for his work on the [[ARPANET|Arpa Network]] and the Purdy Polynomial.

'''Gábor Tardos''' (born 11 July 1964) is a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]], currently a professor at [[Central European University]] and previously a [[Canada Research Chair]] at [[Simon Fraser University]]. He works mainly in [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. He is the younger brother of [[Éva Tardos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html Baseball Families and Math Families], [[William Gasarch]], February 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical results==
Tardos started with a result in [[universal algebra]]: he exhibited a maximal [[clone (algebra)|clone]] of monotone operations which is not finitely  generated. He obtained partial results concerning the [[Hanna Neumann conjecture]]. With his student, [[Adam Marcus (mathematician)|Adam Marcus]], he proved a combinatorial conjecture of [[Zoltán Füredi]] and [[Péter Hajnal]] which was known to imply the [[Stanley–Wilf conjecture]]. With topological methods he proved that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set system consisting of the unions of intervals on two disjoint lines, then &lt;math&gt;\tau(\mathcal{H})\leq 2\nu(\mathcal{H})&lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;\tau(\mathcal{H})&lt;/math&gt; is the least number of points covering all elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu(\mathcal{H})&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the largest disjoint subsystem of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Tardos worked out a method for optimal probabilistic fingerprint codes. Although the mathematical content is hard, the algorithm is easy to implement.

==Awards==
He received the European Mathematical Society prize for young researchers at the [[European Congress of Mathematics]] in 1992 and the [[Paul Erdős Prize|Erdős Prize]] from the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 2000. He received a Lendület Grant from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.hu/index.php?id=634&amp;no_cache=1&amp;backPid=390&amp;tt_news=11051&amp;cHash=10423ab5d6 Lendületben az MTA]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically devised to keep outstanding researchers in Hungary.

==Life and career==
Ida Busbridge was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] then studied mathematics at [[Royal Holloway College]], London, where in 1929 she was the highest-ranked student in the final examinations for mathematics for the whole of the [[University of London]]. After obtaining a master's degree with distinction from London, she moved to Oxford in 1935 to teach mathematics to the undergraduates of five women's colleges.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; During the Second World War, she also helped with the education of physicists and engineers at Oxford; her workload was especially great not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=figures&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The twentieth century|first=Margaret E.|last=Rayner|title=Oxford Figures: Eight Centuries of the Mathematical Sciences|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=316–317|year=2013|isbn=9780199681976|editor1-first=	John |editor1-last=Fauvel|editor2-first=Raymond |editor2-last=Flood|editor3-first=Robin |editor3-last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellowship]] of [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], in 1946 – she was the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; In 1962, she was awarded a [[Doctor of Science]] degree by Oxford.  She was also a [[Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Busbridge's work included [[integral equations]] and [[radiative transfer]].  She was highly regarded as a lecturer and tutor, attending to her students' educational and personal needs. She retired from Oxford in 1970, and died in 1988.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Ida Winifred Busbridge 1908-1988|first=Margaret E.|last= Rayner|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=73|number=466|date=December 1989|pages=339–341|publisher=[[Mathematical Association]]|jstor=3619320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Pierre Serre''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁ|lang}}; born 15 September 1926) is a French [[mathematician]] who has made contributions to [[algebraic topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[algebraic number theory]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1954 and the [[Abel Prize]] in 2003.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Born in [[Bages, Pyrénées-Orientales|Bages]], [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], [[France]], to pharmacist parents, Serre was educated at the Lycée de Nîmes and then from 1945 to 1948 at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;J J O'Connor and E F Robertson ''Serre Biography'' http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Serre.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded his doctorate from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1951. From 1948 to 1954 he held positions at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] in [[Paris]]. In 1956 he was elected professor at the [[Collège de France]], a position he held until his retirement in 1994. His wife, Professor Josiane Heulot-Serre, was a chemist; she also was the director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles. Their daughter is the former French diplomat, historian and writer [[Claudine Monteil]]. The French mathematician [[Denis Serre]] is his nephew.  He practices skiing, table tennis, and rock climbing (in [[Fontainebleau]]).

===Career===
From a very young age he was an outstanding figure in the school of [[Henri Cartan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Serre | first1 = J. -P. | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2009.0005 | title = [[Henri Cartan|Henri Paul Cartan]]. 8 July 1904 -- 13 August 2008 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 55 | pages = 37–44 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; working on [[algebraic topology]], [[several complex variables]] and then [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], where he introduced [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]] techniques. Serre's thesis concerned the [[Serre spectral sequence|Leray–Serre spectral sequence]] associated to a [[fibration]]. Together with Cartan, Serre established the technique of using [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s for computing [[homotopy groups of spheres]], which at that time was one of  the major problems in topology.

In his speech at the Fields Medal award ceremony in 1954, [[Hermann Weyl]] gave high praise to Serre, and also made the point that the award was for the first time awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus. 

====Algebraic geometry====
In the 1950s and 1960s, a fruitful collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger [[Alexander Grothendieck]] led to important foundational work, much of it motivated by the [[Weil conjectures]]. Two major foundational papers by Serre were ''Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents'' (FAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serre | first1 = Jean-Pierre | year = 1955 | title = Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents | url = | journal = The Annals of Mathematics | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 197–278 | doi=10.2307/1969915}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[coherent cohomology]], and ''Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique'' ([[GAGA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Serre | first1=Jean-Pierre | author1-link=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Géométrie algébrique et géométrie analytique | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=AIF_1956__6__1_0 | mr=0082175 | year=1956 | journal=[[Annales de l'Institut Fourier|Université de Grenoble. Annales de l'Institut Fourier]] | issn=0373-0956 | volume=6 | pages=1–42 | doi=10.5802/aif.59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at an early stage in his work Serre had perceived a need to construct more general and refined [[cohomology]] theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. The problem was that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] over a [[finite field]] couldn't capture as much topology as [[singular cohomology]] with integer coefficients.  Amongst Serre's early candidate theories of 1954–55 was one based on [[Witt vector]] coefficients.

Around 1958 Serre suggested that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties – those that become trivial after pullback by a finite [[étale map]] – are important. This acted as one important source of inspiration for Grothendieck to develop [[étale topology]] and the corresponding theory of [[étale cohomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~illusie/Grothendieck_etale.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in [[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]] (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne.

====Other work====
[[File:SERRE Jean-Pierre.jpg|thumb|Serre]]
From 1959 onward Serre's interests turned towards [[group theory]], [[number theory]], in particular [[Galois module|Galois representations]] and [[modular form]]s.

Amongst his most original contributions were: his "[[Serre's conjecture II (algebra)|Conjecture II]]" (still open) on Galois cohomology; his use of group actions on [[Bass–Serre theory|trees]] (with [[Hyman Bass]]); the Borel–Serre compactification; results on the number of points of curves over finite fields;  [[Galois representation]]s in [[l-adic cohomology|ℓ-adic cohomology]] and the proof that these representations have often a "large" image; the concept of ''p''-adic [[modular form]]; and the [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre conjecture]] (now a theorem) on mod-''p'' representations that made [[Fermat's last theorem]] a connected part of mainstream [[arithmetic geometry]].

In his paper FAC, Serre asked whether a finitely generated [[projective module]] over a polynomial ring is free. This question led to a great deal of activity in [[commutative algebra]], and was finally answered in the affirmative by [[Daniel Quillen]] and [[Andrei Suslin]] independently in 1976. This result is now known as the [[Quillen–Suslin  theorem]].

==Honors and awards==
Serre, at twenty-seven in 1954, is the youngest ever to be awarded the [[Fields Medal]]. He went on to win the [[Balzan Prize]] in 1985, the [[Steele Prize]] in 1995, the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] in 2000, and was the first recipient of the [[Abel Prize]] in 2003. He has been awarded other prizes, such as the Gold Medal of the French National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).

He is a foreign member of several scientific Academies (France, US, Norway, Sweden, Russia, the Royal Society, [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4781 |title=J.-P. Serre |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and has received many honorary degrees (from Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and others). In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serre has been awarded the highest honors in France as [[Grand Cross]] of the Legion of Honour (Grand Croix de la Légion d'Honneur) and Grand Cross of the Legion of Merit (Grand Croix de l'Ordre National du Mérite).

'''John Roe''' (October 6, 1959 – March 9, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/johnroe/ |title=John Roe |website=John Roe |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British mathematician.

Roe grew up in the countryside in [[Shropshire]]. He went to [[Rugby School]], was an undergraduate at [[Cambridge University]], and received his D.Phil. in 1985 from the [[University of Oxford]] under the supervision of [[Michael Atiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|43912|title=John Roe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a post-doctoral student, he was at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) in Berkeley, and then a tutor at [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. From 1998 until shortly before his death he was a professor at the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

His research interests center around [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem|index theorems]], [[coarse geometry]], [[operator algebras]], [[noncommutative geometry]], and the [[Novikov conjecture]] in [[differential topology]].  He was an editor of the ''[[Journal of Noncommutative Geometry]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Topology]]''.

In 1996 he was awarded the [[Whitehead Prize]]. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9805">In [[graph theory]], the '''Katz centrality''' of a node is a measure of [[centrality]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]]. It was introduced by [[Leo Katz (statistician)|Leo Katz]] in 1953 and is used to measure the relative degree of influence of an actor (or node) within a [[social network]].&lt;ref name="katz1953" /&gt; Unlike typical centrality measures which consider only the shortest path (the [[geodesic]]) between a pair of actors, Katz centrality measures influence by taking into account the total number of [[walk (graph theory)|walks]] between a pair of actors.&lt;ref name="hanneman2005" /&gt;

It is similar to [[Google]]'s [[PageRank]] and to the [[eigenvector centrality]].&lt;ref name="vigna2016" /&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Katz example net.png|thumb|500px|right|A simple social network: the nodes represent people or actors and the edges between nodes represent some relationship between actors]]
Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node within a network by measuring the number of the immediate neighbors (first degree nodes) and also all other nodes in the network that connect to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors. Connections made with distant neighbors are, however, penalized by an attenuation factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name ="aggarwal2011" /&gt; Each path or connection between a pair of nodes is assigned a weight determined by &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the distance between nodes as &lt;math&gt;\alpha^d&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in the figure on the right, assume that John's centrality is being measured and that &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. The weight assigned to each link that connects John with his immediate neighbors Jane and Bob will be &lt;math&gt;(0.5)^1 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. Since Jose connects to John indirectly through Bob, the weight assigned to this connection (composed of two links) will be &lt;math&gt;(0.5)^2 = 0.25&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Aziz and Jane will be &lt;math&gt;(0.5)^3 = 0.125&lt;/math&gt; and the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Diego, Jose and Bob will be &lt;math&gt;(0.5)^4 = 0.0625&lt;/math&gt;.

==Mathematical formulation==
Let ''A'' be the [[adjacency matrix]] of a network under consideration. Elements &lt;math&gt;(a_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; of ''A'' are variables that take a value 1 if a node ''i'' is connected to node ''j'' and 0 otherwise. The powers of ''A'' indicate the presence (or absence) of links between two nodes through intermediaries. For instance, in matrix &lt;math&gt;A^3&lt;/math&gt;, if element &lt;math&gt;(a_{2,12}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it indicates that node 2 and node 12 are connected through some first and second degree neighbors of node&amp;nbsp;2. If &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{Katz}}(i)&lt;/math&gt; denotes Katz centrality of a node&amp;nbsp;''i'', then mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{Katz}}(i) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha^k (A^k)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Note that the above definition uses the fact that the element at location &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A^k&lt;/math&gt; reflects the total number of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; degree connections between nodes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The value of the attenuation factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has to be chosen such that it is smaller than the reciprocal of the absolute value of the largest [[eigenvalue]] of ''A''.&lt;ref name="junker2008" /&gt; In this case the following expression can be used to calculate Katz centrality:

:&lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{C}_{\mathrm{Katz}} = ((I - \alpha A^T)^{-1}-I)\overrightarrow{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{I}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of size ''n'' (''n'' is the number of nodes) consisting of ones. &lt;math&gt;A^T&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[transposed matrix]] of A and &lt;math&gt;(I - \alpha A^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[matrix inversion]] of the term &lt;math&gt;(I - \alpha A^T)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="junker2008" /&gt; 

An extension of this framework allows for the walks to be computed in a dynamical setting. &lt;ref name ="grindrod2011communicability" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grindrod2010Dynamical"/&gt; By taking a time dependent series of network adjacency snapshots of the transient edges, the dependency for walks to contribute towards a cumulative effect is presented. The arrow of time is preserved so that the contribution of activity is asymmetric in the direction of information propagation.

Network producing data of the form: 

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{A^{[k]} \in \R^{N \times N} \right \} \qquad \text{for} \quad k=0,1,2,\ldots,M,&lt;/math&gt; 

representing the adjacency matrix at each time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, 

:&lt;math&gt;\left( A^{[k]} \right)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{there is an edge from node } i \text{ to node } j \text{ at time } t_k \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

The time points &lt;math&gt;t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_M&lt;/math&gt; are ordered but not necessarily equally spaced. &lt;math&gt;Q \in \R^{N \times N}&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;(Q)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a weighted count of the number of dynamic walks of length &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The form for the dynamic communicability between participating nodes is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q} = \left(I-\alpha A^{[0]} \right)^{-1} \cdots \left( I - \alpha A^{[M]} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be normalized via:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{Q}}^{[k]} = \frac{\hat{\mathcal{Q}}^{[k-1]} \left(I-\alpha A^{[k]} \right)^{-1}}{\left \|\hat{\mathcal{Q}}^{[k-1]} \left( I - \alpha A^{[k]} \right)^{-1} \right \|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore centrality measures that quantify how effectively node &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can 'broadcast' and 'receive' dynamic messages across the network,

:&lt;math&gt;C_n^{\mathrm{broadcast}} := \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathcal{Q}_{nk} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad C_n^{\mathrm{receive}} := \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathcal{Q}_{kn}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
Katz centrality can be used to compute centrality in directed networks such as citation networks and the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name="newman2010" /&gt; 

Katz centrality is more suitable in the analysis of directed acyclic graphs where traditionally used measures like [[eigenvector centrality]] are rendered useless.&lt;ref name="newman2010" /&gt; 

Katz centrality can also be used in estimating the relative status or influence of actors in a social network. The work presented in &lt;ref name="laflin2013discovering"/&gt; shows the case study of applying a dynamic version of the Katz centrality to data from Twitter and focuses on particular brands which have stable discussion leaders. The application allows for a comparison of the methodology with that of human experts in the field and how the results are in agreement with a panel of social media experts.

In [[neuroscience]], it is found that Katz centrality correlates with the relative firing rate of [[neurons]] in a neural network.&lt;ref name="jmckay2017" /&gt;. The temporal extension of the Katz centrality is applied to fMRI data obtained from a musical learning experiement in &lt;ref name="mantzaris2013fMRI"/&gt; where data is collected from the subjects before and after the learning process. The results show that the changes to the network structure over the musical exposure created in each session a quantification of the cross communicability that produced clusters in line with the success of learning.

In [[mathematics]], '''Laplace's method''', named after [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is a technique used to approximate [[integral]]s of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b\! e^{M f(x)} \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ƒ''(''x'') is some twice-[[Derivative|differentiable]] [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''M'' is a large number, and the endpoints ''a'' and ''b'' could possibly be infinite. This technique was originally presented in Laplace (1774, pp.&amp;nbsp;366–367).

==The idea of Laplace's method==
[[File:Laplaces method.svg|right|150px|thumb|The function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Mƒ''(''x'')&lt;/sup&gt;, in blue, is shown on top for ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5, and at the bottom for ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3. Here, ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''x''/''x'', with a global maximum at&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  It is seen that as ''M'' grows larger, the approximation of this function by a [[Gaussian function]] (shown in red) is getting better. This observation underlies Laplace's method.]]

Assume that the function ''ƒ''(''x'') has a unique [[Maxima and minima|global maximum]] at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, the value  ''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) will be larger than the other values of ''ƒ''(''x''). If we multiply this function by a large number ''M'', the ratio between ''Mƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and  ''Mƒ''(''x'') will stay the same (since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{M f(x_0)}{M f(x)} = \frac{f(x_0)}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;), but it will grow exponentially in the function &lt;math&gt;e^{M f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;(see figure).

Thus, significant contributions to the integral of this function will come only from points ''x'' in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which can then be estimated.

==General theory of Laplace's method==
To state and motivate the method, we need several assumptions. We will assume that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not an endpoint of the interval of integration, that the values  ''ƒ''(''x'') cannot be very close to  ''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) unless ''x'' is close to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and that the second derivative &lt;math&gt;f''(x_0)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

We can expand ''ƒ''(''x'') around ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by [[Taylor's theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{1}{2} f''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + R 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R = O\left((x-x_0)^3\right).&lt;/math&gt; (See: [[big O notation]].)

Since ''ƒ'' has a global maximum at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and since ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not an endpoint, it is a [[stationary point]], so the derivative of ''ƒ'' vanishes at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, the function ''ƒ''(''x'') may be approximated to quadratic order

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \approx f(x_0) - \frac{1}{2} \left|f''\left(x_0\right)\right| \left(x-x_0\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for ''x'' close to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (recall that the second derivative is negative at the global maximum ''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)). The assumptions made ensure the accuracy of the approximation

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\int_a^b\! e^{M f(x)}\, dx\approx e^{M f(x_0)}\int_a^b e^{-M|f''(x_0)| (x-x_0)^2/2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

(see the picture on the right). This latter integral is a [[Gaussian integral]] if the limits of integration go from −∞ to +∞ (which can be assumed because the exponential decays very fast away from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), and thus it can be calculated. We find

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b\! e^{M f(x)}\, dx\approx \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{M|f''(x_0)|}}e^{M f(x_0)}  \text { as } M\to\infty. \,&lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of this method and extension to arbitrary precision is provided by Fog (2008).

'''Formal statement and proof:'''

Assume that &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a twice continuously differentiable function on &lt;math&gt; [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x_0 \in (a,b) &lt;/math&gt; the unique point such that &lt;math&gt; f(x_0) = \max_{[a,b]} f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.  Assume additionally that &lt;math&gt; f''(x_0)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then,

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{
  \int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \, dx}
  {e^{nf(x_0)} \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n \left(-f''\left(x_0\right) \right)}}}
= 1
&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title={{center|Proof}}}}
'''Lower bound''':

Let &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then by the continuity of &lt;math&gt; f'' &lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt; |x_0-c|&lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; f''(c) \ge f''(x_0) - \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;.  By [[Taylor's Theorem]],  for any &lt;math&gt; x \in (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge f(x_0) + \frac{1}{2}(f''(x_0) - \varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2  &lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have the following lower bound:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_a^b e^{n f(x) } \, dx 
\\
&amp; \ge \int_{x_0 - \delta}^{x_0 + \delta} e^{n f(x)} \, dx 
\\
&amp; \ge  e^{n f(x_0)} \int_{x_0 - \delta}^{x_0 + \delta} e^{\frac{n}{2} (f''(x_0) - \varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \, dx
\\
&amp;= e^{n f(x_0)} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)}} \cdot
\\
&amp; \cdot
\int_{-\delta \sqrt{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)} }^{\delta \sqrt{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)} } e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2} \, dy
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality was obtained by a change of variables &lt;math&gt; y= \sqrt{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)} (x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Remember that &lt;math&gt; f''(x_0)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt; so that is why we can take the square root of its negation.

If we divide both sides of the above inequality by &lt;math&gt; e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} &lt;/math&gt; and take the limit we get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \,dx}{ e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} } \ge
\\
&amp; \ge \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\delta\sqrt{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)} }^{\delta \sqrt{n (-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)} } e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2} \, dy \, \cdot \sqrt{\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon}}
\\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) + \varepsilon}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

since this is true for arbitrary &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; we get the lower bound:

: &lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \, dx}{ e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} } \ge 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this proof works also when &lt;math&gt; a = -\infty &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; b= \infty &lt;/math&gt; (or both).

'''Upper bound''':

The proof of the upper bound is similar to the proof of the lower bound but there are a few inconveniences.  Again we start by picking an &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; but in order for the proof to work we need &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; small enough so that &lt;math&gt; f''(x_0) + \varepsilon &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then, as above, by continuity of &lt;math&gt; f'' &lt;/math&gt; and [[Taylor's Theorem]] we can find &lt;math&gt; \delta&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; so that if &lt;math&gt; |x-x_0| &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(x) \le f(x_0) + \frac{1}{2} (f''(x_0) + \varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Lastly, by our assumptions (assuming &lt;math&gt; a,b &lt;/math&gt; are finite) there exists an &lt;math&gt; \eta &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt; |x-x_0|\ge \delta &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(x) \le f(x_0) - \eta &lt;/math&gt;.

Then we can calculate the following upper bound:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_a^b e^{n f(x) } \, dx \le
\\
&amp; \le \int_a^{x_0-\delta} e^{n f(x) } \, dx + \int_{x_0-\delta}^{x_0 + \delta} e^{n f(x) } \, dx +
\\
&amp; + \int_{x_0 + \delta}^b e^{n f(x) } \, dx
\\
&amp; \le (b-a)e^{n (f(x_0) - \eta)} + \int_{x_0-\delta}^{x_0 + \delta} e^{n f(x) } \, dx
\\
&amp; \le (b-a)e^{n (f(x_0) - \eta)} + e^{n f(x_0)} \int_{x_0-\delta}^{x_0 + \delta} e^{\frac{n}{2} (f''(x_0)+\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \, dx
\\
&amp; \le (b-a)e^{n (f(x_0) - \eta)} + e^{n f(x_0)} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{\frac{n}{2} (f''(x_0)+\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \, dx
\\
&amp; \le (b-a)e^{n (f(x_0) - \eta)} + e^{n f(x_0)} \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0) - \varepsilon)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we divide both sides of the above inequality by &lt;math&gt; e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} &lt;/math&gt; and take the limit we get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \, dx}{ e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} } \le
\\
&amp; \le \lim_{n \to +\infty} (b-a) e^{-\eta n} \sqrt{\frac{n (-f''(x_0))}{2 \pi}} +
\\
&amp; + \sqrt{\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) - \varepsilon}} 
\\
&amp; = \sqrt{\frac{-f''(x_0)}{-f''(x_0) - \varepsilon}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary we get the upper bound:

: &lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \, dx}{ e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} } \le 1
&lt;/math&gt;

And combining this with the lower bound gives the result.

Note that the above proof obviously fails when &lt;math&gt; a = -\infty &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; b = \infty &lt;/math&gt; (or both). To deal with these cases, we need some extra assumptions. A sufficient (not necessary) assumption is that for &lt;math&gt; n = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the integral &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \, dx &lt;/math&gt; is finite, and that the number &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; as above exists (note that this must be an assumption in the case when the interval &lt;math&gt; [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; is infinite). The proof proceeds otherwise as above, but the integrals

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_a^{x_0-\delta} e^{n f(x) } \, dx + \int_{x_0 + \delta}^b e^{n f(x) } \, dx
&lt;/math&gt;

must be approximated by

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_a^{x_0-\delta} e^{n f(x) } \, dx + \int_{x_0 + \delta}^b e^{n f(x) } \, dx \le
\\
&amp; \le \int_a^b e^{f(x)}e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \eta)} \, dx 
\\
&amp; =  e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \eta)} \int_a^b e^{f(x)} \, dx
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

instead of &lt;math&gt; (b-a)e^{n (f(x_0) - \eta)} &lt;/math&gt; as above, so that when we divide by &lt;math&gt; e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}} &lt;/math&gt;, we get for this term

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \eta)} \int_a^b e^{f(x)} \, dx }{e^{nf(x_0)}\sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{n (-f''(x_0))}}} =
\\
&amp; = e^{-(n-1)\eta} \sqrt{n} e^{-f(x_0)} \int_a^b e^{f(x)} \, dx \sqrt{\frac{ -f''(x_0)}{ 2 \pi}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

whose limit as &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. The rest of the proof (the analysis of the interesting term) proceeds as above.

The given condition in the infinite interval case is, as said above, sufficient but not necessary. However, the condition is fulfilled in many, if not in most, applications: the condition simply says that the integral we are studying must be well-defined (not infinite) and that the maximum of the function at &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; must be a "true" maximum (the number &lt;math&gt; \eta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; must exist). There is no need to demand that the integral is finite for &lt;math&gt; n =1 &lt;/math&gt; but it is enough to demand that the integral is finite for some &lt;math&gt; n = N &lt;/math&gt;.

This method relies on 4 basic concepts such as
{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title={{center|Concepts}}}}
:'''1. Relative error'''
First of all, we need to have an understanding about the so-called “approximation” in this method is related to the [[relative error]] instead of the [[absolute error]]. Therefore, if we set

&lt;math&gt; s = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{M\left|f''(x_0)\right|}} &lt;/math&gt;

, this integration can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; \int_a^b\! e^{M f(x)} \, dx =
\\
&amp; = se^{Mf(x_0)} \frac{1}{s}\int_a^b\! e^{M(f(x)-f(x_0))}\, dx 
\\   
&amp; = se^{Mf(x_0)} \int_{(a-x_0)/s}^{(b-x_0)/s}\! e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))}\,dy 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a small number when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a large number obviously and the relative error will be
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\left| \int_{(a-x_0)/s}^{(b-x_0)/s}  e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))} dy-1 \right|.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let us separate this integration into two parts: &lt;math&gt; y\in[-D_y,D_y] &lt;/math&gt; region and the rest part.

:'''2. function &lt;math&gt; e^{M\left(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0) \right)} &lt;/math&gt; will tend to &lt;math&gt; e^{-\pi y^2} &lt;/math&gt; around the [[stationary point]] when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is large enough'''

Let’s look at the [[Taylor expansion]] of &lt;math&gt; M\left( f(x)-f(x_0) \right)&lt;/math&gt; around  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and translate ''x'' to ''y'' because we do the comparison in y-space, we will get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; M\left( f(x)-f(x_0) \right) =
\\
&amp; = \frac{Mf''(x_0)}{2}s^2y^2 +\frac{Mf''' (x_0)}{6}s^3y^3+ \cdots 
\\    
&amp; = -\pi y^2 +O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\right). 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; f'(x_0)=0&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a stationary point.
From this equation you will find that the terms higher than second derivative in this Taylor expansion is suppressed as the order of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; \exp\left(M\left( f(x)-f(x_0) \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt; will get closer to the [[Gaussian function]] as shown in figure. Besides,

&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\pi y^2} dy =1. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:For laplace method --- with different M.png|thumb|The figure of &lt;math&gt; e^{M[f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0)]} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; equals 1, 2 and 3, and the red line is the curve of function &lt;math&gt; e^{-\pi y^2} &lt;/math&gt; .]]

:'''3. The bigger &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is, the smaller range of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is related'''

Because we do the comparison in y-space, &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt; is fixed in &lt;math&gt; y\in[-D_y,D_y] &lt;/math&gt;which will cause &lt;math&gt; x\in[-sD_y,sD_y] &lt;/math&gt;; however, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is inversely proportional to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{M} &lt;/math&gt;, the chosen region of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be smaller when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is increased.

:'''4. If the integration used by Laplace’s method is converged, the contribution of the region which is not around the stationary point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; of the integration of its relative error will tend to zero when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is increased.'''

Relying on the 3rd concept, even if we choose a very large ''D''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; , ''sD''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; will finally be a very small number when &lt;math&gt;M &lt;/math&gt; is increased to a huge number. Then, how can we guarantee the integration of the rest part will tend to 0 when &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is large enough?

The basic idea is trying to find a function &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; which will &lt;math&gt; m(x)\ge f(x) &lt;/math&gt; and the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{Mm(x)} &lt;/math&gt; will tend to zero when &lt;math&gt;M &lt;/math&gt; is increased. Because the exponential function of &lt;math&gt;Mm(x)&lt;/math&gt; will be always larger than zero as long as &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, and this exponential function is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; , the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{Mf(x)} &lt;/math&gt; will tend to zero. For simplicity, let me choose &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; as a [[tangent]] through the point &lt;math&gt; x=sD_y &lt;/math&gt; as shown in the figure:

[[File:For laplace method --- upper limit function m(x).gif|thumb|  &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is denoted by the two [[tangent]] lines passing through &lt;math&gt; x=\pm sD_y+x_0 &lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt; sD_y &lt;/math&gt; gets smaller, the cover region will be larger. ]]

If the interval of the integration of this method is finite, we will find that no matter &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is continue in the rest region, it will be always smaller than &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; shown above when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is large enough. By the way, it will be proved later that the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{Mm(x)} &lt;/math&gt; will tend to zero when &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is large enough.

If the interval of the integration of this method is infinite, &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; might always cross to each other. If so, we cannot guarantee that the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{Mf(x)} &lt;/math&gt; will tend to zero finally. For example, in the case of &lt;math&gt; f(x)=\frac{sin(x)}{x} &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \int^{\infty}_{0}e^{Mf(x)} dx &lt;/math&gt;  will be always diverged. Therefore, we need to require that &lt;math&gt; \int^{\infty}_{d}e^{Mf(x)} dx &lt;/math&gt; can converge for the infinite interval case. If so, this integration will tend to zero when &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is large enough and we can choose this &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; as the cross of &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; .

You might ask that why not choose &lt;math&gt;\int^{\infty}_{d}e^{f(x)} dx &lt;/math&gt; as a convergent integration? Let me use an example to show you the reason. Suppose the rest part of &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; -\ln x &lt;/math&gt; , then &lt;math&gt; e^{f(x)}=\frac{1}{x} &lt;/math&gt; and its integration will diverge; however, when &lt;math&gt; M=2 &lt;/math&gt; ,the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{Mf(x)}=\frac{1}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt; converges. So, the integrations of some functions will diverge when &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is not a large number, but they will converge when &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is large enough.
{{hidden end}}

Based on these four concepts, we can derive the relative error of this Laplace's method.

==Other formulations==
Laplace's approximation is sometimes written as

:&lt;math&gt;
 \int_a^b\! h(x) e^{M g(x)}\, dx
\ \approx\ \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{M|g''(x_0)|}} h(x_0) e^{M g(x_0)} \ \text { as } M\to\infty \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is positive.

Importantly, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the variable of integration, that is, on what stays in &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and what goes into &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Ronald W |date=2007 |title=Saddlepoint approximations and applications |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87250-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|The derivation of its relative error}}}}
First of all, let me set the global maximum is located at &lt;math&gt;x_0=0&lt;/math&gt; which can simplify the derivation and does not lost any important information; therefore, all the derivation inside this sub-section is under this assumption. Besides, what we want is the relative error  &lt;math&gt;\left|R \right|&lt;/math&gt; as shown below

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_a^b\! h(x) e^{M g(x)}\, dx  
\\
&amp;= h(0)e^{Mg(0)}s \underbrace{\int_{a/s}^{b/s}\frac{h(x)}{h(0)}e^{M\left[ g(sy)-g(0) \right]} dy}_{1+R},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; s\equiv\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{M\left| g'' (0) \right|}}&lt;/math&gt;.
So, if we let &lt;math&gt; A\equiv \frac{h(sy)}{h(0)}e^{M\left[g(sy)-g(0) \right]} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A_0\equiv e^{-\pi y^2} &lt;/math&gt;, we can get

:&lt;math&gt; 
\left| R\right| = \left| \int_{a/s}^{b/s}A\,dy -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A_0\,dy   \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A_0\,dy =1&lt;/math&gt;. Now, let us find its upper bound.

Owing to &lt;math&gt; \left| A+B \right| \le |A|+|B| &lt;/math&gt;, we can separate this integration into 5 parts with 3 different types (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|R| &amp; &lt; \underbrace{\left| \int_{D_y}^{\infty}A_0 dy \right|}_{(a_1)} +  \underbrace{\left| \int_{D_y}^{b/s}A dy \right|}_{(b_1)}+ \underbrace{\left| \int_{-D_y}^{D_y}\left(A-A_0\right) dy \right|}_{(c)} +
\\
&amp; + \underbrace{\left| \int_{a/s}^{-D_y}A dy \right|}_{(b_2)} + \underbrace{\left| \int_{-\infty}^{-D_y}A_0 dy \right|}_{(a_2)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; (a_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (a_2) &lt;/math&gt; are similar, let us just calculate &lt;math&gt; (a_1) &lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt; (b_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (b_2) &lt;/math&gt; are similar, too, I’ll just calculate &lt;math&gt; (b_1) &lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;(a_1)&lt;/math&gt;, after the translation of &lt;math&gt; z\equiv\pi y^2 &lt;/math&gt;, we can get

:&lt;math&gt; (a_1) = \left| \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{\pi D_y^2}^{\infty} e^{-z}z^{-1/2} dz\right| &lt;\frac{e^{-\pi D_y^2}}{2\pi D_y}. &lt;/math&gt;

This means that as long as &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; is large enough, it will tend to zero.

For &lt;math&gt;(b_1)&lt;/math&gt;, we can get

:&lt;math&gt; (b_1)\le\left| \int_{D_y}^{b/s}\left[\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)}\right]_{\text{max}} e^{Mm(sy)}dy \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; m(x) \ge g(x)-g(0) \,\,\text{as}\,\, x\in [sD_y,b]&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; h(x) &lt;/math&gt; should have the same sign of &lt;math&gt; h(0) &lt;/math&gt; during this region.
Let us choose &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; as the tangent across the point at &lt;math&gt; x=sD_y &lt;/math&gt; , i.e. &lt;math&gt; m(sy)= g(sD_y)-g(0) +g'(sD_y)\left( sy-sD_y \right)&lt;/math&gt; which is shown in the figure

[[File:For laplace method --- upper limit function m(x).gif|thumb|&lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the tangent lines across the point at &lt;math&gt; x=sD_y &lt;/math&gt; .]]

From this figure you can find that when &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;D_y&lt;/math&gt; gets smaller, the region satisfies the above inequality will get larger. Therefore, if we want to find a suitable &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; to cover the whole &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; during the interval of &lt;math&gt;(b_1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D_y&lt;/math&gt; will have an upper limit. Besides, because the integration of &lt;math&gt; e^{-\alpha x} &lt;/math&gt; is simple, let me use it to estimate the relative error contributed by this &lt;math&gt;(b_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Based on Taylor expansion, we can get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; M\left[g(sD_y)-g(0)\right] =
\\
&amp; = M\left[ \frac{g''(0)}{2}s^2D_y^2 +\frac{g'''(\xi)}{6}s^3D_y^3 \right] \,\, \text{as}\,\, \xi\in[0,sD_y] 
\\
&amp; = -\pi D_y^2 +\frac{(2\pi)^{3/2}g'''(\xi)D_y^3}{6\sqrt{M}|g''(0)|^{3/2}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; Msg'(sD_y) =
\\
&amp; = Ms\left(g''(0)sD_y +\frac{g'''(\zeta)}{2}s^2D_y^2\right), \,\, \text{as} \,\,\zeta\in[0,sD_y] 
\\
&amp; = -2\pi D_y +\sqrt{\frac{2}{M}}\left( \frac{\pi}{|g''(0)|} \right)^{3/2}g'''(\zeta)D_y^2,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and then substitute them back into the calculation of &lt;math&gt; (b_1) &lt;/math&gt;; however, you can find that the remainders of these two expansions are both inversely proportional to the square root of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, let me drop them out to beautify the calculation. Keeping them is better, but it will make the formula uglier.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(b_1)  &amp; \le \left|\left[ \frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \right]_{\text{max}} e^{-\pi D_y^2}\int_0^{b/s-D_y}e^{-2\pi D_y y} dy \right| 
\\
 &amp; \le  \left|\left[ \frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \right]_{\text{max}} e^{-\pi D_y^2}\frac{1}{2\pi D_y} \right|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it will tend to zero when &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; gets larger, but don't forget that the upper bound of &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; should be considered during this calculation.

About the integration near &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, we can also use [[Taylor's Theorem]] to calculate it. When &lt;math&gt; h'(0) \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(c) &amp; \le \int_{-D_y}^{D_y} e^{-\pi y^2} \left| \frac{sh'(\xi)}{h(0)}y \right|\, dy 
\\
&amp; &lt; \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi M |g''(0)|}} \left| \frac{h'(\xi)}{h(0)} \right|_\text{max} \left( 1-e^{-\pi D_y^2} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and you can find that it is inversely proportional to the square root of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. In fact, &lt;math&gt;(c)&lt;/math&gt; will have the same behave when &lt;math&gt;h(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

Conclusively, the integration near the stationary point will get smaller when &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{M}&lt;/math&gt; gets larger, and the rest parts will tend to zero as long as &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; is large enough; however, we need to remember that &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; has an upper limit which is decided by whether the function &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is always larger than &lt;math&gt; g(x)-g(0) &lt;/math&gt; during this rest region. However, as long as we can find one &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; satisfies this condition, the upper bound of &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; can be chosen as directly proportional to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{M} &lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a tangent across the point of &lt;math&gt;g(x)-g(0)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=sD_y&lt;/math&gt;. So, the bigger &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is, the bigger &lt;math&gt; D_y &lt;/math&gt; can be.

In the multivariate case where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector and &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, Laplace's approximation is usually written as:

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; \int e^{M f(\mathbf{x})}\, d\mathbf{x} 
 \approx \left(\frac{2\pi}{M}\right)^{d/2}
  \frac{e^{M f(\mathbf{x}_0)}}{\left|-H(f)(\mathbf{x}_0)\right|^{1/2}} \text { as } M\to\infty \,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(f)(\mathbf{x}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hessian matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[matrix determinant]]. Analogously to the univariate case, the Hessian is required to be [[Positive-definite matrix|negative definite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By the way, although &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector, the term &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes an [[infinitesimal]] [[Volume element|volume]] here, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x} := dx_1dx_2\cdots dx_d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Laplace's method extension: Steepest descent==
{{main|method of steepest descent}}

In extensions of Laplace's method, [[complex analysis]], and in particular [[Cauchy's integral formula]], is used to find a contour ''of steepest descent'' for an (asymptotically with large ''M'') equivalent integral, expressed as a [[line integral]]. In particular, if no point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where the derivative of ''ƒ'' vanishes exists on the real
line, it may be necessary to deform the integration contour to an optimal one, where the above analysis will be possible. Again the main idea is to reduce, at least asymptotically, the calculation of the given integral to that of a simpler integral that can be explicitly evaluated. See the book of Erdelyi (1956) for a simple discussion (where the method is termed ''steepest descents'').

The appropriate formulation for the complex ''z''-plane is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_a^b\! e^{M f(z)}\, dz \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{-Mf''(z_0)}}e^{M f(z_0)} \text{ as } M\to\infty. \,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for a path passing through the saddle point at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
Note the explicit appearance of a minus sign to indicate the direction of the second derivative: one must ''not'' take the modulus.  Also note that if the integrand is [[meromorphic]], one may have to add residues corresponding to poles traversed while deforming the contour (see for example section 3 of Okounkov's paper ''Symmetric functions and random partitions'').

==Further generalizations==
An extension of the steepest descent method is the so-called ''nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method''. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of [[Riemann–Hilbert problem|Riemann–Hilbert factorization problem]]s.

Given a contour ''C'' in the [[complex sphere]], a function ''ƒ'' defined on that contour and a special point, say infinity, one seeks a function ''M'' holomorphic away from the contour ''C'', with prescribed jump across ''C'', and with a given normalization at infinity. If ''ƒ'' and hence ''M'' are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution.

An asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann–Hilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann–Hilbert problem. Cauchy's theorem is used to justify deformations of the jump contour.

The nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou.
As in the linear case, "steepest descent contours" solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be "S-curves" (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov).

The nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of soliton equations
and [[integrable model]]s, [[random matrices]] and [[combinatorics]].

==Complex integrals==
For complex integrals in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} g(s)e^{st} \,ds &lt;/math&gt;

with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, we make the substitution ''t'' = ''iu'' and the change of variable ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ix'' to get the bilateral Laplace transform:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(c+ix)e^{-ux}e^{icu} \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

We then split ''g''(''c''+''ix'') in its real and complex part, after which we recover ''u'' = ''t'' / ''i''. This is useful for [[inverse Laplace transform]]s, the [[Perron formula]] and complex integration.

==Example 1: Stirling's approximation==
Laplace's method can be used to derive [[Stirling's approximation]]
:&lt;math&gt;N!\approx \sqrt{2\pi N} N^N e^{-N}\,&lt;/math&gt;
for a large [[integer]]&amp;nbsp;''N''.

From the definition of the [[Gamma function]], we have
:&lt;math display="block"&gt;N! = \Gamma(N+1)=\int_0^\infty e^{-x} x^N \, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

Now we change variables, letting
::&lt;math&gt;x = N z \,&lt;/math&gt;
so that
::&lt;math&gt;dx = N \, dz. &lt;/math&gt;
Plug these values back in to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
N! &amp; = \int_0^\infty e^{-N z} \left(N z \right)^N N \, dz \\
&amp; = N^{N+1}\int_0^\infty e^{-N z} z^N \, dz \\
&amp; = N^{N+1}\int_0^\infty e^{-N z} e^{N\ln z} \, dz \\
&amp; = N^{N+1}\int_0^\infty e^{N(\ln z-z)} \, dz.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This integral has the form necessary for Laplace's method with
:&lt;math&gt;f \left( z \right) = \ln{z}-z &lt;/math&gt;
which is twice-differentiable:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \frac{1}{z}-1,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f''(z) = -\frac{1}{z^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The maximum of ''ƒ''(''z'') lies at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and the second derivative of ''ƒ''(''z'') has the value&amp;nbsp;−1 at this point. Therefore, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;N! \approx N^{N+1}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{N}} e^{-N}=\sqrt{2\pi N} N^N e^{-N}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">In mathematics, a '''Liouvillian function''' is an [[elementary function]] or (recursively) the [[antiderivative|integral]] of a Liouvillian function.

More explicitly, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] which is the [[function composition|composition]] of a finite number of [[arithmetic|arithmetic operations]] {{nowrap|(+ – × ÷)}}, [[exponential function|exponential]]s, [[coefficient|constant]]s, [[Algebraic equation|solutions of algebraic equations]] (a generalization of [[nth root|''n''th roots]]), and [[antiderivative]]s. The [[logarithm]] function does not need to be explicitly included since it is the integral of &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows directly from the definition that the set of Liouvillian functions is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under arithmetic operations, composition, and integration. It is also closed under [[derivative|differentiation]]. It is not closed under [[series (mathematics)|limits and infinite sums]].

Liouvillian functions were introduced by [[Joseph Liouville]] in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841.

==Examples==

All [[elementary function]]s are Liouvillian.

Examples of well-known functions which are Liouvillian but not elementary are the [[nonelementary integral]]s, for example:
* The [[error function]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{erf}(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^x e^{-t^2}\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[exponential integral|exponential]] (''Ei''), [[logarithmic integral|logarithmic]] (''Li'' or ''li'') and [[Fresnel integral|Fresnel]] (''S'' and ''C'') integrals.

All Liouvillian functions are solutions of [[algebraic differential equation]]s, but not conversely. Examples of functions which are solutions of algebraic differential equations but not Liouvillian include:&lt;ref&gt;L. Chan, E.S. Cheb-Terrab, "Non-liouvillian solutions for second order Linear ODEs", ''Proceedings of the 2004 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation (ISSAC '04)'', 2004, pp. 80–86 {{doi|10.1145/1005285.1005299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Bessel function]]s (except special cases);
* the [[hypergeometric function]]s (except special cases).

Examples of functions which are ''not'' solutions of algebraic differential equations and thus not Liouvillian include all [[transcendentally transcendental function]]s, such as:

* the [[gamma function]];
* the [[zeta function]].

In [[mathematics]], the term '''local analysis''' has at least two meanings - both derived from the idea of looking at a problem relative to each [[prime number]] ''p'' first, and then later trying to integrate the information gained at each prime into a 'global' picture. These are forms of the [[:Category:Localization (mathematics)|localization]] approach.

==Group theory==
In [[group theory]], local analysis was started by the [[Sylow theorems]], which contain significant information about the structure of a [[finite group]] ''G'' for each prime number ''p'' dividing the order of ''G''. This area of study was enormously developed in the quest for the [[classification of finite simple groups]], starting with the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] that groups of odd order are [[solvable group|solvable]].

==Number theory==
{{main|Localization of a ring}}

In [[number theory]] one may study a [[Diophantine equation]], for example, modulo ''p'' for all primes ''p'', looking for constraints on solutions. The next step is to look modulo prime powers, and then for solutions in the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic field]]. This kind of local analysis provides conditions for solution that are ''necessary''. In cases where local analysis (plus the condition that there are real solutions) provides also ''sufficient'' conditions, one says that the ''[[Hasse principle]]'' holds: this is the best possible situation. It does for [[quadratic form]]s, but certainly not in general (for example for [[elliptic curve]]s). The point of view that one would like to understand what extra conditions are needed has been very influential, for example for cubic forms.

Some form of local analysis underlies both the standard applications of the [[Hardy-Littlewood circle method]] in [[analytic number theory]], and the use of [[adele ring]]s, making this one of the unifying principles across number theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">In [[mathematics]], the '''Loomis–Whitney inequality''' is a result in [[geometry]], which in its simplest form, allows one to estimate the "size" of a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-[[dimension]]al set by the sizes of its &lt;math&gt;(d-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional projections. The inequality has applications in [[incidence geometry]], the study of so-called "lattice animals", and other areas.

The result is named after the [[United States|American]] [[mathematicians]] [[Lynn Harold Loomis]] and [[Hassler Whitney]], and was published in 1949.

==Statement of the inequality==
Fix a dimension &lt;math&gt;d\ge 2&lt;/math&gt; and consider the projections

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{j} : \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}^{d - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{j} : x = (x_{1}, \dots, x_{d}) \mapsto \hat{x}_{j} = (x_{1}, \dots, x_{j - 1}, x_{j + 1}, \dots, x_{d}).&lt;/math&gt;

For each 1 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''d'', let

:&lt;math&gt;g_{j} : \mathbb{R}^{d - 1} \to [0, + \infty),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{j} \in L^{d - 1} (\mathbb{R}^{d -1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the '''Loomis–Whitney inequality''' holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \prod_{j = 1}^{d} g_{j} ( \pi_{j} (x) ) \, \mathrm{d} x \leq \prod_{j = 1}^{d} \| g_{j} \|_{L^{d - 1} (\mathbb{R}^{d - 1})}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, taking

:&lt;math&gt;f_{j} (x) = g_{j} (x)^{d - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \prod_{j = 1}^{d} f_{j} ( \pi_{j} (x) )^{1 / (d - 1)} \, \mathrm{d} x \leq \prod_{j = 1}^{d} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d - 1}} f_{j} (\hat{x}_{j}) \, \mathrm{d} \hat{x}_{j} \right)^{1 / (d - 1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==A special case==
The Loomis–Whitney inequality can be used to relate the [[Lebesgue measure]] of a subset of [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; to its "average widths" in the coordinate directions. Let ''E'' be some [[measurable set|measurable subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; and let

:&lt;math&gt;f_{j} = \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{j} (E)}&lt;/math&gt;

be the [[indicator function]] of the projection of ''E'' onto the ''j''th coordinate hyperplane. It follows that for any point ''x'' in ''E'',

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{j = 1}^{d} f_{j} (\pi_{j} (x))^{1 / (d - 1)} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, by the Loomis–Whitney inequality,

:&lt;math&gt;| E | \leq \prod_{j = 1}^{d} | \pi_{j} (E) |^{1 / (d - 1)},&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:&lt;math&gt;| E | \geq \prod_{j = 1}^{d} \frac{| E |}{| \pi_{j} (E) |}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{| E |}{| \pi_{j} (E) |}&lt;/math&gt;

can be thought of as the average width of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th coordinate direction. This interpretation of the Loomis–Whitney inequality also holds if we consider a finite subset of Euclidean space and replace Lebesgue measure by [[counting measure]].

==Generalizations==
The Loomis–Whitney inequality is a special case of the [[Brascamp–Lieb inequality]], in which the projections ''π&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' above are replaced by more general [[linear map]]s, not necessarily all mapping onto spaces of the same dimension.

In [[mathematical finance]], '''Margrabe's formula'''&lt;ref&gt;William Margrabe, [http://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/~stalimtw/MFE5010/PDF/margrabe1978.pdf "The Value of an Option to Exchange One Asset for Another"], [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. 33, No. 1, (March 1978), pp. 177-186.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[option (finance)|option]] pricing formula applicable to an option to exchange one risky asset for another risky asset at maturity. It was derived by [[William Margrabe]] (PhD Chicago) in 1978. Margrabe's paper has been cited by over 1500 subsequent articles.&lt;ref&gt; [[Google Scholar]]'s [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11754033794255374583&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en "cites" page for this article]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Formula==
Suppose ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' are the prices of two risky assets at time ''t'', and that each has a constant continuous dividend yield ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The option, ''C'', that we wish to price gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to exchange the second asset for the first at the time of maturity ''T''.  In other words, its payoff, ''C(T)'', is max(0, ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(T) - S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(T))''.

If the volatilities of ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' 's are ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then &lt;math&gt; \textstyle\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 - 2 \sigma_1\sigma_2\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''&amp;rho;'' is the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the Brownian motions of the ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' 's.

Margrabe's formula states that the fair price for the option at time 0 is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-q_1 T}S_1(0) N(d_1) - e^{-q_2 T}S_2(0) N(d_2)&lt;/math&gt;

:where:
::&lt;math&gt;q_1,q_2&lt;/math&gt; are the expected dividend rates of the prices &lt;math&gt;S_1,S_2&lt;/math&gt; under the appropriate risk-neutral measure,
::&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[cumulative distribution function]] for a [[normal distribution|standard normal]], 
::&lt;math&gt;d_1 = (\ln (S_1(0)/S_2(0)) + (q_2 - q_1 + \sigma^2/2)T)/ \sigma\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt;, 
::&lt;math&gt;d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivation==
Margrabe's model of the market assumes only the existence of the two risky assets, whose prices, as usual, are assumed to follow a [[geometric Brownian motion]].  The volatilities of these Brownian motions do not need to be constant, but it is important that the volatility of ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''&amp;sigma;'', is constant.  In particular, the model does not assume the existence of a riskless asset (such as a [[zero-coupon bond]]) or any kind of [[interest rate]]. The model does not require an equivalent risk-neutral probability measure, but an equivalent measure under S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The formula is quickly [[Mathematical proof|proven]] by reducing the situation to one where we can apply the [[Black-Scholes formula]].  
*First, consider both assets as priced in units of ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (this is called 'using ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' as [[numeraire]]'); this means that a unit of the first asset now has is worth ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' units of the second asset, and a unit of the second asset is worth 1.  
*Under this change of numeraire pricing, the second asset is now a riskless asset and its dividend rate ''q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the interest rate.  The payoff of the option, repriced under this change of numeraire, is max(0, ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(T)/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(T) - 1)''.  
*So the original option has become a [[call option]] on the first asset (with its numeraire pricing) with a strike of 1 unit of the riskless asset.  Note the dividend rate ''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the first asset remains the same even with change of pricing.
*Applying the [[Black-Scholes formula]] with these values as the appropriate inputs, e.g. initial asset value ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(0)/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0)'', interest rate ''q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', volatility ''&amp;sigma;'', etc., gives us the price of the option under numeraire pricing.  
*Since the resulting option price is in units of ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', multiplying through by ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0)'' will undo our change of numeraire, and give us the price in our original currency, which is the formula above. Alternatively, one can show it by the [[Girsanov theorem]].

'''Mathematical diagrams''' are [[diagram]]s in the field of [[mathematics]], and diagrams using mathematics such as [[chart]]s and [[graph of a function|graphs]], that are mainly designed to convey mathematical relationships, for example, comparisons over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2993&amp;topic=all Working with diagrams] at LearningSpace.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of mathematical diagrams ==

=== Argand diagram ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|120px|Argand diagram.]]
A [[complex number]] can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an [[Argand diagram]]
The [[complex plane]] is sometimes called the ''Argand plane'' because it is used in ''Argand diagrams''. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.&lt;br/&gt;({{cite book |first1=Edmund Taylor |last1=Whittaker |first2=G.N. |last2=Watson |title=A Course of Modern Analysis: An Introduction to the General Theory of Infinite Processes and of Analytic Functions, with an Account of the Principal Transcendental Functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1927 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58807-2 |page=9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[root of a function|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

The concept of the complex plane allows a [[geometric]] interpretation of complex numbers. Under [[addition]], they add like [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s. The [[multiplication]] of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in [[polar coordinates]] — the magnitude or ''modulus'' of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the angle or ''argument'' of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|120px|left|Butterfly diagram]]

=== Butterfly diagram ===
In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a [[Butterfly diagram|butterfly]] is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

The [[butterfly diagram]] show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] as in the [[morpho|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name.

[[Image:5 lemma.svg|thumb|300px|A commutative diagram depicting the [[five lemma]]]]

=== Commutative diagram ===
{{Main|Commutative diagram}}

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a commutative diagram is a diagram of [[Object (category theory)|objects]], also known as vertices, and [[morphism]]s, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.

Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|left|120px|Hasse diagram.]]

=== Hasse diagrams ===
A [[Hasse diagram]] is a simple picture of a finite [[partially ordered set]], forming a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of the partial order's [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from ''x'' to ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. In this case, we say y [[covering relation|covers]] x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.

[[Image:TrefoilKnot 01.svg|right|thumb|120px|Knot diagram.]]

=== Knot diagrams ===
In [[Knot theory]] a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is [[Injective function|one-to-one]] except at the double points, called ''crossings'', where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Rolfsen |title=Knots and links |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Publish or Perish |isbn=978-0-914098-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, [[alternating knot]]s.

[[Image:Venn diagram cmyk.svg|thumb|120px|right|Venn diagram.]]

=== Venn diagram ===
A [[Venn diagram]] is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861733754/venn_diagram.html "Venn diagram"], Encarta World English Dictionary, North American Edition 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5ZATal Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] (1918). [https://archive.org/details/asurveyofsymboli00lewiuoft ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'']. Republished in part by Dover in 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voronoi centerlines skeleton.gif|left|thumb|120px|Voronoi centerlines.]]

=== Voronoi diagram ===
A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a special kind of decomposition of a [[metric space]] determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a [[discrete set]] of points. This diagram is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], also called a Voronoi [[tessellation]], a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites

[[Image:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|thumb|120px|right|Wallpaper group diagram.]]

=== Wallpaper group diagrams ===
A [[wallpaper group]] or ''plane symmetry group'' or ''plane crystallographic group'' is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional [[symmetry groups]], intermediate in complexity between the simpler [[frieze group]]s and the three-dimensional [[crystallographic group]]s, also called [[space group]]s. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.

=== Young diagram ===
A ''Young diagram'' or [[Young tableau]], also called [[Ferrers diagram]], is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). 
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|120px|left|Young diagram.]]
Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'', the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.

The '''''Mathematical manuscripts of Karl Marx''''' consist mostly of [[Karl Marx]]'s attempts to understand the foundations of [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]], from around 1873–1883. A Russian edition edited by [[Sofya Yanovskaya]]  was eventually published  in 1968, and an English translation was published in 1983 {{harv|Marx|1983}}. 

According to Hubert C. Kennedy, Marx "[...] seems to have been unaware of the advances being made by continental mathematicians in the foundations of [[differential calculus]], including the work of [[Cauchy]]." In the same text, Kennedy says "While Marx's analysis of the derivative and differential had no immediate effect on the historical development of mathematics, Engels' claim that Marx made "independent discoveries" is certainly justified. Marx's [[operational definition]] of the differential anticipated 20th century developments in mathematics, and there is another aspect of the differential, that seems to have been seen by Marx, that has become a standard part of modern textbooks—the concept of the differential as the principal part of an increment.", implying that Marx's apprehension and interpretation of calculus was far from short-sighted. This may have contributed to an interest in [[nonstandard analysis]] among Chinese mathematicians {{harv|Dauben|1998}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">In [[mathematics]], spaces of '''non-positive curvature''' occur in many contexts and form a generalization of [[hyperbolic geometry]]. In the [[category (category theory)|category]] of [[Riemannian manifold]]s, one can consider the [[sectional curvature]] of the manifold and require that this curvature be everywhere less than or equal to zero. The notion of curvature extends to the category of [[geodesic metric space]]s, where one can use [[comparison triangle]]s to quantify the curvature of a space; in this context, non-positively curved spaces are known as (locally) [[CAT(0) space]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9180">[[Image:L-alanine-3D-balls.png|thumb|260px|[[Molecule]] of [[alanine]] used in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] implementation of quantum computing. [[Qubit]]s are implemented by [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[Quantum state|states]] of the black [[carbon]] [[atom]]s]]
'''Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computing''' ('''NMRQC''')&lt;ref&gt;http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~msteffen/nmrqc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the several proposed approaches for constructing a [[quantum computer]], that uses the [[spin (physics)|spin]] states of nuclei within molecules as [[qubit]]s. The quantum states are probed through the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]s, allowing the system to be implemented as a variation of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]. NMR differs from other implementations of [[quantum computer]]s in that it uses an [[quantum ensemble|ensemble]] of systems, in this case molecules, rather than a single pure state.

Initially the approach was to use the spin properties of atoms of particular molecules in a liquid sample as qubits - this is known as liquid state NMR (LSNMR). This approach has since been superseded by [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] NMR (SSNMR) as a means of quantum computation.

== Liquid state NMR ==
The ideal picture of liquid state NMR (LSNMR) quantum information processing (QIP) is based on a molecule of which some of its atom’s nuclei behave as spin-½ systems. Depending on which nuclei we are considering they will have different energy levels and different interaction with its neighbours and so we can treat them as distinguishable qubits. In this system we tend to consider the inter-atomic bonds as the source of interactions between qubits and exploit these spin-spin interactions to perform 2-qubit gates such as CNOTs that are necessary for universal quantum computation. In addition to the spin-spin interactions native to the molecule an external magnetic field can be applied (in NMR laboratories) and these impose single qubit gates. By exploiting the fact that different spins will experience different local fields we have control over the individual spins.

The picture described above is far from realistic since we are treating a single molecule. NMR is performed on an ensemble of molecules, usually with as many as 10^15 molecules. This introduces complications to the model, one of which is introduction of decoherence. In particular we have the problem of an open quantum system interacting with a macroscopic number of particles near thermal equilibrium (~mK to ~300 K). This has led the development of decoherence suppression techniques that have spread to other disciplines such as [[Ion trap|trapped ions]]. The other significant issue with regards to working close to thermal equilibrium is the mixedness of the state. This required the introduction of ensemble quantum processing, whose principal limitation is that as we introduce more logical qubits into our system we require larger samples in order to attain discernable signals during measurement.

== Solid State NMR ==
Solid state NMR (SSNMR) differs from LSNMR in that we have a solid state sample, for example a nitrogen vacancy diamond lattice rather than a liquid sample. This has many advantages such as lack of molecular diffusion decoherence, lower temperatures can be achieved to the point of suppressing phonon decoherence and a greater variety of control operations that allow us to overcome one of the major problems of LSNMR that is initialisation. Moreover, as in a crystal structure we can localize precisely the qubits, we can measure each qubit individually, instead of having an ensamble measurement as in LSNMR.

== History   ==
Liquid state NMR Quantum Information Processing was first theoretically introduced independently by Cory, Fahmy and Havel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cory|first=David G.|last2=Fahmy|first2=Amr F.|last3=Havel|first3=Timothy F.|date=1997-03-04|title=Ensemble quantum computing by NMR spectroscopy|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/5/1634|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=94|issue=5|pages=1634–1639|issn=0027-8424|pmc=19968|pmid=9050830|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.1634C |doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.5.1634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gershenfeld and Chuang&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershenfeld|first=Neil A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=1997-01-17|title=Bulk Spin-Resonance Quantum Computation|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5298/350|journal=Science|language=en|volume=275|issue=5298|pages=350–356|doi=10.1126/science.275.5298.350|issn=0036-8075|pmid=8994025}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997. Some early success was obtained in performing quantum algorithms in NMR systems due to the relative maturity of NMR technology. For instance, in 2001 researchers at [[IBM]] reported the successful implementation of [[Shor's algorithm]] in a 7-[[qubit]] NMR quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vandersypen LM, Steffen M, Breyta G, Yannoni CS, Sherwood MH, Chuang IL |year=2001 |title=Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=6866 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1038/414883a |pmid=11780055|arxiv = quant-ph/0112176 |bibcode = 2001Natur.414..883V }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even from the early days, it was recognized that NMR quantum computers would never be very useful due to the poor scaling of the [[signal to noise ratio]] in such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warren WS |year=1997 |title=The usefulness of NMR quantum computing |journal=Science |volume=277 |issue=5332 |pages=1688–1689 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5332/1688.full |doi=10.1126/science.277.5332.1688}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work, particularly by Caves and others, shows that all experiments in liquid state bulk ensemble NMR quantum computing to date do not possess [[quantum entanglement]], thought to be required for quantum computation. Hence NMR quantum computing experiments are likely to have been only classical simulations of a quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menicucci NC, Caves CM |year=2002 |title=Local realistic model for the dynamics of bulk-ensemble NMR information processing |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |issue=16 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.167901|arxiv = quant-ph/0111152 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88p7901M |pmid=11955265 |page=167901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical representation ==
The ensemble is initialized to be the thermal equilibrium state (see [[quantum statistical mechanics]]). In mathematical parlance, this state is given by the [[density matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{e^{- \beta H}}{\operatorname{Tr}(e^{- \beta H})}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is the hamiltonian matrix of an individual molecule and

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{1}{k \, T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the temperature. That the initial state in NMR quantum computing is in thermal equilibrium is one of the main differences compared to other quantum computing techniques, where they are initialized in a pure state. Nevertheless, suitable mixed states are capable of reflecting quantum dynamics which lead to Gershenfeld and Chuang to term them "pseudo-pure states."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Operations are performed on the ensemble through [[radio frequency]] (RF) pulses applied perpendicular to a strong, static magnetic field, created by a very large magnet. See [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].

Consider applying a magnetic field along the z axis, fixing this as the principal quantization axis, on a liquid sample. The Hamiltonian for a single spin would be given by the Zeeman or chemical shift term:
:&lt;math&gt; H =  \mu B_z = I_z \omega &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_z&lt;/math&gt; is the operator for the z component of the nuclear angular momentum, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the resonance frequency of the spin, which is proportional to the applied magnetic field.

Considering the molecules in the liquid sample to contain two spin ½ nuclei, the system Hamiltonian will have two chemical shift terms and a dipole coupling term:
:&lt;math&gt; H = \omega_1 I_{z1}+\omega_2 I_{z2}+2J_{12}I_{z1}I_{z2} &lt;/math&gt;

Control of a spin system can be realized by means of selective RF pulses applied perpendicular to the quantization axis. In the case of a two spin system as described above, we can distinguish two types of pulses: “soft” or spin-selective pulses, whose frequency range encompasses one of the resonant frequencies only, and therefore affects only that spin; and “hard” or nonselective pulses whose frequency range is broad enough to contain both resonant frequencies and therefore these pulses couple to both spins. For detailed examples of the effects of pulses on such a spin system, the reader is referred to Section 2 of work by Cory et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cory D. |year=1998 |title=Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: An experimentally accessible paradigm for quantum computing |journal=Physica D |volume=120 |doi = 10.1016/S0167-2789(98)00046-3 |arxiv = quant-ph/9709001|bibcode = 1998PhyD..120...82C |display-authors=etal |pages=82–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27433">[[File:Silver spiral approximation.png|thumb|The sides of the squares used to construct a silver spiral are the Pell numbers]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Pell numbers''' are an infinite [[sequence]] of [[integers]], known since ancient times, that comprise the [[denominator]]s of the [[closest rational approximation]]s to the [[square root of 2]]. This sequence of approximations begins {{sfrac|1|1}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|7|5}}, {{sfrac|17|12}}, and {{sfrac|41|29}}, so the sequence of Pell numbers begins with 1, 2, 5, 12, and 29. The numerators of the same sequence of approximations are half the '''companion Pell numbers''' or '''Pell–Lucas numbers'''; these numbers form a second infinite sequence that begins with 2, 6, 14, 34, and 82.

Both the Pell numbers and the companion Pell numbers may be calculated by means of a [[recurrence relation]] similar to that for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, and both sequences of numbers [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]], proportionally to powers of the [[silver ratio]] 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}. As well as being used to approximate the square root of two, Pell numbers can be used to find [[square triangular number]]s, to construct integer approximations to the [[right isosceles triangle]], and to solve certain [[combinatorial enumeration]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Sellers (2002) proves that the number of [[perfect matching]]s in the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of a [[path graph]] and the graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''e'' can be calculated as the product of a Pell number with the corresponding Fibonacci number.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Pell's equation]], the name of the Pell numbers stems from [[Leonhard Euler|Leonhard Euler's]] mistaken attribution of the equation and the numbers derived from it to [[John Pell]]. The Pell–Lucas numbers are also named after [[Édouard Lucas]], who studied sequences defined by recurrences of this type; the Pell and companion Pell numbers are [[Lucas sequence]]s.

== Pell numbers ==

The Pell numbers are defined by the [[recurrence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_n=\begin{cases}0&amp;\mbox{if }n=0;\\1&amp;\mbox{if }n=1;\\2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}&amp;\mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that. The first few terms of the sequence are
:{{num|0}}, [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[29 (number)|29]], [[70 (number)|70]], [[169 (number)|169]], 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860,… {{OEIS|id=A000129}}.

The Pell numbers can also be expressed by the closed form formula
:&lt;math&gt;P_n=\frac{\left(1+\sqrt2\right)^n-\left(1-\sqrt2\right)^n}{2\sqrt2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For large values of ''n'', the {{nowrap|(1 + {{sqrt|2}})&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} term dominates this expression, so the Pell numbers are approximately proportional to powers of the [[silver ratio]] {{nowrap|1 + {{sqrt|2}}}}, analogous to the growth rate of Fibonacci numbers as powers of the [[golden ratio]].

A third definition is possible, from the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] formula
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} P_{n+1} &amp; P_n \\ P_n &amp; P_{n-1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Many identities can be derived or proven from these definitions; for instance an identity analogous to [[Cassini's identity]] for Fibonacci numbers,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n+1}P_{n-1}-P_n^2 = (-1)^n,&lt;/math&gt;
is an immediate consequence of the matrix formula (found by considering the [[determinant]]s of the matrices on the left and right sides of the matrix formula).&lt;ref&gt;For the matrix formula and its consequences see Ercolano (1979) and Kilic and Tasci (2005). Additional identities for the Pell numbers are listed by Horadam (1971) and Bicknell (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approximation to the square root of two ==

[[Image:Pell octagons.svg|thumb|300px|Rational approximations to regular [[octagon]]s, with coordinates derived from the Pell numbers.]]
Pell numbers arise historically and most notably in the [[diophantine approximation|rational approximation]] to [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]. If two large integers ''x'' and ''y'' form a solution to the [[Pell equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;x^2-2y^2=\pm 1,&lt;/math&gt;
then their ratio ''{{sfrac|x|y}}'' provides a close approximation to {{sqrt|2}}. The sequence of approximations of this form is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac11, \frac32, \frac75, \frac{17}{12}, \frac{41}{29}, \frac{99}{70}, \dots&lt;/math&gt;
where the denominator of each fraction is a Pell number and the numerator is the sum of a Pell number and its predecessor in the sequence. That is, the solutions have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{n-1}+P_n}{P_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
The approximation
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2\approx\frac{577}{408}&lt;/math&gt;
of this type was known to Indian mathematicians in the third or fourth century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in the [[Shulba Sutras]]; see e.g. Dutka (1986), who cites Thibaut (1875) for this information.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematicians of the fifth century B.C. also knew of this sequence of approximations:&lt;ref&gt;See Knorr (1976) for the fifth century date, which matches [[Proclus]]' claim that the side and diameter numbers were discovered by the [[Pythagoreans]]. For more detailed exploration of later Greek knowledge of these numbers see Thompson (1929), Vedova (1951), Ridenhour (1986), Knorr (1998), and Filep (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato refers to the numerators as '''rational diameters'''.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, as several of the references from the previous note observe, in [[Plato's Republic]] there is a reference to the "rational diameter of 5", by which [[Plato]] means 7, the numerator of the approximation {{sfrac|7|5}} of which 5 is the denominator.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century CE [[Theon of Smyrna]] used the term the  '''side and diameter numbers''' to describe the denominators and numerators of this sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid|first=Sir Thomas Little|last=Heath|authorlink=Thomas Little Heath|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1921|isbn=9780486240732|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These approximations can be derived from the [[continued fraction]] expansion of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2 = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \ddots\,}}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Truncating this expansion to any number of terms produces one of the Pell-number-based approximations in this sequence; for instance,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{577}{408} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

As Knuth (1994) describes, the fact that Pell numbers approximate {{sqrt|2}} allows them to be used for accurate rational approximations to a regular [[octagon]] with vertex coordinates {{nowrap|(±''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ±''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(±''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ±''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}. All vertices are equally distant from the origin, and form nearly uniform angles around the origin. Alternatively, the points  &lt;math&gt;(\pm(P_i+P_{i-1}),0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(0,\pm(P_i+P_{i-1}))&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\pm P_i,\pm P_i)&lt;/math&gt; form approximate octagons in which the vertices are nearly equally distant from the origin and form uniform angles.

== Primes and squares ==

A '''Pell prime''' is a Pell number that is [[prime number|prime]]. The first few Pell primes are
:2, 5, 29, 5741, 33461, 44560482149, 1746860020068409, 68480406462161287469, ... {{OEIS|id=A086383}}.
The indices of these primes within the sequence of all Pell numbers are
:2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 29, 41, 53, 59, 89, 97, 101, 167, 181, 191, 523, 929, 1217, 1301, 1361, 2087, 2273, 2393, 8093, ... {{OEIS|id=A096650}}
These indices are all themselves prime. As with the Fibonacci numbers, a Pell number ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can only be prime if ''n'' itself is prime, because if ''d'' is a divisor of ''n'' then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is a divisor of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The only Pell numbers that are squares, cubes, or any higher power of an integer are 0, 1, and 169 = 13&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pethő (1992); Cohn (1996). Although the [[Fibonacci number]]s are defined by a very similar recurrence to the Pell numbers, Cohn writes that an analogous result for the Fibonacci numbers seems much more difficult to prove. (However, this was proven in 2006 by Bugeaud et al.)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite having so few squares or other powers, Pell numbers have a close connection to [[square triangular number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sesskin (1962). See the [[square triangular number]] article for a more detailed derivation.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, these numbers arise from the following identity of Pell numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;\bigl(\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\right)\cdot P_k\bigr)^2 = \frac{\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\right)^2\cdot\left(\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\right)^2-(-1)^k\right)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The left side of this identity describes a [[square number]], while the right side describes a [[triangular number]], so the result is a square triangular number.

Santana and Diaz-Barrero (2006) proved another identity relating Pell numbers to squares and showing that the sum of the Pell numbers up to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is always a square:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{4n+1} P_i = \left(\sum_{r=0}^n 2^r{2n+1\choose 2r}\right)^2 = \left(P_{2n}+P_{2n+1}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
For instance, the sum of the Pell numbers up to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|1=0 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 12 + 29 = 49}}, is the square of {{nowrap|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 + 5 = 7}}. The numbers {{nowrap|''P''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} forming the square roots of these sums,
:1, 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, 47321,… {{OEIS|id=A002315}},
are known as the [[Newman–Shanks–Williams number|Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers]].

== Pythagorean triples ==
[[Image:Pell right triangles.svg|thumb|300px|Integer right triangles with nearly equal legs, derived from the Pell numbers.]]
If a [[right triangle]] has integer side lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' (necessarily satisfying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), then (''a'',''b'',''c'') is known as a [[Pythagorean triple]]. As Martin (1875) describes, the Pell numbers can be used to form Pythagorean triples in which ''a'' and ''b'' are one unit apart, corresponding to right triangles that are nearly isosceles. Each such triple has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\left(2P_{n}P_{n+1}, P_{n+1}^2 - P_{n}^2, P_{n+1}^2 + P_{n}^2=P_{2n+1}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The sequence of Pythagorean triples formed in this way is
:(4,3,5), (20,21,29), (120,119,169), (696,697,985),…

== Pell–Lucas numbers ==

The '''companion Pell numbers''' or '''Pell–Lucas numbers''' are defined by the [[recurrence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;Q_n=\begin{cases}2&amp;\mbox{if }n=0;\\2&amp;\mbox{if }n=1;\\2Q_{n-1}+Q_{n-2}&amp;\mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In words: the first two numbers in the sequence are both 2, and each successive number is formed by adding twice the previous Pell–Lucas number to the Pell–Lucas number before that, or equivalently, by adding the next Pell number to the previous Pell number: thus, 82 is the companion to 29, and {{nowrap|1=82 = 2 × 34 + 14 = 70 + 12.}} The first few terms of the sequence are {{OEIS|id=A002203}}: [[2 (number)|2]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[14 (number)|14]], [[34 (number)|34]], [[82 (number)|82]], [[198 (number)|198]], [[478 (number)|478]],…

Like the relationship between [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[Lucas number]]s,
:&lt;math&gt;Q_n=\frac{P_{2n}}{P_n}&lt;/math&gt;
for all natural numbers ''n''.

The companion Pell numbers can be expressed by the closed form formula
:&lt;math&gt;Q_n=\left(1+\sqrt 2\right)^n+\left(1-\sqrt 2\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

These numbers are all even; each such number is twice the numerator in one of the rational approximations to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; discussed above.

Like the Lucas sequence, if a Pell–Lucas number {{sfrac|1|2}}''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is prime, it is necessary that n be either prime or a power of 2. The Pell–Lucas primes are
:3, 7, 17, 41, 239, 577,… {{OEIS|id=A086395}}.

For these ''n'' are 
:2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 19, 29, 47, 59, 163, 257, 421,… {{OEIS|id=A099088}}.

The coefficients are the half-companion Pell numbers ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the Pell numbers ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' which are the (non-negative) solutions to {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ±1}}.
A [[square triangular number]] is a number
:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{t(t+1)}{2}=s^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which is both the ''t''th triangular number and the ''s''th square number. A ''near-isosceles Pythagorean triple'' is an integer solution to {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{nowrap|1=''a'' + 1 = ''b''}}.

The next table shows that splitting the odd number ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' into nearly equal halves gives a square triangular number when ''n'' is even and a near isosceles Pythagorean triple when n is odd. All solutions arise in this manner.

===Definitions===
The half-companion Pell numbers ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the Pell numbers ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be derived in a number of easily equivalent ways.

====Raising to powers====

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\sqrt2\right)^n=H_n+P_n\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-\sqrt2\right)^n=H_n-P_n\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this it follows that there are ''closed forms'':

:&lt;math&gt;H_n=\frac{\left(1+\sqrt2\right)^n+\left(1-\sqrt2\right)^n}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P_n\sqrt2=\frac{\left(1+\sqrt2\right)^n-\left(1-\sqrt2\right)^n}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Paired recurrences====

:&lt;math&gt;H_n=\begin{cases}1&amp;\mbox{if }n=0;\\H_{n-1}+2P_{n-1}&amp;\mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_n=\begin{cases}0&amp;\mbox{if }n=0;\\H_{n-1}+P_{n-1}&amp;\mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

====Matrix formulations====

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} H_n \\ P_n  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} H_{n-1} \\ P_{n-1}  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} H_n &amp; 2P_n \\ P_n &amp; H_n \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Approximations ===

The difference between ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''{{sqrt|2}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-\sqrt2\right)^n \approx (-0.41421)^n,&lt;/math&gt;
which goes rapidly to zero. So 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\sqrt2\right)^n=H_n+P_n\sqrt2\,&lt;/math&gt;
is extremely close to 2''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

From this last observation it follows that the integer ratios ''{{sfrac|H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}'' rapidly approach {{sqrt|2}}; and {{sfrac|''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{sfrac|''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} rapidly approach 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}.

=== ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±1 ===

Since {{sqrt|2}} is irrational, we cannot have ''{{Sfrac|H|P}}''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{H^2}{P^2}=\frac{2P^2}{P^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The best we can achieve is either
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{H^2}{P^2}=\frac{2P^2-1}{P^2}\quad \mbox{or} \quad \frac{H^2}{P^2}=\frac{2P^2+1}{P^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The (non-negative) solutions to {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}} are exactly the pairs {{nowrap|(''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} with ''n'' even, and the solutions to {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}} are exactly the pairs {{nowrap|(''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} with ''n'' odd. To see this, note first that

:&lt;math&gt;H_{n+1}^2-2P_{n+1}^2=\left(H_n+2P_n\right)^2-2\left(H_n+P_n\right)^2=-\left(H_n^2-2P_n^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
so that these differences, starting with {{nowrap|1=''H''{{su|b=0|p=2}} − 2''P''{{su|b=0|p=2}} = 1}}, are alternately 
1 and −1. Then note that every positive solution comes in this way from a solution with smaller integers since 
:&lt;math&gt;(2P-H)^2-2(H-P)^2=-\left(H^2-2P^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The smaller solution also has positive integers, with the one exception: {{nowrap|1=''H'' = ''P'' = 1}} which comes from ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===  Square triangular numbers ===
{{main|Square triangular number}}
The required equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t(t+1)}{2}=s^2\, &lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to:&lt;math&gt;4t^2+4t+1=8s^2+1,&lt;/math&gt;
which becomes {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} with the substitutions ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''s''. Hence the ''n''th solution is
:&lt;math&gt;t_n=\frac{H_{2n}-1}{2} \quad \mbox{and} \quad s_n=\frac{P_{2n}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that ''t'' and ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are relatively prime, so that {{sfrac|''t''(''t'' + 1)|2}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; happens exactly when they are adjacent integers, one a square ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the other twice a square 2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since we know all solutions of that equation, we also have

:&lt;math&gt;t_n=\begin{cases}2P_n^2&amp;\mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even};\\H_{n}^2&amp;\mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;s_n=H_nP_n.&lt;/math&gt;

This alternate expression is seen in the next table.

===Pythagorean triples ===

The equality {{nowrap|1=''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''a'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''a'' + 1}} occurs exactly when {{nowrap|1=2''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''a'' + 2}} which becomes {{nowrap|1=2''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} with the substitutions {{nowrap|1=''H'' = 2''a'' + 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''c''}}. Hence the ''n''th solution is {{nowrap|1=''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = {{sfrac|''H''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1|2}}}} and {{nowrap|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The table above shows that, in one order or the other, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and {{nowrap|1=''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 1}} are {{nowrap|1=''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=2''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} while {{nowrap|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8825">'''Petkovšek's algorithm''' (also '''Hyper''') is a [[computer algebra]] algorithm that computes a basis of [[Hypergeometric identity|hypergeometric terms]] solution of its input [[P-recursive equation|linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients]]. Equivalently, it computes a first order right factor of linear [[difference operator]]s with polynomial coefficients. This algorithm was developed by [[Marko Petkovšek]] in his PhD-thesis 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petkovšek|first=Marko|date=1992|title=Hypergeometric solutions of linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0747717192900386|journal=Journal of Symbolic Computation|volume=14|issue=2-3|pages=243–264|doi=10.1016/0747-7171(92)90038-6|issn=0747-7171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm is implemented in all the major computer algebra systems.

== Gosper-Petkovšek representation ==
Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero. A nonzero sequence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n)&lt;/math&gt; is called hypergeometric if the ratio of two consecutive terms is [[Rational function|rational]], i.e. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n+1) /y(n) \in \mathbb{K}(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The Petkovšek algorithm uses as key concept that this rational function has a specific representation, namely the ''Gosper-Petkovšek normal form''. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(n) \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; be a nonzero rational function. Then there exist monic [[Ring of polynomial functions|polynomials]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a, b, c \in \mathbb{K} [n]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0 \neq z \in \mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;r(n) = z \frac{a(n)}{b(n)} \frac{c(n+1)}{c(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

and

#&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\gcd (a(n), b(n+k)) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for every nonnegative integer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k \in \N&lt;/math&gt;,
#&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\gcd (a(n), c(n))=1&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\gcd ( b(n), c(n+1))=1&lt;/math&gt;.

This representation of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(n)&lt;/math&gt; is called Gosper-Petkovšek normal form. These polynomials can be computed explicitly. This construction of the representation is an essential part of [[Gosper's algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gosper |first=R. William |date=1978 |title=Decision procedure for indefinite hypergeometric summation |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c66e/0beca13f866f748971d18bd39ebdc2b88751.pdf |journal=[[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA]] |volume=75 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petkovšek added the conditions 2. and 3. of this representation which makes this normal form unique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Algorithm ==
Using the Gosper-Petkovšek representation one can transform the original recurrence equation into a recurrence equation for a polynomial sequence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The other polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a(n),b(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be taken as the monic factors of the first coefficient polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_0 (n)&lt;/math&gt; resp. the last coefficient polynomial shifted &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_r(n-r+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; has to fulfill a certain [[algebraic equation]]. Taking all the possible finitely many triples &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(a(n), b(n), z)&lt;/math&gt; and computing the corresponding [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|polynomial solution]] of the transformed recurrence equation &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt; gives a hypergeometric solution if one exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html|title=A=B|last=Petkovšek|first=Marko|last2=Wilf|first2=Herbert S.|last3=Zeilberger|first3=Doron|date=1996|publisher=A K Peters|others=|year=|isbn=1568810636|location=|pages=|oclc=33898705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701369215|title=The concrete tetrahedron : symbolic sums, recurrence equations, generating functions, asymptotic estimates|last=Kauers|first=Manuel|last2=Paule|first2=Peter|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=|year=|isbn=9783709104453|location=Wien|pages=|oclc=701369215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one does not end if a solution is found it is possible to combine all hypergeometric solutions to get a general hypergeometric solution of the recurrence equation, i.e. a generating set for the kernel of the recurrence equation in the linear span of hypergeometric sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Petkovšek also showed how the inhomogeneous problem can be solved. He considered the case where the right-hand side of the recurrence equation is a sum of hypergeometric sequences. After grouping together certain hypergeometric sequences of the right-hand side, for each of those groups a certain recurrence equation is solved for a rational solution. These rational solutions can be combined to get a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. Together with the general solution of the homogeneous problem this gives the general solution of the inhomogeneous problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Signed permutation matrices ===
The number of [[Generalized permutation matrix|signed permutation matrices]] of size &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; can be described by the sequence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n)&lt;/math&gt; which is determined by the recurrence equation&lt;math display="block"&gt;4 (n+1)^2 \, y(n) + 2 \, y(n+1) + (-1) \, y(n+2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a(n) = n+1,b(n)=1&lt;/math&gt; as monic divisors of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_0 (n) = 4(n+1)^2, p_2(n) = -1&lt;/math&gt; respectively, one gets &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z = \pm 2&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z=2&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding recurrence equation which is solved in Petkovšek's algorithm is&lt;math display="block"&gt;4(n+1)^2 \, c(n) + 4(n+1)\, c(n+1) - 4(n+1)(n+2) \, c(n+2) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;This recurrence equation has the polynomial solution &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c(n) = c_0 &lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c_0 \in \Q&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(n)=2 (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n) = 2^n \, n!&lt;/math&gt; is a hypergeometric solution. In fact it is (up to a constant) the only hypergeometric solution and describes the number of signed permutation matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000165|title=A000165 - OEIS|website=oeis.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irrationality of &lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt; ===
Given the sum

: &lt;math&gt;a(n)=\sum_{k=0}^n{\binom{n}{k}^2\binom{n+k}{k}^2},&lt;/math&gt;

coming from [[Roger Apéry|Apéry]]'s proof of the irrationality of &lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt;, [[Doron Zeilberger|Zeilberger]]'s algorithm computes the linear recurrence

: &lt;math&gt;(n+2)^3 \, a(n+2)-(17n^2+51n+39)(2n+3) \, a(n+1)+(n+1)^3 \, a(n)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this recurrence, the algorithm does not return any hypergeometric solution, which proves that &lt;math&gt;a(n)&lt;/math&gt; does not simplify to a [[Hypergeometric identity|hypergeometric term]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">In [[mathematics]], '''Plateau's problem''' is to show the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, a problem raised by  [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760.  However, it is named after [[Joseph Plateau]] who experimented with [[soap film]]s.  The problem is considered part of the [[calculus of variations]].  The existence and regularity problems are part of [[geometric measure theory]].

==History==
Various specialized forms of the problem were solved, but it was only in 1930 that general solutions were found in the context of mappings (immersions) independently by [[Jesse Douglas]] and [[Tibor Radó]].  Their methods were quite different; Radó's work built on the previous work of René Garnier and held only for [[rectifiable curve|rectifiable]] simple closed curves, whereas Douglas used completely new ideas with his result holding for an arbitrary simple closed curve.  Both relied on setting up minimization problems; Douglas minimized the now-named Douglas integral while Radó minimized the "energy".  Douglas went on to be awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1936 for his efforts.

==In higher dimensions==
The extension of the problem to higher [[dimension]]s (that is, for ''k''-dimensional surfaces in ''n''-dimensional space) turns out to be much more difficult to study. Moreover, while the solutions to the original problem are always regular, it turns out that the solutions to the extended problem may have [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] if ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2. In the [[hypersurface]] case where ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, singularities occur only for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;8.

To solve the extended problem in special cases, the [[Caccioppoli set#De Giorgi definition|theory of perimeters]] ([[Ennio de Giorgi|De Giorgi]]) for codimension 1 and the theory of [[rectifiable current]]s ([[Herbert Federer|Federer]] and Fleming) for higher codimension have been developed. Multidimensional Plateau problem in the class of spectral  surfaces (parametrized by the spectra of the manifolds with a fixed boundary) was solved in 1969 by [[Anatoly Fomenko]].

==Physical applications==
Physical soap films are more accurately modeled by the (M,0,delta)-minimal sets of [[Frederick Almgren]], but the lack of a compactness theorem makes it difficult to prove the existence of an area minimizer. In this context, a persistent open question has been the existence of a least-area soap film. [[Ernst Robert Reifenberg]] solved such a "universal Plateau's problem" for boundaries which are homeomorphic to single embedded spheres. In his book Almgren claimed to use [[varifold]]s to solve the problem for more than one sphere, as well as more general boundaries, but Allard's compactness theorem for integral varifolds produces a minimal surface, not necessarily an area minimizer. In 2015 [[Jenny Harrison]] and [[Harrison Pugh]] used cohomology to define spanning sets and Hausdorff measure weighted by a bounded Lipschitz function to define area, and solved the problem in this setting. Their paper is currently under review.

A '''polygraphic substitution''' is a cipher in which a uniform substitution is performed on blocks of letters.  When the length of the block is specifically known, more precise terms are used: for instance, a cipher in which pairs of letters are substituted is '''bigraphic'''.

As a concept, polygraphic substitution contrasts with '''monoalphabetic''' (or simple) substitutions in which individual letters are uniformly substituted, or [[polyalphabetic substitution]]s in which individual letters are substituted in different ways depending on their position in the text.  In theory, there is some overlap in these definitions; one could conceivably consider a [[Vigenère cipher]] with an eight-letter key to be an octographic substitution.  In practice, this is not a useful observation since it is far more fruitful to consider it to be a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.

==Specific ciphers==
In 1563, [[Giambattista della Porta]] devised the first bigraphic substitution.  However, it was nothing more than a matrix of symbols.  In practice, it would have been all but impossible to memorize, and carrying around the table would lead to risks of falling into enemy hands.

In 1854, [[Charles Wheatstone]] came up with the [[Playfair cipher]], a keyword-based system that could be performed on paper in the field.  This was followed up over the next fifty years with the closely related [[Four-square cipher|four-square]] and [[Two-square cipher|two-square]] ciphers, which are slightly more cumbersome but offer slightly better security.

In 1929, [[Lester S. Hill]] developed the [[Hill cipher]], which uses matrix algebra to encrypt blocks of any desired length.  However, encryption is very difficult to perform by hand for any sufficiently large block size, although it has been implemented by machine or computer.   This is therefore on the frontier between classical and modern cryptography.

==Cryptanalysis of general polygraphic substitutions==
Polygraphic systems do provide a significant improvement in security over monoalphabetic substitutions.  Given an individual letter 'E' in a message, it could be encrypted using any of 52 instructions depending on its location and neighbors, which can be used to great advantage to mask the frequency of individual letters.  However, the security boost is limited; while it generally requires a larger sample of text to crack, it can still be done by hand.

One can identify a polygraphically-encrypted text by performing a frequency chart of polygrams and not merely of individual letters.  These can be compared to the frequency of plaintext English.  The distribution of digrams is even more stark than individual letters.  For example, the six most common letters in English (23%) represent approximately half of English plaintext, but it takes only the most frequent 8% of the 676 digrams to achieve the same potency.  In addition, even in a plaintext many thousands of characters long, one would expect that nearly half of the digrams would not occur, or only barely.  In addition, looking over the text one would expect to see a fairly regular scattering of repeated text in multiples of the block length and relatively few that are not multiples.  

Cracking a code identified as polygraphic is similar to cracking a general monoalphabetic substitution except with a larger 'alphabet'.  One identifies the most frequent polygrams, experiments with replacing them with common plaintext polygrams, and attempts to build up common words, phrases, and finally meaning.  Naturally, if the investigation led the cryptanalyst to suspect that a code was of a specific type, like a Playfair or order-2 Hill cipher, then they could use a more specific attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">In [[statistics]], and particularly in [[econometrics]], the '''reduced form''' of a system of equations is the result of solving the system for the endogenous variables. This gives the latter as functions of the [[exogenous]] variables, if any.  In econometrics, the equations of a [[structural model (econometrics)|structural form]] model are [[estimation theory|estimated]] in their theoretically given form, while an alternative approach to estimation is to first solve the theoretical equations for the endogenous variables to obtain reduced form equations, and then to estimate the reduced form equations.

Let ''Y'' be the vector of the variables to be explained (endogeneous variables) by a [[statistical model]] and ''X'' be the vector of explanatory (exogeneous) variables. In addition let &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; be a vector of error terms. Then the general expression of a '''structural form''' is &lt;math&gt; f(Y, X, \varepsilon) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' is a function, possibly from vectors to vectors in the case of a multiple-equation model. The '''reduced form''' of this model is given by &lt;math&gt; Y = g(X, \varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt;, with ''g'' a function.

==Structural and reduced forms==
Exogenous variables are variables which are not determined by the system. If we assume that demand is influenced not only by price, but also by an exogenous variable, ''Z'',  we can consider the structural [[supply and demand]] model

: '''supply:''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; Q = a_S +   b_S P + u_S, &lt;/math&gt;

: '''demand:''' &amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt; Q = a_D +  b_D P  + c Z + u_D, &lt;/math&gt;

where the terms &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; are random errors (deviations of the quantities supplied and demanded from those implied by the rest of each equation). By solving for the unknowns (endogenous variables) ''P'' and ''Q'', this structural model can be rewritten in the reduced form:

: &lt;math&gt; Q = \pi_{10} + \pi_{11} Z + e_Q, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P = \pi_{20} + \pi_{21} Z + e_P, &lt;/math&gt;

where the parameters &lt;math&gt;\pi_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depend on the parameters &lt;math&gt;a_i , b_i, c&lt;/math&gt; of the structural model, and where the reduced form errors &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; each depend on the structural parameters and on both structural errors. Note that both endogenous variables depend on the exogenous variable ''Z''.

If the reduced form model is estimated using empirical data, obtaining estimated values for the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\pi_{ij},&lt;/math&gt; some of the structural parameters can be recovered: By combining the two reduced form equations to eliminate ''Z'', the structural coefficients of the supply side model (&lt;math&gt;a_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_S&lt;/math&gt;) can be derived:

: &lt;math&gt; a_S = (\pi_{10}\pi_{21} - \pi_{11}\pi_{20}) / \pi_{21} ,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b_S = \pi_{11} / \pi_{21} .&lt;/math&gt;

Note however, that this still does not allow us to identify the structural parameters of the demand equation. For that, we would need an exogenous variable which is included in the supply equation of the structural model, but not in the demand equation.

==The general linear case==
Let ''y'' be a [[column vector]] of ''M'' endogenous variables. In the case above with ''Q'' and ''P'', we had ''M'' = 2. Let ''z'' be a column vector of ''K''  exogenous variables; in the case above ''z'' consisted only of ''Z''. The structural linear model is

: &lt;math&gt; A y = B z + v, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of structural shocks, and  ''A'' and ''B'' are [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]];  ''A'' is a square ''M'' &amp;nbsp;× ''M'' matrix, while ''B'' is ''M'' × ''K''. The reduced form of the system is:

: &lt;math&gt;  y = A^{-1}Bz+ A^{-1}v = \Pi z + w, &lt;/math&gt;

with vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; of reduced form errors that each depends on all structural errors, where the matrix ''A'' must be [[nonsingular]] for the reduced form to exist and be unique. Again, each endogenous variable depends on potentially each exogenous variable.

Without restrictions on the ''A'' and ''B'', the coefficients of ''A'' and ''B'' cannot be identified from data on ''y'' and ''z'': each row of the structural model is just a linear relation between ''y'' and ''z'' with unknown coefficients. (This is again the [[parameter identification problem]].) The ''M'' reduced form equations (the rows of the matrix equation ''y'' = Π ''z'' above) can be identified from the data because each of them contains only one endogenous variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">In [[mathematics]], in particular in the field of the [[group representation|representation theory of groups]], a '''representative function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' on a [[compact group|compact topological group]] ''G'' obtained by [[Function composition|composing]] a representation of ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' with a [[linear map]] from the [[endomorphism]]s of ''V'' into ''V'' 's underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]].  Representative functions arise naturally from finite-dimensional representations of ''G'' as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]-entry functions of the corresponding matrix representations.

It follows from the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]] that the representative functions on ''G'' are dense in the [[Hilbert space]] of square-integrable functions on ''G''.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Riemann–Liouville integral''' associates with a real [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' another function ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' of the same kind for each value of the parameter α&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  The integral is a manner of generalization of the repeated [[antiderivative]] of ''&amp;fnof;'' in the sense that for positive integer values of α, ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' is an iterated antiderivative of ''&amp;fnof;'' of order α.  The Riemann–Liouville integral is named for [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Joseph Liouville]], the latter of whom was the first to consider the possibility of [[fractional calculus]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="Lizorkin"&gt;{{harvnb|Lizorkin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operator agrees with the '''[[Euler transform]]''', after [[Leonhard Euler]], when applied to [[analytic function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brychkov|Prudnikov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was generalized to arbitrary dimensions by [[Marcel Riesz]], who introduced the [[Riesz potential]].

==Definition==
The Riemann–Liouville integral is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;I^\alpha f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_a^xf(t)(x-t)^{\alpha-1}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
where Γ is the [[Gamma function]] and ''a'' is an arbitrary but fixed base point.  The integral is well-defined provided ''&amp;fnof;'' is a [[locally integrable function]], and α is a [[complex number]] in the [[half-plane]] re(α)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  The dependence on the base-point ''a'' is often suppressed, and represents a freedom in [[constant of integration]]. Clearly ''I''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ƒ is an antiderivative of ƒ (of first order), and for positive integer values of α, ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;ƒ is an antiderivative of order α by [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]].  Another notation, which emphasizes the basepoint, is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|Ross|1993|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{}_aD_x^{-\alpha}f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_a^x f(t)(x-t)^{\alpha-1}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This also makes sense if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;∞, with suitable restrictions on ''&amp;fnof;''.

The fundamental relations hold
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}I^{\alpha+1} f(x) =  I^\alpha f(x),\quad I^\alpha(I^\beta f) = I^{\alpha+\beta}f,&lt;/math&gt;
the latter of which is a [[semigroup]] property.&lt;ref name="Lizorkin" /&gt;  These properties make possible not only the definition of fractional integration, but also of fractional differentiation, by taking enough derivatives of ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;''.

==Properties==
Fix a bounded interval (''a'',''b'').  The operator ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; associates to each [[integrable function]] ''&amp;fnof;'' on (''a'',''b'') the function ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' on (''a'',''b'') which is also integrable by [[Fubini's theorem]].  Thus ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; defines a [[linear operator]] on [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'',''b'')]]:
:&lt;math&gt;I^\alpha : L^1(a,b) \to L^1(a,b).&lt;/math&gt;
Fubini's theorem also shows that this operator is [[continuous linear operator|continuous]] with respect to the [[Banach space]] structure on L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and that the following inequality holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\|I^\alpha f\|_1 \le \frac{|b-a|^{\operatorname{re}(\alpha)}}{\operatorname{re}(\alpha)|\Gamma(\alpha)|}\|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'',''b'').

More generally, by [[Hölder's inequality]], it follows that if ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'',''b''), then ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'',''b'') as well, and the analogous inequality holds

:&lt;math&gt;\|I^\alpha f\|_p \le \frac{|b-a|^{\operatorname{re}(\alpha)/p}}{\operatorname{re}(\alpha)|\Gamma(\alpha)|}\|f\|_p&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] on the interval (''a'',''b''). Thus ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; defines a bounded linear operator from ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'',''b'') to itself.  Furthermore, ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' tends to ''&amp;fnof;'' in the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; sense as α&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0 along the real axis.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;\underset{\alpha &gt; 0}{\lim_{\alpha\to 0}} \|I^\alpha f-f\|_p = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''p''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.  Moreover, by estimating the [[maximal function]] of ''I'', one can show that the limit ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;'' holds pointwise [[almost everywhere]].

The operator ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is well-defined on the set of locally integrable function on the whole real line '''R'''.  It defines a bounded transformation on any of the [[Banach space]]s of functions of [[exponential type]]  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''e''&lt;sup&gt;−σ|''t''|&lt;/sup&gt;d''t''), consisting of locally integrable functions for which the norm
:&lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(t)|e^{-\sigma|t|}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. For ƒ in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Laplace transform]] of ''I&lt;sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;fnof;'' takes the particularly simple form
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}I^\alpha f)(s) = s^{-\alpha}F(s)&lt;/math&gt;
for re(''s'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;σ.  Here ''F''(''s'') denotes the Laplace transform of ''&amp;fnof;'', and this property expresses that ''I''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Fourier multiplier]].

==Fractional derivatives==
One can define fractional-order derivatives of ''&amp;fnof;'' as well by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha} f \overset{def}{=} \frac{d^{\lceil\alpha\rceil}}{dx^{\lceil\alpha\rceil}} I^{\lceil\alpha\rceil-\alpha}f&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lceil\cdot\rceil&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[ceiling function]].  One also obtains a [[differintegral]] interpolating between differentiation and integration by defining
:&lt;math&gt;D^\alpha_x f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{d^{\lceil\alpha\rceil}}{dx^{\lceil\alpha\rceil}} I^{\lceil\alpha\rceil-\alpha}f(x)&amp; \alpha&gt;0\\
f(x) &amp; \alpha=0\\
I^{-\alpha}f(x) &amp; \alpha&lt;0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative fractional derivative was introduced by Caputo in 1967, and produces a derivative that has different properties: it produces zero from constant functions and, more importantly, the initial value terms of the [[Laplace Transform]] are expressed by means of the  values of that function and of its derivative of integer order rather than the derivatives of fractional order as in the Riemann–Liouville derivative.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051029113800/http://www.nd.edu/~msen/Teaching/UnderRes/FracCalc.pdf]  The Caputo fractional derivative with base point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, is then:

:&lt;math&gt;D_x^{\alpha}f(y)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\int_x^y f'(y-u)(u-x)^{-\alpha}du.&lt;/math&gt;

Another representation is:

:&lt;math&gt;{}_a\tilde{D}^\alpha_x f(x)=I^{\lceil \alpha\rceil-\alpha}\left(\frac{d^{\lceil \alpha\rceil}f}{dx^{\lceil \alpha\rceil}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A '''serpentine curve''' is a curve whose equation is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x^2y+a^2y-abx=0, \quad ab &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, it has a parametric representation 
:&lt;math&gt;x=a\cot(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=b\sin (t)\cos(t),&lt;/math&gt;

or functional representation
:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{abx}{x^2+a^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Serpentine curves were studied by [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|L'Hôpital]] and [[Christiaan_Huygens|Huygens]], and named and classified by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

In [[combinatorial game theory]], the '''Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem''' states that every [[impartial game]] under the [[normal play convention]] is equivalent to a '''[[nimber]]'''.  The '''Grundy value''' or '''nim-value''' of an impartial game is then defined as the unique nimber that the game is equivalent to.  In the case of a game whose positions (or summands of positions) are indexed by the natural numbers (for example the possible heap sizes in nim-like games), the sequence of nimbers for successive heap sizes is called the '''nim-sequence''' of the game.

The theorem and its proof encapsulate the main results of a theory discovered independently by [[Roland Sprague|R. P. Sprague]] (1935)&lt;ref name = "SpraguePaper"&gt;{{cite journal

==Definitions==
For the purposes of the Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem, a '''''game''''' is a two-player [[sequential game]] of [[perfect information]] satisfying the ''ending condition'' (all games come to an end: there are no infinite lines of play) and the ''normal play condition'' (a player who cannot move loses).

At any given point in the game, a player's '''''position''''' is the set of '''''moves''''' he or she is allowed to make.  As an example, we can define the ''zero game'' to be the two-player game where neither player has any legal moves.  Referring to the two players as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (for Alice) and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (for Bob), we would denote their positions as &lt;math&gt;(A, B) = (\{\}, \{\})&lt;/math&gt;, since the set of moves each player can make is empty.

An '''''[[impartial game]]''''' is one in which at any given point in the game, each player is allowed exactly the same set of moves. Normal-play [[nim]] is an example of an impartial game. In nim, there are one or more heaps of objects, and two players (we'll call them Alice and Bob), take turns choosing a heap and removing 1 or more objects from it. The winner is the player who removes the final object from the final heap.  The game is '''''impartial''''' because for any given configuration of pile sizes, the moves Alice can make on her turn are exactly the same moves Bob would be allowed to make if it were his turn.  In contrast, a game such as [[checkers]] is not impartial because, supposing Alice were playing red and Bob were playing black, for any given arrangement of pieces on the board, if it were Alice's turn, she would only be allowed to move the red pieces, and if it were Bob's turn, he would only be allowed to move the black pieces.

Note that any configuration of an impartial game can therefore be written as a single position, because the moves will be the same no matter whose turn it is. For example, the position of the ''zero game'' can simply be written &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, because if it's Alice's turn, she has no moves to make, and if it's Bob's turn, he has no moves to make either.

Furthermore, note that we can associate a move with the position it leaves the next player in. 
Doing so lets us define positions recursively.  For example, consider the following game of Nim played by Alice and Bob.

===={{anchor|firstExample}}Example Nim Game====
{{Pre|
 Sizes of heaps  Moves
 A B C
 &amp;nbsp;
 1 2 2           Alice takes 1 from A
 0 2 2           Bob   takes 1 from B 
 0 1 2           Alice takes 1 from C 
 0 1 1           Bob   takes 1 from B 
 0 0 1           Alice takes 1 from C
 0 0 0           Bob   has no moves, so Alice wins
}}

* At step 6 of the game (when all of the heaps are empty) the position is &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, because Bob has no valid moves to make.  We name this position &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;. 
* At step 5, Alice had exactly one option: to remove one object from heap C, leaving Bob with no moves.  Since her ''move'' leaves Bob in position &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;, her ''position'' is written &lt;math&gt;\{ *0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  We name this position &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.
* At step 4, Bob had two options: remove one from B or remove one from C.  Note, however, that it didn't really matter which heap Bob removed the object from: Either way, Alice would be left with exactly one object in exactly one pile. So, using our recursive definition, Bob really only has one move: &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus, Bob's position is &lt;math&gt;\{*1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* At step 3, Alice had 3 options: remove two from C, remove one from C, or remove one from B.  Removing two from C leaves Bob in position &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;.  Removing one from C leaves Bob with two piles, each of size one, i.e., position &lt;math&gt;\{*1\}&lt;/math&gt;, as described in step 4. However, removing 1 from B would leave Bob with two objects in a single pile. ''His'' moves would then be &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\{*1\}&lt;/math&gt;, so ''her'' move would result in the position &lt;math&gt;\{*1, \{*1\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We call this position &lt;math&gt;*2&lt;/math&gt;.  Alice's position is then the set of all her moves: &lt;math&gt;\big\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\big\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Following the same recursive logic, at step 2, Bob's position is &lt;math&gt;\big\{ \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}, *2\big\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Finally, at step 1, Alice's position is 
&lt;math&gt;\Big\{
    \big\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\big\},
    \big\{*2, \{*1, \{*1\},*2\} \big\},
    \big\{\{*1\}, \{\{*1\}\}, \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}\big\}
\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Nimbers===
The special names &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;*2&lt;/math&gt; referenced in our example game are called '''''[[nimber]]s'''''.  In general, the nimber &lt;math&gt;*n&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the position in a game of nim where there are exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; objects in exactly one heap.  
Formally, nimbers are defined inductively as follows:  &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*1 = \{*0\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*2 = \{*0, *1\}&lt;/math&gt; and  for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;*(n+1) = *n \cup \{*n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

While the word ''nim''ber comes from the game ''nim'', nimbers can be used to describe the positions of any finite, impartial game, and in fact, the Sprague&amp;ndash;Grundy theorem states that every  instance of a finite, impartial game can be associated with a ''single'' nimber.

===Combining Games===
Two games can be combined by '''''adding''''' their positions together.
For example, consider another game of nim with heaps &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;.

===={{anchor|secondExample}}Example Game 2====
{{Pre|
Sizes of heaps    Moves
&amp;nbsp;
A' B' C'
1  1  1           Alice takes 1 from A'
0  1  1           Bob takes one from B'
0  0  1           Alice takes one from C'
0  0  0           Bob has no moves, so Alice wins.
}}

We can combine it with our [[#firstExample|first example]] to get a combined game with six heaps: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;:

===={{anchor|thirdExample}}Combined Game====
{{Pre|
 Sizes of heaps     Moves
 A  B  C  A' B' C'  
 &amp;nbsp;
 1  2  2  1  1  1   Alice takes 1 from A
 0  2  2  1  1  1   Bob takes 1 from A'
 0  2  2  0  1  1   Alice takes 1 from B'
 0  2  2  0  0  1   Bob takes 1 from C'
 0  2  2  0  0  0   Alice takes 2 from B
 0  0  2  0  0  0   Bob takes 2 from C
 0  0  0  0  0  0   Alice has no moves, so Bob wins.
}}

To differentiate between the two games, for the [[#firstExample|first example game]], we'll label its starting position &lt;math&gt;\color{blue}S&lt;/math&gt;, and color it blue:

&lt;math&gt;\color{blue}S = \Big\{
    \big\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\big\},
    \big\{*2, \{*1, \{*1\},*2\} \big\},
    \big\{\{*1\}, \{\{*1\}\}, \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}\big\}
\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the [[#secondExample|second example game]], we'll label the starting position &lt;math&gt;\color{red}S'&lt;/math&gt; and color it red:

&lt;math&gt;
\color{red}S' = \Big\{\{*1\}\Big\}
&lt;/math&gt;.

To compute the starting position of the [[#thirdExample|combined game]], remember that a player can either make a move in the first game, leaving the second game untouched, or make a move in the second game, leaving the first game untouched.  So the combined game's starting position is:

&lt;math&gt;
\color{blue}S \color{black} + \color{red}S' \color{black}= 
\Big\{
  \big\{
    \color{blue}S\color{black}, \color{red} \{*1\} \color{black}
  \big\} \Big\} \cup \Big\{
  \big\{
     \color{red}S'\color{black}, \color{blue}\{*1, \{*1\}, *2\} \color{black}
  \big\}, 
  \big\{
     \color{red}S'\color{black}, \color{blue} \{*2, \{*1, \{*1\},*2\} \} \color{black}
  \big\},
  \big\{
     \color{red}S'\color{black}, \color{blue} \{\{*1\}, \{\{*1\}\}, \{*1, \{*1\}, *2\}\} \color{black}
  \big\}
\Big\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The explicit formula for adding positions is: &lt;math&gt;S+S'=\{S+s'\mid s'\in S'\}\cup\{s+S'\mid s\in S\}&lt;/math&gt;, which means that addition is both commutative and associative.

===Equivalence=== 
Positions in impartial games fall into two '''''outcome classes''''': either the next player (the one whose turn it is) wins (an &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathcal{N}}&lt;/math&gt;'''''- position'''''), or the previous player wins (a &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;'''''- position''''').  So, for example, &lt;math&gt;*0&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position, while &lt;math&gt;*1&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;-position.

Two positions &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; are '''''equivalent''''' if, no matter what position &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is added to them, they are always in the same outcome class.  
Formally,
&lt;math&gt;G \approx G' &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall H &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G + H&lt;/math&gt; is in the same outcome class as &lt;math&gt;G' + H&lt;/math&gt;.

To use our running examples, notice that in both the [[#firstExample|first]] and [[#secondExample|second]] games above, we can show that on every turn, Alice has a move that forces Bob into a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position. Thus, both &lt;math&gt;\color{blue}S&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\color{red}S'&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;-positions.  (Notice that in the combined game, ''Bob'' is the player with the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;-positions. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\color{blue}S \color{black} + \color{red}S' &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position, which as we will see in Lemma 2, means &lt;math&gt; \color{blue} S \color{black} \approx \color{red} S'&lt;/math&gt;.)

==First Lemma==
As an intermediate step to proving the main theorem, we show that for every position &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the equivalence &lt;math&gt;G\approx A+G&lt;/math&gt; holds.  By the above definition of equivalence, this amounts to showing that &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+G+H&lt;/math&gt; share an outcome class for all &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position.  Then the previous player has a winning strategy for &lt;math&gt;A+G+H&lt;/math&gt;: respond to moves in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; according to their winning strategy for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (which exists by virtue of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; being a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position), and respond to moves in &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; according to their winning strategy for &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; (which exists for analogous reason).  So &lt;math&gt;A+G+H&lt;/math&gt; must also be a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position.

On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; is an N-position, then the next player has a winning strategy: choose a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position from among the &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; options, putting their opponent in the case above.  Thus, in this case, &lt;math&gt;A+G+H&lt;/math&gt; must be a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;-position, just like &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt;.

As these are the only two cases, the lemma holds.

==Second Lemma==
As a further step, we show that &lt;math&gt;G\approx G'&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;G+G'&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position.

In the forward direction, suppose that &lt;math&gt;G\approx G'&lt;/math&gt;.  Applying the definition of equivalence with &lt;math&gt;H=G&lt;/math&gt;, we find that &lt;math&gt;G'+G&lt;/math&gt; (which is equal to &lt;math&gt;G+G'&lt;/math&gt; by [[commutativity]] of addition) is in the same outcome class as &lt;math&gt;G+G&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;G+G&lt;/math&gt; must be a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position: for every move made in one copy of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the previous player can respond with the same move in the other copy, and so always make the last move.

In the reverse direction, since &lt;math&gt;A=G+G'&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position by hypothesis, it follows from the first lemma, &lt;math&gt;G\approx G+A&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;G\approx G+(G+G')&lt;/math&gt;.   Similarly, since &lt;math&gt;B=G+G&lt;/math&gt; is also a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position, it follows from the first lemma in the form  &lt;math&gt;G'\approx G'+B&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;G'\approx G'+(G+G)&lt;/math&gt;.  By [[associativity]] and commutativity, the right-hand sides of these results are equal.  Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]] because equality is an equivalence relation on outcome classes.  Via the [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] of &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt;, we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;G\approx G'&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==
We prove that all positions are equivalent to a nimber by [[structural induction]].  The more specific result, that the given game's initial position must be equivalent to a nimber, shows that the game is itself equivalent to a nimber.

Consider a position &lt;math&gt;G = \{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_k\}&lt;/math&gt;. By the induction hypothesis, all of the options are equivalent to nimbers, say &lt;math&gt;G_i \approx *n_i&lt;/math&gt;. So let &lt;math&gt;G'=\{*n_1, *n_2, \ldots, *n_k\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We will show that &lt;math&gt;G \approx *m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mex (mathematics)|mex (minimum exclusion)]] of the numbers &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the smallest non-negative integer not equal to some &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The first thing we need to note is that &lt;math&gt;G \approx G'&lt;/math&gt;, by way of the second lemma. If &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is zero, the claim is trivially true.  Otherwise, consider &lt;math&gt;G+G'&lt;/math&gt;. If the next player makes a move to &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then the previous player can move to &lt;math&gt;*n_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt;, and conversely if the next player makes a move in &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt;. After this, the position is a P-position by the lemma's forward implication. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;G+G'&lt;/math&gt; is a P-position, and, citing the lemma's reverse implication, &lt;math&gt;G \approx G'&lt;/math&gt;.

Now let us show that &lt;math&gt;G'+*m&lt;/math&gt; is a P-position, which, using the second lemma once again, means that &lt;math&gt;G'\approx *m&lt;/math&gt;. We do so by giving an explicit strategy for the previous player.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*m&lt;/math&gt; are empty.  Then &lt;math&gt;G'+*m&lt;/math&gt; is the null set, clearly a P-position.

Or consider the case that the next player moves in the component &lt;math&gt;*m&lt;/math&gt; to the option &lt;math&gt;*m'&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m'&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; was the ''minimum'' excluded number, the previous player can move in &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;*m'&lt;/math&gt;.  And, as shown before, any position plus itself is a P-position.

Finally, suppose instead that the next player moves in the component &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to the option &lt;math&gt;*n_i&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;n_i &lt; m&lt;/math&gt; then the previous player moves in &lt;math&gt;*m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;*n_i&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, if &lt;math&gt;n_i &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, the previous player moves in &lt;math&gt;*n_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;*m&lt;/math&gt;; in either case the result is a position plus itself. (It is not possible that &lt;math&gt;n_i = m&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; was defined to be different from all the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;.)

In summary, we have &lt;math&gt;G\approx G'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'\approx *m&lt;/math&gt;.  By transitivity, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;G \approx *m&lt;/math&gt;, as desired.

==Development==
If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a position of an impartial game, the unique integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G \approx *m&lt;/math&gt; is called its Grundy value, or Grundy number, and the function which assigns this value to each such position is called the Sprague–Grundy function.  R.L.Sprague and P.M.Grundy independently gave an explicit definition of this function, not based on any concept of equivalence to nim positions, and showed that it had the following properties:
*The Grundy value of a single nim pile of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. of the position &lt;math&gt;*m&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;;
* A position is a loss for the next player to move (i.e. a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;-position) if and only if its Grundy value is zero; and
*The Grundy value of the sum of a finite set of positions is just the [[nim-sum]] of the Grundy values of its summands.
It follows straightforwardly from these results that if a position &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a Grundy value of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G + H&lt;/math&gt; has the same Grundy value as  &lt;math&gt;*m + H&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore belongs to the same outcome class, for any position &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus, although Sprague and Grundy never explicitly stated the theorem described in this article, it follows directly from their results and is credited to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In mathematics, '''Tait's conjecture''' states that "Every [[K-vertex-connected graph|3-connected]] [[Planar graph|planar]] [[cubic graph]] has a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] (along the edges) through all its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]". It was proposed by {{harvs|first=P. G.|last=Tait|authorlink=P. G. Tait|year=1884|txt}} and disproved by {{harvs|first=W. T.|last=Tutte|authorlink=W. T. Tutte|year=1946|txt}}, who constructed a counterexample with 25 faces, 69 edges and 46 vertices. Several smaller counterexamples, with 21 faces, 57 edges and 38 vertices, were later proved minimal by {{harvtxt|Holton|McKay|1988}}.
The condition that the graph be 3-regular is necessary due to polyhedra such as the [[rhombic dodecahedron]], which forms a [[bipartite graph]] with six degree-four vertices on one side and eight degree-three vertices on the other side; because any Hamiltonian cycle would have to alternate between the two sides of the bipartition, but they have unequal numbers of vertices, the rhombic dodecahedron is not Hamiltonian.

The conjecture was significant, because if true, it would have implied the [[four color theorem]]: as Tait described, the four-color problem is equivalent to the problem of finding [[edge coloring|3-edge-colorings]] of [[bridgeless graph|bridgeless]] cubic planar graphs. In a Hamiltonian cubic planar graph, such an edge coloring is easy to find: use two colors alternately on the cycle, and a third color for all remaining edges. Alternatively, a 4-coloring of the faces of a Hamiltonian cubic planar graph may be constructed directly, using two colors for the faces inside the cycle and two more colors for the faces outside.

==Tutte's counterexample==
[[Image:TutteFrag.png|right]]

===Tutte's fragment===
The key to this counter-example is what is now known as '''Tutte's fragment''', shown on the right.

If this fragment is part of a larger graph, then any Hamiltonian cycle through the graph must go in or out of the top vertex (and either one of the lower ones). It cannot go in one lower vertex and out the other.

===The counterexample===
[[Image:PlanarNonHamil.png|right]]

The fragment can then be used to construct the non-Hamiltonian '''[[Tutte graph]]''', by putting
together three such fragments as shown on the picture. The "compulsory" edges of the fragments, that must be part of any Hamiltonian path through the fragment, are connected at the central vertex; because any cycle can use only two of these three edges, there can be no Hamiltonian cycle.

The resulting [[Tutte graph]] is [[graph connectivity|3-connected]] and [[planar graph|planar]], so by [[Steinitz' theorem]] it is the graph of a polyhedron. In total it has 25 faces, 69 edges and 46 vertices.
It can be realized geometrically from a tetrahedron (the faces of which correspond to the four large faces in the drawing, three of which are between pairs of fragments and the fourth of which forms the exterior) by multiply truncating three of its vertices.

===Smaller counterexamples===
As {{harvtxt|Holton|McKay|1988}} show, there are exactly six 38-vertex non-Hamiltonian polyhedra that have nontrivial three-edge cuts. They are formed by replacing two of the vertices of a [[pentagonal prism]] by the same fragment used in Tutte's example.

In a problem such as [[integer sorting]] in which there are {{mvar|n}} integers to be sorted, the transdichotomous model assumes that each integer may be stored in a single word of computer memory, that operations on single words take constant time per operation, and that the number of bits that can be stored in a single word is at least {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''}}. The goal of complexity analysis in this model is to find time bounds that depend only on {{mvar|n}} and not on the actual size of the input values or the machine words.&lt;ref name="cp1"&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9276">The '''ultraproduct''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] construction that appears mainly in [[abstract algebra]] and in [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]]. An ultraproduct is a [[quotient]] of the [[direct product]] of a family of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]]. All factors need to have the same [[signature (logic)|signature]]. The '''ultrapower''' is the special case of this construction in which all factors are equal.

For example, ultrapowers can be used to construct new [[field (mathematics)|field]]s from given ones. The [[hyperreal numbers]], an ultrapower of the [[real numbers]], are a special case of this.

Some striking applications of ultraproducts include very elegant proofs of the [[compactness theorem]] and the [[completeness theorem]], [[H. Jerome Keisler|Keisler]]'s ultrapower theorem, which gives an algebraic characterization of the semantic notion of elementary equivalence, and the Robinson-Zakon presentation of the use of superstructures and their monomorphisms to construct nonstandard models of analysis, leading to the growth of the area of [[non-standard analysis]], which was pioneered (as an application of the compactness theorem) by [[Abraham Robinson]].

==Definition==
The general method for getting ultraproducts uses an index set ''I'', a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for each element ''i'' of ''I'' (all of the same [[signature (logic)|signature]]), and an [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' on ''I''. The usual choice is for ''I'' to be infinite and ''U'' to contain all [[cofinite]] subsets of ''I''; otherwise, the ultrafilter is [[Principal ultrafilter|principal]], and the ultraproduct is isomorphic to one of the factors.

Algebraic operations on the [[Cartesian product]]

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} M_i &lt;/math&gt;

are defined in the usual way (for example, for a binary function +, (''a'' + ''b'') &lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ), and an [[equivalence relation]] is defined by ''a'' ~ ''b'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ i \in I: a_i = b_i \right\}\in U,&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''ultraproduct''' is the [[quotient set]] with respect to ~.  The ultraproduct is therefore sometimes denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I}M_i / U . &lt;/math&gt;

One may define a finitely additive [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''m'' on the index set ''I'' by saying ''m''(''A'') = 1 if ''A'' ∈ ''U'' and = 0 otherwise.  Then two members of the Cartesian product are equivalent precisely if they are equal [[almost everywhere]] on the index set.  The ultraproduct is the set of equivalence classes thus generated.

Other [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s can be extended the same way:

:&lt;math&gt;R([a^1],\dots,[a^n]) \iff \left\{ i \in I: R^{M_i}(a^1_i,\dots,a^n_i) \right\}\in U,&lt;/math&gt;

where [''a''] denotes the equivalence class of ''a'' with respect to ~.

In particular, if every ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[ordered field]], then so is the ultraproduct.

An '''ultrapower''' is an ultraproduct for which all the factors ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal:

: &lt;math&gt;M^\kappa/U=\prod_{\alpha&lt;\kappa}M/U.\,&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the construction above can be carried out whenever ''U'' is a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on ''I''; the resulting model &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I}M_i / U&lt;/math&gt; is then called a '''reduced product'''.

== Examples ==

The [[hyperreal numbers]] are the ultraproduct of one copy of the [[real numbers]] for every natural number, with regard to an ultrafilter over the natural numbers containing all cofinite sets. Their order is the extension of the order of the real numbers. For example, the sequence ''ω'' given by ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' defines an equivalence class representing a hyperreal number that is greater than any real number.

Analogously, one can define [[nonstandard integer]]s, [[nonstandard complex numbers]], etc., by taking the ultraproduct of copies of the corresponding structures.

As an example of the carrying over of relations into the ultraproduct, consider the sequence ''ψ'' defined by ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''i''. Because ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' for all ''i'', it follows that the equivalence class of ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''i'' is greater than the equivalence class of ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'', so that it can be interpreted as an infinite number which is greater than the one originally constructed. However, let ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' for ''i'' not equal to 7, but ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8. The set of indices on which ''ω'' and ''χ'' agree is a member of any ultrafilter (because ''ω'' and ''χ'' agree almost everywhere), so ''ω'' and ''χ'' belong to the same equivalence class.

In the theory of [[large cardinal]]s, a standard construction is to take the ultraproduct of the whole set-theoretic universe with respect to some carefully chosen ultrafilter ''U''.   Properties of this ultrafilter ''U'' have a strong influence on (higher order) properties of the ultraproduct; for example, if ''U'' is σ-complete, then the ultraproduct will again be well-founded.  (See [[measurable cardinal]] for the prototypical example.)

==Łoś's theorem==

Łoś's theorem, also called ''the fundamental theorem of ultraproducts'', is due to [[Jerzy Łoś]] (the surname is pronounced {{IPA-pl|ˈwɔɕ|}}, approximately "wash"). It states that any [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order]] formula is true in the ultraproduct if and only if the set of indices ''i'' such that the formula is true in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a member of ''U''. More precisely:

Let σ be a signature, &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; an ultrafilter over a set &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;, and for each &lt;math&gt; i \in I &lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt; M_{i} &lt;/math&gt; be a σ-structure. Let &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; be the ultraproduct of the &lt;math&gt; M_{i} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt; M = \prod_{ i\in I }M_i/U.&lt;/math&gt; Then, for each &lt;math&gt; a^{1}, \ldots, a^{n} \in \prod M_{i} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; a^{k} = (a^{k}_{i})_{i \in I} &lt;/math&gt;, and for every σ-formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; M \models \phi[[a^1], \ldots, [a^n]] \iff \{ i \in I : M_{i} \models \phi[a^1_{i}, \ldots, a^n_{i} ] \} \in U.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is proved by induction on the complexity of the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an ultrafilter (and not just a filter) is used in the negation clause, and the [[axiom of choice]] is needed at the existential quantifier step.  As an application, one obtains the [[transfer principle|transfer theorem]] for [[hyperreal number|hyperreal fields]].

===Examples===
Let ''R'' be a unary relation in the structure ''M'', and form the ultrapower of ''M''. Then the set &lt;math&gt;S=\{x \in M|R x\}&lt;/math&gt; has an analog ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;S'' in the ultrapower, and first-order formulas involving S are also valid for ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;S''. For example, let ''M'' be the reals, and let ''Rx'' hold if ''x'' is a rational number. Then in ''M'' we can say that for any pair of rationals ''x'' and ''y'', there exists another number ''z'' such that ''z'' is not rational, and ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''. Since this can be translated into a first-order logical formula in the relevant formal language, Łoś's theorem implies that ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;S'' has the same property. That is, we can define a notion of the hyperrational numbers, which are a subset of the hyperreals, and they have the same first-order properties as the rationals.

Consider, however, the [[Archimedean property]] of the reals, which states that there is no real number ''x'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;... for every inequality in the infinite list. Łoś's theorem does not apply to the Archimedean property, because the Archimedean property cannot be stated in first-order logic. In fact, the Archimedean property is false for the hyperreals, as shown by the construction of the hyperreal number ''ω'' above.

==Ultralimit==
:''For the ultraproduct of a sequence of metric spaces, see [[Ultralimit]].''
In [[model theory]] and [[set theory]], an '''ultralimit''' or '''limiting ultrapower''' is a [[direct limit]] of a sequence of ultrapowers.

Beginning with a structure, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and an ultrafilter, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, form an ultrapower, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then repeat the process to form ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so forth. For each ''n'' there is a canonical diagonal embedding &lt;math&gt;A_n\to A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. At limit stages, such as ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, form the direct limit of earlier stages. One may continue into the transfinite.

'''Vladimir Nikolaevich Burkov''' is a Russian control theorist and the author of more than four hundred publications on control problems, game theory, and combinatorial optimization. Laureate of [[State Prize of USSR]], of Prize of Cabinet Council of USSR, he is a [[Honorary titles of Russia|Honoured Scholar of the Russian Federation]]. Vladimir Burkov is a vice-president of Russian Project Management Association (SOVNET) (the Russian branch of International Project Management Association, IPMA), Member of [[Russian Academy of Natural Sciences]]. A professor at [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] and Head of Laboratory at V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS, in the end of 1960s he pioneered the theory of active systems (which was a Soviet version of the theory of [[mechanism design]]).

== Biography ==
Vladimir Burkov was born on November 17, 1939, in the city of [[Vologda]]. In 1963 he graduated from the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)]] and was employed by Institute of Automation and Remote Control (since 1970s it is known as ICS RAS, V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS), where he earned his [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree in 1966, and became [[Doctor of Sciences]] in 1975. In 1981 he earned professorship at the Chair of Control Sciences at [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]] and since 1974 he works as a Head of Laboratory 57 (Laboratory of active systems) at ICS RAS.

Married to Elena Burkova, the couple has a daughter Irina, who also earned the doctoral degree for her contributions to control theory.

== Launching theory of active systems ==
Since late 1960s interests of Vladimir Burkov shift to the studies of specific nature of human being as a controlled object (an agent). In 1969 he pursued an idea of the "''fairplay principle''" (in Russian: принцип открытого управления): plans assigned to selfish agents by the optimal control mechanism must be coordinated with agents' goal functions. Under such an [[incentive-compatible]] mechanism truthtelling is benefitiary for agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkov|first=V.N.|last2=Lerner|first2=A.Ya.|year=1970|title=Open control principle for active systems|url=https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0218.93003|journal=Avtomat. i Telemekh.|volume=8|pages=100–111|via=ZentralMATH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Burkov V.N., Lerner A.Ya. | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url = http://www.mtas.ru/search/search_results.php?publication_id=856 | title = Fairplay in control of active systems | orig-year = | agency = H.

They pioneered the [[revelation principle]], which opened a new era in the studies of economic institutions ([[mechanism design]] and [[contract theory]]); it was mentioned as the main achievement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2007/advanced-economicsciences2007.pdf|title=Mechanism Design Theory: Scientific background on the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2007|last=Compiled by the Prize Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007s [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] won by [[Leonid Hurwicz|L.

The fairplay principle became the foundation of the newly introduced ''theory of active systems'' (a version of mechanism design originated from USSR), which systematically studied control mechanisms in man-machine systems.

== Organizational and teaching activities ==
In 1973 V. Burkov headed the newly created division in the Institute of Automation and Remote Control called "the Sector of Business Games"; in 1974 it was re-organized into the Laboratory 57 "Theory and methods of business games" later renamed to "Laboratory of Active Systems". As of the end of 2016 its headcount is 28 employees including 15 [[Doctor of Sciences|Doctors of Sciences]] and 5 [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidates of Sciences]]. During the decades V. Burkov superwised dozens of thesis works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtas.ru/users/chart/|title=Interactive tree of the Theory of Active Systems|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=|author=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous followers ==
Professor Dmitry Novikov, corresponding member of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (since 2008), was elected a director of ICS RAS on October 17, 2016.
