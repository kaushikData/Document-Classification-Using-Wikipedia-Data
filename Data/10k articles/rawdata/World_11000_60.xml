The '''Aboriginal Tasmanians''' ([[Tasmanian languages|Tasmanian]]: ''Palawa'') are the [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] of the [[Australian states and territories|Australian state]] of [[Tasmania]], located south of the mainland. For much of the 20th century, the Tasmanian Aboriginal people were widely, and erroneously, thought of as being an extinct cultural and ethnic group.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}} Contemporary figures (2016) for the number of people of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent vary according to the criteria used to determine this identity, ranging from 6,000 to over 23,000.{{sfn|Shine|2017}}{{sfn|Hunt|2017}}

First arriving in Tasmania (then a peninsula of Australia) around 40,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Aboriginal Tasmanians were cut off from the [[Australian mainland]] by rising sea levels c. 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. They were entirely isolated from the rest of the human race for 8,000 years until British contact.

Before [[British colonisation of Australia|British colonisation]] in 1803, there were an estimated 3,000–15,000 Palawa.{{efn|[[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]]: 3,000–5,000, [[Brian Plomley|N. J. B. Plomley]]: 4,000–6,000, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]]: 5,000–7,000, Colin Pardoe: 12,000+ and David Davies: 15,000.{{sfn|Madley|2008|p=78, n.7}}}}  The Palawa population suffered a drastic drop in numbers within three decades, so that by 1835 only some 400 full-blooded Tasmanian aborigines survived, most of this remnant being incarcerated in camps where all but 47 died within the following 12 years.{{sfn|Madley|2008|p=78}} No consensus exists as to the cause, over which [[History wars|a major controversy]] arose.{{efn|"Despite over 170 years of debate over who or what was responsible for this near-extinction, no consensus exists on its origins, process, or whether or not it was genocide".{{sfn|Madley|2008|p=78}}}} The traditional view, still affirmed, held that this dramatic demographic collapse was the result of the impact of introduced diseases, rather than the consequence of policy.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|p=388}}{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=66–67}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=372–376}}{{efn| Tasmanian novelist [[Richard Flanagan]] is also skeptical of the notion of genocide, if understood as an accomplished extermination:"Tasmania is still frequently - and wrongly - cited as the site of the only successful genocide in history.."{{sfn|Flanagan|2002}}}} [[Geoffrey Blainey]], for example, wrote that by 1830 in Tasmania: "Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating."{{sfn|Blainey|1980|p=75}}{{sfn|Rouse|2003|p=45}} [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] attributed the depletion to losses in the [[Black War]].{{sfn|Tatz|2003|p=79}} [[Keith Windschuttle]] claimed that in addition to disease, the prostitution of women in a society already in decline, explained the extinction.{{sfn|Johnson|McFarlane|2015|p=?}} Many specialists in the history of colonialism and genocide, such as [[Ben Kiernan]], [[Colin Tatz]], and Benjamin Madley state that the Tasmanian decimation qualifies as genocide in terms of the definition set forth by [[Raphael Lemkin]] and adopted in the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Genocide Convention]].{{sfn|Kiernan|2008|pp=265ff}}{{sfn|Tatz|2003|pp=78–79}}{{sfn|Lawson|2014|pp=1ff,31ff.}}{{efn|"In light of the U.N. definition, sufficient evidence exists to designate the Tasmanian catastrophe genocide."{{sfn|Madley|2008|p=104}}}}

By 1833, [[Christian missionary]] [[George Augustus Robinson]], sponsored by [[Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[George Arthur]], had persuaded the approximately 200 surviving Aboriginal Tasmanians to surrender themselves with assurances that they would be protected, provided for and eventually have their lands returned to them. These "assurances" were false; there is no suggestion that Robinson or Lieutenant-Governor Arthur intended anything else but exile to the [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux Islands]], and the assurances were given by Robinson in order to facilitate the removal of the Aboriginal people from mainland Tasmania.{{sfn|Boyce|2009|p=297}} The survivors were moved to [[Wybalenna Island|Wybalenna]] Aboriginal Establishment on [[Flinders Island]], where diseases continued to reduce their numbers even further. In 1847, the last 47 living inhabitants of Wybalenna were transferred to [[Oyster Cove, Tasmania|Oyster Cove]], south of [[Hobart]]. Two individuals, [[Truganini]] (1812–1876) and [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]] (1834–1905), are separately considered to have been the last people solely of Tasmanian descent.{{efn|For discussion of the Truganini claim, and the other candidates, Suke and Fanny Cochrane Smith, see {{harvnb|Taylor|2004|pp=140ff.|ps='''{{red| ?}}'''}}}}{{efn|Lyndall Ryan denies Truganini was the last "full-blood" and makes a case for ''Suke'' (d. circa 1888){{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=220}}}}

The complete [[Tasmanian languages|indigenous Tasmanian languages]] have been lost; some original Tasmanian language words remained in use with Palawa people in the [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux Islands]], and there are some efforts to [[Palawa kani|reconstruct a language]] from the available wordlists. Today, some thousands of people living in Tasmania describe themselves as Aboriginal Tasmanians since a number of Parlevar women bore children to European men in the Furneaux Islands and mainland Tasmania.

==History==
===Before European settlement===
[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago as sea levels were rising showing some of the human archaeological sites – see [[Prehistory of Australia]]]]
People crossed into Tasmania approximately 40,000 years, ago via a [[land bridge]] between the island and the rest of mainland Australia, during the [[last glacial period]]. According to genetic studies, once the sea level rose, flooding the [[Bass Strait|Bassian Plain]], the people were left isolated for approximately 8,000 years, until the time of European exploration, during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1–27}}

Until the 1980s, it was thought that Tasmania was only occupied relatively recently, but the discovery of 19,000-year-old deposits at [[Kutikina Cave|Kutikina (or Fraser) Cave]] demonstrated the Ice Age occupation of the highlands.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006|pp=58–63}}{{sfn|Johnson|McFarlane|2015|p=31}} In 1990, archaeologists excavated material in the Warreen Cave in the Maxwell River valley of the south-west, proving Aboriginal occupation from as early as 34,000 [[before present|BP]], making indigenous Tasmanians the southern-most population in the world during the [[Pleistocene]] era. Modern digs in southwest and central Tasmania turned up very abundant finds, affording "the richest archaeological evidence from Pleistocene Greater Australia" covering the period from 35,000 to 11,000 BP.{{sfn|Lourandos|1993|pp=72–73}}

==== Migration chronology ====
Tasmania was colonised by successive waves of aboriginal people from southern Australia during glacial maxima, when the sea was at its lowest. The archeological and geographic record suggests a period of drying, with the colder glacial period, with a desert extending from southern Australia into the midlands of Tasmania - with intermittent periods of wetter, warmer weather. People migrating from southern Australia into peninsular Tasmania would have crossed stretches of seawater and desert, and finally found oases in the King highlands (now King Island).

The archeological, geographic and linguistic record suggests a pattern of successive occupation of Tasmania, and coalescence of three ethnic or language groups into one broad group. Evidence for contest over territory is reflected by the presence of ''Nara'' (the broad western Tasmania language group) toponymy in ''Mara'' (the broad eastern language group) territory; for example - suggesting a pattern of occupation and hostile takeover that mirrors traditional hostilities during colonial times.
Colonial settlers found two main language groups in Tasmania upon their arrival, which correlates with the broader nation or clan divisions.
* ''Pleistocene Palawa'' language group - first ethnic and language group in Tasmania - absorbed or displaced by successive invasions except for remnant group on Tasman peninsula. Absorbed population in Eastern Tasmania combined with "victorian speakers" to form '''"Mara"''' language group across broader eastern Tasmania
* ''Furneaux speakers'' displace Palawa in N/E Tasmania as far south as Orford - themselves disappear or are absorbed into Mara language group -the ''Mara'' language group a composite of ''pleistocene palawa, Furneaux and Victorian''
* '''''Nara''''' speakers invade, but are pushed back to western Tasmania - correlates with Western nation of Tasmanian Aboriginal people.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

After the sea rose to create Bass Strait, the Australian mainland and Tasmania became separate land masses, and the Aboriginal people who had migrated from mainland Australia became cut off from their cousins on the mainland. Archeological evidence suggests remnant populations on the King and Furneaux highlands being stranded by rising waters - later to die out.

===Early European contact===
Abel Jansen Tasman, credited as the first European to discover Tasmania (in 1642) and who named it Van Diemen's Land, did not encounter any of the Aboriginal Tasmanians when he landed.
In 1772, a French exploratory expedition under [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion Dufresne]] visited Tasmania. At first, contact with the Aboriginal people was friendly; however the Aboriginal Tasmanians became alarmed when another boat was dispatched towards the shore. It was reported that spears and stones were thrown and the French responded with musket fire, killing at least one Aboriginal person and wounding several others. Two later French expeditions led by [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] in 1792–93 and [[Nicolas Baudin]] in 1802 made friendly contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians; the d'Entrecasteaux expedition doing so over an extended period of time.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58–60}}

The ''Resolution'' under [[Tobias Furneaux|Captain Tobias Furneaux]] (part of an expedition led by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]) had visited in 1773 but made no contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians although gifts were left for them in unoccupied shelters found on Bruny Island. The first known British contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians was on Bruny Island by Captain Cook in 1777. The contact was peaceful. [[William Bligh|Captain William Bligh]] also visited Bruny Island in 1788 and made peaceful contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=3–8}}

===Contact with sealers on the north and east coasts===
More extensive contact between Aboriginal Tasmanians and Europeans resulted when British and American seal hunters began visiting the islands in Bass Strait as well as the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania from the late 1790s. Shortly thereafter (by about 1800), sealers were regularly left on uninhabited islands in Bass Strait during the sealing season (November to May). The sealers established semi-permanent camps or settlements on the islands, which were close enough for the sealers to reach the main island of Tasmania in small boats and so make contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58–60,76}}

Trading relationships developed between sealers and Tasmanian Aboriginal tribes. Hunting dogs became highly prized by the Aboriginal people, as were other exotic items such as flour, tea and tobacco. The Aboriginal people traded kangaroo skins for such goods. However, a trade in Aboriginal women soon developed. Many Tasmanian Aboriginal women were highly skilled in hunting seals, as well as in obtaining other foods such as seabirds, and some Tasmanian tribes would trade their services and, more rarely, those of Aboriginal men to the sealers for the seal-hunting season. Others were sold on a permanent basis. This trade incorporated not only women of the tribe engaged in the trade but also women abducted from other tribes. Some may have been given to incorporate the new arrivals into Aboriginal society through marriage.

Sealers engaged in raids along the coasts to abduct Aboriginal women and were reported to have killed Aboriginal men in the process. By 1810 seal numbers had been greatly reduced by hunting so most seal hunters abandoned the area, however a small number of sealers, approximately fifty mostly "renegade sailors, escaped convicts or ex-convicts", remained as permanent residents of the Bass Strait islands and some established families with Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58–60}}

Some of the women were taken back to the islands by the sealers involuntarily and some went willingly, as in the case of a woman called Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer). Differing opinions have been given on Walyer's involvement with the sealers. McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined the sealers with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike.{{sfn|McFarlane|2008|p=119}} Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to the sealers for dogs and flour.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=141}} Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill the sealers to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]]. Walyer's attacks are the first recorded use of [[musket]]s by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to [[Penguin Island (Tasmania)|Penguin Island]]. Later imprisoned on [[Swan Island (Tasmania)|Swan Island]] she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from sealers became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to, or kidnapped by sealers became "a significant dissident group" against white authority.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}

Historian James Bonwick reported Aboriginal women who were clearly captives of sealers but he also reported women living with sealers who "proved faithful and affectionate to their new husbands", women who appeared "content" and others who were allowed to visit their "native tribe", taking gifts, with the sealers being confident that they would return.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295–297}} Bonwick also reports a number of claims of brutality by sealers towards Aboriginal women including some of those made by Robinson..{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295–301}} An Aboriginal woman by the name of Bulrer related her experience to Robinson, that sealers had rushed her camp and stolen six women including herself "the white men tie them and then they flog them very much, plenty much blood, plenty cry." Sealing captain, James Kelly, wrote in 1816 that the custom of the sealers was to each have "two to five of these native women for their own use and benefit." A shortage of women available "in trade" resulted in abduction becoming common and in 1830 it was reported that at least fifty Aboriginal women were "kept in slavery" on the Bass Strait islands.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Harrington, a sealer, procured ten or fifteen native women, and placed them on different islands in Bass's Straits, where he left them to procure skins; if, however, when he returned, they had not obtained enough, he punished them by tying them up to trees for twenty-four to thirty-six hours together, flogging them at intervals, and he killed them not infrequently if they proved stubborn." (H.W.Parker ''The Rise, Progress, and Present State of V. D. Land'' 1833){{sfn|Roth|1899}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The raids for, and trade in, Aboriginal women contributed to the rapid depletion of the numbers of Aboriginal women in the northern areas of Tasmania, "by 1830 only three women survived in northeast Tasmania among 72 men",{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58–60}} and thus contributed in a significant manner to the demise of the full-blooded Aboriginal population of Tasmania. However many modern day Aboriginal Tasmanians trace their descent from the 19th century sealer communities of Bass Strait.

There are numerous stories of the sealers' brutality towards the Aboriginal women; with some of these reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from the sealers, planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. [[Josephine Flood]], an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: "he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers". The sealers sent a representative, [[James Munro (sealer)|James Munro]], to appeal to [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|Governor Arthur]] and argue for the women's return on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by the sealers against Aboriginal people and against Aboriginal women, in particular. [[Brian Plomley]], who edited Robinson's papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to [[William Grant Broughton|Archdeacon Broughton]]'s 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=76}}

===After European settlement===
[[File:Dowling Natives of Tasmania.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Hawker Dowling|Robert Dowling]], ''Group of Natives of Tasmania'', 1859. Critic [[Bernard William Smith]] assessed the work as a "history painting in the full sense of the word", with the natives "seated—emblematic of their situation—around the dying embers of a burnt-out log near a great blackened stump, and in the far left corner there is a leafless tree with shattered branches."{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=57}} ]]
Between 1803 and 1823, there were two phases of conflict between the Aboriginal people and the British colonists. The first took place between 1803 and 1808 over the need for common food sources such as oysters and kangaroos, and the second between 1808 and 1823, when the small number of white females among the farmers, sealers and whalers, led to the trading, and the abduction, of Aboriginal women as sexual partners. These practices also increased conflict over women among Aboriginal tribes. This in turn led to a decline in the Aboriginal population. Historian Lyndall Ryan records 74 Aboriginal people (almost all women) living with sealers on the Bass Strait islands in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=313}}

By 1816, kidnapping of Aboriginal children for labour had become widespread. In 1814, [[Governor]] [[Thomas Davey (governor)|Thomas Davey]] issued a proclamation expressing "utter indignation and abhorrence" in regards to the kidnapping of the children and in 1819 Governor [[William Sorell]] not only re-issued the proclamation but ordered that those who had been taken without parental consent were to be sent to Hobart and supported at government expense.{{sfn|Bringing them Home – The Report}}
A number of young Aboriginal children were known to be living with settlers. An Irish sealer named Brien spared the life of the baby son of a native woman he had abducted, explaining, "as (he) had stolen the dam he would keep the cub." When the child grew up he became an invaluable assistant to Brien but was considered "no good" by his own people as he was brought up to dislike Aboriginal people, whom he considered "dirty lazy brutes."{{sfn|Merry|2003}} Twenty-six were definitely known (through baptismal records) to have been taken into settlers' homes as infants or very small children, too young to be of service as labourers. Some Aboriginal children were sent to the Orphan School in Hobart..{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=77}} Lyndall Ryan reports fifty-eight Aboriginal people, of various ages, living with settlers in Tasmania in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=176}}

Some historians argue that European disease did not appear to be a serious factor until after 1829.{{sfn|Boyce|2009|p=65}} Other historians including [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and [[Keith Windschuttle]], point to introduced disease as the main cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal population. Keith Windschuttle argues that while smallpox never reached Tasmania, respiratory diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis and the effects of venereal diseases devastated the Tasmanian Aboriginal population whose long isolation from contact with the mainland compromised their resistance to introduced disease. The work of historian [[James Bonwick]] and anthropologist H. Ling Roth, both writing in the 19th century, also point to the significant role of epidemics and infertility without clear attribution of the sources of the diseases as having been introduced through contact with Europeans. Bonwick, however, did note that Tasmanian Aboriginal women were infected with venereal diseases by Europeans. Introduced venereal disease not only directly caused deaths but, more insidiously, left a significant percentage of the population unable to reproduce. Josephine Flood, archaeologist, wrote: "Venereal disease sterilised and chest complaints – influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis – killed."{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=77,90,128}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=372–376}}

Bonwick, who lived in Tasmania, recorded a number of reports of the devastating effect of introduced disease including one report by a Doctor Story, a [[Quaker]], who wrote: "After 1823 the women along with the tribe seemed to have had no children; but why I do not know.".{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|p=388}} Later historians have reported that introduced venereal disease caused infertility amongst the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=90}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=375–376}} Bonwick also recorded a strong Aboriginal oral tradition of an epidemic even before formal colonisation in 1803. "Mr Robert Clark, in a letter to me, said: 'I have gleaned from some of the aborigines, now in their graves, that they were more numerous than the white people were aware of, but their numbers were very much thinned by a sudden attack of disease which was general among the entire population previous to the arrival of the English, entire tribes of natives having been swept off in the course of one or two days' illness.'"{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84–85}} Such an epidemic may be linked to contact with sailors or sealers..{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=66–67}}

Henry Ling Roth, an anthropologist, wrote: "Calder, who has gone more fully into the particulars of their illnesses, writes as follows ...: 'Their rapid declension after the colony was founded is traceable, as far as our proofs allow us to judge, to the prevalence of epidemic disorders….'"{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Roth was referring to James Erskine Calder who took up a post as a surveyor in Tasmania in 1829 and who wrote a number of scholarly papers about the Aboriginal people. "According to Calder, a rapid and remarkable declension of the numbers of the aborigines had been going on long before the remnants were gathered together on Flinders Island. Whole tribes (some of which Robinson mentions by name as being in existence fifteen or twenty years before he went amongst them, and which probably never had a shot fired at them) had absolutely and entirely vanished. To the causes to which he attributes this strange wasting away ... I think [[infertility|infecundity]], produced by the infidelity of the women to their husbands in the early times of the colony, may be safely added ... Robinson always enumerates the sexes of the individuals he took; ... and as a general thing, found scarcely any children amongst them; ... adultness was found to outweigh infancy everywhere in a remarkable degree ..."{{sfn|Roth|1899|pp=172–173}}

Robinson recorded in his journals a number of comments regarding the Aboriginal Tasmanians' susceptibility to diseases, particularly respiratory diseases. In 1832 he revisited the west coast of Tasmania, far from the settled regions, and wrote: "The numbers of aborigines along the western coast have been considerably reduced since the time of my last visit [1830]. A mortality has raged amongst them which together with the severity of the season and other causes had rendered the paucity of their number very considerable."{{efn|Robinson writing to Edward Curr, 22 Sept 1832.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=732}}}}

Between 1825 and 1831 a pattern of guerilla warfare by the Aboriginal Tasmanians was identified by the colonists. Rapid pastoral expansion, a depletion of native game and an increase in the colony's population triggered Aboriginal resistance from 1824 onwards when it has been estimated by Lyndall Ryan that 1000 Aboriginal people remained in the settled districts. Whereas settlers and stock keepers had previously provided rations to the Aboriginal people during their seasonal movements across the settled districts, and recognised this practice as some form of payment for trespass and loss of traditional hunting grounds, the new settlers and stock keepers were unwilling to maintain these arrangements and the Aboriginal people began to raid settlers' huts for food.

The official Government position was that Aboriginal people were blameless for any hostilities, but when [[Musquito]] was hanged in 1825, a significant debate was generated which split the colonists along class lines. The "higher grade" saw the hanging as a dangerous precedent and argued that Aboriginal people were only defending their land and should not be punished for doing so. The "lower grade" of colonists wanted more Aboriginal people hanged to encourage a "conciliatory line of conduct." Governor Arthur sided with the "lower grade" and 1825 saw the first official acceptance that Aboriginal people were at least partly to blame for conflict.

In 1826 the Government gazette, which had formerly reported "retaliatory actions" by Aboriginal people, now reported "acts of atrocity" and for the first time used the terminology "Aborigine" instead of "native". A newspaper reported that there were only two solutions to the problem: either they should be "hunted down like wild beasts and destroyed" or they should be removed from the settled districts. The colonial Government assigned troops to drive them out. A Royal Proclamation in 1828 established military posts on the boundaries and a further proclamation declared [[martial law]] against the Aboriginal people. As it was recognised that there were fixed routes for seasonal migration, Aboriginal people were required to have passes if they needed to cross the settled districts with bounties offered for the capture of those without passes, £5 (around 2010:$1,000) for an adult and £2 for children, a process that often led to organised hunts resulting in deaths. Every dispatch from Governor Arthur to the Secretary of State during this period stressed that in every case where Aboriginal people had been killed it was colonists that initiated hostilities.{{sfn|Cove|1995|pp=25–29}}

Though many Aboriginal deaths went unrecorded, the [[Cape Grim massacre]] in 1828 demonstrates the level of frontier violence towards Aboriginal Tasmanians.

The [[Black War]] of 1828–32 and the [[Black Line]] of 1830 were turning points in the relationship with European settlers. Even though many of the Aboriginal people managed to avoid capture during these events, they were shaken by the size of the campaigns against them, and this brought them to a position whereby they were willing to surrender to Robinson and move to [[Flinders Island]].

====Tasmanian aboriginals and settlers mentioned in literature 1800–1835====
Europeans killed and Aborigines captured may be considered as reasonably accurate. The figures for tribal people shot is likely to be a substantial undercount.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=313–314}}

====Resettlement of the indigenous population====
In late 1831 Robinson brought the first 51 Aboriginals to a settlement on Flinders Island named The Lagoons, which turned out to be inadequate as it was exposed to gales, had little water and no land suitable for cultivation.{{efn|The Lagoons was located on a narrow sandbank, covered with ferns and scrub. It was bounded on one side by the sea, and on the other side by a saltwater lagoon bordered with thick tea-tree which cut off access to the main island.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}
Supplies to the settlement were inadequate and if sealers had not supplied potatoes, the Aboriginal people would have starved. The Europeans were living on oatmeal and potatoes while the Aboriginal people, who detested oatmeal and refused to eat it, survived on potatoes and rice supplemented by [[short-tailed shearwater|mutton birds]] they caught.{{sfn|Roth|1899|p=3}} Within months 31 Aboriginal people had died. &lt;blockquote&gt;They were lodged at night in shelters or "breakwinds." These "breakwinds" were thatched roofs sloping to the ground, with an opening at the top to let out the smoke, and closed at the ends, with the exception of a doorway. They were twenty feet long by ten feet wide. In each of these from twenty to thirty blacks were lodged ... To savages accustomed to sleep naked in the open air beneath the rudest shelter, the change to close and heated dwellings tended to make them susceptible, as they had never been in their wild state, to chills from atmospheric changes, and was only too well calculated to induce those severe pulmonary diseases which were destined to prove so fatal to them. The same may be said of the use of clothes ... At the settlement they were compelled to wear clothes, which they threw off when heated or when they found them troublesome, and when wetted by rain allowed them to dry on their bodies. In the case of Tasmanians, as with other wild tribes accustomed to go naked, the use of clothes had a most mischievous effect on their health.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Duterrau - Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Duterrau]], ''Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy'', 1840]]

By January 1832 a further 44 captured Aboriginals had arrived and conflicts arose between the tribal groups. To defuse the situation, Sergeant Wight took the Big River group to [[Green Island (Tasmania)|Green island]], where they were abandoned and he later decided to move the rest to Green Island as well. Two weeks later Robinson arrived with Lieutenant Darling, the new commander for the station, and moved the Aboriginal people back to The Lagoons. Darling ensured a supply of plentiful food and permitted "hunting excursions." In October 1832, it was decided to build a new camp with better buildings ([[wattle and daub]]) at a more suitable location, Pea Jacket Point. Pea Jacket Point was renamed Civilisation Point but became more commonly known as Wybalenna, which in the Ben Lomond language meant "Blackman's Houses".{{sfn|Roth|1899}}

Robinson befriended Truganini, learned some of the local language and in 1833 managed to persuade the remaining 154 "full-blooded" people to move to the new settlement on Flinders Island, where he promised a modern and comfortable environment, and that they would be returned to their former homes on the Tasmanian mainland as soon as possible. At the Wybalenna Aboriginal establishment on Flinders Island, described by historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] as the "best equipped and most lavishly staffed Aboriginal institution in the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century", they were provided with housing, clothing, rations of food, the services of a doctor and educational facilities. Convicts were assigned to build housing and do most of the work at the settlement including the growing of food in the vegetable gardens.{{efn|Flood cites Henry Reynolds.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=88}}}} After arrival, all Aboriginal children aged between six and 15 years were removed from their families to be brought up by the storekeeper and a lay preacher.{{sfn|Bringing them Home – The Report}} The Aboriginal people were free to roam the island and were often absent from the settlement for extended periods on hunting trips as the rations supplied turned out to be inadequate. By 1835 the living conditions had deteriorated to the extent that in October Robinson personally took charge of Wybalenna, organising better food and improving the housing. However, of the 220 who arrived with Robinson, most died in the following 14 years from introduced disease and inadequate shelter. As a result of their loss of freedom, the birth rate was extremely low and few children survived infancy.
[[File:oyster cove mob.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oyster Cove Mob]]
In 1839, Governor Franklin appointed a board to inquire into the conditions at Wybalenna that rejected Robinson's claims regarding improved living conditions and found the settlement to be a failure. The report was never released and the government continued to promote Wybalenna as a success in the treatment of Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Howson|2004}}
In March 1847 six Aboriginals at Wybalenna presented a petition to [[Queen Victoria]], the first petition to a reigning monarch from any Aboriginal group in Australia, requesting that the promises made to them be honoured.{{efn|Since the 1980s this petition has been the focus of a major argument in the legal battle regarding the promises that Robinson and Governor Arthur made to the Tasmanian Aborigines.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}
In October 1847, the 47 survivors were transferred to their final settlement at Oyster Cove station..{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=270–295}} Only 44 survived the trip (11 couples, 12 single men and 10 children) and the children were immediately sent to the orphan school in Hobart.{{sfn|Bringing them Home – The Report}} Although the housing and food was better than Wybalenna, the station was a former convict station that had been abandoned earlier that year due to health issues as it was located on inadequately drained [[mudflat]]s. According to the guards, the Aboriginal people developed "too much independence" by trying to continue their culture which they considered "recklessness" and "rank ingratitude." Their numbers continued to diminish, being estimated in 1859 at around a dozen and, by 1869, there was only one, who died in 1876.

Commenting in 1899 on Robinson's claims of success, anthropologist [[Henry Ling Roth]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;While Robinson and others were doing their best to make them into a civilised people, the poor blacks had given up the struggle, and were solving the difficult problem by dying. The very efforts made for their welfare only served to hasten on their inevitable doom. The white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal than the white man's musket.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Anthropological interest ====
[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith.oga|thumb|1903 recording of a Tasmanian language]]
The Oyster Cove people attracted contemporaneous international scientific interest from the 1860s onwards, with many museums claiming body parts for their collections. Scientists were interested in studying Aboriginal Tasmanians from a [[physical anthropology]] perspective, hoping to gain insights into the field of [[paleoanthropology]]. For these reasons, they were interested in individual Aboriginal body parts and whole [[skeletons]].

Tasmanian Aboriginal [[Human skull|skulls]] were particularly sought internationally for studies into [[craniofacial anthropometry]]. Truganini herself entertained fears that her body might be exploited after her death and two years after her death her body was exhumed and sent to Melbourne for scientific study. Her skeleton was then put up for public display in the Tasmanian Museum until 1947, and was only lay to rest, by cremation, in 1976.{{sfn|Fforde|Hubert|2006|pp=79–80}} Another case was the removal of the skull and scrotum — for a tobacco pouch — of William Lanne, known as King Billy, on his death in 1869.

However, many of these skeletons were obtained from "aboriginal mummies" from graves or bodies of the murdered. [[Amalie Dietrich]] for example became famous for delivering such specimens.{{sfn|Turnbull|1991}}

Aboriginal people have considered the dispersal of body parts as being disrespectful, as a common aspect within Aboriginal [[belief systems]] is that a soul can only be at rest when laid in its homeland.

=== 20th century to present ===
[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith recording.jpg|thumb|Horace Watson recording the songs of [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]], considered to be the last fluent speaker of a Tasmanian language, 1903. Singer [[Bruce Watson (songwriter)|Bruce Watson]], descendant of Watson, composed a song about this picture and later performed it with singer Ronnie Summers, a descendant of Smith.]]
Body parts and ornaments are still being returned from collections today, with the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] returning samples of Truganini's skin and hair (in 2002); and the [[British Museum]] returning ashes to two descendants in 2007.{{sfn|Bodies of Knowledge}}

During the 20th century, the absence of Aboriginal people of solely indigenous ancestry, and a general unawareness of the surviving populations, meant many non-Aboriginals assumed they were [[extinct]], after the death of [[Truganini]] in 1876. Since the mid-1970s Tasmanian Aboriginal activists such as [[Michael Mansell]] have sought to broaden awareness and identification of Aboriginal descent.

A dispute exists within the Tasmanian Aboriginal community, however, over what constitutes Aboriginality. Since splitting from the [[Lia Pootah]] in 1996, the Palawa minority were given the power to decide who is of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent at the state level (entitlement to government Aboriginal services). Palawa recognise only descendants of the Bass Strait Island community as Aboriginal and do not consider as Aboriginal the Lia Pootah, who claim descent, based on oral traditions, from Tasmanian mainland Aboriginal communities. The Lia Pootah feel that the Palawa controlled [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]] does not represent them politically.{{sfn|Lia Pootah Community|2008}}{{sfn|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|2002}}
Since 2007 there have been initiatives to introduce [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] to establish family history in descendant subgroups. This is strongly opposed by the Palawa and has drawn an angry reaction from some quarters, as some have claimed "[[spirituality|spiritual]] connection" with aboriginality distinct from, but not as important as the existence of a genetic link. The Lia Pootah object to the current test used to prove Aboriginality as they believe it favours the Palawa, a DNA test would circumvent barriers to Lia Pootah recognition, or disprove their claims to Aboriginality.{{sfn|Denholm|2007}}

In April 2000, the Tasmanian Government ''Legislative Council Select Committee on Aboriginal Lands'' discussed the difficulty of determining Aboriginality based on oral traditions. An example given by Prof. [[Cassandra Pybus]] was the claim by the Huon and Channel Aboriginal people who had an oral history of descent from two Indigenous women. Research found that both were non-indigenous convict women.{{sfn|Legislative Council Select Committee|2002}}

The Tasmanian Palawa Aboriginal community is making an effort to reconstruct and reintroduce a Tasmanian language, called [[palawa kani]] out of the various records on Tasmanian languages. Other Tasmanian aboriginal communities use words from traditional Tasmanian languages, according to the language area they were born or live in.

==Tasmanian Aboriginal nations==
[[File:Tasmanian tribes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Map of Tasmanian nations]]
The social organisation of Aboriginal Tasmanians had at least two hierarchies: the domestic unit or family group and the social unit or clan - which had a self-defining name with 40 to 50 people. It is contentious whether there was a larger political organisation, hitherto described as a "tribe" in the literature (and by colonial observers), as there is no evidence in the historical literature of larger political entities above that of the clan. Robinson, who gathered ethnographic data in the early 1800s, described aboriginal political groups at the clan level only. Nevertheless, clans that shared a geographic region and language group are now usually classified by modern ethnographers, and the Palawa, as a nation.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10–11}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006}}

Estimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are in the range of 3,000 to 15,000 people.{{sfn|Madley|2008|pp=77–106}} Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were "more numerous than the white people were aware of" but that their population had been greatly reduced by a sudden outbreak of disease before 1803. It is speculated that early contacts with sealers before colonisation had resulted in an epidemic.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84–85}} Using archaeological evidence, Stockton (I983:68) estimated 3,000 to 6,000 for the northern half of the west coast alone, or up to six times the commonly accepted estimate, however he later revised this to 3,000 to 5,000 for the entire island, based on historical sources. The low rate of [[genetic drift]] indicates that Stockton's original maximum estimate is likely the lower boundary and, while not indicated by the archaeological record, a population as high as 100,000 can "not be rejected out of hand". This is supported by [[carrying capacity]] data indicating greater resource productivity in Tasmania than the mainland.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1–27}}

The Aboriginal Tasmanians were primarily nomadic people who lived in adjoining territories, moving based on seasonal changes in food supplies such as seafood, land mammals and native vegetables and berries. They socialised, intermarried and fought "wars" against other clans.{{sfn|ABS|2008}}

According to Ryan,{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=14}} the population of Tasmania was aligned into nine nations composed of six to fifteen clans each, with each clan comprising two to six extended family units who were relations. Individual clans ranged over a defined nation boundary with elaborate rites of entry required of visitors.{{sfn|Huys|2009|p=17}}

There were more than 60 clans before European colonisation, although only 48 have been located and associated with particular territories.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10–11}}
The location and migratory patterns discussed below come from the work of Jones (cited in Tindale). Ryan used Jones' work in her seminal history of Tasmanian Aboriginals{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}} but Taylor discusses in his thesis how Jones' original work is uncited and possibly conjectural.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Moreover, Jones published his work without recourse to Plomley's later extensive descriptions of Tasmanian Aboriginal clan groups. Given this, the clan boundaries and nomadic patterns discussed below should be taken with caution unless referenced from primary documents.

===Oyster Bay (Paredarerme)===
The Paredarerme was estimated to be the largest Tasmanian nation with ten clans totalling 700 to 800 people.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The members of the Paredarerme nation had good relations with the Big River nation, with large congregations at favoured hunting sites inland and at the coast. Relations with the North Midlands nation were mostly hostile, and evidence suggests that the [[Douglas-Apsley National Park|Douglas-Apsley]] region may have been a dangerous borderland rarely visited (Ferguson 1986 pg22). Generally, the clans of the Paredarerme ranged inland to the High Country for spring and summer and returned to the coast for autumn and winter, but not all people left their territory each year with some deciding to stay by the coast. Migrations provided a varied diet with plentiful seafood, seals and birds on the coast, and good hunting for kangaroos, wallabies and possums inland.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The High Country also provided opportunities to trade for ochre with the North-west and North people, and to harvest intoxicating gum from ''[[Eucalyptus gunnii]]'', found only on the plateau.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10–11}} The key determinant of camp sites was [[topography]]. The majority of camps were along river valleys, adjacent north facing hill slopes and on gentle slopes bordering a forest or marsh (Brown 1986).

===North East===
The North East nation consisted of seven clans totalling around 500 people. They had good relations with the Ben Lomond nation - granted seasonal access to the resources of the north-east coast.

===North===
The Northern nation consisted of four clans totalling 200–300 people.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=22}} Their country contained the most important ochre mines in Tasmania, accessed by well defined roads kept open by firing. They traded the ochre with nearby clanspeople. They would spend part of the year in the country of the North West nation to hunt seals and collect shells from [[Robbins Island (Tasmania)|Robbins Island]] for necklaces. In return, the North West nation had free access to the ochre mines{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=23–26}} Relatively isolated, the region was first explored by Europeans in 1824 with the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]] being given a grant of {{convert|250,000|acre|ha}}, which included the greater part of the clan hunting grounds. The settlement was a failure, with the inland areas described as "wet, cold and soggy", while the coastal region was difficult to clear, as Superintendent Henry Hellyer noted the "forest [was] altogether unlike anything I have seen in the Island". However, in 1827 a port was established at Emu Bay. In 1828 Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer), a woman who had escaped from sealers, became the leader of the Emu Bay people and attacked the settlers with stolen weapons, the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Burnie City Council}}

The Big River nation numbered 400 – 500 people consisting of five clans. Little is known of their seasonal movements although it is believed that four of the five clans moved through Oyster Bay territory along the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] to reach their coastal camps near [[Midway Point, Tasmania|Pitt Water]]. The Oyster Bay People had reciprocal movement rights through Big River territory.{{sfn|Refshauge|1804}}

===North Midlands===
The North Midlands nation occupied the Midland plains, a major geographical area formed in a [[horst and graben]] valley which was also subject to previous major freshwater lacustrine inundation.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}{{sfn|Gilfedder|2003|ps='''{{red| ?}}'''}}
The result being a relatively flat and fertile landscape that supported a large biomass and, thus, a major food source for the aboriginal people.{{sfn|Gilfedder|2003|ps='''{{red| ?}}'''}}
The North Midlands nation is likely to have consisted of several clans but there are three accepted major clan divisions described in the ethnographic literature today.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=18}}{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}} The total population of the North Midlands nation has been estimated to be between 300{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}} and 500{{sfn|Kee|1990}} and, although migratory, the archeological and historical record infers seasonal residency in locations adjacent to permanent water sources in the Midlands valley.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}

====Boundaries of the North Midlands nation====
The North Midlands nation was circumscribed by the geographical constraints of the Midlands valley. To the west the nation was bounded by the escarpment of the Great Western Tiers, to the north-east the boundaries are less certain; with the eastern Tamar appearing to have been occupied by the Letteremairrener as far east as Piper's River: where the Poremairrenerner clan of the North-east nation were resident.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18–19}}
The occupation of the western Tamar is open to dispute -  the ethnographic record suggests that it was the province of the Pallitorre and Parnillerpanner clans of the North nation; or the Leterrmairrener; or a hitherto unnamed clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}} It is likely that the west Tamar valley, or the Meander river valley formed the NNW boundaries of the North Midlands nation - with the arc of highlands formed by Cluan Tier and Dry's Bluff forming the nor-western extremity of their country.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18–19}}
To the east the natural boundary was the South-Esk River and, running northwards, the high tier of Mts Barrow, Arthur and Tippogoree Hills: beyond which lay the North-east nation. Running south past the eastern bend of the South-Esk it appears that the North Midlands Nation held land to some extent along the south bank of the Esk, at least as far as Avoca and possibly as far as the natural boundary of the St Pauls River, beyond which the Oyster Bay nation were resident.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}
To the south their country was constrained by the uplands beyond Tunbridge, as the plains narrow towards Big River and Oyster Bay country.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18–20}}

====Language of the North Midlands nation====
The North Midlands language is classified as "mairremenner" and was spoken by the Ben Lomond and North-east nations and also the Luggermairrenerpairer clan of the Central Highlands. This language group is likely to be a derivation of three other Tasmanian languages.{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}

====Clans of the North Midlands nation====
Three major national divisions are generally ascribed to the North Midlands nation although it is llkely that more clans existed and Ryan (2012) asserts the possibility of another two clan territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}} What is known of the composition of the North Midlands nation derives from settler description (who ascribed simple tribal divisions based upon locality), direct attribution from contemporary Tasmanian Aborigines (recorded by [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]] collated by [[Brian Plomley|Plomley]]) and later research by [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]]. From this we can be certain that there were three major clan divisions, described by colonials as the Port Dalrymple Tribe (Leterrermairrener Clan), at the Tamar River; Pennyroyal Creek Tribe (Panninher), at Norfolk Plains; and the Stony Creek Tribe (Tyrrernotepanner), at Campbell Town.

=====The Letteremairrener "Port Dalrymple" Clan=====
The Letteremairrener (Letter-ramare-ru-nah) Clan occupied country from Low Head to modern day Launceston. In colonial times reports were made of clusters of huts, up to ten in number, in the Tamar valley and there are extensive archeological remains of occupation on both sides of the Tamar river and north coastal country.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}

======Toponymy======
Little is recorded of the toponymy of their country but some local placenames have survived and are likely to be of the "Nara" language group.
* Tamar River: kunermurluker, morerutter, ponrabbel{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}}
* Low Head: Pilerwaytackenter
* Georgetown area: Kennemerthertackenloongentare
* Launceston (Port Dalrymple): Taggener, Lorernulraytitteter
* North-Esk River: Lakekeller
* Mt Barrow: Pialermaligena

======Significant sites======
Little is known of specific sites of significance to the Letteremairrener, but modern day Palawa assert the significance of the [[Cataract Gorge]]{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}{{sfn|Clarke|2015}}
as a place of ceremony and significance. Certainly, in 1847, when a surviving aboriginal "chief" was temporarily returned to Launceston from exile in Wybalenna, he requested to be taken to the Cataract Gorge and was described as being jubilant at return to the Gorge, followed with apparent lamentation at what had been lost to him.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}}{{sfn|Richards|Johnson|2007|p=63}}
There are no recorded significant archeological remains in the Gorge precinct, although the area was subject to significant seasonal flooding before damming.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}

The Letteremairrener had been recorded to have specific meeting places at Paterson's Plains (near modern-day St Leonards){{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}} and groups as large as 150 had been recorded in colonial times in this vicinity.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}} The Clan country overlapped with that of the Panninher and Tyrrernotepanner and it is likely that, at times, the clans shared resources across clan borders.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}

======Colonial contact======
The Letteremairrener were among the first Tasmanian Aboriginals to be affected by the impact of colonisation by the British as colonial occupation commenced at Port Dalrymple and progressed to Launceston, with settlers progressively occupying land up the Tamar valley.
By the early 1800s the Letteremairrener had been involved in skirmishes with exploratory parties of colonials, in the second decade of that century they had reached some accommodation with the interlopers; and were observed practicing spear throwing near present-day Paterson Barracks and watching colonial women wash clothes at Cataract Gorge.{{sfn|Bethell|1957}}
Between 1811 and 1827 several aboginal children were baptised in Launceston, either abducted or the progeny of settler/aboriginal liaison.
By 1830 the people of the Letteremairenner had largely disappeared from their homeland and the survivors were waging a desperate guerrilla war with colonial British, living a fringe existence in Launceston or living life on the margin at the peripheries of their traditional land.
By 1837 the Letteremairrenner had disappeared completely from the Tamar Valley and would eventually die in the squalor of Wybalenna or Oyster Cove.

=====The Panninher "Pennyroyal Creek" Clan=====
The Panninher (parn-in-her)were known to colonial people as the Penny Royal Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the river that comes off the Western Tiers south of Drys Bluff (which is now called the [[Liffey River, Tasmania|Liffey River]]). The Panninher named the Liffey river ''tellerpanger'' and Drys Bluff, the mountain rearing above their homeland, was ''taytitkekitheker''. Their territory broadly covered the north plains of the midlands from the west bank of the Tamar River across to what is now Evandale and terminating at the Tyerrernotepanner country around modern day Conara.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}

The Panninher also freely moved from the Tamar to the central highlands and brokered trade in ochre from the Toolumbunner mine to neighbouring clans.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}
Robinson describes the aboriginal road used by the Panninher from their home up to the Central Highlands, via the gully of the Liffey river, and the South road along the base of the Western Tiers - up the Lake River to modern day Interlaken.

======Significant sites======
Whilst sites of ritual significance to the Panninher are not known, the Panninher were known to frequent Native Point, on the [[South Esk River]] between modern day [[Perth, Tasmania|Perth]] and [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]], where flint quarries were located and clans met for celebration.{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Here local historians believe that cemetery (hollowed) trees were used to inter the dead.{{sfn|Haygarth|2013|pp=4–5}}
Similarly, Reibey's Ford, near modern-day [[Hadspen]], was a known "resort of the natives" and they named this site ''moorronnoe''.{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}} Archaeological evidence shows also indicates signs of continuous occupation at permanent lagoons near Cleveland,{{sfn|Kee|1990}} which was known historically as a clan meeting place.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Stancombe|1968}}

The Panninher were affected early by settlement around Norfolk Plains and aggressive assertion of property rights by settlers at first hindered their hunting and migration through their country and, subsequently, led to outright hostility from both parties. Captain Ritchie, an early settler near Perth, tolerated, or fostered, forays by his assigned men against the Panninher and this culminated in a massacre by settlers near modern-day Cressy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}
The Panninher, or their neighbouring clansmen, retaliated in various attacks against settlers at Western Lagoon and in remote country up the Lake River, reaching a peak in aggression against the colonial interlopers by 1827.{{sfn|Clements|2014}}
In 1831 a war party of "100 or 150 stout men" attacked settlers at the base of the Western Tiers and up the Lake River{{sfn|Clements|2014}} but it is unclear whether this was the action of the Panninher alone or a confederation of warriors from remnant North Tasmanian nations. The colonial settlers made little discrimination between Panninher and members of the "Stony Creek Tribe" and it is likely that the North Midlands nation had disintegrated and the amalgamated band was known under the overarching name of "Stony Creek Tribe" by this time. This notwithstanding, it seems that the Panninher were resourceful enough to survive in some numbers until late in the Black War.

=====The Tyerrernotepanner "Stony Creek" clan=====
The Tyerrernotepanner (Chera-noti-pana) were known to colonial people as the Stony Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the small southern tributary of the South Esk at Llewellyn, west of modern-day Avoca.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}

The clan Tyerrernotepanner were centred at [[Campbell Town, Tasmania|Campbell Town]] and were one of up to four clans in the south central Midlands area.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}}
Nevertheless, this clan name is now used as a general term for all aboriginal peoples of this region. The ethnographic and archaeological evidence describes areas of significance to the south central Midlands clans: modern day Lake Leake, Tooms Lake, Windfalls farm, Mt Morriston, Ross township{{sfn|Casella|2002|p=30}} and the lacustrine regions of the midlands all show evidence of tool knapping, middens and records of hut construction consistent with occupation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}

===== Significant sites =====
Lake Leake (previously Kearney's Bogs), Campbell Town, Ellinthorpe Plains (near modern day Auburn) and Tooms Lake were described as "resorts of the natives" by settlers and showed substantial evidence of seasonal occupation.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}} Furthermore, several small lagoons in the midlands area all show substantial archeological evidence of regular occupation consistent with tool-making and semi-nomadic use. Aboriginal roads, ''markenner'', are described as passing up the Eastern Tiers to Swanport, up the Western Tier to Interlaken and up the Lake River to Woods Lake and thence to the Central Highlands.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}

The clan divisions of the southern central Midlands are suggested below. Caution must be exercised as to the provenance of the names and the complete accuracy of attributing discrete geographical regions.
* ''tyrrernotepanner'': clan at Northern Campbell Town/Lake river/ South Fingal Valley
* ''marwemairer'': clan at Ross/Mt Morriston region
* ''peenrymairmener'': clan at Glen Morriston/Lake Leake
* ''rolemairre'': clan at Tunbridge area{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=23, 24}}

The Tyerrernotepanner are described consistently in contemporary records as a "fierce tribe" and the records describe consistent and concerted violence by the Tyerrernotepanner during the Black War. The Tyeerrernotepanner, along with clansmen from other remnant tribes, conducted raids across the midlands during the Black War and, until "conciliated" by Robinson, were the subject of fearful reminiscence by colonial people.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}
The famed aboriginal leader Umarrah was a member of this clan and he was noted for his aggression and sustained campaign against European interlopers - although he was raised by colonials himself.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}

===Ben Lomond===
The Ben Lomond nation consisted of at least three clans totalling 150–200 people. They occupied the 260 km2 of country surrounding the [[Ben Lomond (Tasmania)|Ben Lomond]] plateau. Three clan names are known but their locations are somewhat conjectural - the clans were recorded as Plangermaireener, Plindermairhemener and Tonenerweenerlarmenne.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}

The Plangermaireener clan is recorded as variously inhabiting the south-east aspect of the Ben Lomond region and also has been associated with the Oyster Bay or Cape Portland Clans to the east - indeed the chief [[Mannalargenna]] is variously described as a chief of the Oyster Bay, Cape Portland and Ben Lomond nations.{{sfn|Mannalargenna}}{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=20}}
Plangermaireener is also used as a blanket term for the Ben Lomond nation, which reflects the suffix "mairreener"; meaning "people".{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=13}}

The Plindermairhemener are recorded in association with the south and south-western aspects of the region{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=20}}{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|p=125}} and the location of the Tonenerweenerlarmenne is uncertain, but were probably centred in the remaining Ben Lomond nation territory from White Hills to the headwaters of the North and South-Esk rivers or the upper South-Esk Valley.{{sfn|Syme|Ball|Elder|2012}}
This notwithstanding, the Palawa were a nomadic people and likely occupied these lands seasonally.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}

The Ben Lomond nation is sometimes described as the Ben Lomond/Pennyroyal Creek nation from an entry in [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]]'s journal:
'(Mannalargenna) ... said that "the smoke...was that of the Ben Lomond-Pennyroyal Creek natives"'{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=315}}

This is a misnomer, as the Pennyroyal Creek was the original European name for the [[Liffey River (Tasmania)|Liffey River]] and the Pennyroyal Creek Tribe was the contemporary name of the Panninher Clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=31}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1011}}
Mannalargenna would be familiar with the clans neighbouring his own traditional country and could be relied upon to report accurately the composition of the clanspeople in question. It is plausible that when Robinson was writing in 1830 the remnant peoples of the Ben Lomond nation had federated with that of the Panninher and this was the provenance of the conjoined title.

====Seasonal movement====
The clans of the Ben Lomond nation were nomadic and the Aborigines hunted along the valleys of the [[South Esk River|South Esk]] and [[North Esk River|North Esk]] rivers, their tributaries and the highlands to the northeast; as well as making forays to the plateau in summer. There are records of aboriginal huts or dwellings around the foothills of [[Stacks Bluff]] and around the headwaters of the South Esk River near modern-day Mathinna.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} On the plateau there is evidence of artifacts around Lake Youl that suggests regular occupation of this site by aborigines after the last ice age.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} The clans of the Ben Lomond nation had close enough relationships with neighbouring clans of the East Coast and North Midlands that they enjoyed seasonal foraging rights to these adjoining territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}} [[John Batman]] describes the seasonal movement of the Plangermaireener in his diary of May 1830:

===North West===
The North West nation numbered between 400 and 600 people at time of contact with Europeans and had at least eight clans.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10–11}} They had good relations with the North nation, who were allowed access to the resources of the north-west coast. First explored by Europeans in 1824, the region was considered inhospitable and only lightly settled, although it suffered a high rate of Aboriginal dispossession and killings.

===South East===
Risdon Cove, the first Tasmanian settlement, was located in south-east country. There is eyewitness evidence that the South East nation may have consisted of up to ten clans, totalling around 500 people. However, only four groups totalling 160–200 people were officially recorded as the main source by Robinson, whose journals begin in 1829. By this time, Europeans had settled in most of the South East tribe's country, with the country dispossessed and food resources depleted. Their country contained the most important [[silcrete]], [[chert]] and [[quartzite]] mines in Tasmania.{{sfn|Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Survey|2001}}
The South East people had a hostile relationship with the Oyster Bay people whom they frequently raided, often to kidnap women.{{sfn|Refshauge|1804}}
[[Trugernanner|Truganini]] was a Nuenonne from [[Bruny Island]], which they called ''Lunawanna-Alonnah''. The first two European towns built on the island were named Lunawanna and Alonnah, and most of the island's landmarks are named after Nuenonne people. The island was the source of the [[sandstone]] used to build many of [[Melbourne]]'s buildings, such as the Post Office and Parliament House.&lt;ref&gt;''Tasmania''. Regional Guide Series.

==Tasmanian Aboriginal culture==
Tasmanian aboriginal culture is one of the world's most enduring. Aboriginal culture was disrupted severely in the 19th century after dispossession of land and incarceration of aboriginal people on Wybalenna and Oyster Cove. Much traditional knowledge has irrevocably disappeared and what remains has been nurtured over several generations starting with the aboriginal wives of sealers on the Furneaux Islands.

But, as the aboriginal writer Greg Lehman states, "aboriginal culture (is not) past tense." Aboriginal people, in a variety of forms, continue to express their culture in unique ways - expressing themes that lament the past but also celebrate endurance and continuity of culture into the future.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006}}

===Pre-colonial contact===
Contemporary accounts of the ceremonial and cultural life of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people are very limited. There were no observers trained in the social sciences after the French expeditions in the 18th century had made formal study of Tasmanian Aboriginal culture. Moreover, those who wrote most comprehensively of aboriginal life in the 19th century did so after colonial contact, and the ensuing violence and dislocation, had irrevocably altered traditional aboriginal culture. Those that most closely observed aboriginal cultural practices either did not write accounts of what they observed or, if they did, observed culture through the ethnocentric lens of religious and proselytising 19th century European men.

==== Mythology ====
The mythology of the Aboriginal Tasmanians appears to be complex and possibly specific to each clan group. One of their creation myths refers to two creator deities, Moinee and Droemerdene; the children of Parnuen, the sun, and Vena, the moon.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53–90}}
&lt;br /&gt;{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=436}}
Moinee appears as the primeval creator, forming the land and rivers of Tasmania and fashioning the first man, Parlevar - embodied from a spirit residing in the ground. This form was similar to a kangaroo and Aboriginal people consequently take the kangaroo as a totem.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}} Similarly, Moinee then created the kangaroo, who emerged, like the first man, from the soil.

Droemerdene appears as the star Canopus who helped the first men to change from their kangaroo-like form. He removed their tails and fashioned their knee joints "so that they could rest" and thus man achieved differentiation form the kangaroo.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}

Moinee fought with his brother Droemerdene, and many "devils", after Droemerdene changed the shape of the first men and Moinee was finally hurled to his death from the sky to take form as a standing stone at Cox Bight. Droemerdene subsequently fell into the sea at Louisa Bay.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53–90}}
Toogee Low (Port Davey) remained in mythology as a residence of many "devils".

Alternatively, Tasmanian Aboriginal mythology also records in their oral history that the first men emigrated by land from a far off country and the land was subsequently flooded - an echo of the Tasmanian people's migration from mainland Australia to (then) peninsular Tasmania, and the submergence of the land bridge after the last ice age.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=514}}

==== Spirituality ====
Little has been recorded of traditional Tasmanian Aboriginal spiritual life. Colonial British recorded that Aboriginal people describe topographical features, such as valleys and caves, as being inhabited by spiritual entities recorded by contemporaries as "sprites". Furthermore, Robinson recorded members of some clans as having animistic regard for certain species of tree within their domain.
Robinson recorded several discussions regarding spiritual entities that his companions describe as having agency or a source of interpretive power to aid their navigation of their physical world. The Tasmanian Aboriginal people would describe these entities as "devils" and related that these spiritual beings as walking alongside aboriginal people "carrying a torch but could not be seen".{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}

Mannarlargenna, in particular, described consulting his "devil" which seems to be a resident personal spirituality that provided prognostic or oracular powers.
The "devil" might also be used to describe malevolent spiritual entities in the Aboriginal cosmos.

Aboriginal people recounted that there was a prime malevolent spirit called ''rageowrapper'', who appeared as a large black (Aboriginal?) man and is associated with the darkness. ''rageowrapper'' might appear borne on a strong wind or be the source of severe illness{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=52}}
this malign spirit might be released from a sick individual by cutting the skin to "let him out".{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=319}}

Several researchers assert that there was belief in a kind of manichean cosmos with a "good" and "bad" spirit - delineated by day and night - although this may reflect the cultural bias of the observers. Milligan (a contemporary at Wyballenna) described a creator spirit called ''tiggana marrabona'' - translating as "twilight man" but as referred to above there are a number of supernatural beings associated with creation.{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1–16}}

Etymological study of Milligan's ethnographic data describes a pantheon of spiritual beings associated with environmental or supernatural phenomena:

* ''nama burag''                   - or "the ghost of the thunderstorm"
* ''ragi roba''                        - (see rageowrapper) the "revered spirit" - frequently connoted to awesome/revered/dreaded and a signifier of ghosts/phantoms of the departed when connected with signifier ''ragi''{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=7}}
* ''laga robana''                    - "awful spirit of the dead" i.e. the dead man, some kind of dreaded spirit, malevolent phantom{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=8}}
* ''maian ginja''                     - "the killer" - translates also to fiend/demon: bringer of death{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=9}}
* ''muran bugana luwana''    - "the bright spirit of the night" - a kind of benign or ebullient entity, often described of female form "clothed in grass"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=10}}
* ''wara wana''                      - "the spirit being" - also ''warrawah'' translates to transcendental/ethereal/spirit of dead associated with celestial bodies- may be malevolent{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=11}}
* ''badenala''                        - "shadow man" - ghost or spirit{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1–16}}
* ''kana tana''                       - "the bone man" - Western Nation language term for spirit of the dead{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}
* ''nangina''                          - "shadow/ghost" - contemporary association with "fairy" or "elf" - a supernatural entity dwelling "in the hill - dancing (and) fond of children"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}
* ''buga nubrana''                 - "the man's eye" - associated with the sun - possibly a benign entity{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=15}}

Traditional Aboriginal Tasmanians also related beliefs of a spiritual afterlife. One such belief, related by an aboriginal person from the west coastal nation, was that the spirit of the dead travelled to a place over the sea: to the far north-west, called ''Moo-ai''. This possibly reflects the ancestral memory of the ''Mara'' language group, resident in Western Tasmania, who are believed to have settled Tasmania from the Warrnambool region in modern day Victoria.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=498}}
but other Tasmanians state that after death their spirits would have a post-corporeal existence in their traditional lands.{{sfn|Plomley|1991}}{{sfn|Roe}} &lt;br /&gt; Other reference is made to an Island of the Dead ''tini drini'', described as "an island in Bass Strait" where the dead would be reincarnated or "jump up white men". White here does not refer to european, but rather the skeletal or phantasmic nature of returned dead.{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=12}}

==== Funeral customs ====
The dead might be cremated or interred in a hollow tree or rock grave, dependant on clan custom{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=540}}
Aboriginal people were also recorded to keep bones of dead people as talismans or amulets. The bones might be worn on a kangaroo sinew string bare around the neck or enclosed in a kangaroo skin bag.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=70}}

==== Cosmology ====
Traditional Tasmanian Aboriginals saw the night sky as residence of creator spirits (see above) and also describe constellations that represent tribal life; such as figures of fighting men and courting couples.{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}

=== Material culture ===
==== Use of fire ====
The Tasmanian Aboriginal people preferred to store coals in wrapped bark for the purpose of starting fires.  This was likely due to the difficulty in creating fire in Tasmania's wet maritime climate. When this source of flame was extinguished they would seek to gain fire from neighbouring hearths or clans but also were likely to have created fire by friction methods{{sfn|Cotton|1887}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Gott|2002|pp=650–656}}{{sfn|Breen|1992|pp=40–43}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}} and possibly by mineral percussion{{sfn|Volger|1973|pp=58–63}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}}
The Tasmanian Aboriginals extensively employed fire for cooking, warmth, tool hardening and clearing vegetation to encourage and control macropod herds.{{sfn|Gammage|2008|pp=241–254}}

==== Hunting and diet ====
Approximately 4,000 years ago, the Aboriginal Tasmanians largely dropped scaled fish from their diet, and began eating more land mammals, such as [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], [[kangaroos]], and [[Wallaby|wallabies]]. Aboriginal Tasmanians had employed bone tools, but it appears that they switched from worked [[bone tools]] to sharpened [[stone tools]],{{sfn|Ryan|1996}} as the effort to make bone tools began to exceed the benefit they provided.{{sfn|Manne|2003}} The significance of the disappearance of bone tools (believed to have been primarily used for fishing related activities) and fish in the diet is heavily debated. Some argue that it is evidence of a [[maladaptation|maladaptive]] society, while others argue that the change was economic, as large areas of scrub at that time were changing to grassland, providing substantially increased food resources. Fish were never a large part of the diet, ranking behind shellfish and seals, and with more resources available, the [[Labor theory of value|cost/benefit ratio]] of fishing may have become too high.{{sfn|Manne|2003}}
Archaeological evidence indicates that around the time these changes took place, the Tasmanian people began expanding their territories, a process that was still continuing when Europeans arrived.{{sfn|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2002}}

==== Basket making ====
Basket making is a traditional craft which has been carried through into contemporary art. Baskets had many uses, including carrying food, women's and men's tools, shells, ochre, and eating utensils. Basket-like carriers were made from plant materials, kelp, or animal skin. The kelp baskets or carriers were used mainly to carry water and as drinking vessels.

Plants were carefully selected to produce strong, thin, narrow strips of fibre of suitable length for basket making.

Several different species of plant were used, including white flag iris, blue flax lily, rush and sag, some of which are still used by contemporary basket makers, and sometimes shells are added for ornamental expression.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}

====Tasmanian Aboriginal shell necklace art====
Making necklaces from shells is a significant cultural tradition among Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}
Necklaces were used for adornment, as gifts and tokens of honour, and as trading objects. Dating back at least 2,600 years, necklace-making is one of the few Palawa traditions that has remained intact and has continued without interruption since before European settlement.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}
A number of shell necklaces are held in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}

==== Ochre ====
Ochre is an important cultural resource for the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. Traditionally, Aboriginal women had the exclusive role of obtaining ochre. Today, many Tasmanian Aboriginal men continue to respect the traditional cultural custom by obtaining ochre from women only.

Tasmanian ochre ranges in colour from white through yellow to red. It has many uses, including ceremonial body marking, colouring wood craft products, tie-dyeing and various other uses in crafts and arts. Tasmanian Aborigines consider ochre to be a special cultural resource.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}

Traditionally, Aboriginal people have sourced ochre from sites throughout Tasmania. The most celebrated site is Toolumbunner in the Gog Range in NW Tasmania. This site lies in the traditional lands of the Pallitorre Clan and was a significant site of ochre mining, tribal meeting, celebration and trading.{{sfn|Sagona|1994}}

==== Ceremony ====
Colonial settlers describe various ceremonies enacted by aboriginal people. Tasmanians would gather for ceremony that contemporaries called "corobery", although that is a mainland aboriginal word. Dance and singing was a feature of these ceremonies and dance would encompass reenactment of traditional tales and also recent events.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=706}}
Robinson describes reenactment of a horseman hunting an aboriginal person via the display of the "horse-dance" as well as the sensual "devil-dance" performed by women form the Furneaux islands{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=579}}

Battle and funeral was also the time for painting the body with ochre or black paint. The important ceremonial meaning of painting the body can be inferred by record of discussion at the funeral for the Aboriginal man "Robert", in Launceston, where an Aboriginal mourner was asked by a settler why he painted his body for the funeral and he replied "what do you wear fine clothes for?"{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=626}}

==== Visual art ====
Contemporary colonial settlers relate several examples of pictorial art drawn on the insides of huts or on remnants of discarded paper. These designs are generally circular or spiral motifs that represent celestial bodies or figures of clans-people. Robinson related that one design in an aboriginal hut was very accurately drawn and was created via the use of a kind of wooden compass.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=575}}

The most enduring art form left by Tasmanians are petroglyphs, or rock art. The most elaborate site is at Premighana on the West Coast, although other significant sites exist at the Bluff in Devonport and at Greenes Creek. Smaller sites include the cupules at ''meenamatta'' Blue Tier and isolated circle motifs at Trial Harbour.{{sfn|Bednarick|2007|pp=161–170}}

Aboriginal people inhabited Tasmania's South-west from the last glacial maximum and hand stencils and ochre smears are found in several caves, the oldest of which is dated to 10000 years ago.{{sfn|Jones|1995}}
{{pp-semi|small=yes}}

=== Modern Tasmanian Aboriginal culture ===
==== Visual art ====
Tasmanian Aboriginal people are asserting their identity and culture through the visual arts. The art expresses the Aboriginal viewpoint on colonial history, race relations and identity. Themes consistent in modern Tasmanian Aboriginal art are loss, kinship, narratives of dispossession but also survival. The art is modern, using textiles, sculpture and photography but often incorporates ancient motifs and techniques such as shell necklaces and practical artifacts.{{sfn|Humphries|2015}}{{sfn|Gough}}
&lt;br /&gt;
Photographer Ricky Maynard has had his work exhibited internationally and his documentary style "brings to light the stories of indigenous people where they have previously been absent or distorted. His photographs mark historical sites, events and figures of great significance to Tasmanian and mainland Aboriginal people, and speak to their struggle in a subtle, poetic, and powerful way."{{sfn|Ricky Maynard}}
&lt;br /&gt;
Modern painting in Tasmania is starting to use techniques shared by indigenous art in mainland Australia but incorporating traditional Tasmanian motifs, such as spirals and celestial representation.{{sfn|Rosalind Langford - Connecting Spirits}}
This shows that, like mainland Australia, indigenous art is dynamic and evolving from established post-colonial preconceptions.

Tasmanian Aboriginal women have traditionally collected ''Maireener'' shells to fashion necklaces and bracelets.
This practice continues by Aboriginal women whose families survived on the Furneaux Islands, handed down by elder women to maintain an important link with traditional lifestyle.
Late in the nineteenth century a number of women aimed to keep this part of their traditional culture alive in order to allow their daughters and granddaughters to participate in their cultural heritage. Today, there are only a few Tasmanian Aboriginal women who maintain this art, but they continue to hand down their knowledge and skills to younger women in their community. Shell necklace manufacture continues to maintain links with the past but is expressed as a modern art form.{{sfn|Tasmanian aboriginal art}}

==== Writing ====
The earliest publication attributed to Tasmanian authors, predating the journalism of [[David Unaipon]] by a century, was ''The Aboriginal/Flinders Island Chronicle'', written between September 1836 and December 1837, though it is unclear to what degree its composition was influenced by "The Commandant", George Robinson.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=9}}

Tasmanian Aboriginal authors in the past century have written history, poetry, essays and fiction. Authors such as Ida West{{sfn|West|1987}} have written autobiographies recounting their experiences growing up within white society; Phyllis Pitchford, Errol West{{efn"In the 1970s a young Tasmanian Aborigine, Errol West, wrote a beautiful poem, ''The Moon Birds of Big Dog Island'', about the great gaping absence that was being a Tasmanian Aborigine."{{sfn|Flanagan|2002}}}} and Jim Everett have written poetry, while Everett and Greg Lehman have explored their tradition as essayists.{{sfn|Thornley|2010|p=259}}{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}

==Legislated definition==
In June 2005, the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] introduced an innovated definition of aboriginality into the Aboriginal Lands Act.{{sfn|Tasmanian Legislation – Aboriginal Lands Act 199}}
The bill was passed to allow Aboriginal Lands Council elections to commence, after uncertainty over who was "aboriginal", and thus eligible to vote.

Under the bill, a person can claim "Tasmanian Aboriginality" if they meet the following criteria:
* Ancestry
* Self-identification
* Community recognition

==Government compensation for "Stolen Generations"==
On 13 August 1997 a Statement of Apology (specific to removal of children) was issued – which was unanimously supported by the Tasmanian Parliament – the wording of the sentence was

{{quote|That this house, on behalf of all Tasmanian(s)... expresses its deep and sincere regret at the hurt and distress caused by past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and homes; apologises to the Aboriginal people for those past actions and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians.}}

There are many people currently working in the community, academia, various levels of government and NGOs to strengthen what has been termed as the Tasmanian Aboriginal culture and the conditions of those who identify as members of the descendant community.

In November 2006 Tasmania became the first Australian state or territory to offer financial compensation for the [[Stolen Generations]], Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families by Australian government agencies and church missions between about 1900 and 1972. Up to 40 Aboriginal Tasmanians' descendants are expected to be eligible for compensation from the $5&amp;nbsp;million package.{{sfn|Lennon}}

==Notable Aboriginal Tasmanians==
* [[Tunnerminnerwait]]
* [[Trugernanner]] (Truganini) and [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]], who both claimed to be the last "full blooded" Palawa.
* [[William Lanne]] or "King Billy"
* [[Michael Mansell]], lawyer and activist

The '''Asinara donkey''', {{lang-it|'''Asino dell'Asinara'''|italic=no}} ({{IPA-it|ˈaːzino dellaziˈnaːra}}), is a [[list of donkey breeds|breed]] of [[feral]] [[donkey]] indigenous to the island of [[Asinara]], which lies off the north-west coast of [[Sardinia]], Italy, in the [[province of Sassari]].&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; Most of the population is wholly or partly [[albinism|albinistic]]; the small number of grey donkeys on the island are also considered part of the population, and are probably [[heterozygous]] carriers of the albino gene.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; The Asinara donkey is one of the eight autochthonous donkey breeds of limited distribution recognised by the [[Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali]], the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.&lt;ref name=aia/&gt; It is called ''{{lang|sc|ainu}}'', ''{{lang|sc|borricu}}'' or ''{{lang|sc|molenti}}'' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

There are approximately 120 individuals on the island. Others are in the natural reserve of [[Porto Conte]] in [[Alghero]] and at the Istituto di Incremento Ippico at [[Burgos, Sardinia|Foresta Burgos]], and a few are raised in [[Tuscany]] and in [[Emilia Romagna]].&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

==History==
The Asinara donkey probably derives from a chance mutation in the population of [[Sardinian donkey]]s abandoned on the island by the inhabitants when they were forcibly evacuated from it following the law of 28 June 1885, under which Asinara was to be transformed into a [[lazaret]] and [[penal colony]]. It is also possible that the breed descends from white donkeys imported from Egypt in the 19th century by the Duca dell'Asinara.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

Scouting was officially founded in 1984. The association has 10,592 members (as of 2008).&lt;ref name="WOSM-TR_05-08"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triennial Report 2005-2008 |url=http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909204757/http://scout.org/en/content/download/11615/94838/file/Triennial_Report_EN.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">The '''Bača subdialect''' (''baški govor''&lt;ref&gt;Smole, Vera. 1998. "Slovenska narečja." ''Enciklopedija Slovenije'' vol. 12, pp. 1–5. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Slovene dialects|Slovene subdialect]] of the [[Tolmin dialect]] in the [[Rovte dialect group]]. It is spoken around [[Podbrdo, Tolmin|Podbrdo]] in the triangular area bounded by [[Bača pri Podbrdu]], [[Porezen, Tolmin|Porezen]], and [[Mount Rodica]] (1966 m).&lt;ref&gt;Toporišič, Jože. 1992. ''Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika''. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==
The Bača subdialect is a transitional dialect between the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group]] and the [[Rovte dialect group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welcome-to-slovenia.com/content?ContentID=123 Rovtarska narečja {{sl icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of the Tolmin dialect, it is generally characterized by [[akanye]], but the local dialect of the village of [[Rut, Tolmin|Rut]] lacks this feature. The dialectologist Tine Logar has suggested that this may be due to the influence of German colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Logar, Tine. 1968. "Glasovne in morfološke posebnosti v govorici sloveniziranih nemcev." ''Slavistična revija'' 16: 159–168, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reindl, Donald F. 2008. ''Language Contact: German and Slovenian''. Bochum: Brockmeyer, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Another special feature of Rut, together with the villages of [[Stržišče, Tolmin|Stržišče]] and Podbrdo, is the merger of alveolar and palatal fricatives into alveolo-palatals: ''s/š'' &gt; /ɕ/, ''z/ž'' &gt; /ʑ/, a phenomenon known in Slovene as ''slekanje''.&lt;ref&gt;Logar, Tine. 1993. ''Slovenska narečja.'' Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reindl, Donald F. 2008. ''Language Contact: German and Slovenian''. Bochum: Brockmeyer, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; This phonological development has also been attributed to German influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramovš, Fran. 1935. ''Historična gramatika slovenskega jezika. VII. Dialekti.'' Ljubljana: Učiteljska tiskarna, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logar, Tine. 1968. "Glasovne in morfološke posebnosti v govorici sloveniziranih nemcev." ''Slavistična revija'' 16: 159–168, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Briconet Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Briconet}}), also known as '''Marsaskala Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott ta' Marsaskala}}) or the '''Vendôme Entrenchment''' ({{lang-mt|It-Trunċiera ta' Vandomu}}), is a [[redoubt]] in [[Marsaskala]], [[Malta]]. It was built in 1715 by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. Until recently, the redoubt was used as a police station.

==History==
Briconet Redoubt was built in 1715 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries and redoubts in Malta. It formed part of the defences of Marsaskala Bay, which also included the large [[Saint Thomas Tower|St. Thomas Tower and Battery]] and the now-demolished [[Żonqor Tower]].&lt;ref name="guillaumier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillaumier|first=Alfie|date=2005|title=Bliet u Rħula Maltin – Volume 2|language=Maltese|publisher=Klabb Kotba Maltin|isbn=9993239402|pages=154–155, 955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Briconet_Redoubt.jpeg|thumb|left|The redoubt viewed from the rear]]

Briconet Redoubt's structure is typical of most other coastal redoubts built in Malta. It consists of a pentagonal platform having short flanks, and a rectangular [[blockhouse]] sealing off the gorge. Unlike other redoubts, the gorge and flanks have high boundary walls pierced by musketry loopholes. These were built to defend the redoubt from a landward attack, since it is overlooked by high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsascala police station|url=http://anecdotesfrommalta.blogspot.com/2009/05/marsascala-police-station.html|website=anecdotesfrommalta.blogspot.com|date=12 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620191553/http://anecdotesfrommalta.blogspot.com.mt/2009/05/marsascala-police-station.html|archivedate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the redoubt cost 768 scudi. These were paid by the knight Giovanni Battista Briconet, and the redoubt was named in his honour. The redoubt was initially garrisoned by militia from [[Żejtun]],&lt;ref name="lc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortifications|url=http://marsaskala.lc.com.mt/fortifications/|website=Marsaskala Local Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316102719/http://marsaskala.lc.com.mt/fortifications/|archivedate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was armed with two cannons.&lt;ref name="guillaumier"/&gt;

==Present day==
[[File:Briconet Redoubt and modern building.jpeg|thumb|right|View of the redoubt with one of the modern structures visible]]

Today, Briconet Redoubt is still intact and in good condition, being one of the best preserved redoubts in Malta.&lt;ref name="lc"/&gt; A few modern modifications have been made, such as the opening of a small doorway on one of its faces to enable access from the modern road. The redoubt is surrounded by modern buildings, including Marsaskala's parish church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsaskala|url=http://www.mydestination.com/malta/sights/138452/marsaskala|website=mydestination.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620191535/http://www.mydestinationmalta.com/sights/marsaskala|archivedate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have completely blocked its relation with the sea.

Until the early 21st century, Briconet Redoubt was used as the Marsaskala Police Station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chetcui|first1=Joe|title=The Malta Independent Online|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-10-29/letters/the-malta-independent-online-164341/|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=29 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110355/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-10-29/letters/the-malta-independent-online-164341/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; until this was moved to an irregular structure in a garden next to the church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/qrati_u_pulizija/40042/marsascala_tispia_mingajr_gassa_talpulizija#.W1JN7hrRahA&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the redoubt is a Grade 1 national monument and it is also listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsacala Redoubt|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1424.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629144904/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1424.pdf|archivedate=29 June 2015|date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Burkina Faso]]''' contains a shield based on the   national flag. Above the shield the name of the country is shown, while below it is the national motto, ''Unité, Progrès, Justice'' ([[French language|French]] for "Unity, Progress, Justice").  The supporters are two white stallions. The two plants emerging from the lower banner appear to represent [[pearl millet]], an important cereal grain cultivated in this country where agriculture represents 32% of the gross domestic product. This coat of arms is similar to the old [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] coat of arms (see below), with the Burkina Faso flag replacing the Upper Volta flag in the middle.

==Historic emblem (1984–1997)==
[[File:Coat of arms of Burkina Faso 1984-1991.svg|left|thumb|Emblem 1984–1997]]
[[Thomas Sankara]]'s 1983–1987 Burkinabé revolution implemented an emblem featuring a crossed [[mattock]] and [[AK-47]] (an allusion to the [[Hammer and Sickle]]), with the motto ''La Patrie ou la Mort, nous vaincrons'' ("Fatherland or death, we shall overcome"').

==Coat of arms of Upper Volta==
[[File:Coat of arms of Upper Volta.svg|left|thumb|Coat of arms of Upper Volta]]
This somewhat resembles the current emblem, except that the enclosing shield has a blue background, the inescutcheon is based on the flag of Upper Volta with the superimposed letters "RHV" (for ''République de Haute-Volta''), and the motto was ''Unité, Travail, Justice'' ("Unity, Labour, Justice").&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horne''' (also ''Horn'', ''Hoorn'' or ''Hoorne'') is a small historic [[county]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the present day [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. It takes its name from the village [[Horn (Netherlands)|Horn]], west of [[Roermond]]. The residence of the counts of Horne was moved from Horn to [[Weert]] in the 15th century.

After the execution in 1568 of [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn|Philip de Montmorency]] who died without male heirs, the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Prince-Bishop of Liège]], as suzerain of Horne, was declared the direct lord and new count. The bishops ruled the county in personal union. Horne maintained its own laws and customs as well as its financial autonomy. The county included the communes of Neer, Nunhem, Haelen, Buggenum, Roggel, Heythuysen, Horne, Beegden, Geystingen and Ophoven.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin de la Commission centrale de statistique, Brussels, 1857, vol. 7, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suppressed in 1795, when it was [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1795|occupied by the French]], and it became part of the French département [[Meuse-Inférieure]].

Many of the 989 polling booths used [[marbles]], which were inserted into candidate drums instead of ballot papers due to the high [[illiteracy]] rate.

'''Intelsat 504''', previously named '''Intelsat V F-4''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1982, it was the fourth of fifteen [[Intelsat V]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[Spacebus|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]].

Intelsat V F-4 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network. The satellite was deactivated on November 1995.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on March 5, 1982, at 00:23 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida, United States. It had a launch mass of 1,928&amp;nbsp;kg. The Intelsat 504 was equipped with 4 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 21 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 12,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

[[Image:Chitenge-baby-sling.jpg|thumb|Woman carrying a baby on her back using a kitenge.]]
''For the surname, see [[Kitenge (surname)]].''

'''Kitenge''' or '''chitenge''' is an [[East Africa]]n, West African and Central African fabric similar to [[sarong]], often worn by women and wrapped around the chest or waist, over the head as a [[headscarf]], or as a [[baby sling]]. Kitenges are colourful pieces of fabric. In the Coastal area of Kenya, and in Tanzania, Kitenges often have Swahili sayings written on them.

Kitenges are similar to [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]]s and kikoy, but are of a thicker cloth and have an edging on only a long side. [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Sudan]], Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Liberia, Rwanda, and  Democratic Republic of the Congo are some of the African countries where kitenge is worn.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In [[Malawi]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]], kitenge is known as ''Chitenge''. They are sometimes worn by men around the waist in hot weather. In some countries like Malawi, Chitenges never used to be worn by men until recently when the president encouraged civil servants to buy Malawian products by wearing Chitenje on Fridays.

Kitenges (plural ''vitenge'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]; ''zitenge'' in [[Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe|Tonga]]) serve as an inexpensive, informal piece of clothing that is often decorated with a huge variety of colors, patterns and even political [[slogan]]s.

The printing on the cloth is done by a traditional [[batik]] technique. These are known as wax prints and the design is equally as bright and detailed on the obverse side of the fabric. These days Wax prints are commercially made and are almost completely roller printed.  Fancy prints are roller printed with the designs being less colorful or detailed on the obverse side. Many of the designs have a meaning. A large variety of religious and political designs are found as well as traditional tribal patterns. The cloth is used as material for dresses, blouses and pants as well.

==Uses ==
Chitenges can be used on occasions and in many ways either symbolically or for practical reasons. Chitenges are used in different settings to convey messages. The following list demonstrates uses of the cloths.

*In Malawi, Chitenjes are customary for women at funerals.
*They are used as a sling to hold a baby across the back of a mother. They can hold the baby at the front as well, particularly when breast feeding.
*Chitenges are given as gifts to young women. 
*They are sometimes tied together and used as decorative pieces at dinner tables.
*When women go to the beach, often the Chitenge is wrapped around the bathing suit for modesty or to shield cold air.
*Chitenges can be framed or otherwise hung up on the wall as a decorative batik artwork.

Kitenges have also become very popular as fashion statements in urban pop culture with youth in Africa. Kitenges are incorporated in clothing items such as hoodies, trousers, and accessories such as bags.

[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] '''Sir Malcolm Campbell''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (11 March 1885 – 31 December 1948) was a British racing motorist and motoring journalist. He gained the world speed record on [[Land Speed Record|land]] and on [[Water speed record|water]] at various times during the 1920s and 1930s using [[List of Bluebird record-breaking vehicles|vehicles called ''Blue Bird'']], including a [[Grand Prix Sunbeams 1921, 1922 TT|1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam]]. His son, [[Donald Campbell]], carried on the family tradition by holding both land speed and water speed records.

==Early life and family==
Campbell was born in [[Chislehurst]], Kent on 11 March 1885,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=mVDUbCN19RY3B20K%2Fa%2BD4A&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only son of William Campbell, a [[Hatton Garden]] diamond seller. He attended the independent [[Uppingham School]]. In Germany, learning the diamond trade, he gained an interest in motorbikes and races. Returning to Britain, he worked for two years at [[Lloyd's of London]] for no pay, then for another year at £1 a week.

Between 1906 and 1908, he won all three London to Lakes End Trials motorcycle races. In 1910 he began racing cars at [[Brooklands]]. He christened his car ''Blue Bird'', painting it blue, after seeing the play ''[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]]'' by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. Campbell married Marjorie Dagmar Knott in 1913 but divorced two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=87AdayIVHdUD18gEazu3VA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell then married Dorothy Evelyn Whittall in 1920 and their son [[Donald Campbell|Donald]] was born in 1921, and their daughter, Jean, in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=vUWl8pj5KuIh25pbvLEeLw&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1940. Campbell married Betty Nicory in 1945 in Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=%2FSqLT2LzjwZCQJ%2Fk%2BjABlA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] Campbell initially enlisted as a motorcycle dispatch rider and fought at the [[Battle of Mons]] in August 1914.&lt;ref name="Calley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Calley |first=Roy |date=1 September 2014 |title=The World Water Speed Record: The Fast and the Forgotten |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=1445637987 |location=[[Stroud]] |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=9781445637860 |author-link=Roy Calley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the 5th Battalion, [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]], a [[Territorial Force]] unit, on 2 September 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28910 |date=22 September 1914 |page=7496}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon drafted into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] where he served as a ferry pilot, as his instructors believed he was too clumsy to make the grade as a fighter pilot.&lt;ref name="Calley"/&gt;

During the late 1930s he commanded the [[Provost (military police)|Provost Company]] of the [[56th (London) Division]] of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. From 1940 to 1942 he commanded the Military Police contingent of the [[Coats Mission]] tasked with evacuating [[King George VI]], [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] and their immediate family from London in the event of German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Second to None: The History of the Coldstream Guards 1650 – 2000 |page=488 |author=Julian Paget |publisher=Casemate Publishers |year=2000 |isbn=1783379391}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 1943 he was transferred from the [[Royal Military Police|Corps of Military Police]] to the [[General Service Corps|General List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35872 |date=22 January 1943 |page=435 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 1945, having attained the age limit of 60, Campbell relinquished his commission and was granted the honorary rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37454 |date=5 February 1946 |page=802 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand Prix career==
Campbell competed in [[Grand Prix motor racing]], winning the 1927 and 1928 Grand Prix de Boulogne in France driving a [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 39|Bugatti T37A]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Land speed record==
Campbell broke the land speed record for the first time in 1924 at {{convert|146.16|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}} at [[Pendine Sands]] near [[Carmarthen Bay]] in a [[Sunbeam 350HP|350HP V12 Sunbeam]], now on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]]. He broke nine [[land speed record]]s between 1924 and 1935, with three at [[Pendine Sands]] and five at [[Daytona Beach Road Course|Daytona Beach]]. His first two records were driving a racing car built by [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]].

On 4 February 1927 Campbell set the land speed record at [[Pendine Sands]], covering the Flying Kilometre (in an average of two runs) at {{convert|174.883|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and the Flying Mile in {{convert|174.224|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, in the [[Napier-Campbell Blue Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', March 1927, p.282; ''Motor Sport'', September 1927, p.77; ''Thrust'', by Richard Noble (Bantam Books, 1999), p.401.&lt;/ref&gt;

He set his final land speed record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]] on 3 September 1935, and was the first person to drive an automobile over 300&amp;nbsp;mph, averaging {{convert|301.337|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} in two passes.&lt;ref name="Calley" /&gt;

==Water speed records==
Campbell developed and flotation-tested Blue Bird on Tilgate Lake, in [[Tilgate Park]], [[Crawley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|2138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He set the [[water speed record]] four times, his highest speed being {{convert|141.740|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} in the ''[[Blue Bird K4]]''. He set the record on 19 August 1939 on [[Coniston Water]], Cumbria, England.&lt;ref name="Calley" /&gt;

==Politics==
Campbell stood for Parliament without success at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]] in [[Deptford (UK Parliament constituency)|Deptford]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], despite his links to the [[British Union of Fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie V. Gottlieb, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/96364?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true "British Union of Fascists (act. 1932–1940)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 (Accessed 5 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he once adorned his car with a Fascist pennant of the [[London Volunteer Transport Service]], though there has been no photographic evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;Zander, Patrick Glenn.

==Death==
[[File:Grave of Malcolm Campbell.JPG|thumb|Campbell's grave at St Nicholas' Church in [[Chislehurst]].]]

Campbell died after a series of strokes in 1948 in [[Reigate]], Surrey, aged 63 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=0SjKo02SS07xqxW497z2Aw&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the few land speed record holders of his era to die of natural causes, as so many had died in crashes. His versatile racing on different vehicles made him internationally famous.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

As the main hub for Mexico's largest airline [[Aeroméxico]] (with [[Aeroméxico Connect]]), the airport has become a [[SkyTeam]] hub. It is also a hub for [[Aeromar]], [[Interjet]], [[Volaris]], and a focus city for [[VivaAerobus]]. On a typical day, more than 100,000 passengers&lt;ref name=AICM /&gt; pass through the airport to and from more than 100 destinations on four continents. In 2017, the airport handled 44,732,418 passengers, a 7.2% increase compared to 2016.&lt;ref name="aicmstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm/archivos/files/Estadisticas/Estadisticas2017_En.pdf|title=Statistics Mexico City airport|publisher=Mexico City International Airport|accessdate=January 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114021902/https://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm/archivos/files/Estadisticas/Estadisticas2017_En.pdf|archive-date=January 14, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Located at the neighbourhood of Peñón de los Baños within [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]], one of the sixteen boroughs into which [[Mexico City]] is divided, the airport is {{Convert|5|km|abbr=on}} east from [[Historic center of Mexico City|Downtown Mexico City]] and is surrounded by the built-up areas of [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]] to the north and [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]] to the west, south and east. As the airport is located on the east side of Mexico City and its runways run southwest-northeast, an airliner's landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of Mexico City when the wind is from the northeast. Therefore, there is an important overflying problem and noise pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2575234/The_dark_side_of_aeromobilities_Unplanned_airport_planning_in_Mexico_City|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140908164515/http://www.academia.edu/2575234/The_dark_side_of_aeromobilities_Unplanned_airport_planning_in_Mexico_City|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 8, 2014|title=Unplanned airport planning in Mexico City|publisher=Academia Education|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexico.quadratin.com.mx/Se-quejan-vecinos-de-Interlomas-por-ruido-de-aviones/|title=Disgruntled neighbors by noise pollution in Mexico City|publisher=Quadratin|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:Vuelo inaugural Iberia Madrid - México (1950).jpg|thumb|left|Inauguration of Iberia's Mexico City-Madrid route, March 1, 1950]]
The original site, known as Llanos de Balbuena, had been used for aeronautical activities since 1910, when Alberto Braniff became the first to fly an aeroplane in Mexico, and in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiegoairandspace.org/exhibits/mexican_american_exhibit/|title=Mexican-americans in aviation online exhibition|publisher=San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/the_americas/summary/v067/67.3.ganson.html|title=Conquistador of the Sky: A History of Aviation in Latin America|publisher=Project MUSE|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was onboard of a [[Voisin 1907 biplane|Voisin]] biplane. On November 30, 1911, President [[Francisco I. Madero]], was the first head of State in the world to fly onboard of a [[Deperdussin]] airplane piloted by Geo M. Dyott of Moisant International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecatalist.org/2010/01/570/|title=Mexico's 100 years of flying taking off to new heights!|publisher=The Catalist|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1171-did-you-know-the-world-s-first-aerial-bombing-the-battle-of-topolobampo-mexico|title=A brief Mexican History aviation|publisher=Mexconnect|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1915 the airport first opened as Balbuena Military Airport with five runways. Construction of a small civilian airport began in 1928. The first landing was on November 5, 1928, and regular service started in 1929, but was officially inaugurated on May 15, 1931. On July 8, 1943, the Official Gazette of the Federation published a decree that acknowledged Mexico City's Central Airport as an international airport, capable of managing international arrivals and departures of passengers and aircraft. Its first international route was to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] operated by [[Mexicana de Aviación|Mexicana]]. Construction of Runway 05D-23I started six years later, as well as new facilities such as a platform, a terminal building, a control tower and offices for the authorities. The runway started its operations in 1951. On November 19, 1952, President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] opened the passenger terminal, which later became Terminal 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contenido.com.mx/2013/11/un-ano-mas-del-aicm/|title=One more year of Mexico City International Airport (In Spanish)|publisher=Contenido|accessdate=September 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907005210/http://contenido.com.mx/2013/11/un-ano-mas-del-aicm/|archivedate=September 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 the airport had four runways in service: 05L-23R (2,720m long, 40m wide), 05R-23L (3,000m long, 45m wide), with electric lights for night-time service; 13-31 (2,300m long, 40m wide) which had been built to relieve 14-32, to which residential areas had encroached too closely; and 5 Auxiliar (759m long).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm/Archivos/BREVEHISTORIA2011.pdf |title="Breve Historia del Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México", Mexico City International Airport |access-date=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906085020/http://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm/Archivos/BREVEHISTORIA2011.pdf |archive-date=September 6, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s–1990s===
[[File:JFK exiting Air Force One.jpg|thumb|President and Mrs. Kennedy disembark Air Force One, June 29, 1962]]
On December 2, 1963, Walter C. Buchanan, former director of the Transport and Communications Department (SCT), changed the airport's name "Aeropuerto Central" (Central Airport) to "Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México" (Mexico City International Airport).&lt;ref name="pilotos"&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2016-01-26
  |format=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, president [[Luis Echeverría]] closed the two remaining shorter runways (13/31 and 5 Auxiliar); on the land of 13-31 a social housing complex was built, Unidad Fiviport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cRjAAAAMAAJ|title=Obras|publisher=|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexdfmagazine.com/2013/02/22/a-new-airport-for-mexico-city/|title=A New Airport for Mexico City?|work=MexDFmagazine|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historic photo at [http://www.flyapm.com/foro/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=139 FlyAPM site]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the two parallel runways. In 1980, the terminal was expanded to double its capacity, using a single large terminal rather than multiple terminals as in other airports. Ten years later in 1990, the mixed domestic/international gates were separated to increase the terminal's functionality, along with the separation of domestic and international check-in halls. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

On November 24, 1978, the "Mexico" Control Tower began its operations; it has been in service since then.&lt;ref name="pilotos" /&gt;

The AICM has continually improved its infrastructure. On August 15, 1979, and after about a year of remodeling works, the terminal building reopened to the public; the airport continued its operations during the renovation, which improved passenger transit with better space distribution in walkways and rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to constant growth in demand of both passengers and operations, on January 13, 1994, the Official Gazette of the Federation, published a presidential decree that prohibited general aviation operations in the AICM, which were moved to [[Lic. Adolfo López Mateos International Airport|Toluca International Airport]] in order to clear air traffic in the capital's airport.&lt;ref name="diariooficial"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renovations to the AICM continued and on April 11, 1994, a new International Terminal building was ready and operational. It was built by a private contractor according to a co-investment agreement with Airports and Auxiliary Services. In 2001, in order to further improve service to passengers, construction for Module XI started. This Module permitted eight new contact positions in the Airport Terminal, capable of receiving eight regular airplanes, two wide-body, or four narrow-body aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2003–2007 expansion===
Because of the increasing traffic, president [[Vicente Fox]] announced the construction of a new, larger airport on {{Convert|5000|ha|abbr=on}} in the municipalities of [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] and [[San Salvador Atenco]], but when [[Community Front in Defense of Land|local violent protests]] took place in 2002, the new airport was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/03/international/americas/03MEXI.html|title=Mexico drops planned airport after protests from peasants|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, to respond to the growing demand and aiming to position the AICM as one of the greatest in terms of quality, services, security, and operational functionality, on May 30, 2003, the Federal Government announced an update: an extension to the air terminal in order to widen its service capacity from 20 million to 32 million passengers a year. This program was part of the Metropolitan Airport System, promoted by the Federal Administration. The Communications and Transportation Ministry (SCT), Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) and AICM performed expansion and remodeling work on Terminal 1, over a surface area of {{convert|90000|m2}}; 48,000 of which were new construction and 42,000 of which were remodeled. The renovations include new airline counters, commercial spaces and an elevator for people with disabilities, which improved the flow of passengers with domestic destinations.

Among other works performed in the international area, a long-distance bus terminal was built with connections to Puebla, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, Toluca, Querétaro and Orizaba. The new bus station has access to a food court and the international arrivals and departures area, as well as a pedestrian bridge that connects to "The Peñón de los Baños" neighborhood.

The airport was formally named after the 19th-century president [[Benito Juárez]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decretará Fox que el AICM se denomine Benito Juárez |first1=Triunfo |last1=Elizalde |first2=Rosa Elvira |last2=Vargas |trans-title=President Vicente Fox decrees official name for Mexico City Airport |language=Spanish |publisher=La Jornada |date={{Date|2006-10-5|mdy}} |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/10/05/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=024n1pol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908232128/https://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/10/05/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=024n1pol |archivedate=September 8, 2014 |df=mdy }}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2007, Terminal 2 was opened, significantly increasing the airport's capacity. All SkyTeam members moved their operations to the new terminal, except [[Air France]] and [[KLM]]. It was officially inaugurated in March 2008, once the new road accesses and taxiways were finished. Terminal 2 increased the airport's contact positions by 40% and the operational capacity by 15%. The terminal was inaugurated by former President [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-11-16-mexico-city-airport_N.htm|title=Mexico City inaugurates new airport terminal|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of capacity and slot restriction==
{{Multiple image||align=right||image1=Aerial View of Mexico City Airport on 3.21.11.jpg|thumb|caption1=The airport as seen from an aircraft in 2011.||width1=197||image2=Benitojuarezarptaerial.jpg|thumb|caption2=aerial view of the airport before the construction of Terminal 2.||width2=170}}
The airport has suffered from a lack of capacity due to restrictions on expansion, since it is located in a densely populated area. In 2014, Mexican authorities established 
and declared a maximum capacity of 61 operations per hour with a total of 16 rush hours (7:00 –22:59).&lt;ref name="diario2"&gt;{{cite web

  |date=2014-09-29
  |accessdate=2016-01-26
  |format=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with the airport is the limitation that its two runways provide, since they are used at 97.3% of their maximum capacity, leaving a very short room for new operations into the airport. Only government, military, commercial, and specially authorised aircraft are allowed to land at the airport. Private aircraft must use alternate airports, such as [[Lic. Adolfo López Mateos International Airport]] in [[Toluca]], [[General Mariano Matamoros Airport]] in [[Cuernavaca]], or [[Hermanos Serdán International Airport]] in [[Puebla]].

==Failed attempt to replace the airport==
{{Main article|New Mexico City international airport}}
[[File:FernandoRomero01.jpeg|thumb|Architect [[Fernando Romero]] and the scale model of the New Mexico City airport.]]
The construction of a [[new Mexico City international airport]] was announced by Mexican president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] on September 2, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Mexico City International Airport |work=CAPA Centre for Aviation |url=http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/newairports/new-mexico-city-international-airport |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906201454/https://centreforaviation.com/profiles/newairports/new-mexico-city-international-airport |archivedate=September 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; who said that it would be ''emblemático'', or a national symbol. The new airport will replace the current Mexico City International Airport, which is at capacity. It is to have one large terminal of {{convert|6000000|ft2|m2}} and six runways: two that are each {{convert|4.5|km|mi ft}} long and four that are each {{convert|4|km|mi ft}} long.

Construction will take eight years and depending on the source, is estimated to cost 120 or 169 billion [[Mexican pesos]], about 9–13 billion U.S. dollars. It will be built on land already owned by the federal government in the ''Zona Federal del Lago de Texcoco'', between [[Ecatepec]] and [[San Salvador Atenco|Atenco]] in the [[State of Mexico]], about 10&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the current airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2014/0903/Ready-for-landing-Mexico-City-airport-expansion-could-make-it-one-of-largest-in-world "Ready for landing: Mexico City airport expansion could make it one of largest in world", ''Christian Science Monitor'', 2014-09-03]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Mexico Plans New $9.2 Billion Airport|first= David|last= Luhnow|newspaper= [[The Wall Street Journal]]|date= {{Date|2014-9-2|mdy}}|url= https://online.wsj.com/articles/mexico-plans-new-9-2-billion-airport-1409676782}}&amp;nbsp;{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminal 2 was built over a surface area of 242,666.55m² and has modern security systems, in accordance with international standards including a passenger traffic separation systems. The new facility will help AICM increase its capacity to 32 million passengers per year.

Air operations in the new facilities began on November 15, 2007, with flights by [[Aeromar]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], and later [[AeroMéxico]], [[Copa Airlines|Copa]], [[LAN Airlines|LAN]] and [[Continental Airlines]]. Terminal 2 was formally inaugurated by former Presidente [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]] on March 26, 2008.

These projects were done without affecting airplane takeoffs and landings, and will help Mexico City International Airport offer better services, and respond to the growing demand of passengers and operations in the coming years.

Terminal 2 now houses all Aeroméxico flights out of the airport, becoming the airline's main distribution center. Although the terminal was intended to be served by all-SkyTeam member airlines, Air France and KLM decided to remain at Terminal 1.

==Inter-terminal transportation==
[[File:MexicoCable.jpg|thumb|Mexico City airport inter-terminal transit with Terminal 2 in background.]]
Terminal 1 is connected to Terminal 2 by the [[Aerotrén]] monorail system in which only connecting passengers with hand baggage are allowed to use with their boarding pass. Technical and cabin crew can also use it. The distance between the terminals is {{Convert|3|km|abbr=on}}. and the Airtrain's speed is {{Convert|45|km/h|abbr=on}}. Also there is a land service between terminals called "inter-terminal transportation". These buses are located at entrance no. 6 of Terminal 1 and entrance no. 4 of Terminal 2.

==Ground transportation==

===[[File:Mexico City Metro.svg|45px]] Metro and bus services===
Terminal 1 is served by the [[Metro Terminal Aérea|Terminal Aérea]] [[Mexico City Metro|Metro]] station, which belongs to [[Mexico City Metro Line 5|Line 5]] of the subway, running from [[Metro Pantitlán|Pantitlán]] station to [[Metro Politécnico|Politécnico]] station. It is located just outside the national terminal. Also, trolley bus line G runs from the bus stop next to the Metro to [[Metro Boulevard Puerto Aéreo|Boulevard Puerto Aéreo]] station {{Convert|1.7|km|abbr=on}} away, allowing transfer to Metro Line 1 (one can also take line 5 to Pantitlán and change to line 1, which is a geographical detour). Terminal 2 does not have any Metro station, but is a {{Convert|700|m|abbr=on}} walk from Pantitlán served by Metro lines 1, 5, 9, A and numerous local buses.

Terminals 1 and 2 have two land terminals operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Different bus lines operate from here [http://www.aicm.com.mx/serviciosausuarios_en/transportacion.php?Grupo=4]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and provide continuous transportation services to the main cities located around Mexico City, such as [[Córdoba, Veracruz|Córdoba]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Pachuca]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Santiago de Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]] and [[Toluca]].

===[[File:Metrobus Mexico.svg|60px]] Metrobús===
In late 2010, former [[Head of Government of the Federal District]] [[Marcelo Ebrard]] announced a plan to build a new [[Mexico City Metrobús|Metrobús]] Line 4 that would run from near [[Buenavista Station]] in the west of the city towards Mexico City airport. Construction on Line 4 started on July 4, 2011. The plans for Line 4 include a two step construction process with the first {{Convert|28|km|abbr=on}} operational segment to be built between Buenavista and Metro San Lázaro. An extension provides travel between San Lázaro and the airport. The line opened on April 1, 2012.

&lt;/div&gt;

===Authorised taxis===
Taxis are in operation in Terminals 1 and 2 and there are two models of service: Ordinary service in a sedan type vehicle for 4 passengers. Executive service in 8 passengers vans. At present there are 5 taxi groups in operation. These are the only taxis authorised by the Ministry of Communications and Transport ([[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|SCT]]) of the Federal Government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2388">'''Movicel''' is the smaller of the two [[Angola]]n [[mobile phone]] companies. Its official name is ''Movicel Telecomunicações S.A.''. Movicel was originally created in 2003 as a subsidiary of the state owned [[Angola Telecom]]. In 2010, 80% of the company's capital was sold to various private companies: Portmil - Investimentos e Telecomunicações, S.A., Modus Comunicar, S.A., Ipangue, S.A., Lambda Investement and [[Novatel Wireless]]. The remaining 20% remain in the hands of the state owned (''empresa publica'') companies [[Angola Telecom]] and [[ENCTA]]. The seat of the company is the capital city [[Luanda]]. Movicel sells its services via a network of shops; recharging cards for pre-paid contracts are also sold by individual street sellers.

Movicel claims to have more than 3 million customers out of a population of estimated 18 to 20 million people in Angola.&lt;ref name="Movicel_quem-somos"&gt;

'''Manuel Crescencio Rejón International Airport''', formerly known as '''Mérida-Rejón Airport''' {{Airport codes|MID|MMMD}} is an international airport located in the Mexican city of [[Mérida, Yucatán]].

'''''P.M. News''''' is a daily newspaper published in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] by the Independent Communications Network Limited (ICNL). The company also publishes the weekly ''TheNEWS'' magazine and ''Tempo'', a tabloid.&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt;

'''''The News''''' was founded in 1993 by Bayo Onanuga, [[Babafemi Ojudu]] and other former staff from the African Concord who had resigned in protest over a request by [[M.K.O. Abiola]], the publisher, to apologise to President [[Ibrahim Babangida]] over a critical story about the military regime. Ojudu was the first Managing Editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://babafemiojudu.org/about-babafemi.html
 |title=About Babafemi
 |publisher=Babafemi Ojudu
 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After harassment by the Babangida regime, there was a brief period of press freedom under General [[Sani Abacha]] during which ''P.M. News'' was launched in August 1994 as a breezy afternoon paper strongly oriented towards news but also covering fashions, sports and entertainment.&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt;

In the years that followed, ''P.M. News'' and ''TheNews'' were known for "guerrilla journalism".&lt;ref name=cjfe1998/&gt;
They were subject to constant interference by the authorities, arrests and closures.&lt;ref name=AboutUs/&gt;
For example, in August 1996 [[Amnesty International]] reported that Editor-in-chief Bayo Onanuga was thought to be held by the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] at their Lagos headquarters, and may have been ill-treated in custody.
Babafemi Ojudu had been released on 13 August 1996 and had required hospital treatment as a result of ill-treatment. The two men may have been arrested due to publishing articles critical to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-05-12
 |title=Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoner of conscience: Bayo Onanuga
 |date=14 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Onanuga fled from Nigeria in 1997 after hiding from state security forces for months. He returned home to resume work at ICNL in 1998, after the sudden death of Abacha and the start of the transition to democracy.&lt;ref name=cjfe1998/&gt;

'''Slavery in the Madras Presidency''' during the [[British Raj]] affected close to 20% of the population. The landlords were predominantly higher caste individuals. When those from the lower castes borrowed money against their land and defaulted, they entered a life of [[debt bondage]]. The slaves formed 12.2% of the total population in 1930.

The patterns of slavery and slave population varied between districts. Various laws were passed during 1811, 1812 and 1823 to restrict slavery and prevent child labour, though the slave trade was only ended with the [[Indian Slavery Act, 1843|Indian Slavery Act of 1843]], and the sale of slaves became a criminal offence in 1862 under the new [[Indian Penal Code]].

==Pattern==
The ''Mirasdars'', or landlords, were usually from the higher castes. Lower caste individuals borrowed money [[Secured loan|against their holdings]] from the ''mirasdars'' for marriage expenses, housing, or farming costs. On defaulting, they would find themselves obliged to repay the debt through labour. Hereditary relationships continued between debtors and their masters, as generations found themselves in debt bondage, [[Debt-slavery|leading to slavery]]. The opinion is divided on whether Brahmins directly used slaves or employed hired labourers. A theory, emitting from the note of the collector of [[Trichonopoly]] in 1819, states that the [[Brahmin]]s employed lower castes labourers and the non-Brahmin landlords used lower caste slaves. Slavery was observed in almost all castes, both Brahmin and non-Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society|British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society]] 1841, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern of slavery varied between different districts of the presidency, as did the [[Serfdom|sale of workers with land]]&lt;ref name="Kumarp43"&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar]] pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; In South [[Arcot]] and [[Coimbatore]], slaves could be sold to anyone. In Coimbatore, slavery during the early 19th century was predominantly debt based. Serfs were sold along with land in [[Trichonopoly]]. The collector of [[Tinnevelly]] reported in 1919 that there was no specific pattern for selling serfs with land or slaves alone. It was later observed that slaves were sold with land, a situation closer to what would be called [[serfdom]]. A similar pattern was observed in [[Tanjore]], where the sale of slaves to other estates was rare. In Madurai, slavery was in gradual decline as early as 1819. Some slaves, after liberation joined the [[Presidency armies|Presidency army]] as [[Sepoy]]s. In the northern parts of the Presidency, like [[Masulipatnam]] and [[Ganjam]], agrarian slavery was minimal. In the Telugu speaking districts, the slaves were of three kinds – servants to ''[[zamindars]]'', servants to Muslims, and [[Serfdom|labourers attached to land]].

==Distribution==
The Law Commission report on slavery in 1841 contained the indicative figures on the number of slaves, based the numbers categorised as [[Pallar]] and [[Paraiyar]].&lt;ref name="Britishp4"&gt;[[#British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society|British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society]] 1841, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In South Arcot , the number of slaves was 17,000 in 1819, comprising less than 4% of the population. In [[Tanjore]], the numbers were reported to be more numerous, while in [[Madurai]] it was less. The [[Tinnevely|Tinnelvely]] collector reported 38% of the whole population as slaves. In [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichonopoly]], the collector estimated 10,000 slaves in wet parts and 600 in dry parts of the district. In [[Nellore district|Nellore]], the slave population was 14.6% of the total population in 1827 and 16% in 1930.

Quoting a statement by the European Union: "If there is to be genuine peace, a way must be found to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states."&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of [[United Nations]] (UN) member states and most international organisations do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over East Jerusalem, which came under its control after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], or its 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]] proclamation, which declared a "complete and united" Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.&lt;ref name=jlaw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/68006/S_RES_478%281980%29-EN.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y |title=UN security Council Resolution 478 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most countries locate their foreign embassies in [[Tel Aviv]] and its suburbs rather than in Jerusalem.

==Background==
{{See also|Timeline of Jerusalem}}
[[File:JerusalemEastAndWest.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Jerusalem municipal area]]
From the end of the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|Ottoman–Mamluk War in 1517]] until the [[First World War]], Jerusalem was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Since the 1860s, Jews have formed the largest religious group in the city and since around 1887, Jews have been in the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Kark and Michal Oren-Nordheim (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=KzOAxmHDzHUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false''Jerusalem and Its Environs: Quarters, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800-1948'']. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, European powers vied for influence in the city, usually on the basis of extending protection over Christian churches and Holy Places. A number of these countries also established consulates in Jerusalem. In 1917 and following the First World War, Great Britain was in control of Jerusalem; from 1923 as part of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate of Palestine]]. The principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] recognized the unique spiritual and religious interests in Jerusalem among the world's [[Abrahamic religions|three great monotheistic religions]] as "a sacred trust of civilization",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf ''Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory''], Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 2004, p. 165 para. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. I. M. de Waart (2005). "International Court of Justice Firmly Walled in the Law of Power in the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process". ''Leiden Journal of International Law''. '''18''' (3): pp. 467–487. "The Court ascertained the legal significance of the 'sacred trust of civilization' of the League of Nations (LoN) in respect of the 1922 Palestine Mandate as the origin of the present responsibility of the United Nations".&lt;/ref&gt; and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with it be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp#art28 Article 28 of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Arab and Jewish [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|communities in Palestine]] were in mortal dispute and Britain sought United Nations assistance in resolving the dispute. In November 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] (Resolution 181), which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and [[Jewish state]]s, with Jerusalem being established as a ''[[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]]'', or a "separated body" with a special legal and political status, administered by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 48/158D, 20 December 1993. para. 5(c) stipulated that the permanent status negotiations should guarantee "arrangements for peace and security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181(II) of 29 November 1947"&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish representatives accepted the partition plan, while representatives of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states rejected it, declaring it illegal.&lt;ref name=WJ/&gt;

In May 1948, the Jewish community in Palestine issued the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel]]. Israel became a member of the United Nations the following year and has since been [[International recognition of Israel|recognised by most countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273]].&lt;/ref&gt; The countries recognizing Israel did not recognize its sovereignty over Jerusalem generally, citing the UN resolutions which called for an international status for the city.&lt;ref name=JQ2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=John|title=The Case for Palestine: An International Law Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822335395|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Case_For_Palestine.html?id=VaUvqHNd6m0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel and the subsequent [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|invasion by surrounding Arab states]], the UN proposal for Jerusalem never materialised. The [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] left [[Jordan]] in [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|control of the eastern parts]] of Jerusalem, while the western sector was held by Israel.&lt;ref name=TJQ&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapidoth |first=Ruth |last2=Hirsch |first2=Moshe |title=The Jerusalem Question and Its Resolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e93JIwTBjHgC |year=1994 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |isbn=0-7923-2893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each side recognised the other's ''[[de facto]]'' control of their respective sectors.&lt;ref name=TRC&gt;{{cite book |last=Korman |first=Sharon |title=The Right of Conquest: The Acquisition of Territory by Force in International Law and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueDO1dJyjrUC |year=1996 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19-828007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armistice Agreement, however, was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalisation of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Corpus Separatum"&gt;See:

Though the United Kingdom and Pakistan recognized Jordanian rule over East Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger|first1=Marshall J. |last2=Ahimeir |first2=Ora |title=Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |date=2002 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGOY5oDGGLUC&amp;pg=PA145 |isbn= 978-0-8156-2912-2 |page= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; no other country recognized either Jordanian or Israeli rule over the respective areas of the city under their control.&lt;ref name=TJQ/&gt;

Following the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, Israel declared that [[Israeli law]] would be applied to [[East Jerusalem]] and enlarged its eastern boundaries, approximately doubling its size. The action was deemed unlawful by other states who did not recognize it. It was condemned by the UN Security Council and General Assembly which described it as an annexation and a violation of the rights of the Palestinian population. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]], which declared that ''"Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel"''.&lt;ref name= kbl&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic10_eng.htm "Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel (Unofficial translation)"]. ''www.knesset.gov.il''. Passed by the Knesset on the 17th Av, 5740 (30 July 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council declared the law null and void in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|Resolution 478]], which also called upon member states to [[List of diplomatic missions in Israel|withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city]]. The UN General Assembly has also passed numerous resolutions to the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140203082012/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/34BE727D1EED7D688525799500579D23 "A/RES/66/18 of 26 January 2012"].

Israel took control of [[West Jerusalem]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], while [[Jordan]] had taken control of [[East Jerusalem]] (including the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] in which most holy places are located).&lt;ref name=TJQ/&gt; Israel rejected [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1949]] and instead indicated a preference for a division of Jerusalem into Jewish and Arab zones, and international control and protection only for holy places and sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130705171032/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/2C25E1B7AADB7CC685256AF5005F6D18 ''Letter dated 31 May 1949, addressed by Mr. Walter Eytan, Head of the Delegation of Israel''] (doc.nr.

After Israel conquered East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 during the [[Six-Day War]], which it characterised as self-defence, Israel also argued that it had the stronger right to the city.&lt;ref name=TJQ/&gt; Israel argued that Jordan had no rights to any land west of the Jordan River, and had taken the West Bank and East Jerusalem by an act of aggression and therefore never acquired sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Einhorn|first1=Talia|title=The Status of Palestine/Land of Israel and Its Settlement Under Public International Law|url=http://www.acpr.org.il/english-nativ/issue1/einhorn-1.htm|website=www.acpr.org.il|publisher=NATIV|accessdate=11 March 2018|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DISPUTED TERRITORIES- Forgotten Facts About the West Bank and Gaza Strip|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/DISPUTED%20TERRITORIES-%20Forgotten%20Facts%20About%20the%20We.aspx|website=mfa.gov.il|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=11 March 2018|date=1 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its conquest of East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel merged East Jerusalem with West Jerusalem by [[Reunification of Jerusalem|administratively extending the municipal boundary of the city]].

In July 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] as part of the country's [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]], which declared Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel.&lt;ref name="basiclaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic%20Law-%20Jerusalem-%20Capital%20of%20Israel |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2 April 2007 |date=30 July 1980 |title=Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a  1999 statement by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], "There is no basis in international law for the position supporting a status of [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|'corpus separatum']] (separate entity) for the city of Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="Jerusalem status"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/3/The+Status+of+Jerusalem.htm The Status of Jerusalem].

''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''. 14 March 1999. Quote comes from §IV.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the ministry, the concept of ''corpus separatum'' became irrelevant after the Arab states rejected the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|invaded the newly created state of Israel]] in 1948. Accordingly, the ministry states, "There has never been any agreement, treaty, or international understanding which applies the 'Corpus Separatum' concept to Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="Jerusalem status" /&gt;

Positions on the final status of Jerusalem have varied with different Israeli governments. The [[Oslo Accords]] declared that the final status of Jerusalem would be negotiated, but Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] declared that he would never divide the city. In 1995, he told a group of school children that "if they told us peace is the price of giving up a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, my reply would be 'let's do without peace'". This position was upheld by his successor, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. Netanyahu's successor, [[Ehud Barak]], during negotiations, became the first Israeli Prime Minister to allow for a possible division of Jerusalem, despite his campaign promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dore Gold |author-link=Dore Gold |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |title=Jerusalem History |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] vowed to keep Jerusalem the "undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avishai|first1=Bernard|title=The Israel Peace Plan That Still Could Be|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/magazine/13Israel-t.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=11 March 2018|date=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later supported the detachment of several Arab neighborhoods from Israeli sovereignty and the introduction of an international trust to run the [[Temple Mount]]. When Netanyahu succeeded Olmert, he declared that "all of Jerusalem would always remain under Israeli sovereignty" and that only Israel would "ensure the freedom of religion and freedom of access for the three religions to the holy places".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/netanyahu-jerusalem-holy-sites-will-remain-israeli-forever-1.276465 "Netanyahu: Jerusalem holy sites will remain Israeli forever"]. ''Haaretz''. 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These statements seem to closely reflect Israeli public opinion. According to a 2012 poll by the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], 78% of Jewish voters who responded said that they would reconsider voting for any politician that wants to relinquish Israel's control over the Old City and East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Karl Vick |url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/31/the-west-banks-2012-the-year-of-the-israeli-settlement/?iid=gs-main-lead | work=Time |title=The West Bank's 2012: The Year of the Israeli Settlement |date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated, regarding Jerusalem serving as the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state, "Jerusalem has forever been the capital of only the Jewish people and no other nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel’s foreign relations: Contra mundum |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21651865-israels-new-government-running-out-friends-abroad-contra-mundum |accessdate=24 May 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2018, Netanyahu repeated the previous government position but seemed to alter the position, reportedly saying: "Under any peace agreement the capital of Israel will continue to be ''in'' Jerusalem."

==Palestine==
{{see also|Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|Thawabit}}
Until the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the [[Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|Letters of Mutual Recognition]], the Palestinian leadership had at all times rejected any partition of any part of the former British Mandate territory. However, while they had previously rejected the UN's internationalisation plan,&lt;ref name="Tessler2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84ehDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA322|title=A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Second Edition|author=Mark Tessler|first=|date=24 March 2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-253-01346-0|location=|pages=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the Arab delegations at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1949]] accepted a permanent international regime (called [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|''corpus separatum'']]) under United Nations supervision as proposed in Resolutions 181 and 194,&lt;ref&gt;UN Committee on Jerusalem, [https://archive.is/20130705175611/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/39dceb7d1499881685256af50068f3ba ''Meeting between the Committee on Jerusalem and the delegations of the Arab states, 20 June 1949''] (doc.nr. A/AC.25/Com.Jer./SR.33)&lt;/ref&gt; and objected to Israel moving to (West) Jerusalem its national institutions, namely the Knesset, the presidential, legislative, [[Israeli Supreme Court|judicial]] and administrative offices.

The Palestinian leadership now claims the "1967 borders" as the borders of the Palestinian territories, and includes East Jerusalem as part of these territories. Despite recognition of Israel, and its support in 1949 of ''corpus separatum'', it had never conceded sovereignty of Jerusalem. In the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]], Jordan conceded all claims to the West Bank, including Jerusalem, other than the Muslim holy places.

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] views East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory, in line with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UNSC Resolution 242]]. The PNA claims all of East Jerusalem, including the [[Temple Mount]], as the capital of the [[State of Palestine]], and claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to final status negotiations, but is willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an [[open city]]. In the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] of 1988, Jerusalem is called the capital of the [[State of Palestine]]. In 2000 the [[Palestinian Authority]] passed a law designating the city as such, and in 2002 this law was ratified by Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref name=PalestinianPosition&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200210/06/eng20021006_104530.shtml "Arafat Signs Law Making Jerusalem Palestinian Capital"], ''People's Daily'', published 6 October 2002; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2302961.stm "Arafat names Jerusalem as capital"], ''BBC News'', published 6 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The official position of the PNA is that Jerusalem should be an open city, with no physical partition and that Palestine would guarantee freedom of worship, access and the protection of sites of religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minfo.gov.ps/permenant/English/Jerusalem/Pal_Official.htm |title=The Palestinian Official Position |accessdate=10 February 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212195415/http://www.minfo.gov.ps/permenant/English/Jerusalem/Pal_Official.htm |archivedate=12 February 2006 |df= }}, Palestinian National Authority, Ministry of Information, copy from Archive.org, retrieved 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1947 UN Partition Plan|United Nations General Assembly resolution 181]] (II), passed on 29 November 1947, provided for the full territorial internationalisation of Jerusalem: "The City of Jerusalem shall be established as a ''corpus separatum'' under a special international regime and shall be administered by the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 |date=29 November 1947 |deadurl=yes |at=See "Part III. - City of Jerusalem" |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029150108/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |archivedate=29 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution received the consent of the Jewish leadership in Palestine, but it was rejected by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=lapidoth&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lapidoth |first=Ruth |author-link=Ruth Lapidoth |encyclopedia=Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law |title=Jerusalem |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was restated in the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in [[s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 303|UN General Assembly Resolution 303(IV)]] of 1949. According to a 1979 report prepared for and under the guidance of the [[Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People]], it would appear that the United Nations has maintained the principle that the legal status of Jerusalem is that of a ''corpus separatum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/651C804E6815FB28852575DF004B7C4C "The Status of Jerusalem, CEIRPP, DPR (1 January 1981)"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208020505/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/651C804E6815FB28852575DF004B7C4C |date=8 December 2012}} Section "Conclusions".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] does not recognize Israel's proclamation of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which is, for example, reflected in the wording of General Assembly Resolution 63/30 of 2009 which states that "any actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to cease all such illegal and unilateral measures."&lt;ref name="GA63/30"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unga63_30.pdf?OpenElement|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly – 63/30.

Although the General Assembly cannot pass legally binding resolutions over international issues, the [[United Nations Security Council]], which has the authority to do so, has passed a total of six Security Council [[List of UN resolutions concerning Israel|resolutions on Israel]] on the matter, including [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|UNSC resolution 478]] which affirmed that the enactment of the 1980 [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic]] [[Jerusalem Law]] declaring unified Jerusalem as Israel's "eternal and indivisible" capital, was a violation of international law. The resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city. The Security Council, as well as the UN in general, has consistently affirmed the position that East Jerusalem (but not west Jerusalem) is [[occupied Palestinian territory]] subject to the provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. The [[International Court of Justice]] in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" described East Jerusalem as "occupied Palestinian territory".&lt;ref name="RL2008"/&gt;

In 2011, Russian president Medvedev stated Russia had recognized the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital already in 1988, and had not changed that view.&lt;ref name=rus88&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4015504,00.html Medvedev reaffirms Soviet recognition of Palestine (Ynet News, 18 January 2011)] "Russian president says Moscow has not changed its position since 1988 when it 'recognized independent Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem'"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] position on Jerusalem states that "Jerusalem was supposed to be a ‘corpus separatum’, or international city administered by the UN. But this was never set up:  immediately after the UNGA resolution partitioning Palestine, Israel occupied West Jerusalem and Jordan occupied East Jerusalem (including the Old City).  We recognised the de facto control of Israel and Jordan, but not sovereignty.  In 1967, Israel occupied E Jerusalem, which we continue to consider is under illegal military occupation by Israel. Our [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tel Aviv|Embassy to Israel]] is in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem. In E Jerusalem we have a Consulate-General, with a Consul-General who is not accredited to any state:  this is an expression of our view that no state has sovereignty over Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="fco1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front%3Fpagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1057335917798 |title=The UK position on Jerusalem – A key issue in the Palestinian track, and a key concern to the whole Islamic world |website=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20030917110448/http://www.fco.gov.uk:80/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1057335917798&amp;print=true |archive-date=17 September 2003 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fac2009-07-26"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmfaff/261/26108.htm |title=Global Security: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories – Foreign Affairs Committee.

The UK believes that the city's status has yet to be determined, and maintains that it should be settled in an overall agreement between the parties concerned, but considers that the city should not again be divided.&lt;ref name="fco1"/&gt; The Declaration of Principles and the Interim Agreement, signed by Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993 and 28 September 1995 respectively, left the issue of the status of Jerusalem to be decided in the ‘permanent status’ negotiations between the two parties.&lt;ref name="fco1"/&gt;

In 2012, the UK [[Press Complaints Commission]] initially ruled that the newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' had not acted wrongly in writing that "Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel; Tel Aviv is,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/156169#.T8JPN1IViSo|title=UK Press Commission Rules: Tel Aviv is Capital of Israel|website=Israel National News|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later overturned.

==Vatican==
The [[Holy See|Vatican]] has had a long-held position on Jerusalem and its concern for the protection of the Christian [[holy places]] in the Holy Land which predates the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestinian Mandate]]. The Vatican's historic claims and interests, as well as those of Italy and France were based on the former [[Protectorate of the Holy See]] and the [[French Protectorate of Jerusalem]], which were incorporated in article 95 of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920), which incorporated the [[Balfour Declaration]], but also provided: "it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". The Balfour Declaration and the proviso were also incorporated in the Palestinian Mandate (1923), but which also provided in articles 13 and 14 for an international commission to resolve competing claims on the holy places. These claimants had officially lost all capitulation rights by article 28 of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923). However, Britain never gave any effect to Mandate provisions arts 13 &amp; 14. During the drafting of proposals that culminated in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] (also known as Resolution 181) in 1947, the historic claims of the Vatican, Italy and France were revived, and expressed as the call for the special international regime for the city of Jerusalem. This was also confirmed in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] in 1948, which maintained the position that Jerusalem be made an international city,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Kane, "Hearing the Sounds of Silence at Middle East Conference" ''Virginia Gazette'' [http://www.internationalcity.in International City, Gurgaon, India] 28 November 2007  {{cite web |url=http://www.vagazette.com/bal-md.kane28nov28,0,6834786.column |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190458/http://www.vagazette.com/bal-md.kane28nov28,0,6834786.column |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; under United Nations supervision. The Vatican's official position on the status of Jerusalem was in favour of an [[internationalization of Jerusalem]], in order to keep the holy place away from either Israeli or Arab sovereignty.

Pope [[Pius XII]] supported this idea in the 1949 encyclical ''[[Redemptoris nostri cruciatus]]''. It was proposed again during the papacies of [[John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]], [[John Paul II]] and [[Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/vatican-hails-un-palestine-vote-wants-guarantees-for-jerusalem-1.481596 Vatican hails UN Palestine vote, wants guarantees for Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican reiterated this position in 2012, recognizing Jerusalem's "identity and sacred character" and calling for freedom of access to the city's holy places to be protected by "an internationally guaranteed special statute". After the US recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, [[Pope Francis]] repeated the Vatican’s position: "I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Horowitz| first = Jason| title = U.N., European Union and Pope Criticize Trump’s Jerusalem Announcement| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 10 December 2017| date = 6 December 2017| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/europe/trump-jerusalem-pope.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] in 1980, the UN Security Council adopted [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|Resolution 478]], which called upon UN member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city. Thirteen countries — [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]] — moved their embassies from Jerusalem primarily to [[Tel Aviv]]. Costa Rica and El Salvador moved theirs back to Jerusalem in 1984.

Various countries recognized Israel as a state in the 1940s and 1950s, without recognizing Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem. There is an international ''[[Sui generis#Legal applications|sui generis]]'' consular corps in Jerusalem. It is commonly referred to as the "Consular Corps of the Corpus Separatum". The states that have maintained consulates in Jerusalem say that it was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a ''de jure'' sense has not since become part of any other sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Corpus Separatum"/&gt; The Netherlands maintains an office in Jerusalem serving mainly Israeli citizens. Other foreign governments base consulate general offices in Jerusalem, including [[Greece]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Since the [[President of Israel]] resides in Jerusalem and confirms the foreign diplomats, the ambassadors have to travel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to submit letters of credentials upon being appointed.

'''Tasmanian wine''' is [[wine]] produced in the [[Australian]] state of [[Tasmania]]. Located at a more southerly [[latitude]] than the rest of [[Australian wine|Australia's wine regions]], Tasmania has a cooler climate and the potential to make distinctly different wines than in the rest of the country. The area grows primarily [[Pinot noir]], [[Chardonnay]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]],  with some smaller plantings of [[Riesling]], [[Pinot gris]] and [[Cabernet Sauvignon]]. [[Global warming]] has had positive effects on the Tasmanian wine industry, allowing most of the grapes in the past few [[vintage]]s (as of 2005) to ripen fully and produce more vibrant wine.&lt;ref name="Johnson atlas pg 315"&gt; H. Johnson &amp; J. Robinson ''The World Atlas of Wine'' pg 315 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-84000-332-4}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tasmania was one of the earliest regions in Australia to be planted with vines and was even the source of [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s for the first vineyards in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]]. It was also home to some of the earliest wines to gain attention outside of the county with a [[fortified wine|fortified]] [[dessert wine]] by [[Bartholomew Broughton]] being praised by one [[England|English]] writer as Australia's equivalent to [[port wine|Port]].&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 344-347"&gt;H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 344-347 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate and geography==
[[File:Blick ueber Great Oyster Bay zur Freycinet Peninsula.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Freycinet Peninsula has shown itself to be one of the more promising areas for Tasmanian red wine production.]]
Being an [[island]], Tasmania has a [[temperate climate]] that is marked by the strong winds of the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Bass Strait]] and [[Tasman Sea]]. These winds necessitate the use of large screens around the perimeter of vineyards in order to protect the [[grapevines]]. The cool climate of the regions gives way to a late [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] typically around April. The effects of global warming have caused the area's grapes to progressively ripen slightly earlier which has allowed most of the recent vintages to be successful.&lt;ref name="Johnson atlas pg 315"/&gt; It has opened up the prospects of increasing red wine production with Cabernet Sauvignon, [[Merlot]] and [[Shiraz (grape)|Shiraz]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 682"&gt; J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 682 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine regions==
The majority of Tasmania's vineyard are located near the cities of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in the north and Hobart in the south. Most of the area of Tasmania is well suited for the production of [[dry (wine)|dry]], aromatic white wines but the warmer [[Coal River Valley]] and [[Freycinet Peninsula]] are starting to distinguish themselves with red wines.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 324"&gt; J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 324 Abbeville Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

* '''North West''' - south of [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]]
* '''Tamar Valley''' - along the valley north of Launceston
* '''Pipers River''' - on the Georgetown to Bridport road.
* '''East Coast''' - between [[Bicheno, Tasmania|Bicheno]] in the north, and east of [[Sorell, Tasmania|Sorell]]
* '''Coal River''' - between [[Cambridge, Tasmania|Cambridge]] and north of [[Colebrook, Tasmania|Colebrook]].
* '''Derwent Valley''' - between [[Hamilton, Tasmania|Hamilton]] and Hobart
* '''Southern''' - between [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and [[Southport, Tasmania|Southport]]

==Wines==
The region's cool climate has made Tasmania a good location for the production of [[sparkling wine]] with many of Australia's mainland producers having production facilities on the island to make the base ''[[cuvée]]'' that is later transported to the winery's main facility. Even some French [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] houses have taken notice with companies like [[Moët et Chandon]] using some Tasmanian grapes for the Australian sparkling wines. Tasmanian Rieslings have begun to gain notice for their closer similarities to a [[Mosel wine|Mosel]] Riesling than that which is typically produced in Australia.&lt;ref name="Johnson atlas pg 315"/&gt;

Tasmania enjoys a global reputation as a leading producer of premium cool climate wines, winning high praise and accolades from wine judges and critics alike.

'''Terroir'''

The Tasmanian landscape is dominated by dolerite-capped mountains that shelter the state’s wine regions from high winds and rainfall. On the lower slopes, the vineyard soils are formed from ancient sandstones and mudstones and also from more recent river sediments and igneous rocks of volcanic origin.

'''Cool climate advantage'''

Tasmania has a moderate maritime climate, cooled by prevailing westerly winds off the Southern Ocean, providing conditions free of extremes in temperature. Mild spring and summer temperatures, with warm autumn days and cool nights allow the grapes to ripen slowly on the vine, resulting in maximum varietal flavour development.  This is achieved without losing that essential natural acidity that gives wine both freshness and balance.

'''Vintage'''

The Tasmanian vintage usually begins from mid-March, at the peak of the dry autumn when ripening occurs, to late May before the risk of frost and rain.

Vintage variations are greater in Tasmania than any other Australian region. This vintage variation is reflected in each unique wine and makes for an insightful tasting of multiple vintages from the same producer.

'''Tasmanian wine statistics'''

The following provides an overview of the Tasmanian wine sector. In Tasmania there are approximately:
* 160 licensed wine producers
* 230 individual vineyards
* 90 cellar door outlets
* 1500 hectares under vine.
* More than 11,000 tonnes of wine grapes were processed in the 2013 vintage. This represents around 0.5% of Australia’s total winegrape production.

The majority of Tasmania’s grapes are grown in:
* the Tamar Valley wine growing area, which produces approximately 40%
* the East Coast wine growing area, which produces approximately 20%
* the North East (Pipers River) wine growing area, which produces approximately 19%
* the Coal River Valley wine growing area, which produces approximately 13%
* The remaining wine growing areas, including the Derwent Valley, North West and the Huon/Channel, contributed approximately 9% to the total harvest in 2013.

Cool climate grape varieties most common in the state are:
* Pinot Noir - 44% (used for both table and sparkling wine)
* Chardonnay - 23% (used for both table and sparkling wine)
* Sauvignon Blanc - 12%
* Pinot Gris - 11%
* Riesling - 5%
* Other varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Gewürztraminer.&lt;ref&gt;http://winetasmania.com.au/about_our_wine&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| 2011}}, '''''The Great Picture''''' (111 feet (34 m) wide and 32 feet (9.8 m) high) holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the largest print photograph, and the camera with which it was made holds a record for being the world’s largest.&lt;ref name="prnewswire2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/guinness-certifies-worlds-largest-photograph-and-camera-57936427.html|title=Guinness Certifies World’s Largest Photograph and Camera|publisher=''PR Newswire, United Business Media'', July 13, 2006|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was taken in 2006 as part of the Legacy Project, a photographic compilation and record of the history of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] as it is being transformed into the [[Orange County Great Park]]. The project used the abandoned [[F-18]] hangar #115 at the closed fighter base in [[Irvine, California]], United States, as the world's largest [[pinhole camera]]. The aim was to make a black-and-white negative print of the Marine Corps air station with its control tower and runways, with the [[San Joaquin Hills]] in the background.

==Construction of the pinhole camera==
[[File:GP Lifting Muslin RJ.jpg|thumb|Volunteers lift the muslin cloth into place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc-79vOzshw | title=The Great Picture | first=Anthony | last=Mournian | website=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Six photographer artists, Jerry Burchfield, [[Mark Chamberlain (photographer)|Mark Chamberlain]], Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, [[Douglas McCulloh]], and Clayton Spada plus approximately 400 assistants built the world's largest pinhole camera in building #115 at El Toro using {{convert|24000|sqft|m2}} six mil black [[visqueen]], {{convert|1300|gal|l}} of foam gap filler, {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} wide black [[Gorilla Tape]] and {{convert|40|USgal|l}} of black spray paint to make the hangar light-tight. The camera measured 160&amp;nbsp;ft (48.76 m) wide x 45&amp;nbsp;ft (13.71 m) high x 80&amp;nbsp;ft (24.38 m) deep.&lt;ref name="prnewswire2006" /&gt;

A seamless piece of [[muslin]] cloth was made light sensitive by coating it with {{convert|80|l|USgal|disp=flip}} of gelatin [[silver halide]] emulsion and then hung from the ceiling at a distance of about {{convert|80|ft|m}} from a pinhole, just under {{convert|6|mm|in}} in diameter and situated {{convert|15|ft|m}} above ground level on the hangar's metal door. The distance between the pinhole and the cloth was determined to be {{convert|55|ft|m}} for best coverage, and the exposure time was calculated at 35 minutes.&lt;ref name="cafa.com.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.cafa.com.cn/worlds-largest-photograph-the-great-picture-by-the-legacy-project.html

==Development==
[[File:GP Washing JB.jpg|thumb|''The Great Picture'' was washed using fire hydrants.]]
[[File:GP Development JK.jpg|thumb|A [[long-exposure]] of ''The Great Picture'' being developed.]]
The hangar-turned-camera recorded a panoramic image of what was on the other side of the door using the centuries-old principle of "[[camera obscura]]" or [[pinhole camera]]. An image of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station appeared upside down and flipped left to right on film after being projected through the tiny hole in the hangar's metal door.

The opaque [[Negative (photography)|negative]] image print was developed by 80 volunteers during five hours in a vinyl pool liner custom tray, the size of an [[Olympic swimming pool]], with {{convert|600|USgal|l}} of traditional [[Photographic developer|developer]] and {{convert|1200|USgal|l}} of [[Photographic fixer|fixer]] pumped into the tray using high volume pumps. The photograph was then washed using fire hoses attached to two fire hydrants. The finished print is {{convert|111|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|32|ft|m}} high with an area of 3,505.75 square-foot (325.44&amp;nbsp;m²).&lt;ref name="ocregister"&gt;{{cite web

'''USA-92''', also known as '''GPS IIA-12''', '''GPS II-21''', '''GPS SVN-39''', and '''NAVSTAR 39''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the twelfth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-92 was launched at 13:27:00 UTC on 26 June 1993, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D221, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-92 into a transfer orbit.

      <comment>Utter rubbish. In Churchill's 1946 on "a United States of Europe", Churchill clearly envisioned Britain OUTSIDE that "natural grouping". In his words, "I believe that the larger synthesis can only survive if it is founded upon broad natural groupings.There is already a natural grouping in the Western Hemisphere. We British have our own Commonwealth of Nations".</comment>

At present, while the [[European Union]] (EU) is not officially a federation, various academic observers regard it as having the characteristics of a [[Federalism|federal system]].&lt;ref name="Built to Last"&gt;Kelemen, R.

Specifically, the term "United States of Europe" – as a direct comparison with the United States of America – would imply that all the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European states]] would acquire [[States' rights|a status similar]] to that of a [[U.S. state]], becoming constituent parts of a European federation acting as one country.

Traditionally, the term "European Superstate", particularly within the [[United Kingdom]], is used as a criticism of further integration into the EU with the term implying a forced loss of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nigel|last=Farage|authorlink=Nigel Farage|title=The EU and what it costs you|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/eucost.html|website=Sovereignty Journal|accessdate=29 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813190522/http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/eucost.html|archivedate=13 August 2004|deadurl=yes|via=the [[Wayback Machine]]|date=19 June 2000|quote=On the table is the abolition of our national veto in 39 more aspects of legislative competence, a plan to give the EU its own national identity, the creation of a "single judicial space" and further moves to develop the EU's own defence and foreign policy, with plans eventually to create a European army. There can be no doubt about it. The plan is to create a European superstate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has occasionally been used positively in the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph European superstate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simms|first1=Brendan|last2=Rüger|first2=Korbinian|title=Britain should want Europe to become a superstate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11972157/Britain-should-want-Europe-to-become-a-superstate.html|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various versions of the concept have developed over the centuries, many of which are mutually incompatible (inclusion or exclusion of the United Kingdom, secular or religious union, etc.). Such proposals include those from Bohemian King [[George of Podebrady]] in 1464;{{cn|date=January 2018}} [[Duc de Sully]] of France in the seventeenth century;{{cn|date=January 2018}} and the plan of [[William Penn]], the [[Quaker]] founder of [[Pennsylvania]], for the establishment of a "European Dyet, Parliament or Estates".{{cn|date=January 2018}} [[George Washington]] also allegedly voiced support for a "United States of Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. William Fulbright|title=A United States of Europe?|jstor=1026642|work=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|issue=257, Peace Settlements of World War II|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. in association with the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=May 1948|pages=151–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the authenticity of this statement has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed'' [[:wikiquote:Europe|"Europe" on Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[Felix Markham]] notes how, during a conversation on St. Helena, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] remarked: "Europe thus divided into nationalities freely formed and free internally, peace between States would have become easier: the United States of Europe would become a possibility".&lt;ref&gt;Felix Markham, ''Napoleon'' (New York: Penguin Books USA Inc., 1966), 257 as quoted in Matthew Zarzeczny, ''Napoleon's European Union: The Grand Empire of the United States of Europe'' (Kent State University Master's thesis), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; "United States of Europe" was also the name of the concept presented by [[Wojciech Jastrzębowski]] in ''About eternal peace between the nations'', published 31 May 1831. The project consisted of 77 articles. The envisioned United States of Europe was to be an international organisation rather than a superstate. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was an early advocate of a "United States of Europe" and regarded European unification as a logical continuation of the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Cosmopolitanism of Nations|first=Giuseppe|last=Mazzini|chapter=From a Revolutionary Alliance to the United States of Europe|pages=131–135|editor1=Steffano Reccia|editor2=Nadia Urbinati|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACLiOPrOW2kC}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzini created the [[Young Europe]] movement.

The term "United States of Europe" ({{lang-fr|États-Unis d'Europe}}) was used by [[Victor Hugo]], including during a speech at the [[International Peace Congress]] held in Paris in 1849.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Hugo favoured the creation of "a supreme, sovereign senate, which will be to Europe what parliament is to England" and said: "A day will come when all nations on our continent will form a European brotherhood ... A day will come when we shall see ... the United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas".{{cn|date=January 2018}} Hugo planted a tree in the grounds of his residence on the Island of [[Guernsey]] and was noted in saying that when this tree matured the United States of Europe would have come into being. This tree to this day is still growing in the gardens of Maison de Hauteville, [[Saint Peter Port|St. Peter Port]], Guernsey, Victor Hugo's residence during his exile from France.

In 1867, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] joined Victor Hugo at a congress of the League for Peace and Freedom in [[Geneva]]. Here the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] stated: "That in order to achieve the triumph of liberty, justice and peace in the international relations of Europe, and to render civil war impossible among the various peoples which make up the European family, only a single course lies open: to constitute the United States of Europe".{{cn|date=January 2018}} The [[French National Assembly]] also called for a United States of Europe on 1 March 1871.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=dubious}}

Following the catastrophe of the [[First World War]], some thinkers and visionaries again began to float the idea of a politically unified Europe. In 1923, the Austrian Count [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] founded the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa Movement]] and hosted the First Paneuropean Congress, held in [[Vienna]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews Participate in Pan-europe Congress Sessions in Vienna|url=http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=12 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409060558/http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|archivedate=9 April 2017|location=Vienna|language=English|date=5 October 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was for a Europe based on the principles of [[liberalism]], [[Christianity]] and [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name="paneuropa.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paneuropa.org/ |title=Internationale Paneuropa Union - Union Paneuropeénne Internationale - International Paneuropean Union&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215145537/http://www.paneuropa.org/ |archive-date=15 February 2013 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[October Revolution|communist revolution]] in Russia, [[Leon Trotsky]] foresaw a "Federated Republic of Europe — the United States of Europe", created by the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;John Reed, "Ten Days That Shook The World", Boni &amp; Liveright, New York, (March 1919) ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, [[Aristide Briand]], [[French Prime Minister]], gave a speech before the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] in which he proposed the idea of a federation of European nations based on solidarity and in the pursuit of economic prosperity and political and social co-operation.{{cn|date=January 2018}} At the League's request, Briand presented a "Memorandum on the organisation of a system of European Federal Union" in 1930.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 1931, French politician [[Édouard Herriot]] and British civil servant [[Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter|Arthur Salter]] both penned books titled ''The United States of Europe''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=ISBNs please}}
After the First World War, [[Winston Churchill]] had seen continental Europe as a source of threats and sought to avoid Britain's involvement in European conflicts. On 15 February 1930, Churchill commented in the American journal ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' that a "European Union" was possible between continental states, but without Britain's involvement: {{quote|We see nothing but good and hope in a richer, freer, more contented European commonality. But we have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not compromised. We are interested and associated but not absorbed.&lt;ref name="Biddeleux 2002"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=A revision|first=Clive|last=Ponting |editor1-last=Biddeleux| editor1-first=Robert| editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |title= European Integration and Disintegration: east and west|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|pages=36–38 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bu2S8bXsirIC&amp;pg=PA36 |isbn=978-1-134-77522-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
During the 1930s, Churchill was influenced by and became an advocate of the ideas of [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] and his [[Paneuropean Union]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} though Churchill did not advocate Britain's membership of such a union. (Churchill revisited the idea in 1946).

During the World War II victories of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] stated that "the hand of God is creating a new world &amp; working miracles. ... We are becoming the United States of Europe under German leadership, a united European Continent".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Petropoulos, ''Royals and the Reich'', Oxford University Press (2006) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Italian anti-fascists [[Altiero Spinelli]] and [[Ernesto Rossi (politician)|Ernesto Rossi]] finished writing the [[Ventotene Manifesto]], encouraging a federation of European states.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Vayssière,  "Le Manifeste de Ventotene (1941): Acte de Naissance du Federalisme Europeen," ''Guerres Mondiales et Conflits Contemporains'' (Jan 2005), Vol. 55 Issue 217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War II ===
Churchill used the term "United States of Europe" in a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/AboutUs/zurich_e.htm|title=Speech of Sir Winston Churchill|date=19 September 1946|website=PACE website|publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]|location=Zürich, Switzerland|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218054245/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/AboutUs/zurich_e.htm|archivedate=18 February 2013|accessdate=18 November 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech given after the end of the Second World War, Churchill concluded: {{quote|We must build a kind of United States of Europe. In this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|last=Churchill|first=Winston|title=Speech to the Academic Youth|date=19 September 1946|location=Zürich, Switzerland|url=http://www.europa-web.de/europa/02wwswww/202histo/churchil.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100820031147/http://www.europa-web.de/europa/02wwswww/202histo/churchil.htm|archivedate=20 August 2010|accessdate=18 November 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Churchill's was a more cautious approach ("the unionist position") to European integration than was the continental approach that was known as "the federalist position".&lt;ref name="D. Dinan 2005. pages 14–15"&gt;D. Dinan, 2005. Ever Closer Union, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|1-58826-234-0}}. pages 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federalists advocated full integration with a constitution, while the Unionist United Europe Movement advocated a consultative body and the Federalists prevailed at the Congress of Europe.&lt;ref name="D. Dinan 2005. pages 14–15"/&gt; The primary accomplishment of the Congress of Europe was the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which predates the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;D. Dinan, 2005. Ever Closer Union, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|1-58826-234-0}}. page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s and 1960s, Europe saw the emergence of two different projects, the [[European Free Trade Association]] and the much more political [[European Economic Community]]. 

===Early 21st century===
Individuals such as the former [[German Foreign Minister]] [[Joschka Fischer]] have said (in 2000) that he believes that the EU must in the end become a single [[federation]], with its political leader chosen by direct elections among all of its citizens.&lt;ref name="BBC European Superstate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horsley|first1=William|title=Fears of a European superstate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1058155.stm|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=BBC News|date=7 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, claims that the (then) proposed [[Treaty of Nice]] aimed to create a "European superstate" were rejected by former United Kingdom [[European Commissioner]] [[Chris Patten]] and by many member-state governments.&lt;ref name="BBC European Superstate" /&gt; ({{As of|2018}}, the post "[[President of the European Union]]" does not exist, nor are there any plans that it should do so).

== Proposals for closer union ==
The [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] do have many common policies within the EU and on behalf of the EU that are sometimes suggestive of a single state. It has a common executive (the [[European Commission]]), a single [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], a common [[European Security and Defence Policy]], a supreme court ([[European Court of Justice]]{{spaced ndash}}but only in matters of [[European Union law]]) and an intergovernmental research organisation (the EIROforum with members like [[CERN]]). The [[euro]] is often referred to as the "single European currency", which has been officially adopted by nineteen [[Eurozone|EU countries]] while seven other member countries of the European Union have linked their currencies to the euro in [[ERM II]]. In addition a number of European territories outside the EU have adopted the euro unofficially such as [[Montenegro]], the [[Republic of Kosovo]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], the [[Vatican City]] and [[Andorra]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

{{Double image|right|Schengen area single entity.PNG|150|Eurozone single entity.PNG|150|[[Schengen Area]]|[[Eurozone]]}}

Several pan-European institutions exist separate from the EU. The [[European Space Agency]] counts almost all the EU member nations in its membership, but it is independent of the EU and its membership includes nations that are not EU members, notably Switzerland and Norway. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (not to be confused with the European Court of Justice) is also independent of the EU. It is an element of the [[Council of Europe]], which like ESA counts EU members and non-members alike in its membership.

At present, the European Union is a free association of sovereign states designed to further their shared aims.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Other than the vague aim of "ever closer union" in the [[Solemn Declaration on European Union]], the EU (meaning its member governments) has no current policy to create either a federation or a confederation. However, in the past [[Jean Monnet]], a person associated with the EU and its predecessor the [[European Economic Community]], did make such proposals. A wide range of other terms are in use to describe the possible future political structure of Europe as a whole and/or the EU. Some of them, such as "United Europe", are used often and in such varied contexts, but they have no definite constitutional status.

In the United States, the concept enters serious discussions of whether a unified Europe is feasible and what impact increased European unity would have on the United States of America's relative political and economic power. Glyn Morgan, a [[Harvard University]] associate professor of government and social studies, uses it unapologetically in the title of his book ''The Idea of a European Superstate: Public Justification and European Integration.'' While Morgan's text focuses on the security implications of a unified Europe, a number of other recent texts focus on the economic implications of such an entity. Important recent texts here include [[T.R. Reid]]'s ''The United States of Europe'' and [[Jeremy Rifkin]]'s ''The European Dream.'' Neither the ''[[National Review]]'' nor the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' doubt the appropriateness of the term in their reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ramosmrosovsky200412200804.asp|title=Carlos Ramos-Mrosovsky on United States of Europe on National Review Online|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029005255/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ramosmrosovsky200412200804.asp|archivedate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/v51/i44/44a01201.htm Making the Case for a United States of Europe - Research - The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European federalist organisations ===
Various federalist organisations have been created over time supporting the idea of a federal Europe. These include the [[Union of European Federalists]], the [[European Movement International]], the (former) [[European Federalist Party]] and [[Stand Up For Europe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Union of European Federalists ====
The [[Union of European Federalists]] (UEF) is a European non-governmental organisation campaigning for a Federal Europe. It consists of 20 constituent organisations and it has been active at the European, national and local levels for more than 50 years. A young branch called the [[Young European Federalists]] also exists in 30 countries of Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== European Movement International ====
The [[European Movement International]] is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== European Federalist Party ====
The [[European Federalist Party]] was a pro-European, pan-European and federalist political party from 2011 to 2016 which advocated further integration of the European Union.

==== Stand Up for Europe ====
As the successor movement of the [[European Federalist Party]], [[Stand Up For Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of Stand Up for Europe|url=https://www.standupforeurope.eu/|website=Stand Up for Europe|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pan-European NGO that advocates the foundation of a European Federation. Contrary to movements like the UEF or the former EFP, Stand Up for Europe does not command any national levels anymore, but only consists of regional city teams and the European level.

==== Volt Europa ====
[[Volt Europa]] is a pan-European, progressive movement that stands for a new and inclusive way of doing politics and that wants to bring change for European citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.volteuropa.org/about|title=About us|work=Volt|access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party claims that a new pan-European approach is needed to overcome current and future challenges, such as - among others - climate change, economic inequality, migration, international conflict, terrorism, and the impact of the technological revolution on jobs. Volt says that national parties are powerless in front of these challenges, because they go beyond national borders and need to be tackled by Europeans, as one people. As a transnational party, it believes it can help the European people unite, create a shared vision and understanding, exchange good practices across the continent, and come up with working policies.

=== Politicians ===
==== Guy Verhofstadt ====
Following the negative referendums about the [[European Constitution]] in France and the [[Netherlands]], the Belgian ex prime minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] released in November 2005 his book, written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Verenigde Staten van Europa'' ("United States of Europe") in which he claims – based on the results of a [[Eurobarometer]] questionnaire – that the average European citizen wants more Europe. He thinks a federal Europe should be created between those states that wish to have a federal Europe (as a form of enhanced cooperation). In other words, a core federal Europe would exist within the current EU. He also states that these core states should federalise the following five policy areas: a European social-economic policy, technology cooperation, a common justice and security policy, a common diplomacy and a European army. Following the ratification of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] (December 2009) by all member states of the EU, the outline of a common diplomatic service, known as the [[External Action Service of the European Union|External Action Service of the European Union (EEAS)]], was set in place. On 20 February 2009, the [[European Parliament]] also voted in favour of the creation of [[Synchronised Armed Forces Europe|Synchronised Armed Forces Europe (SAFE)]] as a first step towards a forming a true European military force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/4689736/Blueprint-for-EU-army-to-be-agreed.html|title=Blueprint for EU army to be agreed|author=Bruno Waterfield in Brussels|date=18 February 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Verhofstadt's book was awarded the first [[Europe Book Prize]], which is organised by the association Esprit d'Europe and supported by former [[President of the European Commission]] [[Jacques Delors]]. The prize money was €20,000. The prize was declared at the European Parliament in Brussels on 5 December 2007. Swedish crime fiction writer Henning Mankell was the president of the jury of European journalists for choosing the first recipient.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While receiving the reward, Verhofstadt said: "When I wrote this book, I in fact meant it as a provocation against all those who didn't want the European Constitution. Fortunately, in the end a solution was found with the treaty, that was approved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=europa&amp;article=457865&amp;lng=1|title=International news - euronews, latest international news|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206143409/http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=europa&amp;article=457865&amp;lng=1|archivedate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Dutch businessman [[Freddy Heineken]], after consulting with historians of the [[University of Leiden]], [[Henk Wesseling]] and [[Willem van den Doel]] published a brochure "United States of Europe, Eurotopia?". In his work he put forward the idea of creating the United States of Europe as a confederation of 75 states that would be formed according to an ethnic and linguistic principle with a population of 5 to 10 million people. It is noteworthy that in their work in 1992 the authors divided the territory of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, which, in time, disintegrated almost identically to the plan that the brochure had described.&lt;ref name="Tuesday Map: Heineken's „Eurotopia“"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|title=Tuesday Map: Heineken's "Eurotopia"|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/05/26/tuesday-map-heinekens-eurotopia/|accessdate=26 May 2009|work=Foreign Policy|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predictions ==
=== Future superpower ===
{{main article|Potential superpowers}}
The United States of Europe is widely hypotheticised, fictionalised or depicted as a superpower that is as powerful as, or more powerful than, the United States. Some people, such as [[T.R. Reid]], Andrew Reding and [[Mark Leonard (writer)|Mark Leonard]], believe that the power of the hypothetical United States of Europe will rival that of the United States in the twenty-first century. Leonard cites seven factors: [[demographics of Europe|Europe's large population]], [[economy of Europe|Europe's large economy]], Europe's low inflation rates, Europe's central location in the world, the unpopularity and perceived failure of [[foreign relations of the United States|American foreign policy]] in recent years and certain European countries' highly developed [[social organisation]] and [[quality of life]] (when measured in terms such as hours worked per week and income distribution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cer.org.uk/in-the-press/europe-new-superpower Europe: the new superpower by Mark Leonard], ''Irish Times'', Accessed 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts{{who|date=January 2016}} claim that Europe has developed a sphere of influence called the "[[Eurosphere]]".

=== A small power ===
Norwegian foreign policy scholar and commentator [[Asle Toje]] has argued that the power and reach of the European Union more closely resembles a [[small power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=396412|title=The European Union as a Small Power|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The EU As a Small Power'', he argues that the EU is a response to and function of Europe's unique historical experience in that the EU contains the remnants of not one but five past European orders. Although the 1990s and early 2000s have shown that there is policy space for greater EU engagement in European security, the EU has been unable to meet these expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/84efd5fe-bc55-11df-a42b-00144feab49a,s01=1.html Europe heads for Japanese irrelevance] ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Asle Toje expresses particular concerns over the EU's security and defence dimension [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], where attempts at pooling resources and forming a political consensus have failed to generate the results expected. These trends, combined with shifts in global power patterns, are seen to have been accompanied by a shift in EU strategic thinking whereby [[great power]] ambitions have been scaled down and replaced by a tendency towards hedging ''vis-à-vis'' the great powers. The author uses the case of the [[Military operations of the European Union|EUFOR]] intervention in [[Darfur]] and [[Chad]] to illustrate that the EU's effectiveness is hampered by a [[consensus–expectations gap]], owing primarily to the lack of an effective decision-making mechanism. In his view, the sum of these developments is that the EU will not be a great power and is taking the place of a small power in the emerging multi-polar international order.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Opposition ===
The European Union does not include every nation in Europe and there is no consensus among the existing member state governments towards becoming even a loose [[confederation]]. 

In June 2016, the [[Brexit|United Kingdom voted 52% to 48% to leave the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36534802 |title=EU referendum: Vote Leave sets out post-Brexit plans |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polls ===
[[File:EU members where more people in favor of the European Federation.png|thumb|Attitude toward further development of the EU into a federation of nation states according to the [[Eurobarometer]] Poll of spring 2014.&lt;br/&gt;{{legend|#0e5e1b|border=1px solid #666|EU members with more people in favour of a federation than against it}}]]
According to [[Eurobarometer]] (2013), 69% of citizens of the EU were in favour of [[direct election]]s of the [[President of the European Commission]] and 46%  support the creation of a united EU army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-321_en.htm |title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Making the European elections more democratic and boosting participation – Ground is prepared, say two Commission reports |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thirds of respondents think that the EU (instead of a national government alone) should make decisions on foreign policy and more than half of respondents think that the EU should also make decisions on defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reconproject.eu/main.php/RECON_wp_1119.pdf?fileitem=50512030&lt;/ref&gt;

44% of respondents support the future development of the European Union as a federation of nation states, 35% are opposed. The Nordic countries were the most negative towards a united Europe in this study, as 73% of the Nordics opposed the idea.&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb79/eb79_publ_en.pdf Standard Eurobarometer 79 Spring 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the people for whom the EU conjures up a positive image support the further development of the EU into a federation of nation states (56% versus 27%).&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

== Fiction ==
{{sources|section|date=October 2018}}
In the [[fictional universe]] of [[Eric Flint]]'s best selling [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] [[1632 series|''1632'' series]], a United States of Europe is formed out of the Confederation of Principalities of Europe, which was composed of several German political units of the 1630s.&lt;ref name=1632series&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[1632 (novel)|1632]]|date=1 November 2002|page=655|edition=trade paperback (July 2003)|quote=President of the United States, Prime Minister of the United States of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science fiction has made particular use of the idea: ''[[Incompetence (book)|Incompetence]]'', a [[dystopian]] novel by [[Red Dwarf]] creator [[Rob Grant]], is a [[murder mystery]] [[political thriller]] set in a federated Europe of the near future, where stupidity is a constitutionally protected right. References to a European Alliance or European Hegemony have also existed in episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987–1994). In the ''[[Spy High]]'' series of books for young adults, written by [[A. J. Butcher]] and set around the 2060s, a united Europe exists in the form of "Europa", and [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]'s 1995 book ''[[The Aachen Memorandum]]'' details a United States of Europe formed from a fraudulent referendum entitled the Aachen Referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew (1995). ''The Aachen Memorandum''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. {{ISBN|9780297816195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2000s a number of [[computer strategy game]]s set in the future have presented a unified European faction alongside other established military powers such as the United States and Russia. These include [[Battlefield 2#Euro Force|''Euro Force'']] (a 2006 expansion pack to ''[[Battlefield 2]]'') and ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'' (also released in 2006, with a 2007 expansion pack). In ''Battlefield 2142'' a united Europe is shown as one of the two great superpowers on Earth, the other being Asia, despite being mostly frozen in a new [[ice age]]. The disaster theme continues with ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'' (2009), in which a nuclear war between [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], destroying the Middle Eastern oil supply, prompts the EU to integrate further as the "European Federation" in 2018. One game not to make bold claims of full integration is ''[[Shattered Union]]'' (2005), set in a future civil war in the United States, with the EU portrayed as a peacekeeping force. The video game series [[Wipeout (video game series)|''Wipeout'']] instead makes a clear federal reference without a military element: one of the core teams that has appeared in every game is FEISAR. This [[acronym]] stands for Federal European Industrial Science and Research. In the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' set in the 22nd century, the European Union is a sovereign state.

In the backstory of the [[Fallout (video game)|''Fallout'']] series, several European nations joined together after the end of the Second World War, becoming known as the European Commonwealth. Heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East, the Commonwealth began a military invasion of the region in April 2052 once oil supplies began to run dry. This marked the beginning of the Resource Wars. After the oil dried up completely in 2060 and both sides were left in ruins, the Commonwealth collapsed into civil war as member states fought over whatever resources remained. It is not specified whether the European Commonwealth is a single federated nation or just an economic bloc similar to the EU.

'''What Satellite and Digital TV''' was a [[satellite television|satellite]], [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[cable television|cable]] and [[IPTV|broadband]] television [[magazine]] published monthly in the [[United Kingdom]] by MyHobbyStore. Although the magazine was primarily targeted for the UK market, it was also sold in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="sold"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futurelicensing.com/home/titles/WST |title=What Satellite |date= |publisher=Future Publishing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111132503/http://www.futurelicensing.com/home/titles/WST |archivedate=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The magazine was originally launched as '''What Satellite''' by WV Publications in May 1986,&lt;ref&gt;"250 Issues." What Satellite and Digital TV May 2007: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; as an eight page monthly supplement with What Video magazine&lt;ref name="issue 250"&gt;"The Countdown Starts Here." What Satellite and Digital TV, November 24, 2006: 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/leighpreece.html|title=Adventures in Satellite-ville|last=Preece|first=Leigh|accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=Analoguesat}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It became a monthly magazine in May 1989, following the launch of the first [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellite and [[BSkyB|Sky]] TV, and changed its name to What Satellite TV for the October 1992 issue.&lt;ref&gt;What Satellite TV October 1992&lt;/ref&gt; WV Publications was purchased by Highbury House Communications plc in 1998, which published the title until Summer 2005 when Future Publishing acquired What Satellite TV along with the majority of the Highbury House specialist consumer titles for £30.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipp.com/Default.aspx?PageIndex=2002&amp;ItemId=12131|title=Future acquires Highbury’s magazines|date=2005-06-25|accessdate=2008-02-23|publisher=International Federation of the Periodic Press (FIPP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Satellite TV focused exclusively on satellite television, including the [[SES Astra|Astra]] and [[Eutelsat]] satellites and the [[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky Digital]] platform until June 2002 when it also started to cover digital terrestrial television, including [[ITV Digital]], [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Top Up TV]] and renamed itself to its current name. It thereafter covered all aspects of digital TV, including broadband and internet-delivered services such as [[Virgin Media]], [[BT Vision]], [[TalkTalk TV]], the [[BBC iPlayer]] and [[4oD]], and digital radio.&lt;ref&gt;"250 Issues." What Satellite and Digital TV May 2007: 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine incorporated listings for many years, and did so since early editions. It also included features on upcoming TV shows, film reviews and interviews.

In April 2002, What Satellite and Digital TV was the first magazine to discover secret military broadcasts of [[NATO]] spy planes over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] being broadcast and received using a one metre [[satellite dish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17423483.200-why-natos-spy-flicks-are-getting-a-public-airing.html|title=Why NATO's spy flicks are getting a public airing|date=2002-06-22|last=Fox|first=Brian|accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[encryption|encrypted]] the transmissions after the security breach was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/06/13/nato.spyplane/index.html|title=U.S. acts over satellite images|date=2002-06-13|accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was merged with sister title ''Satellite TV Monthly'' (formerly known as ''Satellite TV Europe'', which was purchased by Highbury in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/506990/|title=Highbury buys Millennium|date=2001-11-26|accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=Media Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;) when that magazine ceased publication in 2005;&lt;ref&gt;"250 Issues." What Satellite and Digital TV May 2007: 58.&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the June 2005 issue.

The May 2007 issue of ''What Satellite and Digital TV'' marked the 250th issue of the magazine's publication.&lt;ref name="issue 250" /&gt;

In July 2011, Future Publishing announced its intention to either sell or close the magazine alongside other publications due to a slump in profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/20/future-magazines-close-sell|title=Future to sell or close eight magazines|date=2011-07-20|accessdate=2011-09-19|last=Halliday|first=Josh|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2011, it was announced that MyHobbyStore had purchased the magazine along with sister publications ''Hi-Fi Choice'' and ''Home Cinema Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futureplc.com/2011/10/11/future-completes-the-sale-of-three-audio-visual-brands-to-myhobbystore/|title=Future completes the sale of three audio visual brands to MyHobbyStore|date=2011-10-11|accessdate=2011-10-20|publisher=Future Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2014 a greatly reduced content (32 pages) plus a free Hi-Fi Choice (sister publication) was issued and subscriptions no longer being accepted.

The November issue was the last and the website redirects to Home Cinema Choice.

== Features ==

The magazine featured news, a letters page, reviews on satellite and terrestrial television [[set-top box]]es, [[satellite dish]]es and [[gadget]]s, in depth features on satellite and terrestrial television technology as well as satellite television channel line-up's by satellite and TV listings, plus Certificate X, an article on [[censorship]] in the [[mass media|media]], specifically, but not exclusively dealing with the [[pornography|adult]] satellite television industry.

From the very beginning, ''Živa istina'' is produced by [[Radio Antena M|''Antena M'']], which [[broadcast]]s the talk show through its [[radio program]]. The new air term of ''Živa istina'' is Sunday from 14 P.M.

There is almost no significant politician from the former [[SFRY]] who was not a guest in the ''Živa istina'' ([[Milan Kučan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akdSVrarm5M ''Živa istina'', guest Milan Kučan(2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stjepan Mesić]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYxHxTJQpjw ''Živa istina'', guest Stjepan Mesić (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raif Dizdarević]], [[Haris Silajdžić]], [[Ejup Ganić]], [[Milorad Dodik]], [[Zoran Đinđić]], [[Vojislav Šešelj]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIa6oMR3Tes ''Živa istina'', guest Vojislav Šešelj (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vuk Drašković]], [[Boris Tadić]], [[Aleksandar Vučić]], [[Ramush Haradinaj]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAJ7CiF_v7k ''Živa istina'', guest Ranush Haradinaj (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;...)

Some of the guests in the show were: [[Robert Gelbard]], [[Miroslav Lajčak]], [[Horhe Kapetanić]] and each of [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] political [[leader]]s.

As a matter of fact, ''Živa istina'' is the only political talk show who hosted all leading politicians of its time.
