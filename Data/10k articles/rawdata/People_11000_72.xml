'''Adam Alexander Carrington''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[prime time]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', created by [[Richard and Esther Shapiro]]. Introduced at the beginning of the series' third season, the role was originated by [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]] in 1982. He continued to appear as a series regular until the series finale in 1989. For the 1991 [[miniseries]] continuation, the role of Adam Carrington was recast with [[Robin Sachs]] as Thomson was unavailable.

The addition of Adam to the cast provided a male villain to the show. Over the next seven seasons, Adam would be motivated primarily by jealousy, undermining the professional successes of his brother Steven and brother-in-law Jeff, in an attempt to curry favor with his parents, especially his father. Adam would betray both his parents multiple times but would be forgiven, even when his acts were criminal, due to residual feelings of guilt for Adam's difficult childhood. When circumstances arise that truly make Adam sympathetic, he squanders that good will due to his selfish, jealous nature.

==Original series==

===Characterization===
In 1986, the ''[[New Sunday Times]]'' called Adam "one of the truly imaginative, despicable villains on television", noting that "Adam has raped the butler's daughter, painted poor Jeff Colby's office with poisonous, lead-based paint, tricked Blake into signing over power of attorney while he lay at death's door—and blew a competitor out of the water by plastering his son's homosexuality all over Denver's front pages."&lt;ref name="NST"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&amp;dat=19860615&amp;id=4QNOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bZoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4132,3446313&amp;hl=es |title=From Despair to Success |work=[[New Sunday Times]] |page=6 |date=June 15, 1986 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearances===
Gordon Thomson originated the role of Adam Carrington in "[[The Plea (Dynasty)|The Plea]]", the September 1982 season premiere of ''Dynasty''{{'s}} third season. According to Thomson, "They had planned on Adam being an impostor but they liked him so much they decided to keep him on. They tested me for 13 shows, then extended that to 24."&lt;ref name="NST"/&gt; Thomson played the character until the series finale in 1989.

Adam was recast with British actor [[Robin Sachs]] for the 1991 miniseries ''Dynasty: The Reunion'' because Thomson was unavailable, filming the daytime series ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]''.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/im-gay-gordon-thomson-dynastys-adam-carrington-comes-outand-trashes-cws-reboot|title='I’m Gay': Gordon Thomson, ''Dynasty''{{'s}} Adam Carrington, Comes Out—and Trashes CW's Reboot|first=Tim|last=Teeman|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===

====Season 3====
Former spouses [[Blake Carrington]] and [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Carrington]] make a televised plea for the return of their kidnapped infant grandson [[L.B. Colby]]. While on the air, Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and never recovered. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children [[Fallon Carrington Colby|Fallon]] and [[Steven Carrington|Steven]]. (Alexis first mentions Adam during an argument with Blake in episode 36 during season 2.)

In [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Montana]], an elderly woman named Kate Torrance watches the broadcast from her deathbed. Afterwards, Kate tearfully tells her grandson Michael—who she has raised since he was a baby, telling him he survived the car crash in which his parents died—
that he is really the [[Carrington family|Carrington]] heir. (In fact, the real baby Michael had died along with his parents in the crash. A grief-stricken Kate subsequently kidnapped baby Adam, and raised him as her grandson Michael.) To prove it, she shows him an engraved silver baby rattle with the monogram ''A.A.C.'' Michael is stunned by the news. As her dying wish, Kate tells Michael to find and rejoin his real family. Michael agrees, telling Kate, "My name is Adam Carrington."

Still using the name Michael Torrance, Adam travels to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and checks into the La Miranda Hotel. He meets a beautiful woman, and while they flirt with each other and share a kiss, she playfully refuses to tell him her name. Adam first goes to meet his father. Blake assumes that he is a con-man who saw the TV broadcast. Stunned by Blake's abrupt rejection, Adam leaves without showing him the baby rattle. In episode 41, "The Will," Adam meets his mother, Alexis. She immediately accepts him as her lost child, and they have an emotional reunion. When Alexis introduces Adam to his sister Fallon, they are shocked—she is the woman from the hotel. Adam isn't bothered by their close-call with incest, but notices that it troubles Fallon. Over time, their relationship will remain strained. Alexis and Adam also visit a doubtful Blake, who gradually accepts the idea that Adam could be his son.

Alexis offers Adam, a lawyer, a job at ColbyCo. When she also recruits Fallon's husband [[Jeff Colby]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexis had been married, briefly, to Jeff's uncle Cecil, from whom she inherited ColbyCo.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam is jealous. Revealing his devious nature, Adam has Jeff's office painted with toxic paint. Gradually, Jeff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. In episode 51, Alexis sends Jeff away on a vacation. Realizing that Jeff will "recover" when he's not breathing toxic fumes every day, Adam confesses to Alexis.  Alexis orders Adam to have the paint removed from Jeff's office. Adam warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver-Carrington to her.

During this time, Adam also is attracted to [[Kirby Anders|Kirby]], Jeff and Fallon's nanny. Jeff protects Kirby from Adam's unwanted advances, increasing tension between the two men. In episode 48, a drunken Adam rapes Kirby. In episode 55, Adam attacks Kirby again but she is rescued by Jeff, who proposes to her.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff and Kirby are married in the following episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake and his wife Krystle are suspicious of Alexis when they learn from Jeff's doctors that there was poison in his bloodstream. But Fallon suspects Adam and vows to learn the truth. She notes that Adam is distressed that his family doctor from Billings is in Denver for a conference. Fallon questions Dr. Edwards, who reveals that Adam once won a court case that involved poisoning by toxic paint fumes.

====Season 4====
In episode 66, Alexis warns Adam that if Fallon learns the truth about Jeff's illness that he is on his own. In return, Adam tricks Alexis into signing documents that make it look like she ordered the office to be painted. Alexis travels to Montana to investigate her son's background and learns from Dr. Edwards that Adam had experimented with drugs as a teen and suffered a psychotic breakdown. Alexis is somewhat more sympathetic to Adam at this point, feeling guilty that they gave up the search for their lost son so many years ago, condemning him to such a tragic life. As she does not want his past drug addiction to be widely known, Alexis is resigned to suffer the consequences of his actions. She gives up her control of Denver-Carrington. In episode 71, Adam is attacked by Jeff. Jeff tells him that Kirby (who is now married to Jeff) is pregnant with Adam's child. Surprised, Adam tells Kirby that he wants to be a father to their baby. When he learns that Kirby and Jeff plan to divorce, he proposes. In episode 75, Kirby accepts his proposal. Adam confesses to Blake that he raped Kirby, who is disgusted by his son. Kirby is diagnosed with [[eclampsia]] and must be hospitalized. She suffers from seizures and convulsions and doctors are forced to operate. In episode 77, Adam is distressed to learn that their baby girl has not survived. He tells Kirby gently, devastating her. Stunned with grief, Adam apologizes to Blake and Alexis for the pain that he has caused them. He and Kirby decide to proceed with their wedding plans. However, Alexis blackmails Kirby into leaving Adam, who is crushed when Kirby breaks off their engagement and moves to Paris in the season finale.

====Season 5====
Adam causes great concern when he unwillingly is duped by [[Sammy Jo Carrington|Sammy Jo]], his former sister-in-law into helping her kidnap her son, his nephew, Danny. Steven's wife [[Claudia Carrington|Claudia]] sympathizes with Adam and encourages him to re-kidnap the child back, mollifying the situation.

Adam is also called upon to defend Alexis against charges that she murdered Mark Jennings. Adam and Dex are able to identify Congressman Neal McVane as the killer, and Alexis is acquitted. During this time, Adam mourns the death of his sister Fallon&lt;ref&gt;It will turn out that Fallon is alive and suffering from amnesia&lt;/ref&gt; and discovers that he has another sister, [[Amanda Carrington|Amanda]].&lt;ref&gt;In an interesting scene, Adam and Amanda exchange stories about being "new additions" to the family.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam also grows closer to Claudia, and steps in to comfort her when her marriage to Steven falls apart. Despite Blakes admonition not to become romantically involved with Claudia, he invites her to accompany him to Amanda's wedding to Prince Michael of Moldavia. Adam promises Blake that he'll end the relationship after the wedding, which is interrupted by a terrorist attack.

====Season 6====
After surviving the terrorist attack on Amanda's wedding, Adam proposes to Claudia in episode 121. After they elope in episode 123, a furious Blake disowns Adam and cuts him out of his will. Meanwhile, Claudia pressures Adam to help her acquire an oil well from Blake that she believes is rightfully hers. Adam takes advantage of Blake's health problems&lt;ref&gt;Blake is being slowly poisoned by a Krystle look-alike named Rita Lesley.&lt;/ref&gt; to trick him into signing a Power of Attorney.

Adam is also working with Denver-Carrington on a pipeline project with Colby Enterprises. When he travels to California for a meeting, he encounters his sister Fallon who is alive and suffering from amnesia. Fallon becomes hysterical upon meeting Adam, and accuses him of raping her. Jeff is ready to believe her accusation, but upon further counseling, Fallon realizes that her unresolved conflict over her sexual attraction to Adam when they first met was what triggered her mental breakdown and subsequent disappearance and amnesia.

As part of his work on the pipeline, Adam attempts to bribe State Senator [[Bart Fallmont]]. When Fallmont refuses the bribe, Adam investigates and learns that he is a closeted gay man. Adam leaks stories to the press that Bart is sleeping with Steven, which infuriates his family but ultimately causes Bart to resign, effectively ending opposition to his pipeline deal.

Claudia has been increasingly obsessed with regaining an [[oil well]] from Blake. When Adam cannot help her, she reveals to Blake that Adam took advantage of his illness. Later that night, in the season finale (episode 148) Claudia accidentally sets fire to her hotel room while Adam drowns his sorrows at the hotel bar.

====Season 7====
Adam escapes the hotel fire, but is devastated to learn that Claudia has perished in the blaze.

Adam, working for Alexis at ColbyCo, attempts to seduce his father's assistant Dana Waring. Dana is furious when she learns Adam has used her, but he convinces her that his feelings for her are true. In episode 165, Adam proposes. Dana accepts, although in episode 166, it is revealed that Dana has a secret which she fears could come between them.

In episode 167, Neal McVane is released from prison. He tells Adam that, while in prison, he learned that the real baby Adam Carrington had died during the kidnapping—that he is a fraud. He also claims to have evidence. McVane begins blackmailing Adam who, who has recently reconciled with Blake, is panicked that he will lose everything. Adam feeds McVane insider trading information but his depression causes him to drink heavily. In episode 170, Adam is arrested for DUI. Blake vows to learn what is causing Adam's troubles. In episode 174, Adam confesses to Blake and Alexis that he has learned he is not their son. Adam plans to leave Denver with Dana, but Blake convinces him not to go. In episode 176, the season finale, Adam and Dana are married. Just prior to the wedding, Blake and Alexis present a stunned and grateful Adam with adoption papers—regardless of what McVane says, they consider him to be their son, faults and all. Later, in the 1988 episode "The Scandal", McVane leads Adam to the source of the story about Adam actually being Michael Torrance. Adam discovers that it was fabricated, and that he really is Blake and Alexis' son.&lt;ref&gt;In episode 195, Adam confronts McVane's source on the kidnapping, and learns he is, in fact, really Adam Carrington. Adam later discovers that McVane was lying, and that he is actually Adam Carrington after all.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 8====
On their honeymoon, Adam tells Dana that he wants to start a family. He grows suspicious when Dana keeps avoiding the subject. He follows Dana to her doctor and is crushed to learn that Dana is unable to have children. They decide to hire a surrogate mother, and in episode 181 meet Karen Atkinson. After she becomes pregnant, Adam showers Karen with presents and affection making Dana feel excluded.

Meanwhile, Adam finds himself in conflict with his mother's new husband, [[Sean Rowan]]. Sean is hell-bent on destroying all the Carringtons. Sean blackmails Dana who must eventually confess her secret to Adam. Dana cannot have children due to a botched abortion during high school. What's more, Dana was a student at Adam's high school in Billings (when Adam was still Michael Torrance, naturally). One night during a drunken blackout, the shy and mousy Dana slept with Adam who has no memory of the incident. She was obsessed with him which is what ultimately led her to Denver last year. Adam is stunned by the news and reacts badly, accusing her of killing his child. Adam turns to Karen for comfort. Eventually, Adam forgives Dana and threatens to kill Sean if he hurts Dana again.

Undaunted, Sean pays Karen's ex-husband, Jessie, to reconcile with her, throwing the surrogacy into question. Adam attempts to bribe him to leave town, but Sean forces Jessie to stay. After the baby is born in episode 194, Karen tells Adam that she and Jessie want to keep the baby. During the trial, Alexis reveals that Sean bribed Karen and Jessie. Dana sympathizes with Karen and states that Karen is the rightful mother. Adam moves out of their bedroom.

Just before the end of the trial, the baby is kidnapped. Adam is the primary suspect, but he and Steven discover that Sean is the kidnapper and are able to rescue the baby. In the season finale, custody is awarded to Karen and Jessie.

====Season 9====
A drunk and depressed Adam alienates his family. Dana leaves Adam and moves away from Denver. Adam continues his manipulative ways, attempting to double-cross Jeff on their pipeline work by sleeping with Steven's former secretary, Claire. He also seduces Virginia, Krystle's cousin, and learns of her mysterious past with Dex. Adam learns that Virginia was a prostitute and humiliates her into leaving Denver. When Dex learns of Adam's actions, they come to blows. Dex tells Blake about Adam's behavior causing a rift between father and son.

Adam also flirts with Joanna, Sable Colby's vice-president of [[mergers and acquisitions]], in an attempt to help his mother with a vendetta against Sable. Blake eventually fires Adam who returns to ColbyCo, and offers Joanna a job when Sable fires her. Adam assists Alexis in investigating a mysterious mine on the Carrington property, where a 20-year-old dead body was recently found. Adam discovers a witness who claims he saw Blake put the body in the mine. Adam passes this information to Blake, and then finds the witness dead just moments after seeing Blake leave the witnesses apartment. Blake accuses Adam of setting him up, but Adam insists that something more nefarious is going on. As the mystery deepens, Adam and Alexis learn that the mine holds stolen Nazi treasure and artwork.

Out of spite, Adam has photographs of Jeff and his supposed-sister, Monica, doctored to look like they are sharing a romantic moment. In the chaos that follows, Alexis reveals that Monica is not Jeff's sister and only his cousin as before.

In the final episode of the series, Adam taunts Dex when he learns that Sable is pregnant with his child. The men fight while Alexis, Sable, and Monica watch in horror. When Dex turns his back, Adam rushes him. Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing falling off a second-story balcony.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Dynasty: The Reunion'', it is revealed that Alexis survived the fall, while Dex's fate is left unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Reunion'' (1991)====
Three years after the final episode, Adam is still working for Alexis, having sold out Denver-Carrington to a foreign cartel while Blake was in jail. After Blake's release and subsequent recontrol of his company, Adam and Blake are reconciled once again. In addition, a remorseful Adam is reunited with Kirby.

==Reboot==
A [[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|''Dynasty'' reboot]] premiered on [[The CW]] on October 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/the-cw-fall-premiere-dates-dynasty-valor-the-flash-1202109659/|title=The CW Sets Fall 2017 Premiere Dates For ''Dynasty'' &amp; ''Valor'' And Returning Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 8, 2017|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallon ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]) is kidnapped in the January 2018 episode "[[I Answer to No Man]]", prompting Blake ([[Grant Show]]) to confide in his wife [[Cristal Carrington|Cristal]] ([[Nathalie Kelley]]) that he and Alexis had a son before Steven and Fallon. The baby, Adam, was kidnapped at six months old and never returned. In "[[Don't Con a Con Artist]]", Alexis ([[Nicollette Sheridan]]) tells Steven ([[James Mackay (actor)|James Mackay]]) about Adam, and admits that she spent all of her money trying to find him. A tip from Alexis leads Steven to [[El Paso]] in "[[A Line from the Past]]", where he finds Adam living under the name Hank Sullivan ([[Brent Antonello]]). In "[[Trashy Little Tramp]]", Steven brings Hank/Adam home, but Blake refuses to accept him. Hank's missing finger convinces Blake that he is Adam, but Hank is actually Alexis' lover with whom she is conspiring to amass enough Carrington Atlantic shares to seize control of the company.

'''Alexandra Vasilevna Artyukhina''' (6 November 1889 – 7 April 1969) was an early Russian Bolshevist and revolutionary who rose to sit on the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee]], but was brought down by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[purges]] in the late 1930s.
==Life and career==
The child of textile workers, Artyukhina was born at [[Vyshny Volochyok]]. She became a dressmaker's apprentice at age ten and a mill worker by 17.  She joined the Communist labor movement in Russia, and was forced into exile at age 20 - probably in 1909.  After three years, she returned to Russia and resumed her work, both in textiles and in union organizing.

She was active during the Revolution and rose through the ranks to sit as an alternate member on the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee]] from 1926 to 1930.  On March 1, 1931, international journalists noticed Artukhina as the first woman to sit on the Soviet Supreme Court.  

She assumed leadership of the Cotton Textile Workers Union when a Commissar of light industry, Isadore Lubimoff, was removed.  A collective farm was named for her.

Her industry fell 11% short of its production goal for the first quarter of 1938.  Artukhina and her subordinates were charged with allowing anti-Soviet wreckers to spread their corruption.  She was accused of approving the same quotas for different machines, allowing the neglect of machines, and unnecessarily complicated paperwork.  

After Stalin's death Artyukhina was rehabilitated. She was named a [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] in 1960, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[International Women's Day]], and lies buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

==Biography==

Between 2009 and 2010, he served as the research director of the Middle East Center of the Carnegie Endowment in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. In 2011, he joined the Department of Public Policy and Administration at the [[American University in Cairo]], where he continues to serve today. Hamzawy also serves as an associate professor of political science at the Department of Political Science, [[Cairo University]].

His research and teaching interests as well as his academic publications focus on democratization processes in [[Egypt]], tensions between [[Political freedom|freedom]] and [[Political repression|repression]] in the Egyptian public space, political movements and civil society in Egypt, contemporary debates in Arab political thought, and [[human rights]] and governance in the Arab world.

Hamzawy is a former member of the [[House of Representatives (Egypt)|People’s Assembly]] after being elected in the first Parliamentary elections in Egypt after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]]. He is also a former member of the Egyptian [[National Council for Human Rights]].

==Political activism==
Hamzawy used to work in the Middle East as a research director at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name="Marriage"/&gt;
He played an important role in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] and he was the spokesman of the "Board of Wise Men" set up during the revolution to offer negotiations and possible solutions to the protesters and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Amr Hamzawy is a Member of the National Council for Human Rights since April 2011.[http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=385874 لجنة الحكماء: أبو المجد مقررا عاما وعمرو حمزاوي متحدثا رسميا]&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the installation of [[Ahmed Shafik]] as [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]], Hamzawy was offered the position of Minister of Youth. He declined the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alwafd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18039&amp;catid=102&amp;Itemid=69 Amr Hamzawy refuses the position of Minister of Youth - Al Wafd]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Allan Thomas''' (born 2 January 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arthur Allan Thomas: The Inside Story |last=Wishart |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wishart (journalist) |author2= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Investigate (magazine)|Howling at the Moon Publishing]] |location=New Zealand |isbn=978-0-9582401-7-8 |chapter=chapter 2 |pages=280 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a New Zealand man who was granted a [[Royal Pardon]] and compensation after being wrongfully convicted of the murders of [[Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]] in June 1970. Thomas was married and farming a property in the [[Pukekawa]] district, south of Auckland before the case. Following the revelation that the crucial evidence against him had been faked, Thomas was pardoned and awarded NZ$950,000 in compensation for his 9 years in prison and loss of earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |page=120 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign to overturn the convictions ==
There were numerous inconsistencies in the [[evidence]], which led to an outcry among elements in the farming community and among relatives of Thomas and his wife, Vivien Thomas. That led to the formation of the Arthur Thomas Retrial Committee.

The report by a retired judge, Sir George MacGregor, which rejected the appeal for a retrial was also riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. However, a report on that by journalist Terry Bell, then deputy editor of the ''[[Auckland Star]]'' Saturday edition, was rejected for publication on the grounds that "it is not the role of the newspapers to attempt to try the courts". Bell then resigned and produced the booklet ''Bitter Hill'', which is the English meaning of Pukekawa, outlining inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and the theory advanced by the retrial committee. It provided the impetus for a national campaign that eventually led to a controversial retrial where the jury was housed incommunicado with police in a local hotel. Thomas was again convicted.

[[Pat Booth (journalist)|Pat Booth]], the assistant editor of the ''Auckland Star'', attended the retrial and became concerned. As part of the campaign for a pardon, Booth wrote a book, ''Trial by Ambush''. That was followed by another campaigning book, ''Beyond Reasonable Doubt'', by British investigative author [[David Yallop]], which was subsequently made into [[Beyond Reasonable Doubt (1982 film)|a film of the same name]].&lt;ref name=nzonscreen&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/beyond-reasonable-doubt-1980|publisher=nzonscreen.com|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas received a pardon, and a Royal Commission report explicitly stated that detectives had used ammunition and a rifle taken from his farm to fabricate false evidence against him. A 2014 police review of the case acknowledged police misconduct was probably the explanation for the key evidence against Thomas, a spent cartridge case.&lt;ref&gt;Crewe murders: Police admit cartridge planted, http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10327013/Crewe-murders-Police-admit-cartridge-planted Retrieved 13. 12. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal Commission of inquiry ==
A [[Royal Commission|Royal Commission of Inquiry]] was established, headed by retired [[New South Wales]] Justice Robert Taylor. It declared Thomas to have been wrongfully charged and convicted and found that among other improprieties, police had planted a .22 rifle cartridge case in the garden of the house in which the murders were committed. The case was found four months and ten days after the area had already been subjected to one of the most intensive police searches ever undertaken. The cartridge case was said to have come from a rifle belonging to Thomas.  However, the police tested only 64 rifles in an area where this weapon was common and found that two, including the one belonging to Thomas – could have fired the cartridge case found in the garden. That was the link to the deaths of the Crewes although it was later admitted that the case was "clean" and uncorroded when it was found. As such, the condition of the case was inconsistent with having lain in the garden, exposed to weather and dirt for more than four months.

=== No action against police officers ===

== Subsequent events ==

In 2009 Arthur Allan Thomas travelled to Christchurch to support [[David Bain]], who also had criminal convictions against him overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/1762341|title=Arthur Allan Thomas in Christchurch to support Bain |date=2 March 2009|publisher=[[The Press]]|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he collaborated with investigative journalist [[Ian Wishart (journalist)|Ian Wishart]] on the book ''Arthur Allan Thomas'', where for the first time he gave his perspective on his life, from before the murders to the present.

The two detectives who planted the shell which helped convict Thomas are now dead. Johnston died in 1978. Bruce Hutton, 83, died in [[Middlemore Hospital]] in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10874822 Crewe 'plant' cop dies]&lt;/ref&gt; At Hutton's funeral, Deputy Commissioner Mike Bush praised Mr Hutton and said he was known for having "integrity beyond reproach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/9111858/Disgust-at-probe-into-Thomas-case&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' said: "that was clearly absurd.

'''Assia''' (born on November 1, 1973, in [[Algiers]]) is an [[Algeria]]n-born [[France|French]] singer with [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] origins. Her albums mixed French variety, [[contemporary R&amp;B|rhythm and blues]], and [[Mizrahi music|Oriental music]]. She had great success with her hit singles "Elle est à toi" and "Là-bas".

==Biography==
At a young age, she spent twelve years at the classical conservatory in [[Créteil]] (near Paris), then a few years later obtained a law degree.

From 1998 to 1999, Assia participated in "Une Affaire de famille" with [[Stomy Bugsy]], [[Passi]] and [[Doc Gynéco]] of the Sector A and the soundtracks of the movies ''[[Taxi (1998 movie)|Taxi]]'' and ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' with the song "Ghir Dini".

In 2000, she released her first album entitled ''Chercheuse d'or'' (recorded in Paris, Toulouse and Los Angeles). Assia wrote the texts and his brother Khalil signed the music. Her first top single "Elle est à toi" (over 700,000 copies) was written in collaboration with Calbo of Arsenik. The second single is "Là-bas" (music video directed by J.G. Biggs).

In 2002, Assia played in the musical ''Cindy'' with Lââm in the lead role.

In 2003, she released a single with [[Beenie Man]], "Street Life".

In 2005, Assia released her second album, ''Encore et Encore'', recorded in Spain, whose second single "Politiquement Correct" was co-written with [[Diam's]].

He was detained and interrogated by [[Hamas]], and has been missing since then.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Israelis missing after disappearing into Gaza, one being held by Hamas|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.663653|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family has stated that he is mentally unstable and had been admitted to a mental hospital in the past. He had been treated with medication, which he stopped taking a few weeks prior to his crossing.&lt;ref name=Haaretz17&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas official: Mengistu isn’t mentally unstable, captured during Gaza war|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.666501|work=Haaretz|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Mengistu was born in [[Ethiopia]], the fourth of ten children in Haili and Agumesh Mengistu's family. He made ''[[aliyah]]'' (''i.e.'', immigrated to Israel) with his family at age five and grew up in a low income neighborhood in [[Ashkelon]], which is {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} from Gaza. His mother cleaned houses for a living, while his father became chronically unemployed, and his parents divorced in 2012.&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/03/2-israelis-who-entered-gaza-held-incommunicado |title=2 Israelis Who Entered Gaza Held Incommunicado |date=May 2, 2017 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Tal Harris described the Mengistu family as extremely underprivileged and belonging to the poorest socio-economic sector of Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Avera-Hisham-and-Jumma-need-us-475079|title=Avera, Hisham and Jumma Need Us|last=Harris|first=Tal|date=December 11, 2016|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mengistu attended public schools. After finishing high school, Mengistu worked in a series of odd jobs, including recycling.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

In 2011, Mengistu began to experience mental health problems after his older brother Masrashau died. He became withdrawn from his family and friends. He tied a piece of string around one of his fingers so tightly it cut off the blood flow, causing severe [[gangrene]] that led to the amputation of the finger. He quit his job and refused to accept benefits from the [[Bituah Leumi|National Insurance Institute]]. He also began asking friends for money and traveling alone through various parts of Israel. At one point, his family considered him missing until police located him almost {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} away in [[Tiberias]]. He agreed to undergo psychiatric treatment and was hospitalized voluntarily in a mental facility in [[Beersheba]] for 12 days in January 2013, but his family did not think he seemed better when he was released. Five days later, they had him committed involuntarily for a week, but after his release, he threw away his medication. According to his brother, his condition worsened.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mako" /&gt; 

In March 2013, Mengistu was exempted from mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] after a medical committee found him unfit for service. According to a childhood friend, in the year before his disappearance, his condition further worsened, and he began to hurt himself and talk illogically.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

== Incident ==
On September 7, 2014, Mengistu asked his mother to give him money. When she told him she did not have any, he became angry and left at about noon without saying anything. He then walked to a beach in [[Zikim]] and arrived at the security fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip. An Israeli patrol who were guarding electrical work spotted him carrying a bag near the security fence with Gaza and let him pass. One of the soldiers later said he thought Mengistu was a Sudanese refugee who had decided to move to Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/item/2871432]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mako&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mako.co.il/news-israel/local-q3_2015/Article-c5aa0659d497e41004.htm |title=מי אתה אברה מנגיסטו? |trans-title=Who Are You, Avera Mengistu? |language=he |first=Yigal |last=Mosko |date=July 10, 2015 |publisher=Mako.il |accessdate=April 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A security camera on an army watchtower noticed him trying to climb the fence, and the patrol that had let him pass earlier was notified. By the time they arrived, Mengistu had reached the top of the fence. They called for him to stop and fired a warning shot into the air, but he ignored them and scaled the fence. He left behind the bag, which was found to contain slippers, a towel, a Bible, and a few other books, one of which had his name on it.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mako/&gt; Since then, he has not been seen by any Israeli.&lt;ref name="Ynet_swap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel: No Hamas prisoner release for two missing Israelis|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4678328,00.html|publisher=Ynet|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel contacted the [[Red Cross]] and officials in the Gaza Strip and demanded that Mengistu be returned to Israel.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Initially, a Hamas official said Mengistu was interrogated and seemed to have psychological problems. Israeli officials said there is "credible intelligence" that Hamas holds Mengistu "against his will".&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amid Detente With Hamas, Israel Says 2 Citizens Held in Gaza |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/09/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 9, 2015 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712020204/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/09/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html |archivedate=July 12, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2017 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Moussa Abu Marzouk]], deputy chairman of Hamas' political bureau, said in an interview with [[Al Jazeera]] that Mengistu wore a uniform, was mentally healthy, and that his case had came up during truce negotiations related to the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], which took place weeks before the date Israel says Mengistu crossed into Gaza.&lt;ref name="Haaretz17" /&gt;

==Gag order==
In Israel, a blanket [[gag order]] regarding the incident was put into place. It lasted 10 months, until July 9, 2015. Discussions took place in social media forums and some reports were published on foreign websites.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; Some clues about the affair were leaked to different Arabic media outlets, from which the story made its way to international media and was published by blogger [[Richard Silverstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Israelis are held in Gaza|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3663949,00.html|work=[[Maariv]]|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gag order was lifted following a request from ''[[Haaretz]]''.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;  The [[Associated Press]] speculated that a statement made by [[Khaled Mashaal]] the previous day, in which he spoke of an Israeli request through a European intermediary for the release of "two soldiers and two bodies", may have "forced Israel's hand".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

[[Amir Rapaport]] of [[Makor Rishon]] wrote, "The main reason for the low profile in which the incident was dealt with was the fear that public announcement will make it difficult for Hamas to return Mengistu to Israel, since a massive [Palestinian] public pressure will be applied to Hamas to not return him without an extensive deal of prisoners swap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapaport|first1=Amir|title=A question of responsibility|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic efforts ==
The Mengistu family went to [[Geneva]] in 2015 to meet with human rights organizations, including the Red Cross and [[Amnesty International]], in an effort to gain their assistance and to put pressure on Hamas to release Avera. The family provided medical documentation of his hospitalizations and his need for daily medication and therapy, as well as proof he did not serve in the army, carry any weapon, and was in no way involved in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The family returned to Israel with the promise of help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/831/275.html |title='שנתיים להיעלמות אברה: 'לא ניתן לקולו לידום |trans-title=Two Years After Avera's Disappearance: 'You Cannot Let His Voice Go Unheard' |language=he |first= |last= |date=September 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Nrg.co.il]] |accessdate=April 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report condemning Hamas for holding Mengistu and [[Hisham al-Sayed]], another Israeli, [[wikt:incommunicado|incommunicado]], calling on the group to "officially and unconditionally disclose" whether it was holding the men and to free them unless "a credible legal basis" for holding them could be provided. In its report, Human Rights Watch wrote that both men had histories of mental health problems. The report also said that although Hamas' military wing had referred to both men as soldiers, Mengistu had been deemed "unfit for [military] service" by the IDF and al-Sayed had been discharged three months after he volunteered in 2008 as "incompatible for service". The report added that photos of the men in military uniforms circulated by Hamas appeared to have been "photoshopped".&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rights-group-blasts-hamas-for-holding-mentally-ill-israelis/ |title=Rights group blasts Hamas for holding 2 'mentally ill' Israelis |date=May 3, 2017 |work=[[The Times of Israel]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt; When the report was released, [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said "Hamas's refusal to confirm its apparent prolonged detention of men with mental health conditions and no connection to the hostilities is cruel and indefensible. No grievance or objective can justify holding people incommunicado and bartering over their fates."&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

==Allegations of racist bias==
Critics say the Mengistu family is being treated poorly because of their Ethiopian ethnicity. Avera's brother, Yalo, has stated that if Avera were white, the affair would have been handled differently.&lt;ref name="haaretz" /&gt; A message sent on Hamas' Twitter account said, "Obviously, the real Israeli motto is 'leave no Ashkenazi man behind,'" an apparent reference to the military and diplomatic efforts made by Israel on behalf of captured soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] and the lack of such efforts on Mengistu's behalf.&lt;ref name="Ynet_hamas"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas takes a jab at Israel over missing Israeli Ethiopian|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4678288,00.html|publisher=Ynet|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamas demands==
In 2016, Hamas demanded the release of 60 Palestinian prisoners who were released as part of the [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange]] and subsequently rearrested as the "entry fee" to start negotiating for the release of Mengistu and for the separation of his negotiation from other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas: Two conditions before any negotiation on prisoners|url=http://aawsat.com/home/article/602486/%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A1-%D8%A3%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%89|publisher=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]|date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EntryFee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ashkelonim.co.il/articles/1885/?full=1|title=דיווח: מו"מ לעסקת שבויים בה יושב גם תושב העיר|last=|first=|date=July 12, 2016|work=|access-date=|publisher=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed Israeli official said in July 2016 that Hamas wanted a deal similar to the Shalit exchange, in which hundreds of prisoners would be released in return for the bodies of IDF soldier [[Death and ransoming of Oron Shaul|Oron Shaul]] and IDF officer Hadar Goldin and the living civilians Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, an Israeli Bedouin held by Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas seeks another Shalit deal for soldiers' bodies, missing civilians|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4823893,00.html|publisher=Ynet|date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
In June 2017, the IDF gave Mengistu's family a copy of the security camera footage showing him crossing into Gaza. They had been shown the tape several months after his disappearance, but a few years later they requested a copy of their own. When she accepted the tape from representatives from the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense Ministry]] and IDF Intelligence Unit, Mengistu's mother said "I would have preferred to see footage of my son Avraham Mengistu returning home. My son Avera struggles with mental health disabilities and there is a daily concern for his life. The delivery of the recording does not exempt the state of its responsibility to operate to return my son to his country."&lt;ref name=JPost&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Family-of-Israeli-said-held-by-Hamas-gets-tape-of-him-crossing-into-Gaza-497166 |title=Family of Israeli said held by Hamas gets tape of him crossing into Gaza |first=Yossi |last=Melman |authorlink=Yossi Melman |date=June 18, 2017 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=December 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mengistu's father feels that the government is not being transparent with him. On 2 July 2018, he spoke at a conference organized by [[Yehiel Bar|MK Hilik Bar]] to focus public attention on Mengistu's situation. "I asked them for Avera's bag, which was [found] after the incident," he said. "The bag still had clothes; the bag looked bad because they fired upon [Avera], warning shots. There is a 'conspiracy of silence' with Israel's security forces. I ask, why don't they tell us the whole story, everything that happened there. I ask from you, from the public and from the government, to help me."&lt;ref&gt;Oren Oppenheimer (July 3, 2018).

== Early life ==
Omalu was born in Nnokwa, [[Idemili South]], [[Anambra]] in southeastern [[Nigeria]] on September 30, 1968,&lt;ref ? name="BENNETOMALUFOUNDATIONBIO"/&gt; the sixth of seven siblings. He was born during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], which caused his family to flee from their home in the predominantly [[Igbo people|Igbo]] village of [[Enugwu Ukwu|Enugu-Ukwu]] in southeastern Nigeria. They returned two years after Omalu's birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Concussion|publisher = Random House Trade Paperbacks|date = 2015-11-24|isbn = 9780812987577|first = Jeanne Marie|last = Laskas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omalu's mother was a [[seamstress]] and his father a civil [[mining engineer]] and community leader in Enugu-Ukwu. The family name, Omalu, is a shortened form of the surname, Onyemalukwube, which translates to "he who knows, speak."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Education and career==
Omalu began primary school at age three and earned entrance into the [[Federal Government College Enugu]] for secondary school. He attended medical school starting at age 16 at the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]]. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) in June 1990, he completed a clinical internship, followed by three years of service work doctoring in the highland city of [[Jos]]. He became disillusioned with Nigeria after presidential candidate [[Moshood Abiola]] failed to win the Nigerian presidency during an [[Nigerian presidential election, 1993|inconclusive election]] in 1993&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and began to search for scholarship opportunities in the United States. Omalu first came to [[Seattle]], Washington in 1994 to complete an [[epidemiology]] fellowship at the [[University of Washington]]. In 1995, he left Seattle for [[New York City]], where he joined [[Columbia University]]'s [[Harlem Hospital Center]] for a residency training program in [[anatomic pathology|anatomic]] and [[clinical pathology]].

After residency, he trained as a forensic pathologist under noted forensic consultant [[Cyril Wecht]] at the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] Coroner's Office in Pittsburgh. Omalu became particularly interested in [[neuropathology]].

Omalu holds eight advanced degrees and [[board certification]]s, later receiving fellowships in pathology and neuropathology through the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 2000 and 2002 respectively, a [[Professional degrees of public health|Master of Public Health]] (MPH) in epidemiology in 2004 from [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health]], and a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) from [[Tepper School of Business]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="BENNETOMALUCVUCDAVIS"&gt;[https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pathology/our_team/faculty/OmaluB/BennetIOmaluMD,MBA,MPH,CPE,CurriculumVitaeAndTestimonies,August2015.pdf "CV: Bennet Omalu"], UC Davis Medical Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Omalu served as chief [[medical examiner]] of [[San Joaquin County, California]] from 2007 until he resigned in 2017 after accusing the county's Sheriff, who doubles as Coroner, of repeatedly interfering with death investigations to protect law enforcement officers who killed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Small |first = Julie |title = Autopsy Doctor Resigns, Says Sheriff Overrode Death Findings to Protect Officers |newspaper = KQED |date = December 4, 2017 |url = https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/12/04/autopsy-doctors-sheriff-overrode-death-findings-to-protect-law-enforcement/ |access-date = 2017-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An assistant forensic pathologist who joined the office for the opportunity to work with Omalu resigned a few days earlier citing similar allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Small |first = Julie |title = Autopsy Doctor Quits, Alleges Sheriff Interfered in Death Probes |newspaper = KQED |date = November 27, 2017 |url = https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/11/27/autopsy-doctor-quits-alleges-sheriff-interfered-in-death-probes/ |access-date = 2017-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Omalu is a professor in the [[UC Davis]] Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bennet Omalu, M.D., M.B.A., MPH, CPE, DABP-AP, CP, FP, NP|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pathology/our_team/faculty/OmaluB.html|publisher=University of California, Davis Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on CTE==
{{Main article|Concussions in American football|Concussions in sport|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|l3=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)}}
Omalu's autopsy of former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] player [[Mike Webster]] in 2002 led to the re-emergence of awareness of a neurologic condition associated with chronic head trauma called [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE, which had been previously described in boxers&lt;ref&gt;Sabharwal RK, Sanchetee PC, Sethi PK, Dhamija RM. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in boxers. J Assoc Physicians India. 1987 Aug;35(8):571-3.&lt;/ref&gt; and other professional athletes. Webster had died suddenly and unexpectedly following years of struggling with cognitive and intellectual impairment, destitution, mood disorders, depression, drug abuse, and suicide attempts. Although Webster's brain looked normal at autopsy, Omalu conducted independent and self-financed tissue analyses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He suspected that Webster suffered from [[dementia pugilistica]], which is a form of dementia that is induced by repeated blows to the head, a condition found previously in boxers. Using specialized staining, Omalu found large accumulations of [[tau protein]] in Webster's brain, which affect mood, emotions, and [[executive functions]] similar to the way that clumps of [[Amyloid beta|beta-amyloid protein]] contribute to [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Together with colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], Omalu published his findings in the journal ''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]'' in 2005 in a paper titled "Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player." In it, Omalu called for further study of the disease: "We herein report the first documented case of long-term neurodegenerative changes in a retired professional NFL player consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This case draws attention to a disease that remains inadequately studied in the cohort of professional football players, with unknown true prevalence rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in a National Football League player|journal = Neurosurgery|date = 2005-07-01|issn = 1524-4040|pmid = 15987548|pages = 128-134; discussion 128-134|volume = 57|issue = 1|first = Bennet I.|last = Omalu|first2 = Steven T.|last2 = DeKosky|first3 = Ryan L.|last3 = Minster|first4 = M.

Omalu later partnered with Julian Bailes, a neurosurgeon, concussion researcher, and then chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], and West Virginia attorney Robert P. Fitzsimmons to found the [[Brain Injury Research Institute]] which established a brain and tissue bank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 2006, Omalu published a second ''Neurosurgery'' paper based on his findings in the brain of former NFL player [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]], who suffered from depression and committed suicide in 2005. Though Long died at 45, Omalu found tau protein concentrations more consistent with "a 90-year-old brain with advanced Alzheimer's."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As with Mike Webster, Omalu asserted that Long's football career had caused later brain damage and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in a national football league player: part II|journal = Neurosurgery|date = 2006-11-01|issn = 1524-4040|pmid = 17143242|pages = 1086-1092; discussion 1092-1093|volume = 59|issue = 5|doi = 10.1227/01.NEU.0000245601.69451.27|first = Bennet I.|last = Omalu|first2 = Steven T.|last2 = DeKosky|first3 = Ronald L.|last3 = Hamilton|first4 = Ryan L.|last4 = Minster|first5 = M. Ilyas|last5 = Kamboh|first6 = Abdulrezak M.|last6 = Shakir|first7 = Cyril H.|last7 = Wecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omalu also found evidence of CTE in the brains of retired NFL players [[Justin Strzelczyk]] (d. 2004 at 36 years old), [[Andre Waters]] (d. 2006 at 44), and [[Tom McHale (American football)|Tom McHale]] (d. 2008 at 45).

In summer 2007, Bailes presented his and Omalu's findings to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] at a league-wide concussion summit. Bailes later said that the research was "dismissed". The NFL's MTBI committee chair, [[Ira Casson|Dr. Ira Casson]], told the press: "In my opinion, the only scientifically valid evidence of a chronic encephalopathy in athletes is in boxers and in some Steeplechase jockeys."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The NFL did not publicly acknowledge the link between concussions sustained in football and long-term neurological effects until December 2009,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; seven years after Omalu's discovery. However, as late as 2013, the annual meeting of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN) included a debate between two sports concussion experts regarding the validity (or existence) of CTE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130619132354.htm "Sports concussions debate: Does CTE really exist?"]. [[Science Daily]]. Loyola University Health System. June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in March 2016, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety policy, Jeff Miller, testified before congress that the NFL now believed that there was a link between football and CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/sports/nfl-concussions-cte-football-jeff-miller.html|title=N.F.L.

Omalu has also discovered CTE in the brains of military veterans, publishing the first documented case in a November 2011 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in an Iraqi war veteran with posttraumatic stress disorder who committed suicide|journal = Neurosurgical Focus|date = 2011-11-01|issn = 1092-0684|pmid = 22044102|pages = E3|volume = 31|issue = 5|doi = 10.3171/2011.9.FOCUS11178|first = Bennet|last = Omalu|first2 = Jennifer L.|last2 = Hammers|first3 = Julian|last3 = Bailes|first4 = Ronald L.|last4 = Hamilton|first5 = M.

Omalu's paper links PTSD to the CTE spectrum of diseases and calls for further study.

Omalu is lead author in a study published in November 2017&lt;ref name="FDDNP-PET"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Omalu |first = Bennet |author2 = et al |title = Postmortem Autopsy-Confirmation of Antemortem [F-18]FDDNP-PET Scans in a Football Player With Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy |journal = Neurosurgery |date = 2017 |doi = 10.1093/neuros/nyx536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that for the first time confirmed CTE in a living person. A chemical [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]], FDDNP, binds to tau proteins, detectable by [[positron emission tomography]], and associated with the distinctive topographical distributions characteristic of CTE. Tested on at least a dozen former NFL players, it was confirmed postmortem in former linebacker [[Fred McNeill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Kounang |first = Nadia |title = Ex-NFL player confirmed as 1st case of CTE in living patient.

== Stephon Clark report ==
{{Main article|Shooting of Stephon Clark}}

In March 2018 Omalu conducted an independent autopsy of [[Shooting of Stephon Clark|Stephon Clark]], who had been shot by [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] Police officers.  On March 30, he released his findings, stating that Clark had been shot eight times from the back or side, adding, "You could reasonably conclude that he received seven gunshot wounds from his back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/30/stephon-clark-independent-autopsy-results-announced-friday/472507002/|title=Stephon Clark shot 8 times, mostly in back, independent autopsy finds|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/us/stephon-clark-independent-autopsy.html|title=Stephon Clark Was Shot 8 Times Primarily in His Back, Family-Ordered Autopsy Finds|last=Robles|first=Frances|date=2018-03-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-01|last2=Real|first2=Jose A.

==In popular media==
Omalu's efforts to study and publicize CTE in the face of NFL opposition were reported in a ''[[GQ]]'' magazine article in 2009 by journalist [[Jeanne Marie Laskas]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Game Brain: Football Players and Concussions|url = https://www.gq.com/story/nfl-players-brain-dementia-study-memory-concussions|work = [[GQ]]| last=Laskas|first= Jeanne Marie|accessdate = 9 November 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151111053002/http://www.gq.com/story/nfl-players-brain-dementia-study-memory-concussions | archivedate= 11 November 2015| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later expanded by Laskas into a book, ''Concussion'' (Penguin Random House, 2015), and adapted into a [[Concussion (2015 film)|film of the same name]] where Omalu, portrayed by [[Will Smith]], is the central character. The film has been criticized for not being truthful to the actual events.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (December 21, 2015). [http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2015/12/the_truth_about_will_smith_s_concussion_and_bennet_omalu.html "''Concussion Lies'': The film about the NFL's apparent CTE epidemic feeds the pervasive national myths about head trauma."].

[[CBS New York]]. December 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the movie's production led to the creation of a foundation named after Omalu to advance CTE and concussion research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About the Foundation {{!}} Bennet Omalu Foundation|url = http://bennetomalufoundation.org/about-the-foundation/|website = bennetomalufoundation.org|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Omalu attracted media attention when he suggested on [[Twitter]] that [[Hillary Clinton]] was possibly poisoned and advised members of her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] to "perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton's blood."

'''Boa Sr''' (''[[circa]]'' 1925&amp;nbsp;– 26 January 2010) was an [[India]]n [[Great Andamanese]] elder. She was the last person fluent in the [[Aka-Bo language]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5509 |title=Andaman tribe’s extermination complete as last member dies |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=2016-07-27 |quote= |publisher=[[Survival International]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boa Sr is not to be confused with another Great Andamanese tribal member, Boa Jr; the two women were not directly related. Boa Jr's late mother, Boro (who was also the last speaker of her language, [[Aka-Kora language|Aka-Kora]]) was Boa Sr's best friend and named her daughter in her honor.

==Biography==
Boa was born around 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alastair Lawson  |coauthors= |title=Last speaker of ancient language of Bo dies in India |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8498534.stm |quote=The last speaker of an ancient language in India's Andaman Islands has died at the age of about 85, a leading linguist has told the BBC. |work=[[BBC]] |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, To, belonged to the [[Bo people (Andaman)|Bo people]] and her father, Renge, belonged to the [[Jeru people]]. Boa's early life was spent in [[Mayabunder]], a town on [[Middle Andaman Island]]. She was married at a young age to Nao, another member of her father's people, although both he and their children predeceased her. She regarded the [[Jeru language]] as her mother tongue.&lt;ref name=adam/&gt;&lt;ref name="andamanese1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanese.net/generalia.html|title=Boa Sr. profile|publisher=Andamanese.net |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208214255/http://www.andamanese.net/generalia.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boa Sr. lived through the [[epidemic]] brought by the British to the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], which devastated the Great Andamanese population, and also through the [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=adam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanese.net/BoaSr_Obituary.html |title=Bo Sr.'s obituary |publisher=Andamanese.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, she and other Great Andamanese was forcibly relocated by the government of India to [[Strait Island]], a small tribal reserve east of [[Baratang Island]].&lt;ref name=adam/&gt;

Boa Sr. worked with [[Anvita Abbi]], a professor of [[linguistics]] at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[Delhi]], since 2005. Abbi studied and recorded Boa's language and songs.&lt;ref name="andamanese1"/&gt; Other members of the Great Andamanese speech community had difficulty understanding the songs and narratives which she knew in Bo.&lt;ref name="andamanese1"/&gt; She also spoke the Andamanese [[dialect]] of [[Hindi]], as well as [[Great Andamanese creole]], a mix of the ten indigenous languages of Andamans.

Boa Sr. survived the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] by climbing a tree. She later explained her escape from the [[tsunami]] saying, "We were all there when the [[earthquake]] came. The eldest told us the [[Earth]] would part, don't run away or move."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=|title=Boa Sr. |encyclopedia=Lives Remembered |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7207731/Lives-Remembered.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, Nao Jer, died several years before she did and the couple had no children. She suffered from some vision loss during her later life, but was considered to be in good health until shortly before her death in 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

Boa Sr. died at a hospital in [[Port Blair]] on 26 January 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Boa Sr., who was approximately 85 years old, was the oldest living member of the Great Andamanese tribes at the time.&lt;ref name=telegraph2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Language lost as last member of Andaman tribe dies  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7161422/Language-lost-as-last-member-of-Andaman-tribe-dies.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=|date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boa Sr.'s death left just 52&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; surviving Great Andamanese people in the world, none of whom remember any Bo. Their population is greatly reduced from the estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living in the Andaman Islands at the time of the arrival of the British in 1858.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Stephen Corry]], director of the [[United Kingdom|British]]-based [[NGO]] [[Survival International]], issued a statement saying, "With the death of Boa Sr. and the extinction of the Bo language, a unique part of human society is now just a memory. Boa's loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Watt |title=Ancient tribal language becomes extinct as last speaker dies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/04/ancient-language-extinct-speaker-dies|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Narayan Choudhary also explained what the loss of Boa Sr. meant in both academic and personal terms, "Her loss is not just the loss of the Great Andamanese community, it is a loss of several disciplines of studies put together, including [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]]. To me, Boa Sr. epitomised a totality of humanity in all its hues and with a richness that is not to be found anywhere else."

There were four viable tickets running for election for the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)|Hong Kong Island constituency]]. The left was represented by the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]]'s ticket, consisting of [[Ma Lik]] and [[Choy So-yuk]]; and the centrist ticket was represented by [[Rita Fan]].

The pan-democratic camp decided, after strategising, to put up two tickets for election: the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]'s ticket with [[Martin Lee]] and [[Yeung Sum]], and [[Audrey Eu]] and Cyd Ho's ticket. The thinking was that the remainder vote on both these tickets was sufficient to return all four candidates to office, providing that voters in the pan-democratic camp were coordinated effectively. Cyd Ho was defeated by a slim margin (815 out of a total of about 350,000, or 0.23%) to her nearest DAB rival, Choy So-yuk.

Originally, the slogan "1+1=4" was taken as a way to strategically allocate votes between the two pan-democratic camp tickets, namely that a spouse from each couple would vote for each ticket. Conspiracy theorists claim that, during the final days leading up to the election, the Democratic Party believed it could secure a seat for their third candidate, Lai Chi-Keung. The Democratic Party hence allegedly requested all supporters of the pan-democratic camp in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency to vote for them, claiming that Audrey Eu's star presence on the other ticket was strong enough to skew votes to the other ticket.

In the end, Lai ended up a few hundred votes short of Cyd Ho, costing them both the chance for a seat. This ultimately benefited Cyd Ho's DAB rival Choy So-yuk. A number of disgruntled voters of the pan-democratic camp demanded that then-DP chairman Yeung Sum and Founding chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming both step down in consequence. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Post-election==
In addition to remaining as a key member of the Frontier until 2006, Ho hosted weekly radio programmes on two local radio stations in 2006 – on [[RTHK]] and [[PRHK]]. She hosted a radio show on the [[internet radio]] station My Radio on Thursday nights (2200–2300 HKT).

In 2006, she quit the Frontier and became the chairperson of the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] and the co-convener of Project Civil Referendum, a scheme to pilot and promote the idea of holding a [[referendum]] in Hong Kong.

In 2007, when the death of [[Ma Lik]] vacated a Hong Kong Island Legislative Council seat, she originally decided to run in the by-election, but later she decided against. Also, she declined to stand again for her district council seat to prepare for her 2008 Legco election campaign.

==2008 Legco election==
Ho stood for and was returned in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency for the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008]]. She finished with the fifth highest number of vote in the six-member constituency, 30,887, or 9.85%. Her running mate in 2004, Audrey Eu of the Civic Party, obtained 30,362.

== Labour Party ==
In December 2011, after The Frontier had failed to pass its own resolution to dissolve, she joined with [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], [[Cheung Kwok-che]] and others to form the Labour Party, taking up the position of vice-chairwoman. She was re-elected in 2012 elections.

== LGBT rights ==
In 2012, soon after Ho re-elected as member of Legco, she put forward a proposal calling for public consultation on legislation to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. This proposal was supported by most of the pro-democrats and some pro-Beijing lawmakers, but was veto by Democratic Party lawmaker [[James To]] (who voted abstained) and pro-Beijing conservative parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1083187/lawmakers-opposition-gay-rights-law-shames-hong-kong?login=1 Lawmakers' opposition to gay rights law shames Hong Kong]. ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; During her terms, Ho is one of only few legislators to openly support [[same-sex marriage]] and other [[LGBT rights]], conservative parties and groups criticized her on this issue. Though most of the pro-democrats support non-discrimination laws, they are less openly discuss and talk about this issue, as the pro-democrats have many supporters with many social conservative views.

==2016 Legco election==
She lost in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016]] with 19,376 votes, placed ninth in the Hong Kong Island constituency, along with the former party chairman [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], leaving the Labour Party only one representative in the legislature.

'''Farid T. Fata''' ({{Lang-ar|فريد فتى, born 1965) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born former [[hematology|hematologist]]/[[oncology|oncologist]] and the admitted mastermind of one of the largest [[health care fraud]]s in American history.  He was the owner of Michigan Hematology-Oncology (MHO), one of the largest [[cancer]] practices in [[Michigan]].  He was arrested in 2013 on charges of prescribing [[chemotherapy]] to patients who were either perfectly healthy or whose condition did not warrant chemotherapy, then submitting $34 million in fraudulent charges to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and private health insurance companies over a period of at least six years.  He pleaded guilty in 2014 to charges of health care fraud, conspiring to pay and receive [[kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]], and [[money laundering]].  On July 10, 2015, he was sentenced to 45 years in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Area Doctor Sentenced to 45 Years in Prison for Providing Medically Unnecessary Chemotherapy to Patients|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/detroit-area-doctor-sentenced-45-years-prison-providing-medically-unnecessary-chemotherapy|website=US Department of Justice|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moghe|first1=Sonia|title=Patients give horror stories as cancer doctor gets 45 years|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/us/michigan-cancer-doctor-sentenced/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Fata was born in Lebanon in 1965, to a [[Melkite]] Catholic family.  After obtaining a medical degree there in 1992, he emigrated to the United States to begin his medical career.  He served a [[medical residency|residency]] at [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] from 1993 to 1996.  From 1996 to 1999, he was a fellow in hematology-[[oncology]] at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] in [[Manhattan]].  He was an attending physician at [[Geisinger Medical Center]] in [[Danville, Pennsylvania]] from 2000 to 2003.

He struck out on his own in 2003, opening Michigan Hematology-Oncology (MHO) in [[Rochester Hills, Michigan]].  Over the next decade, it grew to seven locations located throughout [[Metro Detroit]]—in Rochester Hills, [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]], [[Clarkston, Michigan|Clarkston]], [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]].&lt;ref name=sentencingmemo&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/file/623456/download Sentencing memorandum for Fata] submitted by U. S. Attorney for Eastern District of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a naturalized U. S. citizen in April 2009.&lt;ref name=Indictment&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-edmi/legacy/2014/01/15/Dr%20Fata%204th%20SS%20Ind.pdf Federal indictment against Fata]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fata specialized in treating blood cancer.  He owned his own lab, pharmacy and radiation treatment facility.  At his height, he was treating 17,000 patients at his clinics.  He acquired a sterling reputation as one of the best cancer specialists in Metro Detroit.  He was known for his aggressive approach, which gave higher doses of chemo drugs more frequently—a protocol he called "European protocol."&lt;ref name=Dateline&gt;{{cite episode|title=Do No Harm|url=http://www.nbc.com/dateline/video/dateline-0117b/2966610?onid=209511|series=[[Dateline NBC]]|date=2015-01-17|network=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fata's wife, Samar, helped run the business side of his practice as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of his companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/million-dollar-question-for-judge-in-fata-bond-hearing-9-million-or-25000]&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved back to Lebanon after her husband's arrest; they have since divorced.&lt;ref name=Dateline/&gt;

==Fraud revealed==
Concerns about Fata cropped up as early as 2007, when Maggie Dorsey sued Fata for malpractice.  She'd been diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and seven months of chemo made it difficult for her to walk.  She learned that she did not have cancer.  The case was settled out of court in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/video/treated-for-cancer-she-never-had-602775619570|title=Treated for cancer she never had|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, veteran oncology nurse Angela Swantek went to MHO for an interview, but was stunned to see practices that her experience told her were "plain wrong."  She believed that Fata was pumping patients with drugs specifically to bill their insurance for more money—a classic fraud scenario.  She complained to state authorities, but got no response until 2011, when she got a form letter saying that there was no evidence to support an investigation.&lt;ref name=Dateline/&gt;

In 2013, Fata diagnosed 54-year-old Monica Flagg with [[multiple myeloma]]—a condition that required a lifetime of chemo for her to have any chance to survive.  On July 1, hours after her first round of chemotherapy, she broke her leg in two places.  Fata was on vacation in Lebanon at the time.  One of the doctors at MHO, Soe Maunglay, saw her in the hospital that day, and was stunned to see that her readings were completely normal.  As he put it, he could tell "just by looking at the chart" that Flagg's numbers were not consistent with an active cancer patient.&lt;ref name=Dateline/&gt;

The next day, Maunglay went to Fata's clinic and reviewed Flagg's records, and could find nothing in Flagg's test results that could justify a chemo regimen.&lt;ref name="Dateline" /&gt;  He later told ''[[The Detroit News]]'' that myeloma can start with minor changes in blood chemistry—minor enough that a dishonest doctor can use chemotherapy to avoid detection.  He estimated that if another doctor had seen Flagg within two months, she would have appeared to be in remission.  He also believed that since Flagg was far healthier on paper than a typical myeloma patient, the insurance payments would continue flowing to Fata for the rest of his life.  Maunglay went to see Flagg the following day, and told her she did not have cancer.  He further advised her to get her records right away and find another doctor, and that she should never go back to Fata again.&lt;ref name=Maunglay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/special-reports/2015/06/10/whistle-blower-doctor-uncovered-medical-nightmare/71027690/ |title=Whistle-blower: How doctor uncovered nightmare|last=Berman|first=Laura|publisher=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maunglay was already due to leave MHO the following month after catching Fata red-handed lying about the clinic's enrollment in a professional quality program.  However, after discovering that a perfectly healthy woman was being treated with chemotherapy, he felt that he needed to stop Fata.  Knowing that Flagg's case, even as egregious as it was, would not be enough to shut Fata down, he needed to find more evidence of misconduct.  Maunglay investigated MHO's patient records, and found numerous instances of unethical and potentially illegal behavior.  For instance, Fata was treating several patients with [[IVIG]], a drug intended to treat patients with specific immune deficiencies, when there was no apparent medical basis for it.  Maunglay persuaded a nurse and a nurse practitioner to confront Fata.  When Fata agreed to curb the use of IVIG, Maunglay believed that this was further evidence that Fata was a fraud.  He told the ''News'' that an honest doctor would never cut back on his own protocol solely because of staff and physician objections. On July 16—the same day that he learned Fata had stopped the IVIG treatments, Maunglay took his suspicions to office manager George Karadsheh.&lt;ref name=Maunglay/&gt;

Karadsheh didn't believe Maunglay at first, since he was aware that Maunglay was leaving in August. However, Karadsheh recalled that many nurses and others had expressed concerns about Fata's aggressive regimen. Maunglay had also specifically suggested that Karadsheh check on Fata's use of IVIG.  Karadsheh asked a nurse and she confirmed Maunglay's previous report; most of the patients who were being treated with IVIG didn't qualify for it.&lt;ref name=Dateline/&gt;  Karadsheh knew what health care fraud smelled like; he'd exposed a fraud at a Detroit clinic in 1996.  He took his findings to the Detroit office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and sued Fata, MHO and several related entities under the [[False Claims Act]] on August 5; he was thus entitled to a significant financial reward.&lt;ref name=Karadshehsuit&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20150625/NEWS/150629709|title = Lawsuit filed against convicted Oakland Township oncologist by employee unsealed|date =2015-06-25 |publisher = [[The Oakland Press]]|last = Phillips|first = Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maunglay said that Karadsheh did "a great service" because of his past experience detecting fraud.&lt;ref name=Maunglay/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berman: Savvy tipster was key in Dr. Fata’s fall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Laura|title=Savvy tipster was key in Dr. Fata’s fall|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/laura-berman/2015/07/29/savvy-tipster-cancer-doctor-fata/30865735/|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=[[The Detroit News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fata was arrested the next day for health care fraud.&lt;ref name=Maunglay/&gt;  

===Indictment===
Fata was originally held on $170,000 bond, but after federal authorities found evidence that Fata and his wife had assets of $9 million not yet seized and worried that the high liquidity of these assets could make him a high flight risk, they persuaded federal judge [[Sean Cox]] to raise his bond to $9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/million-dollar-question-for-judge-in-fata-bond-hearing-9-million-or-25000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/govt-fights-to-keep-dr-farid-fata-in-jail-with-9m-bond]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was confined to jail pending trial; had he been released, he would have been confined to his home in [[Oakland Township, Michigan|Oakland Township]] and barred from practicing medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20130813/NEWS03/308130110/Fata-bond-hearing-cancer|title=Judge orders $9-million bond for cancer doctor, says he can't practice medicine|last=Baldas|first=Tresa|publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal investigators amassed evidence that Fata had bullied or deceived 553 people into getting chemotherapy treatments they didn't need, leaving the patients' insurance companies and Medicare stuck with $34 million in fraudulent and unnecessary claims.  They also found that Fata took kickbacks from two local hospices, and poured Medicare and private insurance proceeds into his own diagnostic testing facility, where he ordered unnecessary diagnostic tests.  On the basis of these findings, [[Barbara McQuade]], the [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan]], won a series of superseding indictments against Fata.  They culminated in a 23-count indictment charging Fata with health care fraud, conspiring to take and receive kickbacks, money laundering, and unlawfully procuring naturalization.  The last charge was added because McQuade contended Fata had concealed the extent of his fraud from immigration authorities when he applied for citizenship.  If convicted on all charges, Fata faced a maximum of 175 years in prison, plus the prospect of having his naturalization revoked.&lt;ref name=sentencingmemo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indictment/&gt;

===Guilty plea===
Facing the prospect of a lifetime in prison and possible [[deportation]] to Lebanon, Fata pleaded guilty before federal judge [[Paul Borman]] on September 20, 2014.  He pleaded guilty to 13 counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy to pay and receive kickbacks, and two counts of money laundering.  In return, the immigration charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan-cancer-doctor-farid-fata-pleads-guilty-to-16-counts_20151201033528331|title=Michigan cancer doctor Farid Fata pleads guilty to 16 counts|publisher=[[WDIV]]|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, McQuade sought the maximum possible sentence of 175 years in prison.  Her office argued that the egregiousness of Fata's crimes far exceeded that of [[Bernard Madoff]], and denounced him as "the most egregious fraudster in the history of this country."&lt;ref name=sentencingmemo/&gt;

===Sentencing===
Fata's sentencing hearing began on July 3, 2015.  At the hearing, dozens of Fata's victims revealed how the unnecessary chemo treatments had harmed them.  For example, Robert Sobieray lost nearly all of his teeth after being falsely diagnosed with blood cancer, and still twitched uncontrollably.  Patty Hester lost much of her hair after being falsely told she was terminally ill with [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], and the stress of finding out about Fata's deceit gave her high blood pressure.  Another patient, "C. C.," said that due to 177 unnecessary chemo treatments, she had problems with her bladder, bowel and kidneys so serious that she could no longer perform basic tasks.&lt;ref name=sentencingmemo/&gt;

On July 10, 2015, Fata addressed the court for the first time.  He said he was "horribly ashamed" at his behavior, and admitted giving in to a "self-destructive" quest for power and wealth.  Borman was unmoved, and sentenced Fata to 45 years in prison, saying that Fata had committed "huge, horrific" crimes.  The sentence Borman imposed is barely one-fourth of what prosecutors sought, and was deemed insufficient by many of Fata's victims.  Nonetheless, at Fata's age, it is very likely that he will die in prison.  McQuade publicly thanked Maunglay and Karadsheh for exposing what she described as "the most serious fraud case in the history of the country."&lt;ref name="Berman: Savvy tipster was key in Dr. Fata’s fall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2015/07/10/farid-fata/29955103/|title = Cancer doctor gets 45 years for 'huge, horrific' crimes|last = Brand-Williams|first = Oralandar|date =2015-07-10 |publisher=[[The Detroit News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/farid-fata-gets-45-years-prison-scamming-hundreds-cancer-patients-n389956|title=Farid Fata Gets 45 Years in Prison for Scamming Hundreds of Cancer Patients|author1=Kathryn Nathanson|author2=Anna Schechter|author3=Jon Schuppe|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fata also faces myriad civil suits.&lt;ref name=Dateline/&gt; Karadsheh announced in January 2016 that he had reached a $1.7 million settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20160105/NEWS/160109833|title = Ex-employee settles suit against Dr. Fata, oncologist who mistreated many|last = |first = |date =2016-01-05 |publisher =[[The Associated Press]] |access-date = |via = [[The Oakland Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maunglay, who didn’t file a lawsuit, will not take any financial reward.&lt;ref name="Berman: Savvy tipster was key in Dr. Fata’s fall" /&gt;

Fata, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] inmate number 48860-039, is serving his sentence at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Williamsburg]] in [[Salters, South Carolina]].  His earliest possible release will be October 19, 2052, when he will be 87 years old.

Fata requested that his guilty plea be tossed in May 2018. His claim is based on the assertion that he received poor legal advice that resulted in his guilty plea and that he has always maintained his innocence, despite his admission of guilt during his sentencing hearing. He stated in the filing "My guilty pleas were not the result of my actually being guilty. From day one to the present, I have steadfastly  maintained my innocence."{{cite news |last=Baldas |first=Tresa |date=May 22, 2018 |title=Cancer doctor: I was duped into guilty plea, toss my conviction |url= https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/05/22/cancer-doctor-farid-fata-guilty/632820002/ |access-date=July 21, 2018 }}

'''Francesco Daverio''' (April 3, 1815 in Varese &amp;ndash; June 3, 1849 in Rome) was a patriot of the Italian unification, Chief of Staff of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]], and an engineer, who died on the [[Janiculum]] defending the ''Casino dei quattro venti''.

Daverio took part in the [[Five Days of Milan]] in March 1848. In August 1848, he was sent by [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] to guide [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in the campaign in Varese. He fought in [[Luino]] and [[Morazzone]] in 1848. In 1849 he fought in [[Velletri]] and defended the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic.]]
== Early years ==
Daverio was born in Varese on April 3, 1815, to the farmer Giovan Battista, and his wife, Maria Cerutti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-daverio_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ |title=Francesco Daverio in Dizionario Biografico – Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his pre-college studies in [[Parabiago]] and Varese.

In 1834, he entered [[University of Pavia]] and on January 4, 1839 he graduated with a degree in Engineering and Architecture. He worked as an engineer at the Ponti engineering studio in Varese and at the prestigious Gerli engineering studio in Milan. He also was the director and superintendent of the assets of the noble Della Sala family of Varese. He worked for [[Ospedale Maggiore]] in Milan, where he also participated in the Five Days of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/fercova/diz%20artisti%20va/def_artvav_sito.htm |title=def artvav sito |publisher=Xoomer.virgilio.it |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With Garibaldi ==
Daverio's first meeting with Garibaldi took place on August 13, 1848, at [[Castelletto sopra Ticino]]. Garibaldi, who had arrived in June or May via [[Nice]] and [[Uruguay]], started the Provisional Government of Lombardy, gathering 1300 volunteers to begin an uprising in [[Varese]].
[[File:22 Francesco Daverio.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Daverio]] 
On August 9, 1848, Austria and Piedmont had signed the Salasco Armistice, which Garibaldi found unacceptable. Garibaldi was waiting for aid from Switzerland; Mazzini had promised him guns and 180 men. Only Daverio, the 33-year-old engineer from Varese, had arrived. Mazzini had sent him as a guide.

The small army marched during the night from Castelletto sopra Ticino to [[Arona (NO)|Arona]]. Garibaldi seized the steamboats ''San Carlo'' and ''Verbano'' in the port, which had been used by the postal service on the lake. They also seized nine other boats on the lake. They lade small pieces of artillery, 1,286 rations of bread and twenty bags of rice and landed in Luino at eight o'clock in the evening of August 14 with 800 men.
[[File:Lugano.jpeg|thumb|Lugano in the early 20th century]]
The campaign lasted fifteen days and, after the riots of Luino on August 15 and Morazzone on the 26th, revolution was in the air.  Of the 800 men who had gone with him, only seventy followed Garibaldi to [[Switzerland]]. Daverio proved invaluable in guiding the retreat of the forces through the [[Campo dei Fiori di Varese|Campo dei Fiori]] in [[Brusimpiano]], past the shores of Lake Lugano, and out of the country.  With a long trip past [[Buguggiate]], [[Capolago]], Varese, Morosolo, [[Casciago]], [[Usmate Velate|Velate]], St. Ambrose, Bregazzana, the German Alps, and Borgnana Cavagna, the patrol arrived in the late evening of August 27 at Casamora, an isolated area between Brusimpiano and Porto.

A plaque is still visible from the road along the lake showing the house Garibaldi, exhausted from the long march, slept in. The next night, Brusimpianesi barges carried a troop thinned to about thirty volunteers, defying the Austrian gunboat patrols. Garibaldi went to Agno and then [[Lugano]]. Those who had lost him would eventually reach Switzerland in small groups. Garibaldi's volunteers were not yet ready to take Italy.

In Lugano, Daverio didn't waste time and got in touch with his contacts from the uprising in [[Lombardy]]. After the riots started in the fall in [[Val d'Intelvi]], he left Locarno on October 31 and landed in [[Germignaga]], on the Lombardy side of [[Lake Maggiore]], where it reaches [[Luino]]. He was greeted by the ''giunta nazionale d’insurrezione.'' Two Austrian columns rushed from Varese, the uprising failed, and Daverio retreated on the lake from which he came, this time destined for [[Piedmont]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-daverio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Roma 1849 casino quattro venti.jpg|thumb|left|The debris of the ''Casino dei quattro venti'' after the Siege of Rome]]

== 1849 and death ==
In March 1849 he reappeared in [[Velletri]]. He died, defending Rome at the ''Casino dei quattro venti'' on June 3, 1849,. Almost at the same time, another Varese [[Enrico Dandolo (patriot)|Enrico Dandolo]] died at the [[Palazzo Corsini, Rome|Palazzo Corsini]]. Another young patriot and Varese native, [[Emilio Morosini]], would also die on the Janiculum in June 1849.

== Legacy ==
The Varese technical institute for surveyors is named after him. There are streets named after him in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WgWAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=francesco+daverio&amp;dq=francesco+daverio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT40T5CZF6fb0QGTp5WjAg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBDgK |title=WCOTP annual report - World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/20595889 |title=Way &amp;#124; Via Francesco Daverio (20595889) |publisher=OpenStreetMap |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaQ6AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=francesco+daverio&amp;dq=francesco+daverio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT40T5CZF6fb0QGTp5WjAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzgK |title=OECD-ICVA directory; development aid of non-governmental non-profit ... - Edwin Eggins, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Council of Voluntary Agencies - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François Bazaramba''' (born Nshili, [[Gikongoro Province]], Rwanda, 1 January 1951) is a Rwandan sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in Finland for participating in the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide in 1994]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2010/06/ruandalaispastorille_elinkautinen_joukkotuhonnasta_1752961.html | title = Ruandalaispastorille elinkautinen joukkotuhonnasta| work = Yle uutiset| date = 2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Rwanda, he worked as a teacher and a headmaster for a vocational school. Later he became a pastor in the Zambian Baptist Church. The ''Bazaramba'' case is historic in Finnish legal history because it was the first time anyone was sentenced under the section 1 of Chapter 11&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#L11&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] since the international norms against [[genocide]] were implemented in national law.

[[image:Mitsukuni defying the skeleton spectre invoked by princess Takiyasha.jpg|right|thumb|[[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], "{{nihongo|Souma no furudairi|相馬の古内裏}}" also known as "[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]".]]
{{nihongo|'''Gashadokuro'''|がしゃどくろ/ 餓者髑髏 ||literally "starving skeleton," also known as '''Odokuro'''}} are [[Yōkai|mythical creatures]] in [[Japanese mythology]].

==Description==
The Gashadokuro are spirits that take the form of giant [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]]s and are fifteen times taller than an average person, said to be created from the amassed bones of people who died of [[starvation]] or in battle, without being buried. These [[Yōkai]] roam after midnight, grabbing lone travelers and biting off their heads to drink their spraying blood. There is a way to know of their approach, as the victim would hear the sound of loud ringing in the ear. The Gashadokuro are said to possess the powers of invisibility and indestructibility; though Shinto charms are said to ward them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Vampire_Universe.html?id=6h17h23zo1AC|author=Jonathan Maberry|title=Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings That Haunt Us, Hunt Us, and Hunger for Us|year=2006|isbn=9780806528137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|reason=A religious text would be most preferred though any would suffice|date=April 2014}}

==In modern culture==
The Gashadokuro is a yōkai that first appeared in print in the later half of the 20th century. It was created by the authors of shonen magazines published from 1960 - 1970 and illustrated yōkai encyclopedias. Shigeaki Yamauchi's ''World's Bizarre Thriller Complete Works 2: Monsters of the World'' ([[Akita Shoten]], 1968) compiled articles about yōkai by [[Saitō Ryokuu]]. At the same time, it was also picked up by [[Shigeru Mizuki]] and [[Satō Aribumi]], and from their introduction the Gashadokuro became more widely known from 1980 on. 

The illustration in Arabumi's ''Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japanese Yōkai'' (1972) and the illustration by Mizuki both base the appearance of the Gashadokuro on the giant skeleton in [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] print, ''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]''. It has no direct connection to the Gashadokuro, but is said to have influenced modern depictions. Kuniyoshi's print was commissioned in the [[Edo period]] by [[Santō Kyōden]] for a [[yomihon]], depicting a scene in which [[Taira no Masakado]]'s daughter, Takiyasha-hime, summons a skeleton yōkai to attack the samurai Ooya Tarou Mitsukuni. Although originally described as many life-sized skeletons, Kuniyoshi depicted it as a single giant skeleton, as is characteristic of his work.

==Similar Yōkai==
In the entry for Gashadokuro in Mizuki's book, a related tale from the ''[[Nihon Ryōiki]]'' is introduced. It tells of a man in [[Bingo Province]] ([[Hiroshima Prefecture]]) who is in a field at night and, hearing an eerie voice moaning, "My eye hurts," finds a skeleton there with a bamboo shoot growing from its eye socket. He removes the bamboo shoot and offers the skeleton dried boiled rice, upon which the skeleton tells him the story of its murder and its personal history, and rewards him for his kindness. Though this tale has been conflated with that of the Gashadokuro, the two are in fact unrelated, the Gashadokuro having originated in the later half of the 20th century.

==In popular culture==
* In the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series, the Gashadokuro was adapted into its projects:
** In ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'', Gasha Dokuro is one of the main villains who is described as cold, calm, ruthless and calculating. He appears in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'', and ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' as "Rito Revolto".
** Giant Gashadokuro, which can be summoned in lieu of the usual method of enlarging the defeated monster of the day, are recurring enemies in ''[[Shuriken Sentai Ninninger]]''. They are adapted as "Skullgators" in ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Steel]]''.
* In one of the DLC episodes of the ''[[PlayStation Vita]]'' re-release ''[[Muramasa: The Demon Blade]]'', one of the final bosses is a Gashadokuro.
* The Gashadokuro (usually referred to as "Giant Skeleton") is portrayed in varying roles of significance throughout the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series.
* In ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms]]'', a Gashadokuro rises from the ground of a cemetery and rakes the ground to unleash many undead monsters on Hellboy.
* In ''[[Goemon's Great Adventure]]'', a Gashadokuro is encountered in an early level while on a bridge.
* In the [[Studio Ghibli]] movie ''[[Pom Poko]]'', the monster parade scene features a Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[AdventureQuest Worlds]]'', the Gashadokuro is featured as the forbidden Beast of Chaos called the O-Dokuro. Kitsune uses the Hanzamune Blade to free it from a time rift and bring it to Yokai Island. The players fight it in two different forms; first as a complete skeleton, and later on as only a head.
* In ''[[Yo-kai Watch]]'', there is a Yo-kai called Gutsy Bones (Gashadokuro in the Japanese version). He has control over the [[gashapon]]s.
* In ''[[Okamiden]]'', there is a demon known as a Gashadokuro which resembles a humongous human skeleton with a fiery core and twin blades embedded in its stomach. There is also an armoured version which is much more powerful.
* In the manga/anime series, ''[[Inu x Boku SS]]'', Roromiya Karuta is a Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[Kubo and the Two Strings]]'', a Gashadokuro appears as an antagonist, guarding the Sword Unbreakable, which is one of many swords embedded in its skull. It is the largest [[stop motion]] puppet ever built, standing around 16 feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/laika-crazy-enough-animate-16-foot-tall-skeleton-kubo-two-strings-142544.html|title=Laika Was Crazy Enough To Animate A 16-Foot Tall Skeleton for 'Kubo and The Two Strings'|date=19 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the film, a [[Byōbu]] of the Gashadokuro appears in Hanzo's abandoned fortress that is very much based on the one from "[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]"
* In ''[[Nioh]]'', Gasha-Dokuro appears as the boss for the mission "The Source of Evil".
* In the ''[[Dark Souls]]'' series, there are frequent enemies later in the games which resemble the Gashadokuro and often that live in the deepest depths of the earth. The Giant Skeletons in the Tomb of the Giants from the first game may be inspired by the Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[Nurarihyon no Mago]]'' there is an antagonist named Gashadokuro, who is an enormous human-shaped skeleton with a single eyeball.

'''Gene F. Franklin''' (July 25, 1927 – August 9, 2012) was an American [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[Control theory|control theorist]] known for his pioneering work towards the advancement of the [[control systems engineering]] – a subfield of [[electrical engineering]]. Most of his work on [[control theory]] was adapted immediately into [[NASA]]'s [[Us space program|U.S. space program]], most famously in the control systems for the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]] to the [[moon]] in [[History of the United States (1964–80)|1960s–70s]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford University Press|first1=Engineering|title=Gene F. Franklin, Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering, dies at 85|url=https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/gene-f-franklin-professor-emeritus-electrical-engineering-dies-85|website=School of Engineering|publisher=Stanford University Press|accessdate=26 June 2017|language=en|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is also noted for his authorship of influential texts on the [[control system]], most notably, ''Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems'', which has been translated into numerous of languages and has received literary prizes as the best book in the [[Engineering disciplines|discipline]] of [[Control theory|controls]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; 

==Biography==

Franklin was born in [[Banner Elk]] in [[North Carolina]], [[United States]], on July 25, 1927. His father was a professor of [[mathematics]] at the local college, and his mother was a [[Registered Nurse|nurse]], an [[Registered Nurse|RN]] at the local hospital.&lt;ref name="American Automatic Control Council"/&gt; He joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1945, serving in [[World War II]], and was assigned to Navy's [[Radar in World War II|radar systems]].&lt;ref name="American Automatic Control Council"/&gt; He lost his enthusiasm for the navy after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s decision of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name="American Automatic Control Council"/&gt; He took a transfer to study electronics and taught a course on electronics at the [[Great Lakes Naval Training Center]]. He took a discharge from the navy on medical grounds and joined [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="American Automatic Control Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene F. Franklin —American Automatic Control Council|url=http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2005-00-00t000000/gene-f-franklin|website=a2c2.org|publisher= American Automatic Control Council|accessdate=26 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1950, his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in electrical engineering from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1952, and his [[Doctor of Engineering|D.E.]] [[Science|Sc.]] degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1955. 
Franklin's 1958 doctoral thesis “''Sampled-Data Control Systems''” (co-authored by Franklin's dissertation advisor, [[John R. Ragazzini]]) introduced digital control to a discipline which had previously operated almost exclusively in the analog domain.&lt;ref name="The Mathematics Genealogy Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene Franklin - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=107323|website=www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|publisher=The Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakthrough allowed control systems to become much more precise and reliable.

He taught at [[Columbia University]] from 1955 to 1957 before moving to [[Stanford University]], where he was professor emeritus of electrical engineering until his death in August 2012. His research encompassed all aspects of control incorporating digital logic, including adaptive control of both nonlinear systems and systems with multiple-data sampling. He was a recipient of the [[Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award]] in 2005 for "fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of digital, modern, adaptive, and multivariable control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award |title=Richard E.

'''Hanna Gharib''' ({{lang-ar|حنا غريب}}; born 28 ٍSeptember 1953) is a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] politician and the current general secretary of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] (LCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.annahar.com/article/366286-%D8%AD%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9|title=  حنا غريب أميناً عاماً للحزب الشيوعي بالتزكية |newspaper=Annahar Newspaper|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in September 1953 in the city of [[Tripoli]] in Northern [[Lebanon]] to a poor family of six children. His father was a Lebanese army soldier. After the retirement of his father from the army, the family moved to [[Rahbeh]], their original town in [[Akkar]] in the north where he joined its official primary and secondary school. 
[[File:HannaGharib3.jpg|thumb|Gharib in the Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth]]
During this period he joined the [[Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth]], a [[secular]] left-wing youth organization where he met with communists who attracted him with their ideas of social justice and equality. He continued his university studies in the [[Lebanese University]] in [[Beirut]] where he studied [[Chemistry]] at the faculty of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mc-doualiya.com/articles/20160427-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86|title=من هو حنا غريب الأمين العام للحزب الشيوعي |newspaper=Monte Carlo News|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After graduation, Gharib became a public secondary teacher in [[Chemistry]] first in the city of [[Sidon|Saida]] in the south where he taught [[Ibrahime Al-Amine]], the current general director of [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Akhbar]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://al-akhbar.com/node/179152|title=حنا غريب |newspaper=Akhbar Newspaper|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Afterwards, he moved to teach in Beirut in the public and the private sectors. He remained an active teacher despite the big load that he had after becoming the Leader of the League of Public Secondary Teachers and later the coordinator of the Syndicate Coordination Committee that was formed between the union and leagues of public and private teachers and the public employees. Under his leadership, the unions organized continuous demonstrations demanding increases in the wages and proposing progressive taxes and more taxation on the interests and real estate companies. The popular movements lasted from 2012 till 2015 with diverse actions including sit-ins, demonstrations, and general strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/15195|title= The never ending wages battle |newspaper= Akhbar English|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the governmental and presidential palaces, the ministry of finance and the ministry of education, the demonstrations  reached the economic ports of the country like the sea port and the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saidaonline.com/en/news.php?go=fullnews&amp;newsid=44714|title= Unions to expand sit-ins to Beirut Airport and port|newspaper= Saida Online|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HannaGharib2.jpg|thumb|Gharib leading a demonstration for teachers and public employees]]
Due to escalating discourse and action against the government and persisting stances on the rights of the teachers and employees, the political parties loyal to the government formed a large coalition in the teachers syndicate elections to defeat Hanna Gharib and they succeeded in doing so &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/164667|title= Parties Defeat Hanna Gharib in Teachers Elections|newspaper= Naharnet News|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after forming a list supported by 11 parties against the list of Gharib which got 46% of the votes despite all odds. This ended Gharib's career in the leadership of the unions.

During this time, Gharib was a leading member of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] where he raised in ranks to its central committee then its political bureau for two terms. With increased public presence and media coverage, he was a well-known public figure in [[Lebanon]] especially among the communists and left-wing supporters.
After the party's 11th conference in April 2016, Gharib was elected by consensus as the general secretary of the party. He is the seventh leader of the party after [[Fuad Shemali]], [[Farajallah el-Helou]], Nicolas Shawi, [[George Hawi]], Farouk Dahrouj and [[Khaled Hadadi]].

==Personal life==
Hanna Gharib is married to Wafaa Bitar, the daughter of Isber Bitar who was one of the historical figures of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]]. He has a son and a daughter named Walid and Hala.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">The '''Hollister brothers''' were three sailors in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]], who were killed in 1943. Unlike the [[Sullivan brothers]], they were not all in the same unit.

'''Lyle Eugene Hollister''', born 6 July 1923 in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], enlisted in the Navy on  26 March 1941 at [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis, Minn.]] Radioman Second Class Hollister first served in [[USS Prairie (AD-15)|''Prairie'']] (AD-15) before being assigned to [[USS Plunkett (DD-431)|''Plunkett'']] (DD-431) and [[USS Relief (AH-1)|''Relief'']] (AH-1). After duty at the [[Naval Station Key West]], Hollister was reassigned to ''Plunkett''. He was reported missing in action as result of an engagement of ''Plunkett'' with enemy aircraft during the [[Battle of Anzio|assault on Anzio]], September 1943.

Two years younger than their brother, twins '''William Howard Hollister''' and '''Richard Jerome Hollister''' were born 22 November 1925 at Sioux Falls, S. Dak. They enlisted in the Navy 2 March 1943 at Minneapolis. Both were serving in [[USS Liscome Bay (CVE-56)|''Liscome Bay'']] (CVE-56) when that [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] was [[torpedo]]ed in the [[Gilbert Islands]] area 24 November 1943. William died from wounds received in this action; Richard was reported missing and presumed dead.

All three brothers were posthumously awarded the [[Purple Heart]].

==Namesake==
In 1945, the [[destroyer]] [[USS Hollister (DD-788)|USS ''Hollister'']] (DD-788) was named in their honor.

Count '''Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume''' (13 April 1755 in [[La Ciotat]]&lt;ref name=levot206&gt;Levot, p.206&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 28 July 1818 in [[Aubagne]]&lt;ref name=levot208&gt;Levot, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;)  was a [[France|French]] Navy officer and Vice-admiral.

Ganteaume started sailing on Indiamen, before serving during the [[American War of Independence]] in the fleets of Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] and [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]]. At the French Revolution, he was promoted to command the 74-gun [[French ship Trente-et-un Mai|''Trente-et-un Mai'']], taking part in the [[Glorious First of June]] and the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]].

Ganteaume took part in the Expedition to Egypt, narrowly escaping death during the [[Battle of the Nile]]. There, he formed a personal relationship with General Bonaparte, who supported his promotion. He was made a Rear-Admiral and given command of a squadron to supply the Army of Egypt, but in [[Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801]], he engaged in months of complicated maneuvers to elude the Royal Navy and eventually failed his mission.

He supplied the French forces of the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]]. During the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Ganteaume was to lead his squadron to the Caribbean to reinforce [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] and [[Édouard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy|Missiessy]], but he was blockaded by British squadrons. Ganteaume held various offices during the late [[First French Empire]], and gave his loyalty to [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

== Career ==
Ganteaume was born in [[La Ciotat]], into a family of merchant sailors. He started sailing at the age of 14&lt;ref name=michaud98&gt;Michaud, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; on a merchantman commanded by his father,&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; and by the time he reached the age of 22, Ganteaume had accomplished five campaigns in the Middle East and two in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; He served on the [[Mississippi Company]] Indiaman [[French ship Fier Rodrigue|''Fier Rodrigue'']].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

=== Service in the American War of Independence ===
In 1778, with the intervention of [[France in the American Revolutionary War]], Ganteaume enlisted in the French Royal Navy as an auxiliary officer,&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; while ''Fier Rodrigue'' was purchased into naval service as a 54-gun [[ship of the line]].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; ''Fier Rodrigue'' escorted a convoy to America, and attached to a division under [[Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte|Lamotte-Picquet]]&lt;ref name=granier437&gt;Granier, p.437&lt;/ref&gt; in the fleet of Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

In the fleet of Admiral d'Estaing, Ganteaume took part in the [[Capture of Grenada]] and in the [[Siege of Savannah]].&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; In 1781, he was promoted to auxiliary Frigate Lieutenant,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; and appointed to command the fluyt ''Marlborough'' in a convoy bound for the [[Indies]] and escorted by [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

From 1781 to 1785, Ganteaume served on the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']]&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Michaud (p.98) also mentions the "frigate ''Apollon''", but no ship name [[French ship Apollon|''Apollon'']] was in service in the French Navy between 1758 and 1788 (furthermore, ''Apollon'' is an unlikely name for a frigate and more suitable for a ship of the line).&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to Fireship Captain&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Capitaine de brûlot''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1784, and sub-Lieutenant&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Sous-lieutenant de vaisseau''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1786.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

Upon his return at the peace, Ganteaume was granted permission to return to the service of the Mississippi Company.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; He successively commanded the Indiamen ''Maréchal de Ségur'', bound for Chian, and ''Prince de Condé'' and ''Constitution'', bound for the Indies.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; In 1793, he was captured on an Indiaman&lt;ref name=granier437 /&gt; and imprisoned by the British;&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; released, he returned to the Navy, with the rank of Lieutenant.&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; He served on the 74-gun [[French ship Jupiter (1789)|''Jupiter'']] for a campaign in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

=== Service on ''Trente-et-un Mai'' ===
[[File:Mb-vista-entera-min.jpg|thumb|The 74-gun [[French ship Trente-et-un Mai|''Trente-et-un Mai'']], which Ganteaume commanded between 1794 and 1795]]
Ganteaume was promoted to Captain in 1794,&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; and was appointed to command the 74-gun [[French ship Trente-et-un Mai|''Trente-et-un Mai'']].&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt; During the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], he attempted to attach to the French fleet under [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse|Villaret-Joyeuse]], but only joined late in the [[Glorious First of June]]; he took part in the last throes of the battle, where he was thrice wounded.&lt;ref name=levot206 /&gt;

In the winter, Geanteaume led ''Trente-et-un Mai'' in the [[Croisière du Grand Hiver]], and notably rescued the crew of the stricken [[French ship Saint-Esprit (1766)|''Scipion'']].&lt;ref name=levot207&gt;Levot, p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, ''Trente-et-un Mai'' sailed to the Mediterranean, and cruised off [[Catalonia]];&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; she sustained a two-hour battle against a Spanish ship of the line.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; On 18 April 1795,&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p.313-314&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trente-et-un Mai'' was renamed ''Républicain''. She attached to the fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Pierre Martin (French Navy officer)|Martin]], and took part in the [[Battle of Hyères Islands]].&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt;

In late 1795, Ganteaume was appointed to command a division in an [[Ganteaume's expedition of 1795|expedition to Smyrna]], comprising one ship of the line, four frigates and four corvettes. He sailed to [[Smyrna]], where he lifted the blockade on [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]]'s squadron,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; and captured the frigate [[HMS Nemesis (1780)|HMS ''Nemesis'']].&lt;ref name=granier437 /&gt;

In 1796, returned to the Ocean,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; Ganteaume successful ran the British blockade of Brest and sailed a convoy carrying munitions into the harbour.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt;

=== Service in Egypt ===
Appointed [[Chief of staff]] to Rear-Admiral and [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Navy Minister]] [[Étienne Eustache Bruix|Bruix]],&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; Ganteaume took part in the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] on the flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; He took part in the [[Battle of the Nile]], where he was wounded,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; and narrowly escaped death when he left the burning ''Orient''&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; on a boat.&lt;ref name=granier437 /&gt; ''Orient'' exploded soon after.

Promoted to Rear-Admiral upon request of General [[Napoléon I of France|Bonaparte]],&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; Ganteaume led the flotilla of small ships of the Nile River, taking part in the [[Siege of Jaffa]], the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] and the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]].&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

On 22 August 1799, Ganteaume departed Alexandria with the frigates [[French frigate Muiron|''Muiron'']] and [[HMS Carrere (1801)|''Carrère'']], the [[aviso]] ''Revanche'' and a [[tartane]],&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; ferrying General Bonaparte back to France.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; Bonaparte ordered the ships to sail close to the shore of Africa to elude British squadrons, and landed in Corsica, to finally arrive at [[Fréjus]] on 2 October.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

After arriving in France, Bonaparte, as [[First Consul]], appointed Ganteaume to the Council of State, in which he presided the section of the Navy.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

=== Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801 ===
{{main|Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801}}
In 1801,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;  Ganteaume was appointed to command a seven-ship division in Brest, tasked with ferrying supplies and 5000 soldiers to the French Army of Egypt.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; After successfully crossing British-held [[Gibraltar]], Ganteaume cruised in the Mediterranean for six months to elude the British fleet.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt;

Ganteaume returned to Toulon to resupply and repair his ships.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; In the following months, he attempted three sorties, once arriving off Alexandria without landing:&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; when he finally arrived near Egypt, actually [[Derna, Libya]], in June 1800, the troops did not land, due to the hostility of the locals and the British naval threat.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy, [https://books.google.com/?id=gQAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 p.162]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, [https://books.google.com/?id=yTYrggiKvgcC&amp;pg=PA418 p. 418]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganteaume eventually renounced and defiantly returned to Toulon, after capturing [[Elba]] and four British ships,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; including the 38-gun frigate [[HMS Success (1781)|HMS ''Success'']], and in the [[Action of 24 June 1801]], the 74-gun [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']], but failing his mission to supply the French armies in the Middle East.

Ganteaume's tergiversations motivated the satirical poem:&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;
{| width=800px
|-
|''&lt;poem&gt;
::Vaisseaux lestés, tête sans lest,
::Ainsi part l'amiral Ganteaume;
::Il s'en va de Brest à Bertheaume,
::Et revient de Bertheaume à Brest.&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem&gt;
:Loaded ships, head without weight,
:Thus departs Admiral Ganteaume;
:He sails off from Brest to Bertheaume,
:And sails back from Bertheaume to Brest.&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

=== Service in Saint-Domingue and the Trafalgar Campaign ===
After the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] ended the [[War of the Second Coalition]] in early 1801, Ganteaume was tasked with supporting the French forces involved in the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]].&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; In 1802, Ganteaume was appointed [[Maritime Prefect]] for Toulon.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[War of the Third Coalition]] the year after, and with the [[Coronation of Napoleon I]] and the advent of the [[First French Empire]] on 2 December 1804, Ganteaume was promoted to [[Vice-Admiral]],&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; made a [[Count of the Empire]],&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; and appointed to command the fleet in Brest.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt;

In 1805, after the death of Vice-Admiral [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|Latouche-Tréville]] and the outbreak of the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Napoléon briefly considered entrusting Ganteaume with an expedition to land an 18 000-man army in [[Ireland]],&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; in a move similar to what had been attempted in 1796 with the ill-fated [[Expédition d'Irlande]]; eventually, Ganteaume was ordered to the Caribbean to land reinforcements there and return to Europe with the fleets under Rear-Admiral [[Édouard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy|Missiessy]] and Vice-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]].&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt;

Adverse weather prevented Ganteaume from leaving Brest, and he finally departed one month after Missiessy.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; In transit, Ganteaume bumped into the British [[Channel Fleet]] under Admiral [[William Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] and retreated to Brest, where he ended up hermetically blocked.&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; Informed of the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], Ganteaume was ordered to break into the Ocean by force to make his junction with Villeneuve;&lt;ref name=levot207 /&gt; however, Villeneuve's port call to Cadiz thwarted this plan.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt;

=== Later career ===
In 1808, Ganteaume took command of the French squadrons of Toulon and Rochefort, joined together at Toulon, with the aim to 
ferry supplies to Corfu, then blockaded by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt;  He departed Toulon in early February, successfully escorted his convoy into Corfu harbour, and returned to Toulon in April.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; In February on the following year, he authorised the frigates [[French frigate Pénélope (1806)|''Pénélope'']] and ''[[French frigate Pauline (1807)|Pauline]]''  to chase [[French frigate Proserpine (1809)|HMS ''Proserpine'']], yielding the [[Action of 27 February 1809]] in which ''Proserpine'' was captured and brought to Toulon.&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt;

In June 1808, Ganteaume was appointed General Inspector of the Coasts of the Ocean.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; From 1809 to 1810, Ganteaume was appointed to command the fleet in Toulon, but attacks to [[gout]] kept him increasingly away from the sea.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; In 1810, he joined the Council of the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; On 1 August 1811, Napoléon appointed Ganteaume to command the battalion of the [[Marins de la Garde]] in the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] as a Colonel.&lt;ref name=marineimperiale&gt;[http://marine-imperiale.pagesperso-orange.fr/amiraux/ganteaume.htm Comte Honoré Joseph Antoine GANTEAUME]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, he defended Toulon.&lt;ref name=granier437 /&gt;

In 1814, at the first [[Bourbon Restoration]], Ganteaume supported the [[Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur]], and in consequence did not return to command during the [[Hundred Days]];&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; immediately after the [[Battle of Waterloo]], he ordered the Royalist white flag hoisted in Toulon;&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; this act got him almost killed.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt;

Restored to power again, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] made Ganteaume a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]] in recognition for his support.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; In December 1815,&lt;ref name=michaud98 /&gt; he was promoted to Commander in the [[Order of Saint Louis]],&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; and appointed General Inspector of the Classes.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt; In his capacity of Peer of France, Ganteaume took part in the trial of Marshal [[Michel Ney|Ney]], and voted for his execution.&lt;ref name=granier437 /&gt;&lt;ref name=marineimperiale /&gt;

Ganteaume died at his property of Pauline, near Aubagne, on 28 September 1818.&lt;ref name=levot208 /&gt;

'''Samir Saleh Abdullah''' ({{lang-ar|سامر صالح عبد الله }}; &lt;!--br--&gt;14 April 1969 – 20 March 2002), more commonly known as '''Ibn al-Khattab''' or '''Emir Khattab''' (also transliterated as [[Amir]] Khattab and Ameer Khattab, meaning Commander Khattab, or Leader Khattab), was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n-born  leader in the [[First Chechen War]] and the [[Second Chechen War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/v2/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CTC_Khattab-Jihadi-Bio-February2015-3.pdf |title=Khattab |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center |accessdate=2015-03-05 |author=Muhammad al-`Ubaydi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814143452/https://www.ctc.usma.edu/v2/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CTC_Khattab-Jihadi-Bio-February2015-3.pdf |archivedate=14 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins and real identity of Khattab remained a mystery to most until after his death, when his brother gave an interview to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Persecution/Chechnya/khattab.html|title=Khattab, the man who died for the cause of Chechnya|work=Islam Awareness|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 20 March 2002 following exposure to a poison letter delivered via a courier who had been recruited by Russia's [[Federal Security Service]].

==Biography==
Khattab was born in [[Arar, Saudi Arabia]] and of partial [[Circassians|Circassian]] origin.

===Central Asia and the Balkans===
At the age of 18, Khattab left Saudi Arabia to participate in the fight against the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. During this time, he permanently incapacitated his right hand and lost several fingers after an accident with [[improvised explosive]]s. The injury was [[Prophetic medicine|treated]] with [[Honey#Religious significance|honey]] by Khattab on himself.&lt;ref name="Murphy2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J. Murphy|title=The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bu7sAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=khattab+honey+russians&amp;dq=khattab+honey+russians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibzMfRhIjPAhUBXR4KHXndAHEQ6AEIJDAB|year=2004|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=978-1-57488-830-0|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khattab, while the leader of [[Islamic International Brigade]], publicly admitted that he spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that he had met [[Osama Bin Laden]]. In March 1994, Khattab arrived in Afghanistan and toured [[Afghan training camp|fighter training camps]] in [[Khost province]]. He returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Khattab underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with [[al-Qaeda]]. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQE09903E.shtml QE.I.99.03. ISLAMIC INTERNATIONAL BRIGADE (IIB)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514193822/http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQE09903E.shtml |date=14 May 2011 }} "Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenia]]n sources claim that in 1992 he was one of many Chechen volunteers who aided [[Azerbaijan]] in the embattled region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], where he allegedly met [[Shamil Basayev]]. However, the  Azerbaijani [[Ministry of Defense (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Defense]] denied any involvement by Khattab in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav051402.shtml|title=Chechen Fighter's Death Reveals Conflicted Feelings in Azerbaijan|work=EurasiaNet|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TERROR-IN-KARABAKH&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror in Karabakh: Chechen Warlord Shamil Basayev's Tenure in Azerbaijan |url=http://ermeni.org/english/chechen-terrorists-azerbaijan.htm |accessdate=2007-02-15 |publisher=The Armenian Weekly On-Line: AWOL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214081307/http://ermeni.org/english/chechen-terrorists-azerbaijan.htm |archivedate=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1995, Khattab left to fight alongside [[Islam]]ic opposition in the [[Tajikistan Civil War]]. Before leaving for [[Tajikistan]] in 1994, al-Khattab gave [[Abdulkareem Khadr]] a pet rabbit of his own, which was promptly named Khattab.

In an interview, Khattab once mentioned he had also been involved in the [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The fragment of this interview in which he makes this statement can be found in the 2004 [[BBC]] documentary ''The Smell of Paradise'', though he did not specify his exact role or the duration of his presence there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYP7D3p44Ak |title=BBC Four - The Smell of Paradise |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009115604/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYP7D3p44Ak |archivedate=9 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Chechen War===
According to Khattab's brother, he first heard about the Chechen conflict on an Afghan television channel in 1995; that same year, he entered Chechnya, posing as a television reporter. He was credited as being a pioneer in producing video footage of Chechen rebel combat operations in order to aid [[fundraising]] efforts and [[morale|demoralize]] the enemy.

During the [[First Chechen War]], Khattab participated in fighting [[Russia]]n forces and acted as an intermediary financier between foreign [[Muslim]] funding sources and the local fighters. To help secure funding and spread the message of resistance, he was frequently accompanied by at least one cameraman.

His units were credited with several devastating [[ambush]]es on Russian columns in the Chechen mountains. His first action was the October 1995 ambush of a Russian convoy which killed 47 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror'', Murphy, Paul J., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Khattab gained early fame and a great notoriety in Russia for his April 1996 [[Shatoy ambush|ambush of a large armored column]] in a narrow gorge of Yaryshmardy, near [[Shatoy]], which killed up to 100 soldiers and destroyed some two or three dozen vehicles. In another ambush, near [[Vedeno]], at least 28 Russian troops were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9604/01/russia_chechnya/ Russian fighting ceases in Chechnya; Skeptical troops comply with Yeltsin order] [[CNN]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313101520/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9604/01/russia_chechnya/ |date=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

In the course of the war, [[Shamil Basayev]] became his closest ally and personal friend. He was also associated with [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]], who gave Khattab two of the highest Chechen military awards, the Order of Honor and the Brave Warrior medal, and promoted him to the rank of [[general]].

A senior Chechen commander by the name of Izmailov told press how Khattab urged restraint, citing the [[Koran]], when at the end of the war the Chechens wanted to shoot those they considered traitors.&lt;ref name="fighter"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFD81F30F934A25753C1A96F958260 Muslim Fighter Embraces Warrior Mystique], ''The New York Times'', 17 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chechnya===
After the conclusion of the war, Khattab, by then wanted by [[Interpol]] on Russia's request, became a prominent [[warlord]] and commanded the [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya]], his own [[private army]] with a group of Arabs, Turks and other foreign fighters who had come to participate in the war. He set up a network of [[paramilitary]] camps in the mountainous parts of the [[republic]] that trained not only Chechens, but also [[Muslim]]s from the [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] Russian republics and [[Central Asia]].

On 22 December 1997, over a year after the signing of the [[Khasav-Yurt Accord|Khasav-Yurt treaty]] and the end of the first war in Chechnya, the Arab mujahideen and a group of Dagestani rebels raided the base of the 136th Armoured [[Brigade]] of the 58th Division of the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] in [[Buinaksk]], [[Dagestan]].

===Dagestan War===
In 1998, along with [[Shamil Basayev]], Khattab created the [[Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade]] (IIPB) group (also known as the Islamic Peacekeeping Army). In August–September 1999, they led the [[Dagestan War|IIPB's incursions into Dagestan]], which resulted in the deaths of at least several hundred people and effectively started the [[Second Chechen War]].

===1999 bombings in Russia===

A [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]] (FSB) investigation named Khattab as the mastermind behind the September 1999 [[Russian apartment bombings]].&lt;ref name="wolvesofislam"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror |last=Murphy |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Potomac Books Inc. |location= |isbn=978-1-57488-830-0 |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 14 September 1999, Khattab told the Russian [[Interfax]] news agency in [[Grozny]] that he had nothing to do with the [[Moscow]] explosions; he was quoted as saying, ''"We would not like to be akin to those who kill sleeping civilians with bombs and shells."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid%3D94 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410090541/http://www.ict.org.il/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=94 |archivedate=10 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusion by the FSB remains controversial. Some researchers, such as [[Johns Hopkins University]]/[[Hoover Institute]] scholar [[David Satter]],&lt;ref name="Satter"&gt;Satter, David. ''Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State''. [[Yale University Press]]:2003, {{ISBN|0-300-09892-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to conclusion that the bombings were in fact a "[[false flag]]" attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimate the resumption of military activities in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="sakwa"&gt;{{cite book |title=Putin, Russia's choice |last=Sakwa |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-40765-6 |pages=333–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Chechen War===

During the course of the war, Khattab participated in leading his [[militia]] against Russian forces in Chechnya, as well as managing the influx of foreign fighters and money (and, according to the Russian officials, also planning of attacks in Russia).

He led or commanded several devastating attacks, such as [[Battle of Hill 776|the mountain battle]], which killed at least 84 [[Russian Airborne Troops|Russian paratroopers]], and the [[Zhani-Vedeno ambush|attack on the OMON convoy]] near Zhani-Vedeno, which killed at least 52 Russian Interior Ministry troops.

===Death and legacy===

Khattab later survived a heavy-calibre bullet wound to the stomach and a [[landmine]] explosion. He was killed during the night of 19–20 March 2002, when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] gave Khattab a [[poison]]ed letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with "a fast-acting nerve agent, possibly [[sarin]] or a derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/world/europe/moscow-kremlin-silence-critics-poison.html|title=More of Kremlin's Opponents Are Ending Up Dead|date=21 August 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsp/bulletin/cbwcb56.pdf|title=The chemical weapons convention and OPCW: the challenges of the 21st century|author=Ian R Kenyon|date=June 2002|journal=The CBW Conventions Bulletin|publisher=Harvard Sussex Program on CBW Armament and Arms Limitation|issue=56|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The messenger, a Dagestani double agent known as Ibragim Alauri, was turned by the FSB on his routine courier mission. Khattab would receive letters from his mother in Saudi Arabia, and the FSB found this to be the most opportune moment to kill Khattab. It was reported that the operation to recruit and turn Ibragim Alauri to work for the FSB and deliver the poisoned letter took some six months of preparation. Alauri was reportedly tracked down and killed a month later in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] on [[Shamil Basayev]]'s orders.&lt;ref name="jtown"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5zi1n5XGW?url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nca/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D18627%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D%3D184%26no_cache%3D1]=18627&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=184&amp;no_cache=1 "Who Ordered Khattab's Death?"], [[Jamestown Foundation]], quoting Russian press sources&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Al-Khattab was succeeded by Emir [[Abu al-Walid]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Ion Heliade Rădulescu''' or '''Ion Heliade''' (also known as ''Eliad''e or ''Eliade Rădulescu''; {{IPA-ro|ˈi.on heliˈade rəduˈlesku}}; January 6, 1802&amp;nbsp;– April 27, 1872) was a [[Wallachia]]n, later [[Romania]]n academic, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] poet, essayist, memoirist, short story writer, newspaper editor and politician. A prolific translator of foreign literature into [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he was also the author of books on [[linguistics]] and history. For much of his life, Heliade Rădulescu was a teacher at [[Saint Sava College]] in [[Bucharest]], which he helped reopen. He was a founding member and first president of the [[Romanian Academy]].

Heliade Rădulescu is considered one of the foremost champions of [[Romanian culture]] from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of [[Italian language|Italian]] [[neologism]]s into the [[Romanian lexis]]. A [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] landowner siding with moderate [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberals]], Heliade was among the leaders of the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]], after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic [[boyar]]s in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]], he was rewarded for supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] and clashed with the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Heliade Rădulescu was born in [[Târgovişte]], the son of Ilie Rădulescu, a wealthy proprietor who served as the leader of a patrol unit during the 1810s, and Eufrosina Danielopol, who had been educated in [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name="sixtyseven"&gt;Stănescu-Stanciu, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his siblings died of [[bubonic plague]] before 1829.&lt;ref name="sixtyseven"/&gt; Throughout his early youth, Ion was the focus of his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie Rădulescu purchased a house once owned by the scholar [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] on the outskirts of [[Bucharest]] (near [[Obor]]), as a gift for his son.&lt;ref name="sixtyseven"/&gt; At the time, the Rădulescus were owners of a large garden in the Bucharest area, nearby [[Herăstrău Park|Herăstrău]], as well as of estates in the vicinity of [[Făgăraş]] and [[Gârbovi]].&lt;ref name="sixtyseven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt;

After basic education in Greek with a [[tutor]] known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] (reportedly by studying the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' with the help of his father's [[Oltenia]]n servants).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.VI, XXXVII; Stănescu-Stanciu, p.67–68&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by ''[[Caragea's plague]]'').&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"&gt;Stănescu-Stanciu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monk [[Naum Râmniceanu]]; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at [[Schitu Măgureanu]], in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the [[Saint Sava College|Saint Sava School]], where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Măciucă, p.VI, XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heliade birthplace 1.jpg|thumb|280px|Site of Ion Heliade Rădulescu's birthplace in [[Târgovişte]]]]
Between his 1820 graduation and 1821, when effects of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]] led to the School ceasing its activities, he was kept as Lazăr's assistant teacher, tutoring in [[arithmetics]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.VI–VII; XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; It was during those years that he adopted the surname ''Heliade'' (also rendered ''Heliad'', ''Eliad'' or ''Eliade''), which, he later explained, was a Greek version of his [[patronymic]], in turn stemming from the Romanian version of ''[[Elijah]]''.&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Under Grigore Ghica ===
In 1822, after Gheorghe Lazăr had fallen ill, Heliade reopened Saint Sava and served as its main teacher (initially, without any form of remuneration).&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"&gt;Giurescu, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.VIII, IX–X, XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined in this effort by other [[intellectual]]s of the day, such as [[Eufrosin Poteca]],&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt; and, eventually, also opened an art class overseen by the [[Croats|Croat]] [[Carol Valştain]].&lt;ref name="oprescu31"&gt;George Oprescu (ed.), ''Scurtă istorie a artelor plastice în R.P.R.'', [[Editura Academiei|Editura Academiei RPR]], Bucharest, 1958, p.31. {{OCLC|7162839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This re-establishment came as a result of ordinances issued by [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Grigore IV Ghica]], who had just been assigned by the Ottoman Empire to the throne of Wallachia upon the disestablishment of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] rule, encouraging the marginalization of [[Greeks in Romania|ethnic Greeks]] who had assumed public office in previous decades.&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt; Thus, Prince Ghica had endorsed education in Romanian and, in one of his official ''[[firman (decree)|firmans]]'', defined teaching in Greek as "the foundation of evils" (''temelia răutăţilor'').&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt;

During the late 1820s, Heliade became involved in cultural policies. In 1827, he and [[Dinicu Golescu]] founded ''Soţietatea literară românească'' (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in [[Craiova]], and the creation of schools in virtually all Wallachian localities.&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.VII, X, XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''Soţietatea'' attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling for an end to the state monopoly on [[printing press]]es.&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt; The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's [[Calea Victoriei|Podul Mogoşoaiei]], benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and [[Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei]].&lt;ref name="giuonetwenty"/&gt; Its character was based on [[Freemasonry]];&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Djuvara, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.317; {{ro icon}} [[Dan Amedeo Lăzărescu]], [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1998/current6/mi10.htm "1848: Revoluţia intelectualilor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521064925/http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1998/current6/mi10.htm |date=2007-05-21 }}, in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, Heliade published his first work, an essay on [[Romanian grammar]], in the [[Transylvania]]n city of [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] (which was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper ''[[Curierul Românesc]]''.&lt;ref name="giurtwenfiv"&gt;Giurescu, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.X–XI, XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828.&lt;ref name="giurtwenfiv"/&gt; Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, ''Curierul Românesc'' had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of ''[[Curier de Ambe Sexe]]''; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, ''[[Zburătorul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.125, 126; Măciucă, p.XI–XII&lt;/ref&gt; ''Curierul Românesc'' was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three or four times a week. Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[Costache Negruzzi]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], [[Ioan Catina]], [[Vasile Cârlova]], and [[Iancu Văcărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, with whom he fell passionately in love, and whom he later married.&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt; By 1830, the Heliades' two children, a son named Virgiliu and a daughter named Virgilia, died in infancy; subsequently, their marriage entered a long period of crisis, marked by Maria's frequent outbursts of jealousy.&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt; Ion Heliade probably had a number of extramarital affairs: a [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian Militia]] officer named Zalic, who became known during the 1840s, is thought by some, including the literary critic [[George Călinescu]], to have been the writer's illegitimate son.&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt; Before the death of her first child, Maria Heliade welcomed into her house Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a celebrated writer, whom Ion suspected had become her lover.&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt; Consequently, the two authors became bitter rivals: Ion Heliade referred to Alexandrescu as "that ingrate", and, in an 1838 letter to [[George Bariţ]], downplayed his poetry and character (believing that, in one of his [[fable]]s, Alexandrescu had depicted himself as a [[nightingale]], he commented that, in reality, he was "a piteous [[Rook (bird)|rook]] dressed in foreign feathers").&lt;ref name="sixtyeight"/&gt; Despite these household conflicts, Maria Heliade gave birth to five other children, four daughters and one son (Ion, born 1846).&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"&gt;Stănescu-Stanciu, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printer and court poet ===
[[File:Teatrul Naţional, 1866, JR Huber.jpg|thumb|300px|The old building of the [[National Theatre Bucharest]] in 1866]]
In October 1830, together with his uncle Nicolae Rădulescu, he opened the first privately owned printing press in his country, operating on his property at ''Cişmeaua Mavrogheni'', in [[Obor]] (the land went by the name of ''Câmpul lui Eliad''—"Eliad's Field", and housed several other large buildings).&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; Among the first works he published was a collection of poems by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], translated by Heliade from French, and grouped together with some of his own poems.&lt;ref name="macp"&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he translated a textbook on [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[Louis-Benjamin Francoeur]]'s standard manual of ''Arithmetics'', as well as works by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] authors—[[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet, ou le fanatisme]]'', and stories by [[Jean-François Marmontel]].&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt; They were followed, in 1839, by a version of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]''.&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt;

Heliade began a career as a [[Civil service|civil servant]] after the ''[[Postelnic]]ie'' commissioned him to print the ''[[Monitorul Oficial|Official Bulletin]]'', and later climbed through the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|official hierarchy]], eventually serving as ''[[Clucer]]''.&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; This rise coincided with the establishment of the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]], by an [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] administration under [[Pavel Kiselyov]].&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the ''Regulament'', the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist [[boyar]]s: in 1833, together with [[Ion Câmpineanu]], [[Iancu Văcărescu]], [[Ioan Voinescu II]], [[Constantin Aristia]], [[Ştefan Golescu|Ştefan]] and [[Nicolae Golescu]], as well as others, he founded the short-lived ''Soţietatea Filarmonică'' (the Philharmonic Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater of Wallachia]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Măciucă, p.VII, XII–XIII, XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from its stated cultural goals, ''Soţietatea Filarmonică'' continued a covert political activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Giurescu, p.131; Măciucă, p.XII&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, when [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Alexandru II Ghica]] came to the throne, Heliade became one of his close collaborators, styling himself "court poet".&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; Several of the poems and discourses he authored during the period are written as [[panegyric]]s, and dedicated to Ghica, whom Heliade depicted as an ideal prototype of a monarch.&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; As young reformists came into conflict with the prince, he kept his neutrality, arguing that all sides involved represented a privileged minority, and that the disturbances were equivalent to "the quarrel of wolves and the noise made by those in higher positions over the torn-apart animal that is the peasant".&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; He was notably critical of the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Mitică Filipescu]], whom he satirized in the poem ''Căderea dracilor'' ("The Demons' Fall"), and later defined his own position with the words "I hate [[tyrant]]s. I fear [[Anomie|anarchy]]".&lt;ref name="Măciucă"&gt;Măciucă, p.VII&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 1834 that Heliade began teaching at the ''Soţietatea Filarmonică'''s school (alongside Aristia and the musician [[Ioan Andrei Wachmann]]), and published his first translations from [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] (in 1847, he completed the translation of Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'').&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; The next year, he began printing ''Gazeta Teatrului Naţional'' (official voice of the National Theater, published until 1836), and translated [[Molière]]'s ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]'' into Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XII, XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Heliade also translated [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' from a French source.&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt; The first collection of his own prose and poetry works saw print in 1836.&lt;ref name="macp"/&gt; Interested in the development of [[Art of Romania|local art]], he contributed a [[brochure]] on drawing and architecture in 1837, and, during the same year, opened the first permanent exhibit in Wallachia (featuring copies of Western paintings, portraits, and [[gypsum]] [[Casting|casts]] of various known sculptures).&lt;ref name="oprescu31"/&gt;

By the early 1840s, Heliade began expanding on his notion that modern Romanian needed to emphasize its connections with other [[Romance languages]] through [[neologism]]s from [[Italian language|Italian]], and, to this goal, he published {{lang|ro|Paralelism între limba română şi italiană}} ("Parallelism between the Romanian language and Italian", 1840) and {{lang|ro|Paralelism între dialectele român şi italian sau forma ori gramatica acestor două dialecte}} ("Parallelism between the Romanian and Italian Dialects or the Form or Grammar of These Two Dialects", 1841).&lt;ref name="macixxx"&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt; The two books were followed by a [[compendium]], ''Prescurtare de gramatica limbei româno-italiene'' ("Summary of the Grammar of the Romanian-Italian Language"), and, in 1847, by a comprehensive list of Romanian words that had originated in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and German (''see [[Romanian lexis]]'').&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; By 1846, he was planning to begin work on a "universal library", which was to include, among other books, the major the philosophical writings of, among others, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu"&gt;Călinescu, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Alexandru Ghica was replaced with [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], his relations with Heliade had soured.&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt; In contrast with his earlier call for moderation, the writer decided to side with the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] in its [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiratorial]] opposition to Bibescu.&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giuthirt"&gt;Giurescu, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Trandafiloff affair" of early 1844 was essential in this process—it was provoked by Bibescu's decision to lease all Wallachian mines to a Russian engineer named [[Alexander Trandafiloff]], a measure considered illegal by the [[Sfatul boieresc|Assembly]] and ultimately ending in Bibescu's decision to dissolve his legislative.&lt;ref name="isar"&gt;Isar&lt;/ref&gt; These events made Heliade publish a [[pamphlet]] titled ''Măceşul'' ("The [[Rosa rubiginosa|Eglantine]]"), which was heavily critical of Russian influence and reportedly sold over 30,000 copies.&lt;ref name="isar"/&gt; It was centered on the pun alluding to Trandafiloff's name—''trandafir cu of în coadă'' (lit. "a rose ending in -of", but also "a rose with grief for a stem").&lt;ref name="isar"/&gt; Making additional covert reference to Trandafiloff as "the eglantine", it featured the lyrics:

In spring 1848, when the first [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions]] had erupted, Heliade was attracted into cooperation with ''Frăţia'', a [[secret society]] founded by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Christian Tell]], and [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and sat on its leadership committee.&lt;ref name="giuthirt"/&gt; He also collaborated with the reform-minded French teacher [[Jean Alexandre Vaillant]], who was ultimately expelled after his activities were brought to the attention of authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet et les Roumains''&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 1848, following financial setbacks, ''[[Curierul Românesc]]'' ceased printing (this prompted Heliade to write ''Cântecul ursului'', "The Bear's Song", a piece ridiculing his political enemies).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XI, XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

Heliade progressively distanced himself from the more radical groups, especially after discussions began on the issue of [[land reform]] and the disestablishment of the [[boyar]] class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within ''Frăţia'' just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]).&lt;ref name="giuthirtthree"&gt;Giurescu, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, [[responsible government]], [[civil rights]] and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the [[Sfatul boieresc|National Assembly]]), [[freedom of the press]], and [[decentralization]].&lt;ref name="giuthirtthree"/&gt; On June 21, 1848, present in [[Turnu Măgurele|Islaz]] alongside Tell and the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest known as [[Popa Şapcă]], he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (''see [[Proclamation of Islaz]]'').&lt;ref name="giuthirtthree"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Djuvara, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan]] [[Neofit II, Metroplitan of Ungro-Wallachia|Neofit]], it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, [[Ştefan Golescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant [[Gheorghe Scurti]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes regarding the shape of land reform continued, and in late July, the Government created ''Comisia proprietăţii'' (the Commission on Property), representing both peasants and landlords and overseen by [[Alexandru Racoviţă]] and [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]].&lt;ref name="githirfive"&gt;Giurescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; It too failed to reach a compromise over the amount of land to be allocated to peasants, and it was ultimately recalled by Heliade, who indicated that the matter was to be deliberated once a new Assembly had been voted into office.&lt;ref name="githirfive"/&gt; In time, the writer adopted a [[Conservatism|conservative]] outlook in respect to boyar tradition, developing a singular view of [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] from a consideration of property and rank in Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.43, 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]: "Eliad had wanted to lead, as [[dictator]], this movement that added liberal institutions to the old society that had been almost completely maintained in place".&lt;ref name="Iorga"&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other revolutionaries, Heliade favored maintaining good relations with the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="githirfive"/&gt; As [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abdülmecid I]] was assessing the situation, [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Süleyman Paşa]] was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry on with their diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by ''Locotenenţa domnească'', a [[triumvirate]] of [[regent]]s comprising Heliade, Tell, and [[Nicolae Golescu]].&lt;ref name="githirfive"/&gt; Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' and its system of government.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.135–137&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by [[Robert Gilmour Colquhoun]] in exchange for a deposit of [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian florins]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exile ===
[[File:Ludwig Angerer - Coronini and his troops in front of the Meitani House.jpeg|thumb|320px|[[Johann Coronini-Cronberg]] and his troops in front of the [[meitani family|Meitani]] House in [[Bucharest]]]]
Leaving his family behind, he was allowed to pass into the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Banat]], before moving into self-exile in France while his wife and children were sent to Ottoman lands.&lt;ref name="stansixtynine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; In 1850–1851, several of his memoirs of the revolution, written in both Romanian and French, were published in Paris, the city where he had taken residence.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848...''; Măciucă, p.XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt; He shared his exile with Tell and Magheru, as well as with [[Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu]].&lt;ref name="Iorga"/&gt;

It was during his time in Paris that he met with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher who had come to advance a moderate small-scale property project (to counter both [[economic liberalism]] and socialism).&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.268–269&lt;/ref&gt; Heliade used this opportunity to make the Romanian cause known to the staff of Proudhon's ''La Voix de Peuple''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; Major French publications to which he contributed included ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'', ''[[La Semaine]]'', and ''[[Le Siècle]]'', where he also helped publicize political issues pertaining to his native land.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''&lt;/ref&gt; Heliade was credited with having exercised influence over historian [[Élias Regnault]]; [[Nicolae Iorga]] argued that Regnault's discarded his own arguments in favor of a unified Romanian state to include [[Transylvania]] (a concept which Heliade had come to resent), as well amending his earlier account of the 1848 events, after being exposed to "Eliad's [[propaganda]]".&lt;ref name="Iorga"/&gt;

While claiming to represent the entire body of Wallachian ''[[émigré]]s'',&lt;ref name="Măciucă"/&gt; Heliade had by then grown disappointed with the political developments, and, in his private correspondence, commented that [[Romanians]] in general were "idle", "womanizing", as well as having "the petty and base envies of women", and argued that they required "supervision [and] leadership".&lt;ref name="stanseven"&gt;Stănescu-Stanciu, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; His fortune was declining, especially after pressures began for him to pay his many debts, and he often lacked the funds for basic necessities.&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; At the time, he continuously clashed with other former revolutionaries, including Bălcescu, [[C. A. Rosetti]], and the Golescus, who resented his ambiguous stance in respect to reforms, and especially his willingness to accept ''Regulamentul Organic'' as an instrument of power; Heliade issued the first in a series of [[pamphlet]]s condemning young radicals, contributing to factionalism inside the ''émigré'' camp.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; His friendship with Tell also soured, after Heliade began speculating that the revolutionary general was committing [[adultery]] with Maria.&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt;

In 1851, Heliade reunited with his family on the island of [[Chios]], where they stayed until 1854.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; Following the evacuation of Russian troops from the [[Danubian Principalities]] during the [[Crimean War]], Heliade was appointed by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to represent the Romanian nation in [[Shumen]], as part of [[Omar Pasha]]'s staff.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; Again expressing sympathy for the Ottoman cause, he was rewarded with the title of ''[[Bey]]''.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; According to Iorga, Heliade's attitudes reflected his hope of "recovering the power lost" in 1848;&lt;ref name="Iorga"/&gt; the historian also stressed that Omar never actually made use of Heliade's services.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La guerre de Crimée...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the same year, he decided to return to Bucharest, but his stay was cut short when the Austrian authorities, who, under the leadership of [[Johann Coronini-Cronberg]], had taken over administration of the country as a neutral force, asked for him to be expelled.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Peace Treaty of 1856]] and an 1858 essay on the Bible.&lt;ref name="macixxx"/&gt; In 1859, he published his own translation of the [[Septuagint]], under the name ''Biblia sacră ce cuprinde Noul şi Vechiul Testament'' ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the [[New Testament|New]] and [[Old Testament]]").&lt;ref name="macxl"&gt;Măciucă p. XL&lt;/ref&gt;

As former revolutionaries, grouped in the ''[[Partida Naţională]]'' faction, advanced the idea of union between Wallachia and [[Moldavia]] in election for the [[ad hoc Divan|''ad hoc'' Divan]], Heliade opted not to endorse any particular candidate, while rejecting outright the candidature of former prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]] (in a private letter, he stated: "let them elect whomever [of the candidates for the throne], for he would still have the heart of a man and some principles of a Romanian; only don't let that creature [Ghica] be elected, for he is capable of going to the dogs with this country").&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt;

=== Final years ===
[[File:Heliade 1850s.jpg|thumb|200px|Photograph of an aging Heliade Rădulescu]]
Later in 1859, Heliade returned to Bucharest, which had become the capital of the United Principalities after the common election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] and later that of an internationally recognized [[Kingdom of Romania|Principality of Romania]]. It was during that period that he again added ''Rădulescu'' to his surname.&lt;ref name="giuthirt"/&gt; Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions to history and literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own poems. In 1863, ''[[Domnitor]]'' Cuza awarded him an annual [[pension]] of 2,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref name="macxl"/&gt;

One year after the creation of the [[Romanian Academy]] (under the name of "Academic Society"), he was elected its first President (1867), serving until his death.&lt;ref name="macxl"/&gt; In 1869, Heliade and [[Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian]] successfully proposed the [[Italy|Italian]] diplomat and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla]] as honorary member of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Ştrempel, "Pagini de istorie academică. Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', June 1995, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; By then, like most other 1848 Romantics, he had become the target of criticism from the younger generation of intellectuals, represented by the [[Iaşi]]-based literary society ''[[Junimea]]''; in 1865, during one of its early public sessions, ''Junimea'' explicitly rejected works by Heliade and [[Iancu Văcărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Romanian general election, 1866|elections of 1866]], Heliade Rădulescu won a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]] as a deputy for the city of [[Târgovişte]].&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join [[Nicolae Ionescu]] and other disciples of [[Simion Bărnuţiu]] in opposing the appointment of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]] as ''Domnitor'' and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, p.22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] period.&lt;ref name="kell"&gt;Kellogg, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.&lt;ref name="kell"/&gt;

Among Ion Heliade Rădulescu's last printed works were a textbook on [[poetics]] (1868) and a volume on Romanian [[orthography]].&lt;ref name="macxl"/&gt; By that time, he had come to consider himself a [[prophet]]-like figure, and the redeemer of his motherland,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Călinescu, p.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; notably blessing his friends with the words "[[Christ]] and [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]] be with you!"&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; His mental health declining, he died at his Bucharest residence on Polonă Street, nr. 20.&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; Heliade Rădulescu's grandiose funeral ceremony attracted a large number of his admirers;&lt;ref name="stanseven"/&gt; the coffin was buried in the courtyard of the Mavrogheni Church.&lt;ref name="macxl"/&gt;

== Heliade and the Romanian language ==
[[File:Teaching Bucharest 1842.jpg|thumb|320px|A typical open-air religious school in [[Bucharest]] during the 1840s]]

=== Early proposals ===
Heliade's most influential contributions are related to his interest in developing the modern [[Romanian language]], in which he synthesized [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tenets and [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] ideals of the 1848 generation.&lt;ref name="macxv"&gt;Măciucă, p.XV&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Romanian was being discarded by the educated in favor of French or [[Greek language|Greek]], he and his supporters argued in favor of adapting Romanian to the requirements of [[modernization]]; he wrote: "Young people, preoccupy yourselves with the national language, speak and write in it; prepare yourselves for its study, for its cultivation,—and cultivating a language means to write in it about all sciences and arts, about all eras and peoples. The language alone unites, strengthens and defines a nation; preoccupy yourselves with it first and foremost, as, through this, you shall be carrying out the most fundamental of policies, you shall be laying the foundation of nationality".&lt;ref name="macxv"/&gt;

Heliade inaugurated his series of proposals for reforming the language in 1828, when his work on [[Romanian grammar]] called for the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting [[phonetic spelling]] (for this rule, Heliade cited the example of the [[Latin alphabet]] as used in [[Ancient Rome]]).&lt;ref name="Măciucă_2"&gt;Măciucă, p.XVI&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[neologism]]s, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XVI–XVII&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the [[Romanian dialects|varieties of Romanian]] and create a standard [[Romanian lexis]]: this notion was first supported by the [[Transylvania]]ns [[Gheorghe Şincai]] and [[Petru Maior]], whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] (''see [[Transylvanian School]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XVII&lt;/ref&gt; Heliade, who first proposed a [[Standard language|language regulator]] (an idea which was to be employed in creating the [[Romanian Academy]]), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in [[Muntenia]], which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer [[Coresi]], serve as the standard language.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XVII–XVIII&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he advocated [[Aesthetics|aesthetical]] guidelines in respect to the standard shape of Romanian, stressing three basic principles in selecting words: "proper wording", which called for [[vernacular]] words of [[Latin]] origin to be prioritized; "harmony", which meant that words of Latin origin were to be used in their most popular form, even in cases where [[Phonaesthetics|euphony]] had been altered by prolonged usage; and "energy", through which Heliade favored the primacy of the shortest and most expressive of [[synonym]]s used throughout Romanian-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Heliade frowned upon [[Linguistic purism|purist]] policies of removing widely used neologisms of foreign origin—arguing that these were "a fatality", he indicated that the gains of such a process would have been shadowed by the losses.&lt;ref name="macxix"&gt;Măciucă, p.XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

These early theories exercised a lasting influence, and, when the work of unifying Romanian was accomplished in the late 19th century, they were used as a source of inspiration: Romania's major poet of the period, [[Mihai Eminescu]], himself celebrated for having created the modern [[literary language]], gave praise to Heliade for "writing just as [the language] is spoken".&lt;ref name="macxix"/&gt; This assessment was shared by [[Ovid Densusianu]], who wrote: "Thinking of how people wrote back then, in thick, drawly, sleepy phrases, Heliade thus shows himself superior to all his contemporaries, and&amp;nbsp;... we can consider him the first prose writer who brings in the note of [[History of modern literature|modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXI–XXXII&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian influence ===
A second period in Heliade's linguistic researches, inaugurated when he adopted [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Condillac]]'s theory that a language could be developed from conventions, eventually brought about the rejection of his own earlier views.&lt;ref name="macxix"/&gt; By the early 1840s, he postulated that Romanian and [[Italian language|Italian]] were not distinct languages, but rather dialects of Latin, which prompted him to declare the necessity of replacing Romanian words with "superior" Italian ones.&lt;ref name="curente"&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XIX–XX&lt;/ref&gt; One of his [[stanza]]s, using his version of the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian Latin alphabet]], read:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;font-style:italic"&gt;
{{lang|ro|Primi auḑi-vor quel sutteranu resunetu
Şi primi salta-vor afara din grôpa
Sacri Poeţi que prea uşorâ ţêrinâi
Copere, şi quâror puţin d'uman picioarele împlumbă.}}&lt;ref name="calsixfive"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Approximated into modern Romanian and English, this is:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Primii auzi-vor acel subteran răsunet
Şi primii sălta-vor afară din groapă
Sacrii Poeţi ce prea uşoară ţărână-i
Acoperă, şi cărora de uman puţin picioarele le sunt legate.}}
|
The first ones to hear that subterranean echo
And first to jump out of their pit will be
The sacred Poets whom only too light earth
Covers, and whose legs are superficially tied to humankind.}}

The target of criticism and ridicule, these principles were dismissed by Eminescu as "errors" and "[[A priori (languages)|a priori systems]] of [[orthography]]".&lt;ref name="emin"&gt;Eminescu, in "Aprecieri critice", p.207; Măciucă, p.XX&lt;/ref&gt; During their existence, they competed with both [[August Treboniu Laurian]]'s adoption of strong Latin mannerisms and the inconsistent [[Francization|Francized]] system developed in Moldavia by [[Gheorghe Asachi]], which, according to the 20th century literary critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], constituted "the [[boyar]] language of his time".&lt;ref name="curente"/&gt; Ibrăileanu also noted that Asachi had come to admire Heliade's attempts, and had praised them as an attempt to revive the language "spoken by [[Trajan]]'s men"—in reference to [[Roman Dacia]].&lt;ref name="curente"/&gt;

While defending the role Moldavian politicians in the 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibrăileanu argued that practices such as those of Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited [[Alecu Russo]], more than his successors at ''[[Junimea]]'', with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian.&lt;ref name="ibrail"&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Evoluţia spiritului critic...''&lt;/ref&gt; He notably cited Russo's verdict: "The modern political hatred aimed at [Russia] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, but the political perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high".&lt;ref name="ibrail"/&gt; The literary critic [[George Călinescu]] also connected Heliade's experimentation to his [[Anti-Russian sentiment|Russophobia]], in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: "Hating [[Slavic languages|Slavism]] and the Russians, who had striven to underline [Slavic influences in Romanian], he said to himself that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges".&lt;ref name="calsixfive"&gt;Călinescu, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his "[[autodidacticism]]", which, he contended, was responsible for "[his] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Heliade's experiments had marginal appeal, and their critics (Eminescu included) contrasted them with Heliade's own tenets.&lt;ref name="calsixfive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emin"/&gt; Late in his life, Heliade seems to have acknowledged this, notably writing: "This language, as it is written today by people who can speak Romanian, is my work".&lt;ref name="macxxiv"/&gt; One of the few authors to be influenced by the theory was the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who, during his youth, wrote several pieces in Heliade's Italian-sounding Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.346, 365–366&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Heliade's thesis being largely rejected, some of its practical effects on everyday language were very enduring, especially in cases where Italian words were borrowed as a means to illustrate nuances and concepts for which Romanian had no equivalent.&lt;ref name="calsixsix"&gt;Călinescu, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; These include ''afabil'' ("affable"), ''adorabil'' ("adorable"), {{lang|ro|colosal}} ("colossal"), ''implacabil'' ("implacable"), ''inefabil'' ("ineffable"), ''inert'' ("inert"), ''mistic'' ("mystical"), ''pervers'' ("perverse" or "pervert"), ''suav'' ("suave"), and ''venerabil'' ("venerable").&lt;ref name="calsixsix"/&gt;

== Literature ==

=== Tenets ===
Celebrated as the founder of Wallachian [[Romanticism]], Heliade was equally influenced by [[Classicism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.315; Măciucă, p.XX–XXI; [[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Gheţa, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212–213&lt;/ref&gt; His work, written in a special cultural context (where Classiciasm and Romanticism coexisted), took the middle path between two opposing camps: the Romantics ([[Alecu Russo]], [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] and others) and the Classicists ([[Gheorghe Asachi]], [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[George Baronzi]] etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXI&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Călinescu]] defined Heliade as "a devourer of books", noting that his favorites, who all played a part in shaping his style and were many times the subject of his translations, included: [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Dante Aligheri]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-François Marmontel]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu"/&gt;

His poetic style, influenced from early on by Lamartine, was infused with Classicism during his middle age, before he again adopted Romantic tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXV; [[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Gheţa, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Initially making use of guidelines set by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]] in respect to poetry, he came to oppose them after reading [[Victor Hugo]]'s Romantic preface to ''[[Cromwell (play)|Cromwell]]'' (without ever discarding them altogether).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Gheţa, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212–213&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Classicists, Heliade favored a literature highlighting "types" of characters, as the union of universal traits and particular characteristics, but, like the Romantics, he encouraged writers to write from a [[Subjectivism|subjective]] viewpoint, which he believed to be indicative of their mission as "prophets,&amp;nbsp;... men who criticize, who point out their society's plagues and who look on to a happier future, waiting for a savior".&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXI–XXII&lt;/ref&gt; Through the latter ideal of moral regeneration, Heliade also complimented the Romantic stress on "national specificity", which he adopted in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXII–XXIII&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he centered much of his own literary work on non-original material, either by compiling it from various translations or by translating from a single source—having his focus on creating the basis for further development by introducing samples of untapped [[literary genre]]s and styles to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].&lt;ref name="macxxiv"&gt;Măciucă, p.XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

While several of Heliade's contributions to literature have been considered to be of low importance,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.65; Măciucă, p.XIV–XXV; Zarifopol&lt;/ref&gt; many others, above all his Romantic poem ''[[Zburătorul]]'', are hailed as major accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.67–69; Măciucă, p.XV, XXX–XXI&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zburătorul'', borrowing from [[Romanian mythology]] its main character (the eponymous ''[[Incubus (demon)|incubus]]''-like being who visits nubile girls at night) also serves to depict the atmosphere of a Wallachian village from that period.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.68–69; Măciucă, p.XXX–XXI; Zarifopol&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Călinescu]], the poem's value partly relies on its depiction of lust through the girls' eyes: "lacking the rages of [[Sappho]] and [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]. The [[puberty]] crisis is explained through mythology and cured through [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1837 essay of his, centered on a debate regarding the translation of [[Homer]]'s works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: "This is not the time for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience".&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXIII&lt;/ref&gt; Paraphrased as "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" (''Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!''), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''; Măciucă, p.XXIII&lt;/ref&gt; The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian [[Şerban Cioculescu]] and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level.&lt;ref name="macxxiv"/&gt; Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular [[rhyme]], [[Paul Zarifopol]] accused him and [[Gheorghe Asachi]] of "tastelessness" and "literary insecurity".&lt;ref name="zar"/&gt; He elaborated: "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".&lt;ref name="zar"&gt;Zarifopol&lt;/ref&gt;

Heliade's name is closely connected with the establishment of [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian-language theater]], mirroring the activities of Asachi in [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="curente"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XII&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since he partook in creating ''Soţietatea Filarmonică'' and the [[National Theatre Bucharest|Bucharest Theater]], to the moment of his death, he was involved in virtually all major developments in local dramatic and operatic art.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XII–XV&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1834, he was one of the intellectuals who organized the first show hosted by ''Soţietatea Filarmonică'', which featured, alongside a [[cavatina]] from [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Il pirata]]'', Heliade's translation of [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XIII&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, members of the association carried out the translation of [[Theatre of France|French theater]] and other foreign pieces, while encouraging Romanian-language dramatists, an effort which was to become successful during and after the 1840s (when [[Constantin Aristia]] and [[Costache Caragiale]] entered their most creative periods).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XIII–XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Heliade himself advocated [[didacticism]] in drama (defining it as "the preservation of social health"), and supported professionalism in [[acting]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion Massoff, in "Aprecieri critice", p.209–210; Măciucă, p.XIV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical and religious subjects ===
[[File:TurnulChindiei.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chindia Tower]], part of the [[Târgovişte]] citadel site]]
Ion Heliade Rădulescu made extensive use of the [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] focus on history, which he initially applied to his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXVI–XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance as well, the goal was to educate his public; he wrote: "Nothing is worthy of derision as much as someone taking pride in his parents and ancestors and nothing more worthy of praise than when the ancestors' great deeds serve as a model and an impulse for competition among descendants".&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXVII&lt;/ref&gt; The main historical figure in his poetry is the late 16th century [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]], the first one to rally Wallachia, Moldavia and [[Transylvania]] under a single rule: celebrated in Heliade's poem ''O noapte pe ruinele Târgoviştii'' ("A Night on the Ruins of [[Târgovişte]]"), he was to be the main character of a lengthy [[epic poem]], ''Mihaiada'', of which only two sections, written in very different styles, were ever completed (in 1845 and 1859 respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Other historical poems also expanded on the ideal of a single Romanian state, while presenting the 1848 generation as a model for future Romanian politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main interests was an investigation into the issues involving Romanian history during the [[origin of the Romanians]] and the [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval history]] of the [[Danubian Principalities]]. At a time when, in Moldavia, the newly surfaced ''[[Chronicle of Huru]]'' traced a political lineage of the country to the [[Roman Empire]] through the means of a narrative which was later proven to be entirely fictional, Heliade made use of its theses to draw similar conclusions regarding Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.48–49&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Conservatism|conservative]] views were thus expanded to the level of [[Historiography|historiographic]] thesis:&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;Boia, p.43, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.VIII&lt;/ref&gt; according to Heliade, [[boyars]] had been an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and permeable class, which, from as early as the times of [[Radu Negru]], had adopted humane laws that announced and welcomed those of the [[French Revolution]] (he notably claimed that the [[Counties of Romania|county]]-based administration was a [[Democracy|democratic]] one, and that it had been copied from the [[Israelite]] model as depicted in the Bible).&lt;ref name="boia"/&gt;

The ideal he expressed in a work of the period, ''Equilibru între antithesi'' ("A Balance between [[Antithesis|Antitheses]]") was moderate [[progressivism]], with the preservation of social peace.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.67; Măciucă, p.VIII; Vianu, Vol.II, p.261–272&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tudor Vianu]]'s view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, ''Equilibru'', with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.264–272, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, his system parted with [[Hegelianism]] in that, instead of seeking a balance between the ''[[Geist]]'' and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (''[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]'') the reflection of a [[Numerology|mystical number]] favored throughout history.&lt;ref name="calsixsix"/&gt;

In parallel, Heliade worked on a vast synthesis of his own [[philosophy of history]], based on his interpretation of [[Biblical theology]].&lt;ref name="macxxiv"/&gt; His 1858 work, ''Biblice'' ("Biblical Writings"), was supposed to form the first of four sections in a Christian history of the world.&lt;ref name="macxxiv"/&gt; Referring to this project, Călinescu defined Heliade's ideas as "interesting, no matter how naïve at times, in general [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] [in shape]".&lt;ref name="calsixsix"/&gt; ''Biblicele'' partly evidenced Heliade's interests in the [[Talmud]] and ''[[Zohar]]''-like [[gematria]]—with emphasis placed on the numbers 3, 7, and 10—, as well as ample references to the ''[[Sephirot]]''.&lt;ref name="calsixsix"/&gt; One of his original thoughts on the matter was a reference to "[[Delta (letter)|deltas]]" (triangles) of [[Deity|deities]]—[[Elohim]]-[[Spirit]]-[[Matter]] and Spirit-Matter-the Universe.&lt;ref name="calsixsix"/&gt; A portion of Heliade Rădulescu's poems also draw on religious themes and discourse. According to [[George Călinescu]], the poet had attempted to create a parallel to both ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and the Bible, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], with a style influenced by Lamartine and [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satire and polemics ===
Heliade was aware of the often negative response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of [[Friedrich Schiller]], he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed ''Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort''—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good").&lt;ref name="Măciucă_2"/&gt; A noted author of [[satire]], he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXIX–XXXI&lt;/ref&gt; As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his ''Areopagiul bestielor'' ("The [[Areopagus]] of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] of liberalism, most notably [[C. A. Rosetti]] and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXIX–XXX, XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt; During and after his exile, his conflicts with [[Cezar Bolliac]] and [[Ion Ghica]] also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref name="Măciucă_3"&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiographical pieces, marked by acid comments on [[Greek language|Greek-language]] education, and, in this respect, similar to the writings of his friend [[Costache Negruzzi]], also display a dose of self-irony.&lt;ref name="Măciucă_3"/&gt; The enduring polemic with [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], as well as his quarrel with Bolliac, formed the basis of his [[pamphlet]] ''Domnul Sarsailă autorul'' ("Mr. [[Devil in Christianity|Old Nick]], the Author"), an attack on what Heliade viewed as writers whose pretensions contrasted with their actual mediocrity.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXII–XXXIII&lt;/ref&gt; In other short prose works, Ion Heliade Rădulescu commented on the caricature-like nature of ''[[parvenu]]'' [[Bucharest]]ers (the male prototype, ''Coconul Drăgan'', was "an ennobled hoodlum", while the female one, ''Coconiţa Drăgana'', always wished to be the first in line for the [[Anointing of the Sick|unction]]).&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p.XXXIII&lt;/ref&gt;

In various of his articles, he showed himself a critic of social trends. During the 1830s, he reacted against [[misogyny]], arguing in favor of [[women's rights]]: "Who has made man create himself unfair laws and customs, in order for him to cultivate his spirit and forsake [women] into ignorance...?".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liliana Popescu, [http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/ciupala/conditiafemeii.htm "Condiţia femeii în secolul XIX—începutul secolului XX"], in Alin Ciupală, [http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/ciupala/cuprins.htm ''Despre femei şi istoria lor în România''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622075152/http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/ciupala/cuprins.htm |date=2007-06-22 }}, at the [[University of Bucharest]] site (retrieved June 9, 2007){{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, after the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] in [[Galaţi]] fell victim to a [[pogrom]], he spoke out against [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusations: "Jews do not eat children in England, nor do they in France, nor do they in [[German Confederation|Germany]], nor do they do so wherever humans have become humans. Where else are they accused of such an inhumane deed? Wherever peoples are still [[Barbarian|Barbaric]] or semi-Barbaric".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.contrafort.md/2003/100/501_2.html "Acuzaţia de omor ritual (O sută de ani de la pogromul de la Chişinău)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006014743/http://contrafort.md/2003/100/501_2.html |date=2006-10-06 }}, in ''Contrafort'', 2 (100), February 2003 (retrieved June 9, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of Heliade's satirical works rely on mockery of speech patterns and physical traits: notable portraits resulting from this style include mimicking the manner of Transylvanian educators (with their strict adherence to [[Latin]] [[Etymology|etymologies]]), and his critique of the [[exophthalmos]] Rosetti (with eyes "more bulged than those of a giant frog").&lt;ref name="cazimir"&gt;[[Ştefan Cazimir]], ''Caragiale: universul comic'', [[Editura pentru Literatură]], Bucharest, 1967, p.84-86. {{OCLC|7287882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.69; in "Aprecieri critice", p.211–212&lt;/ref&gt; Without sharing Heliade's views on literature, the younger [[Titu Maiorescu]] drew comparisons with his predecessor for launching into similar attacks, and usually in respect to the same rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.I, p.333, 399&lt;/ref&gt;

== In cultural reference ==
[[File:Bucharest university.jpg|thumb|280px|Monument to Heliade Rădulescu, opposite the [[University of Bucharest]] building]] 
A monument to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Ettore Ferrari]], stands in front of the [[University of Bucharest|University]] building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the [[Romanian Academy]] has instituted the ''Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award''—in 1880, it was awarded to [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], for his ''Cuvinte den bătrâni'', and worth 5,000 gold [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cornea, ''Studiu introductiv'', in [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu|B. P. Hasdeu]], ''Etymologicum magnum Romaniae'', Vol.I, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1970, p.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], including Hasdeu and [[Dimitrie Sturdza]]. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with ''[[Junimea]]'', as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of [[didacticism]], and alleged [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref name="cioculescu"&gt;[[Şerban Cioculescu]], ''Caragialiana'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1974, p.124–125, 128–132. {{OCLC|6890267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vianuII182"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; They thus refused to grant him the prize.&lt;ref name="cioculescu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vianuII182"/&gt;

A high school in his native [[Târgovişte]] bears the name ''Ion Heliade Rădulescu'', as does a village in the [[Commune in Romania|commune]] of [[Ziduri]], [[Buzău County]]. The grave of [[Take Ionescu]], an influential political figure and one-time [[Prime Minister of Romania]] who was Heliade's descendant, is situated in [[Sinaia Monastery]], in the immediate vicinity of a fir tree planted by Heliade and his fellow 1848 revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Dobrin, [http://www.respiro.org/Issue6/eseu_dobrin.htm "Take Ionescu—un mare democrat, un mare european"], in ''Respiro'' (retrieved June 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1870 poem ''Epigonii'' ("The [[wiktionary:epigone|Epigone]]s"), [[Mihai Eminescu]] paid tribute to early Romanian-language writers and their contributions to literature. An entire [[stanza]] is dedicated to Heliade:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Eliad zidea din visuri şi din basme seculare
Delta biblicelor sânte, profeţiilor amare,
Adevăr scăldat în mite, sfinx pătrunsă de-nţeles;
Munte cu capul de piatră de furtune deturnată,
Stă şi azi în faţa lumii o enigmă nesplicată
Şi vegheaz-o stâncă arsă dintre nouri de eres.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Eminescu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Epigonii ''Epigonii''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Out of dreams and secular tales, Eliad was building
The delta of Biblical saints, of bitter prophecies,
Truth bathed in myth, a [[sphinx]] imbued with meaning;
A mountain with its head of stone misplaced by the storm,
He still stands today, before the world, as an unsolved enigma
And watches over a burnt rock from between clouds of [[heresy]].}}

During the early 1880s, [[Alexandru Macedonski]] and his ''[[Literatorul]]'' attempted to preserve Heliade's status and his theories when these were faced with criticism from ''Junimea''; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, and contributed to the disestablishment of ''Literatorul''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.362, 376&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a ''Junimist'' for a large part of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a precursor in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]]'s main journal, ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.&lt;ref name="cazimir"/&gt; One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher [[Marius Chicoş Rostogan]], shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories.&lt;ref name="cazimir"/&gt; Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, [[Ion Câmpineanu]], and [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around [[Pantazi Ghica]], [[Nicolae Misail]] and [[Mihail Pătârlăgeanu]]—he identified the latter grouping with [[hypocrisy]], [[demagogy]], and [[political corruption]], while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea şi junimismul'', Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1998, p.202-204, 228. {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature prominently in Macedonski's short story ''Nicu Dereanu'', whose main character, a daydreaming [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]], idolizes the Wallachian writer.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.429–430&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sburătorul]]'', a [[Modernism|modernist]] literary magazine of the [[interwar period]], edited by [[Eugen Lovinescu]], owed its name to ''[[Zburătorul]]'', making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, [[Camil Petrescu]] made reference to Heliade in his novel ''[[Un om între oameni]]'', which depicts events from [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]'s lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Autobiography'', the Romanian philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] indicated that it was likely that his ancestors, whose original surname was ''Ieremia'', had adopted the new name as a tribute to Heliade Rădulescu, whom they probably admired.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Autobiography'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 1990, p.4. {{ISBN|0-226-20407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Edgar "Jack" Webster''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (April 15, 1918 &amp;ndash; March 2, 1999) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] journalist, radio, and television personality, regarded as "king of the [[Vancouver]] airwaves"&lt;ref name="OneFifty"&gt;{{cite news |last= Mackie|first= John|date=May 31, 2017 |title= Jack Webster, a journalist larger than life |url= http://www.theprovince.com/news/local+news/canada+jack+webster+journalist+larger+than+life/13413041/story.html|work= The Province newspaper|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 1950s to his retirement, in 1988.

==Early life==
Webster was born in [[Glasgow]], the son of a Clydeside ironturner. He left school at age 14 to enter into newspaper businesses as a teenager.&lt;ref name="OneFifty" /&gt; He worked in Glasgow and on [[Fleet Street]]. When [[World War II]] broke out, Webster joined the [[British Army]] and rose to the rank of [[major]], with most of his six years' service spent in the [[Middle East]].

==Media career==
After the war, Webster emigrated to Canada. He covered the labour beat for the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;{{cite web|author1=Maclean's Magazine|title=Jack Webster (obituary)|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jack-webster-obituary/|website=Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=March 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he began to work on commercial radio in the [[talk radio]] format, which had its origins in [[British Columbia]] before it spread to the [[United States]]. Webster made his mark broadcasting shorthand transcripts of testimony during a probe into corruption on [[Vancouver Police Department|Vancouver's police force]]. His City Mike show on [[CKPK-FM|CJOR]] achieved some fame covering the issue.

He left CJOR and moved his show to [[CKNW]]. In the 1960s, he had 186,000 daily listeners and a $100,000 salary.&lt;ref name="OneFifty" /&gt; In 1963, prisoners at the BC Penitentiary were foiled in an escape attempt and took hostages. At the prisoners' request, Webster acted as a mediator between hostage-holding prisoners and the authorities and helped resolve the stand-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guard Released After Convicts Transferred|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=l-UcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_pYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7155,4146940&amp;dq=penitentiary+jack-webster&amp;hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2010|newspaper=Park City Daily News|date=21 April 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Jim Pattison]] lured Webster back to CJOR. Then in 1979, at the age of 60, Webster moved his radio show to television, where his familiar expression '9 am prrre-cisely' became his trademark. His hour-long TV interview program ''Webster!'', which was seen weekdays at 9 am on [[CHAN-DT|BCTV]] and then-sister [[CHEK-DT|CHEK-TV]] and from 1986, at 5pm proceeding the nightly news hour on BCTV, frequently dealt with [[British Columbia politics]]. Shortly after the final BCTV show aired in April 1987, Webster and the TV station donated the videos for all nine years of his shows to the BC Archives.&lt;ref name="RBCM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindner|first1=Bruno|title=Nine AM Precisely|url=http://royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/staffprofiles/2016/08/11/nine-am-precisely/|website=royalBCmuseum.bc.ca|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Webster joined the long-running [[CBC Television|CBC]] TV program [[Front Page Challenge]] as its permanent fourth panelist until the show's cancellation in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/frontpagech/frontpagech.htm| title = Front Page Challenge| accessdate = 05-07-2009| publisher = Museum of Broadcast Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 1987, he was inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame.
In 1988, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]].
In 2017, the 150th anniversary of Canada, Webster was profiled in Vancouver newspapers as one of the most notable 150 British Columbians.&lt;ref name="OneFifty" /&gt;

==Jack Webster Foundation==
In 1986, more than 1000 people attended a salute to Webster upon his retirement. This event resulted in the creation of the Jack Webster Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackwebster.com Jack Webster Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; to promote and honour excellence in journalism in British Columbia. Each year, journalists judged to have outstanding work receive a Jack Webster Award (known as a "Webster"), a glass statue and a cash prize that has become the hallmark of journalistic excellence in British Columbia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The awards have grown from a single "Reporter of the Year" in 1987 to thirteen awards today for best news, best feature and best community news reporting (print, radio, and TV awards in each of the three categories) as well as recognition for excellence in the categories of business reporting, science reporting, commentary, legal journalism, Chinese-language news, and the [[Bruce Hutchison]] Lifetime Achievement Award. The Foundation also awards fellowships and six annual student reporting awards.

{{Main|Jessica Graf}}
'''Jessica Furtado Graf''' (born December 11, 1990), 26, is a VIP concierge from [[Los Angeles, California]].

==Jillian==
'''Jillian Nicole Parker''' (born May 12, 1993), 24, is a timeshare sales representative from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Originally from [[Celebration, Florida]], she enjoys rock climbing and ropes courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122719/jillian-parker/|title=Jillian Parker|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 1, Jillian was not picked by Paul for safety and subsequently lost the safety competition, resulting in her becoming one of three nominees for eviction. She received only 3 out of 13 votes to evict and was saved. Later that week, Cody won the first HOH competition and nominated her for eviction. On Day 16, Jillian was evicted from the house 8-4, after Cody faced immense trouble securing a target for eviction; Jillian initially agreed to be a pawn up against Megan, but due to Megan suddenly quitting the game and circumstances beyond his control (Alex being vetoed off the block and Paul revealing his Pendant of Protection), Cody cycled through four different nominees next to Jillian and was eventually forced to put up Christmas as the last of these, and the majority of the house wanted to keep her, resulting in Jillian's role as a pawn backfiring when she became the dispensable player. On Day 30, Jillian competed against Cameron, Cody, and Dominique in the Battle Back Showdown, where she was eliminated in the first round.

==Josh==
'''Joshua “Josh” Martinez''', (born January 4, 1994), 23, is a haircare salesman from [[Homestead, Florida]]. Originally from [[Miami]], he enjoys playing sports, going to the gym, reading, hiking, traveling, meeting new people, being an adrenaline junkie, and having new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122720/josh-martinez/|title=Josh Martinez|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 1, Kevin was the first houseguest to buzz in to give into the first temptation and thus won $25,000 in exchange for the BB Swap twist and his own ineligibility to win the first HOH competition. On Day 25, Kevin chose to go for the mystery cash prize during the veto competition  and won $27. On Day 76, Christmas named Kevin as the replacement nominee after Paul used the POV to save Alex from the block. On Day 79, he was nominated alongside Raven for eviction. On Day 80, he was nominated alongside Alex for eviction. On Day 85, he was nominated alongside Josh for eviction.  On Day 86, Kevin was evicted, the sole vote being cast by Christmas, and became the 8th member of the jury. Kevin voted for Paul to win. He is also the oldest person of the season.

==Mark==
'''Mark Gordon Jansen''' (born June 13, 1991), 26, is a personal trainer from [[Grand Island, New York]]. He enjoys lifting weights, hiking, watching movies, and relaxing on a beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122722/mark-jansen/|title=Mark Jansen|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 37, Mark won the first Temptation Competition and became safe for the week. On Day 45, Josh nominated Mark and Elena for eviction. On Day 46, Mark won the Power of Veto. On Day 52, Mark won the third and final Temptation Competition. On Day 58, Jason nominated Mark and Elena for eviction during the double eviction. Later that night, Mark won the Power of Veto and chose to save himself. On Day 62, Mark was named as Christmas replacement nominee after Jason uses the POV on himself. On Day 65, Mark was evicted from the house by a 4-2 vote and became the third member of the Jury. Mark voted for Josh to win.

==Matt==
'''Matthew John “Matt” Clines''', (born March 31, 1984), 33, is a renovation consultant from [[Arlington, Virginia]]. He enjoys watching funny animal videos, eating, sleeping, and lifting weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122723/matthew-clines/|title=Matthew Clines|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Day 52, Matt lost the third Temptation Competition and became the third nominee for eviction. On Day 53, Matt won the POV. He chose to use the veto on Jason. On Day 58, Jason named Matt as the replacement nominee after Mark saved himself with the POV. On Day 59, Christmas nominated Matt and Jason for eviction. On Day 66, Jason nominated Matt and Raven for eviction. When Jason won the "Hide and Go Veto" POV on Day 68, he did not use it to save either of them, resulting in a heated argument where Matt blasted Jason's decision and for going back on his word and forgetting a promise to take Raven off the block. In an effort to keep his showmance partner Raven from being evicted, Matt attempted to martyr his own game by inciting as many penalty votes as possible (an act that would prove unnecessary when he was unanimously voted out of the house). On Day 69, Matt decided to break the Have-Not rules and eat food other than slop, resulting in him receiving an automatic penalty vote against him at the upcoming eviction. He later proceeded to take hot showers and slept outside of the Have-Not room. On Day 72, Matt was evicted by a 6-0 vote with the one penalty vote and became the fourth jury member. Matt voted for Paul to win.

Matt's time in the house was criticized due to his lack of involvement in the game as a major competitor on his own, almost entirely spent entering into a relationship with Raven and serving as Paul's ally, with Josh later remarking in the "Everybody's a Wiener" HOH Competition that his civil dispute with Alex and Jason for needlessly dragging out the competition (over sixty days into the game) was the first time he had a voice in the game. In general, he was known for eating an excessive amount a cereal, his tendency to shower longer than he needed to, and an uproarious laugh that became the subject of ridicule. His showmance with Raven was referred to as "Maven", and the rest of the Jury would later balk at the clueless nature of the duo when they claimed they were in control of the season after doing virtually nothing and even ending up evicted without realizing how it meant they had been defeated and felt comfortable with throwing their games to Paul and losing in that respect.

==Megan==
'''Megan Ann Lowder''' (born March 7, 1989), 28, is a dog walker from [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Originally from [[Cathedral City, California]], she enjoys playing video games, Harry Potter, and watching South Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122724/megan-lowder/|title=Megan Lowder|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In week 1, Cody nominated Megan alongside Jillian for eviction, due to their alliance. On Day 9, upon the start of the live feeds, it was revealed by fellow houseguests that Megan had quit the game the day before. The next day, she released a statement citing PTSD from a sexual assault during her time in the Navy as the reason for her self-eviction and inability to cope with multiple confrontations inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/television/2017/06/30/megan-lowder-ptsd-previous-assault-reason-she-left-big-brother-house-early/444830001/|title=Megan Lowder: PTSD from previous assault reason she left the 'Big Brother' house early|last=Pena|first=Xochitl|publisher=The Desert Sun|date=June 30, 2017|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Megan's presence in the season was almost completely purged from the show out of respect for her need to disconnect and distance herself from the atmosphere that reawakened her past trauma; none of the subsequent competitions paid mention to her (such as not having an illustrated cover for BB Comics Week), nor did Megan return as a guest for the finale.

==Paul==
{{Main|Paul Abrahamian}}
'''Paul Raffi Abrahamian''' (born June 13, 1993), 24, is a fashion designer from [[Tarzana, California]]. His hobbies are playing music, going to shows and concerts for the crowd surfing, mosh pits, stage diving, traveling and hiking. He is a graduate of [[Pepperdine University]]. He was the runner-up on ''[[Big Brother 18 (U.S.)|Big Brother 18]]'' in 2016.

On Day 1, Paul entered the house as a consequence for someone buzzing in to accept a $25,000 temptation. He was also granted safety from the first eviction and got to save 8 additional houseguests from having to compete for their safety that night. In week 1, Paul was the first houseguest to be voted into the Den of Temptation by America. He accepted the Pendant of Protection, which grants him immunity for the next three evictions. On Day 12, this power was revealed to his fellow houseguests when Cody tried to name him as the replacement nominee. On Day 16, Paul won the second HOH competition. On Day 17, Paul nominated Alex and Josh for eviction. On Day 18, Paul won the POV competition. On Day 20, he chose to take Josh off the block and replaced him with Cody. On Day 30, the house voted for Paul to face off against Cody in the final round of the Battle Back Showdown. Paul lost, which meant that Cody would re-enter the house. On Day 37, Paul won the HOH competition. He decided to nominate Cody and Jessica for eviction. On Day 40, Paul won the POV. On Day 74, Paul won his third POV of the season. On Day 81, Paul won his fourth POV of the season. On Day 84, he won his third HOH of the season. On Day 85, he won his fifth consecutive POV of the season. On day 86, Paul won part 1 of the Final HoH. On Day 92, Paul lost by a 5-4 jury vote to Josh Martinez, receiving the jury votes of Christmas Abbott, Kevin Schlehuber, Raven Walton and Matt Clines.

Paul is the fifth houseguest after Big Brother 3 contestants Danielle Reyes and Jason Guy, Big Brother 16 winner Derrick Levasseur, and Big Brother Canada 1 winner Jillian MacLaughlin to make it to the final 3 without touching the block. However, unlike the others, Paul was actually nominated but did not go on the block because the pendant of protection protected him, and accomplished this feat on his second attempt. Counting only HoH's and PoV's, Paul has won the most competitions in Big Brother history with 15 wins over his two seasons, more competitions than any male in a single season with 9 competitions wins in Big Brother 19, and the most competition wins in a single season, tied with Janelle Pierzina who won 9 competitions in Big Brother All-Stars. He is the second houseguest in Big Brother History after Dan Gheesling to make it to the final 2 twice, and the first person to make it to the final two twice without winning. With this season, Paul has played the most days of any houseguest with 191 days.

==Ramses==
'''Ramses Soto''' (born December 18, 1995), 21, is a cosplay artist from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. He enjoys cosplaying and creating art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122725/ramses-soto/|title=Ramses Soto|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In week 1, after Paul accepted a temptation, Ramses received the consequence and must put himself up as a third nominee for eviction sometime within the first 3 weeks. On Day 17, Ramses decided to follow through with his curse and put himself up for eviction alongside Paul's week 2 nominees. He was getting targeted by fellow housemates (houseguests) Kevin and Christmas in week 2. On Day 31, Jessica nominated Ramses for eviction. As Jessica wins the Power of Veto, she decides to keep the nominations, meaning either him or Josh will be voted to be evicted. On Day 37, Ramses went home in a 7-3 vote against Josh.

==Raven==
'''Raven Leigh-Anna Walton''' (born June 10, 1994), 23, is a dance teacher from [[DeValls Bluff, Arkansas]]. She enjoys road tripping with her friends, reading books, and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1007606/meet-the-cast-of-big-brother-season-19/122726/raven-walton/|title=Raven Walton|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suffers from a disease called [[gastroparesis]], which is a chronic condition of stomach paralysis that forces her to use a [[Implantable gastric stimulation|gastric pacemaker]] in order for food to properly move through her digestive tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/06/big-brother-raven-walton-gastroparesis/|publisher=The Mighty|last=Migdol|first=Erin|date=June 29, 2017|title='Big Brother' Contestant Raven Walton Is Showing Viewers the Reality of Gastroparesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 10, Raven retrieved a golden starfish during the Power of Veto competition and became immune from becoming a have-not for the rest of the summer. On Day 66, Jason nominated Raven and Matt for eviction. The nominations were kept the same post-veto, but Raven was spared from eviction as the expense of her showmance with Matt. On Day 79, Alex nominated Raven and Kevin for eviction and was evicted by a 2-1 vote and became the sixth member of the jury. Raven voted for Paul to win.

Raven became a subject of heavy contention from the show's fans after she repeatedly misrepresented her gastroparesis (or GP) as a terminal condition, along with a multitude of accompanying ailments that were caused by the illness. Most of her statements regarding her health were deemed inconsistent and/or implausible, and ultimately caused many to condemn her behavior as [[malingering]]. She also claimed to have an abundance of other bizarre medical issues, such as an inverted spine, two beating hearts, and "rough kneecap syndrome." Fans heavily speculated the true extent of Raven's illness throughout the entire season, with many divided on whether she was just a misinformed [[hypochondriac]] and/or someone suffering from [[Munchausen's syndrome]]. Some fans accused Raven of being a scam artist after it was discovered that her family had set up a GoFundMe page to support Raven's disease that had acquired $200,000 in donations prior to going on ''Big Brother'''. She also regularly stated that she would need to have expensive surgeries done afterwards in order to be healthy and have children.

In the background, [[Max Fursman|a large crowd]] in a stadium can be seen, as well as two blurred flags hoisted in flagpoles.]]
The tradition of carrying the [[Olympic flame]] from [[Olympia, Greece]], the birthplace of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], to the host city of the modern [[Olympic Games]] via a [[List of Olympic torch relays|torch relay]] was first introduced in 1936, ahead of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Games]]. Since then, famous athletes (active or retired) with significant sporting achievements while representing the host country, promising young athletes, or other individuals with symbolic significance, have been selected as the last runners in the Olympic torch relay and consequently have the honor of lighting the Olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony.

==History==
The first well-known athlete to light the cauldron was nine-time Olympic champion [[Paavo Nurmi]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Other famous final torch bearers include French football star [[Michel Platini]] ([[1992 Winter Olympics|1992]]), heavyweight boxing champion [[Muhammad Ali]] ([[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]), Australian sprinter [[Cathy Freeman]] ([[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]), the Canadian ice hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]] ([[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]), the marathon runner [[Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima]] ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]) and the South Korean figure skating champion [[Yuna Kim]] ([[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]]).

On other occasions, the people who lit the cauldron were not famous but nevertheless symbolized the Olympic ideals. Japanese runner [[Yoshinori Sakai]] was born in [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945, the day the city was destroyed by an [[Little Boy|atomic bomb]]. He symbolized the rebirth of Japan after the [[Second World War]] when he lit the Olympic cauldron of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. At the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Games]] in [[Montreal]], two teenagers—representing the French- and the English-speaking parts of the country—symbolized the unity of Canada. Norway's [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon]] lit the cauldron of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], in honor of his father and grandfather, both Olympians. For the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Games]] in [[London]], seven aspiring young athletes—each nominated by a former British Olympic champion—had the honor of lighting the cauldron.

Nash is a two-time [[NBA]] [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] with the [[Phoenix Suns]] and a former member of the [[Canada national men's basketball team|Canadian Olympic Basketball team]], playing in [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2000 Summer Games]]. Greene won gold in the giant slalom and silver in the slalom in 1968 Winter Games. Gretzky was a member of the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canadian ice hockey team]] and won four [[Stanley Cup]] titles as captain of the [[Edmonton Oilers]] ({{scfy|1984}}, {{scfy|1985}}, {{scfy|1987}}, {{scfy|1988}}). He was the Executive Director of the Canadian men's hockey team in 2002, who won gold at that Games.

During the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], Nash, Greene and Gretzky lit a cauldron inside the [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]] indoor stadium. Gretzky then lit a second, outdoor cauldron near the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]]. Only the outdoor cauldron remained lit throughout the Games.

Le May Doan was supposed to participate in the lighting of the indoor cauldron, but was left out when one of the four arms failed to raise due to mechanical problems. This was corrected at the beginning of the [[2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], when a joke was made about the mechanical error, and she was able to light the newly emerged fourth arm and relight the indoor cauldron to begin the closing ceremony.

'''Léon Pourtau''' (1872&amp;nbsp;– 4 July 1898) was a French painter and musician.

At the age of 15, an apprentice [[typesetter]], Pourtau left Bordeaux for Paris. He worked in a small restaurant on the [[Rue Lafayette]], where musicians gathered [[Orchestre Lamoureux]]. Thanks to them gets a job as a concert [[clarinet]]ist in a [[Café-chantant]]. He toured with a [[circus]] band where he would help set up the [[circus tent|tent]] and bathe the elephants. Back in Paris he entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. During this period he married, had two children, and become a professor at the [[Conservatoire de Lyon]] at the age of 22 – the youngest ever.

He met [[George Seurat]], himself also a musician, who taught him the [[impressionist]] technique. He took the opportunity of a concert tour in the US, which, after two years, earned him 20,000 [[French franc|Francs]]. At the annual exhibition of fine art held in [[Philadelphia]] over the winter of 1896–1897, he exhibited a painting, ''Quatre heures de l'après-midi'' (''Four o'clock in the afternoon''). This would be his only showing.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, "Unexpected masterpieces at Maastricht fair", ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 12 September 2006. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/10/features/melik11.php?page=2 Article consulté en ligne le 27.04.08].&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to [[Le Havre]], Pourtau boarded the [[SS La Bourgogne|SS ''La Bourgogne'']]. On 4 July 1898 she was sunk in collision in dense fog with the British sailing ship ''Cromartyshire'' off [[Sable Island]] (now belonging to Canada).&lt;ref&gt;210 US 95 ''George Deslions vs. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique'', http://openjurist.org/210/us/95/george-deslions-v-la-compagnie-generale-transatlantique&lt;/ref&gt; The painter died in the accident.

His works are now in the collections of several [[art museums]] including the [[Museo Soumaya]], Mexico City and the Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix, Arizona.

{{nihongo4|'''Mayuri Kurotsuchi'''|涅 マユリ|Kurotsuchi Mayuri}} is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Bleach (manga)|Bleach anime and manga]] created by [[Tite Kubo]]. He is the current Captain of Squad 12th Division of the Gotei 13 and overseer of the Soul Reapers' Research and Development Institute.

== History ==
110 years prior to the series, Mayuri Kurotsuchi was an inmate in the Maggots Nest, the only one dangerous enough to be chained behind bars for his utter lack of regard for the life when it comes to experimentation. But that changed when Mayuri is visited by [[Kisuke Urahara]] and his lieutenant [[Hiyori Sarugaki]], the former offering Mayuri a position in the SRDI. After initially refusing being Urahara's assistant, Mayuri accepts when Urahara points out that he be his successor should anything happen to him. Nine years after his release,  Kisuke and Hiyori forced to leave the Soul Society, Mayuri becomes the new captain of Squad 12 as the result of the fifth experiment in his life-creating Nemuri Project while later taking the seventh surviving experiment, [[Nemu Kurotsuchi]], to be his lieutenant and lab assistant while pretending to be uncaring towards her to hide his joy of creating a fully stable artificial life form. During this time, Mayuri experimented on Quincies, including Soken Ishida, the grandfather and trainer of [[Uryū Ishida]].

== Plot Overview ==
When Ichigo and his allies entered the Soul Society, Mayuri aided in the search for the Ryoka and found [[Orihime Inoue]] and Uryū. Orihime escaped and Mayuri reluctantly fights Uryū, seeing no need to study Quincies any further.&lt;ref name="ch120"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kubo, Tite|title=Bleach, Volume 14|year=2006 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |chapter=Chapter 120|isbn=1-4215-0612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uryu is initially too weak to fight Mayuri until the Soul Reaper revealed that he experimented on Soken Ishida which his opponent unlocking his full Quincy powers prior to escaping.&lt;ref name="ch91"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kubo, Tite|title=Bleach, Volume 11|year=2006 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |chapter=Chapter 91|isbn=1-4215-0271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ch125"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kubo, Tite|title=Bleach, Volume 15|year=2006 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |chapter=Chapter 125|isbn=1-4215-0613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayuri remained on the sidelines for the duration of the search out of disinterest, even after he learns of [[Sosuke Aizen]]'s betrayal.

Later, Mayuri joins [[Byakuya Kuchiki]], [[Kenpachi Zaraki]], [[Retsu Unohana]], and their subordinates in Hueco Mundo. He saves Uryū and [[Renji Abarai]] from Szayelaporro Granz, having an advantage against the Espada due to a bacterium he implanted in Uryū during their last fight that analyzed Szayelaporro's abilities.&lt;ref name="ch298"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kubo, Tite|title=Bleach, Volume 34|year=2008 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |chapter=Chapter 298|isbn=978-4-08-874541-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating his controlled Zanpakuto while his opponent uses Nemu's body to reconstitute himself, Mayuri felt disappointed by the Arrancar's claims to have become a perfect being. As Szayelaporro's new body is paralyzed from exposure to the serums in Nemu's body, Mayuri kills him while giving him a lecture on why scientists shouldn't claim or even want perfection. Soon after, Mayuri investigates Szayelaporro's laboratory to take what he can for his research before healing Uryū and Renji, followed by sending [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and Unohana through the Garganta to the Fake Karakura Town. While explaining to Byakuya that he is more interested in seeing what specimens Hueco Mundo offers to him, Mayuri notes that he does faith in Ichigo's ability to end the war. Once the fight against Aizen is settled, Mayuri attempts to seal off the Fake Karakura Town with their allies still inside but is stopped by his subordinates.

Almost a year later, Mayuri appears at a captain's meeting where he and Akon explain what they know about the Quincy group known as the Wandereich. Furthermore, Mayuri confirms that he ordered his squad to slaughter the 28,000 people in the Rukon to stabilize the Wandereich slaughtering Hollows while getting into a debate with Head Captain [[Yamamoto Genryusai]] over whose fault that such a deed needed to be carried out. Mayuri is further livid during the Wandereich's attack on the Soul Society when his fellow captains' lost their Bankai as a result of deciding to act on their own before he could completed his analysis on the enemy. Following the first invasion, meeting with Ichigo to discuss his broken Zangetsu, Mayuri locked himself away to continue his research on the Wandereich's Bankai stealing abilities with Urahara offering his assistance on the matter to develop a countermeasure to give the Soul Reaper captains who lost their Bankai an advantage. During the second Wandenreich invasion, Mayuri personally gets involved once interested in the abilities of Giselle Gewelle to turn living Soul Reapers into her zombie slaves while unveiling his own personal fighting team in the revived Arrancars Dordoni Alessandro Del Socaccio, Cirucci Sanderwicci, Luppi Antenor, and Charlotte Chuhlhourne. When Toshiro Hitsugaya appears as Giselle's zombie slave, Mayuri takes on the fellow Soul Reaper captain with the intent to test some of his serums on the youth. But by the time the zombified Rose, Kensei, and Rangiku arrive after Hitsugaya's defeat, Mayuri revealed that he devised a serum to alter the blood of the zombified Soul Reapers so they can only obey him. After having Giselle killed, while restoring Hitsugaya and Rangiku to normal, Mayuri takes Rose and Kensei to aid Byakuya in his fight against PePe Waccabrada.

When Yhwach absorbed the Soul King's power, Mayuri and Kenpachi come across Pernida Parnkgjas in the transformed Royal Realm. After Pernida defeats Kenpachi, deeming the mysterious Wandenreich to be creepy for even him, Mayuri finds himself in a battle for his life after Perinda reveals himself to be the left arm of the Soul King. After his attempt to defeat Perinda with a variation of his Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō failed, realizing the arm is constantly evolving, Mayuri finds himself being protected by Nemu before she throws him over to a nearby building to watch her fight with the arm unfold. Though Nemu dies while having visions of being taunted by Szayelaporro, Mayuri saves his creation's brain from being eaten by Perinda so the Quincy would die an antagonizing death from her cellular makeup. In the series epilogue, Mayuri created a new Nemu.

== Abilities ==
Mayuri's greatest ability is his scientific intellect. He's able to think many steps ahead of his opponents and has created numerous inventions to aid him in battle. He is also a master of Kido and has a very high level of Reiatsu.

=== Zanpakutō ===
Mayuri Kurotsuchi's ''Zanpakutō'' is {{nihongo|Ashisogi Jizō|疋殺地蔵||"Animal killing Ksitigarbha", translated in other ways}}. When released with the command {{nihongo|"Claw Out"|掻き毟れ|kakimushire}}, Ashisogi Jizō's blade transforms into a deformed [[trident]] head. When it stabs an opponent, it emits a poison that severs the nerve signals that control limb movement, paralyzing that limb regardless of where it was struck. However, unlike normal paralysis, the affected area is still able to feel pain, something which is rather fitting for Mayuri's demented tendencies. Ashisogi Jizō's ''bankai'', named {{nihongo|Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō|金色疋殺地蔵||"Gold Animal killing Ksitigarbha", translated in the English manga as "divine leg-cutting Buddha"}}, takes the form of a giant caterpillar with a baby's head and a silver halo. The creature breathes a poisonous derivative of Mayuri's blood which is lethal to anyone who breathes it, aside from himself and Nemu.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; chapter 307&lt;/ref&gt; It can also run through and skewer opponents with the multiple blades that erupt from its chest. Mayuri has physically modified his ''bankai'' so that it will self-destruct and return to its sealed state if it attacks him. It is also shown that Mayuri changes the poison he uses every time he shows his bankai. During his fight against Pernida, Mayuri reveals an alternate ''bankai'' called Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō: Makai Fukuin Shōtai, which is an enormous overweight infant-like creature that gives birth to a Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō specially designed to Mayuri's specifications against a certain opponent.

''Ashisogi Jizo'' appears as a free ''Zanpakutō'' spirit in the ''Zanpakutō Unknown Tales'' anime arc as a small, baby-like creature with butterfly wings. As a final defensive measure, Mayuri can reduce himself to liquid form for three days by stabbing himself with his ''Zanpakutō''. This leaves him unable to attack or be attacked, making it a very effective escape tool.

== Other Media ==
He appears in almost every Bleach Video Game as a playable character and was in the first three Bleach movies. In [[Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion]] Byakuya Kuchiki, [[Jushiro Ukitake]], and [[Shunsui Kyoraku]] go to his lab to ask him if it's possible for people to have the same Zanpakuto. In [[Bleach: Fade to Black]] his lab is attacked and he is driven to insane with Nemu, the rest of Squad 12 and Kenpachi trying to get him under control before they're engulfed by a white liquid from one of the machines in his laboratory.

== Reception ==
Mayuri Kurotsuchi ranked 28th place in the 3rd Popularity poll.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter 214, pages 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; His fight with Uryu was ranked 8th place in the Bleach Best Bout.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter 392, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; His sword, Ashi Sogi Jizo was the 26th ranked zanpakuto in the 5th poll.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter 392, pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mayuri has appeared in much merchandise including key chains, arm bands, and action figures.

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network said that there was "a certain amount of ridiculousness" in watching Szayelapporo Granz and Mayuri try to get the upper hand on each other during their fight. However, he went on to say that Mayuri finishing the battle was a "wonderfully jaw-dropping conclusion" to Volume 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/bleach/gn-34|title=Bleach GN 34 - Review|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Santos, Carlo|date=2011-02-25|accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.F.

'''Nathan Bedford Forrest''' (July 13, 1821 – October 29, 1877), called '''Bedford Forrest''' in his lifetime, was a cotton farmer, [[Slavery in the United States|slave owner]], slave trader,  [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] general during the [[American Civil War]], first [[Grand Wizard|leader]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and president of the Selma, Marion, &amp; Memphis Railroad.

Prior to the outbreak of the war, Forrest amassed substantial wealth as a cotton planter, horse and cattle trader, [[real estate broker]] and slave trader. In June 1861, Forrest enlisted in the [[Confederate Army]]. He was one of the few officers on either side  during the war to enlist as a [[private (rank)|private]] and be promoted to [[general officer]] and corps commander without any military education or training. An expert cavalry leader, Forrest eventually was given command of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps|a corps]] and established new [[doctrine#Military usage|doctrine]]s for mobile forces, earning the nickname "The Wizard of the Saddle".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Morton |first=John Watson |year=1909 |title=The Artillery of Nathan Bedford Forrest's Cavalry: "the Wizard of the Saddle", |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nmQUAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Publishing house of the M. E. Church, South, Smith &amp; Lamar, agents |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His methods subsequently influenced many future generations of military strategists, although the Confederate high command may have failed to fully utilize his talents.&lt;ref name="Starr2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Z.

Forrest's cavalry captured more Union guns, horses and supplies than any other single Confederate unit. Forrest proved to be a belligerent nemesis for both Union Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William T. Sherman]]. He played pivotal roles at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], the capture of [[First Battle of Murfreesboro|Murfreesboro]], the pursuit and capture of Colonel [[Abel Streight]]'s [[Streight's Raid|Raiders]], [[Battle of Brice's Crossroads|Brice's Crossroads]] and the [[Franklin–Nashville Campaign|Nashville Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castel|first1=Albert|last2=Wyeth|first2=John Allan|title=That Devil Forrest: Life of General Nathan Bedford Forrest|date=1989|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=0-8071-1578-9|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1864, in what has been called "one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history,"&lt;ref&gt;Eicher 2001, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; troops under Forrest's command massacred Union troops who had surrendered, most of them black soldiers, along with some [[Southern Unionist|white Southern Tennesseans]] fighting for the Union, at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow#Massacre|Battle of Fort Pillow]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news

In June, Forrest achieved a notable victory at Brice's Crossroads, but was followed by a Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Tupelo|Tupelo]], in July, where he was wounded in battle. Forrest was in chief command of the cavalry during the Nashville Campaign. In February 1865, Forrest was promoted to Lieutenant General. After [[Robert E. Lee]] was defeated and surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, the war came to a conclusion. In May 1865, Forrest surrendered at Selma, was paroled, and he returned to his cotton plantations.

Lacking coordinated leadership and facing strong prosecution by President Grant and the newly established Department of Justice, the members of  this first incarnation of the Klan absconded and it gradually disappeared.

For a time after the war, Forrest operated a prison labor camp where prisoners, primarily black men arrested for "vagrancy" or other similar charges, had their involuntary labor auctioned to private bidders, to the benefit of the buyers and the prison officials. However, in the last years of his life, Forrest publicly denounced the violence and racism practiced by the Klan, insisted he had never been a member and made at least one public speech (to a black audience) in favor of racial harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (1988), p. 342.

Serbu], ''Sociological Quarterly'', January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars admire Forrest as a military strategist, he has remained a highly controversial figure in Southern history, especially for his role in the attack on Fort Pillow, his 1867–1869 leadership of the Ku Klux Klan and his political influence as a Tennessee delegate at the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]].

There was no need of a window, for light and air found ready access through the door ways and cracks, and down through the wide chimney. A pane of glass was a luxury as yet unknown to this primitive life. Around and near the house was a cleared patch of land containing several acres enclosed with a straight stake fence of cedar rails, and by short cross fences divided into a yard immediately about the cabin; rearward of this a garden, and a young orchard of peach, apple, pear, and plum trees.}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Forrest worked as a blacksmith in Tennessee until 1834, when he moved to [[Mississippi]].{{sfn|Spaulding|1931|p=532}} William died in 1837 and Forrest became the primary caretaker of the family at the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Spaulding|1931|p=532}}

His uncle was killed there in 1845 during an argument with the Matlock brothers.

Nathan Bedford Forrest was a tall man and had a commanding presence. Out of habit, he was mild mannered, quiet in speech, exemplary in language, considerate, and  generally kindhearted. Forrest rarely drank and he abstained from tobacco usage. When he was provoked or angered, however, he would become savage, profane, and terrifying in appearance. Although he was not formally educated, Forrest was able to read and write in clear and grammatical English.{{sfn|Spaulding|1931|p=533}}

==American Civil War (1861–1865)==
===Early cavalry command===
After the Civil War broke out, Forrest returned to Tennessee from his Mississippi ventures and enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] (CSA) on June 14, 1861; he reported for training at [[Fort Wright (Tennessee)|Fort Wright]] near [[Randolph, Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="Chalmers1878"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R.

His superior officers and [[Governor of Tennessee]] [[Isham G.

Public debate surrounded [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]]'s decision to join the Confederacy, and both the Confederate and [[Union Army|Union]] armies recruited soldiers from the state.

===Sacramento and Fort Donaldson===

Forrest received praise for his skill and courage during an early victory in the [[Battle of Sacramento (Kentucky)|Battle of Sacramento]] in [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]], the first in which he commanded troops in the field, where he routed a Union force by personally leading a cavalry charge that was later commended by his commander, Brigadier General [[Charles Clark (governor)|Charles Clark]].&lt;ref name="Bishop2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Randy Bishop|title=Kentucky's Civil War Battlefields: A Guide to Their History and Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ_EtKDJQw8C&amp;pg=PA88|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Pelican Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-4556-1607-7|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2016, pp. 36–41&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest distinguished himself further at the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]] in February 1862. After his cavalry captured a Union [[artillery battery]], he broke out of a [[siege]] headed by [[Major General#United States|Major General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]], rallying nearly 4,000 troops and leading them to escape across the [[Cumberland River]].&lt;ref name="Hurst2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Hurst|title=Men of Fire: Grant, Forrest, and the Campaign That Decided the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AItjjfjiYB0C&amp;pg=PA252|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00847-6|pages=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the Confederate surrender of Fort Donelson, with the fall of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to Union forces imminent, Forrest took command of the city. All available carts and wagons were impressed into service to haul six hundred boxes of army clothing, 250,000 pounds of bacon, and forty wagon-loads of ammunition to the railroad depots to be sent off to Chattanooga and Decatur.&lt;ref name="JordanPryor1868"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Jordan|author2=J.

===Shiloh and Murfreesboro ===
A month later, Forrest was back in action at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], fought April 6–7, 1862. He commanded a Confederate [[rear guard]] after the Union victory. In the battle of [[Battle of Shiloh#Fallen Timbers, April 8|Fallen Timbers]], he drove through the Union [[skirmish line]]. Not realizing that the rest of his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade alone and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking and slashing. A Union [[infantryman]] on the ground beside Forrest fired a musket ball at him with a point-blank shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through Forrest's pelvis and lodged near his spine. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable.&lt;ref name="Welsh1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Isbell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy T.

Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-435-0|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early summer, Forrest commanded a new brigade of "green" cavalry regiments. In July, he led them into Middle Tennessee under orders to launch a cavalry raid, and on July 13, 1862, led them into the [[First Battle of Murfreesboro]], as a result of which all of the Union units surrendered to Forrest, and the Confederates destroyed much of the Union's supplies and railroad track in the area.{{sfn|Boatner III|1988|p=289}}

===West Tennessee raids===
[[File:NathanBedfordForrestportrait.jpg|thumb|right|180px|&lt;center&gt;'''Gen. Bedford Forrest'''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Promoted on July 21, 1862 to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]], Forrest was given command of a Confederate cavalry brigade.&lt;ref name=Eicher240&gt;{{harvnb|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1862, Forrest's veteran troopers were reassigned by General [[Braxton Bragg]] to another officer, against his protest. Forrest had to recruit a new brigade, composed of about 2,000 inexperienced recruits, most of whom lacked weapons.&lt;ref name="Jones2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Jones|title=Alabama and the Civil War: A History &amp; Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SggmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=12 June 2017|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4396-6075-1|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Bragg ordered a series of raids, [[The West Tennessee Raids|this time into west Tennessee]], to disrupt the communications of the Union forces under Grant, which were threatening the city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Forrest protested that to send such untrained men behind enemy lines was suicidal, but Bragg insisted, and Forrest obeyed his orders. In the ensuing raids he led thousands of Union soldiers in west Tennessee on a "[[wikt:wild-goose chase|wild goose chase]]" to try to locate his fast-moving forces. Never staying in one place long enough to be attacked, Forrest led his troops in raids as far north as the banks of the [[Ohio River]] in southwest Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod 2011, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; His destruction of railroads around Grant's headquarters at Holly Springs and his cutting down of telegraph lines slowed the implementation of Grant's notorious [[anti-semitic]] General Orders #11, which expelled Jewish cotton traders and their families from Grant's military district. Grant had blamed Jews for widespread cotton smuggling and speculation that affected his ability to fight the Confederate Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarna|first=Jonathan D.|title=When Gen.

Forrest returned to his base in Mississippi with more men than he had started with. By then, all were fully armed with captured Union weapons. As a result, Grant was forced to revise and delay the strategy of his [[Vicksburg campaign]]. Newspaper correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader, who traveled with Grant for three years during his campaigns, wrote that Forrest "was the only Confederate cavalryman of whom Grant stood in much dread".&lt;ref name="Miers1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Earl S.

===Dover, Brentwood, and Chattanooga===
The Union Army gained military control of Tennessee in 1862 and occupied it for the duration of the war, having taken control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations, including the [[Battle of Dover (1863)]] and the [[Battle of Brentwood]] until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the [[backcountry]] of northern [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]] and west [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]] to defend against an attack of 3,000 Union cavalrymen commanded by Colonel [[Abel Streight]].

Streight's goal changed from dismantling the railroad to escaping the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight's unit east of [[Cedar Bluff, Alabama]].

===Fort Pillow massacre===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Pillow}}
[[image:Battle of Fort Pillow.png|right|220px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''Fort Pillow Massacre'''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fort Pillow, located 40 miles up river from Memphis (''[[Henning, Tennessee|Henning]]''), was originally constructed by Confederate general [[Gideon Johnson Pillow]], on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, later taken over by Union forces in 1862, after the Confederates had abandoned the fort.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} The fort was manned by 557 Union troops, 295 white and 262 black, under Union commander Maj. L.F. Booth. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}}

On the early morning of April 12, 1864, Forrest's men under Brig. Gen. James Chalmers, attacked and recaptured Fort Pillow.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} Booth and his adjutant were killed in battle, leaving Fort Pillow under the command of Major William Bradford {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} At 10:00 Forrest reached the fort after a hard ride from Mississippi. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} Not shy of action, Forrest rode up to the battle, his horse was shot under him, and he fell to the ground. Undaunted, Forrest mounted a second horse, which was shot under him as well, forcing him to mount a third horse.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=139}} By 3:30 pm, Forrest concluded the Fort could not be held anymore and ordered a flag of truce and that the fort be surrendered. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} Bradford refused to surrender, believing his troops could escape to the Union gunboat, [[USS New Era (1862)|USS ''New Era'']], on the Mississippi River. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} Forrest's men immediately took over the fort, while Union soldiers retreated to the lower bluffs of the river, but the ''USS New Era'' did not come to their rescue. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=140}} What happened next became known as the ''Fort Pillow Massacre''{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=141}} As the Union troops surrendered, Forrest's men opened fire, slaughtering both black and white soldiers. {{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=141}}&lt;ref name="WarDept1891610"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

Forrest's Confederate forces were accused of subjecting Union captured soldiers to extreme brutality, with allegations of back-shooting soldiers who fled into the river, shooting wounded soldiers, burning men alive, nailing men to barrels and igniting them, [[crucifixion]], and hacking men to death with sabers.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=142}} Forrest's men were alleged to have set fire to a Union [[barracks]] with wounded Union soldiers inside&lt;ref name="WarDept1891570"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

Additionally, Sherman "was told by hundreds" of Union soldiers that they were treated well, while prisoners under Forrest, at various times during the war.&lt;ref name="Sherman1875"&gt;{{cite book|author=William T.

No doubt Forrest's men acted like a set of barbarians, shooting down the helpless negro garrison after the fort was in their possession; but I am told that Forrest personally disclaims any active participation in the assault, and that he stopped the firing as soon as he could. I also take it for granted that Forrest did not lead the assault in person, and consequently that he was to the rear, out of sight if not of hearing at the time, and I was told by hundreds of our men, who were at various times prisoners in Forrest's possession, that he was usually very kind to them. He had a desperate set of fellows under him, and at that very time there is no doubt the feeling of the Southern people was fearfully savage on this very point of our making soldiers out of their late slaves, and Forrest may have shared the feeling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee but had transferred to the east to command all Union troops. He wrote in his [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|memoirs]] that Forrest in his report of the battle had "left out the part which shocks humanity to read."&lt;ref name="Grant1895417"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulysses Simpson Grant|title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrInAWjWVJ0C&amp;pg=PA417|year=1895|publisher=Sampson Low|page=417|quote=These troops fought bravely, but were overpowered.

The approximate loss was upward of five hundred killed, but few of the officers escaping. My loss was about twenty killed. It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners."

===Murfreesboro, Nashville, and Selma===
After his bloody defeat at Franklin, Hood continued on to Nashville. Hood ordered Forrest to conduct an independent raid against the [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] [[garrison]]. After success in achieving the objectives specified by Hood, Forrest engaged Union forces near Murfreesboro on December 5, 1864. In what would be known as the [[Third Battle of Murfreesboro]], a portion of Forrest's command broke and ran.&lt;ref name="Lardas2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Lardas|title=Nashville 1864: From the Tennessee to the Cumberland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfwyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-1983-3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hood's battle-hardened Army of Tennessee, consisting of 40,000 men deployed in three infantry corps plus 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry, was all but destroyed on December 15–16, at the [[Battle of Nashville]],&lt;ref name="Bobrick2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson Bobrick|title=The Battle of Nashville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZJ0BI6VLRwC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2010|publisher=Random House Children's Books|isbn=978-0-375-84887-2|pages=81, 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest distinguished himself by commanding the Confederate rear guard in a series of actions that allowed what was left of the army to escape.

Burlock|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1865, Forrest led an unsuccessful defense of the state of Alabama against [[Wilson's Raid]]. His opponent, Brig. Gen. [[James H. Wilson]], defeated Forrest at the [[Battle of Selma]] on April 2, 1865.&lt;ref name="Eicher2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J Eicher|title=The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1p94XzYASDAC&amp;pg=PA837|date=30 March 2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1846-7|page=837}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia. When he received news of Lee's surrender, Forrest also chose to surrender. On May 9, 1865, at [[Gainesville, Alabama|Gainesville]], Forrest read his [[farewell address]] to the men under his command, enjoining them to "submit to the powers to be, and to aid in restoring peace and establishing law and order throughout the land."&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2016, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar years and later life==

===Business ventures===
With [[Abolition of slavery in the USA#The end of slavery|slavery abolished]] after the war, Forrest suffered a major financial setback as a former [[slave trader]]. He became interested in the area around [[Crowley's Ridge]] during the war and settled in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1866, Forrest and C.C. McCreanor contracted to finish the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham 2016, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commissary (store)|commissary]] he built as a provisioning store for the 1,000 Irish laborers hired to lay the rails became the nucleus of a town, which most residents called "Forrest's Town" and which was incorporated as [[Forrest City, Arkansas]] in 1870.&lt;ref name="EOA2017"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mike Polston|title=Forrest City (St. Francis County)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=996|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net|publisher=The Central Arkansas Library System|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105132923/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=996|archivedate=November 5, 2017|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Court Carney writes that Forrest was not universally popular in the white Memphis community; he alienated many of the city's businessmen in his commercial dealings, and he was criticized for questionable business practices that caused him to default on debts.&lt;ref name="Carney2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Court Carney|title=The Contested Image of Nathan Bedford Forrest|jstor=3070019|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=August 2001|volume=67|issue=3|page=605|doi=10.2307/3070019|publisher=Southern Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later found employment at the [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]]-based Marion &amp; Memphis Railroad and eventually became the company president. He was not as successful in railroad promoting as in war, and under his direction, the company went [[bankrupt]]. Nearly ruined as the result of this failure, Forrest spent his final days running an eight-hundred acre farm on land he leased on [[President's Island]] in the Mississippi River, where he and his wife lived in a [[log cabin]]. There, with the labor of over a hundred prison convicts, he grew corn, potatoes, vegetables, and cotton profitably, but his health was in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Ashdown, Caudill 2006, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offers services to Sherman===
During the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] of 1873, some of Forrest's old Southern friends were [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]]s aboard the vessel so he wrote a letter to then General-in-Chief of the United States Army William T. Sherman and offered his services in case of war with Spain. Sherman, who in the Civil War had recognized what a deadly foe Forrest was, replied after the crisis settled down. He thanked Forrest for the offer and stated that had war broken out, he would have considered it an honor to have served side-by-side with him.&lt;ref name="Davison 2016, pp. 474–475"&gt;Davison 2016, pp. 474–475&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ku Klux Klan membership===
{{wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}
Forrest was an early member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] ("KKK" or simply "the Klan"), which was formed by six veterans of the Confederate Army in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]] during the spring of 1866,&lt;ref name="Wade1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wyn Craig Wade|title=The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O_XYBMhNYAC&amp;pg=PA32|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512357-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Newton|title=White Robes and Burning Crosses: A History of the Ku Klux Klan from 1866|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NT0xBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=30 July 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7774-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elaine Frantz Parsons|title=Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan during Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl60CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|date=9 November 2015|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-4696-2543-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A common report is that Forrest arrived in Nashville in April 1867 while the Klan was meeting at the [[Maxwell House Hotel]], probably at the encouragement of a state Klan leader, former Confederate general [[George Gordon (Civil War General)|George Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton 2014, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had grown to the point where an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest was well-suited to the role. In Room 10 of the Maxwell, Forrest was sworn in as a member by [[John W. Morton (Tennessee politician)|John W. Morton]].&lt;ref name="tennesseanobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=John W.

B. Forest of Confederate fame was at our head, and was known as the Grand Wizard. I heard him make a speech in one of our Dens".&lt;ref name="Wills1993336"/&gt; The title "[[Grand Wizard]]" was chosen because General Forrest had been known as "The Wizard of the Saddle" during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Bust Hell Wide Open: The Life of Nathan Bedford Forrest |first=Samual W. |last=Mitcham Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jack Hurst's 1993 biography, "Two years after [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], Forrest was reincarnated as grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. As the Klan's first national leader, he became the [[Lost Cause]]'s avenging angel, galvanizing a loose collection of boyish secret social clubs into a reactionary instrument of terror still feared today."&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 1993, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest was the Klan's first and only Grand Wizard, and he was active in recruitment for the Klan from 1867 to 1868.{{sfn|Newton|2014|p=11}}

White Americans who made up the KKK hoped to persuade black voters that a return to their pre-war state of bondage was in their best interest. Forrest assisted in maintaining order. It was after these efforts failed that Klan violence and intimidation escalated and became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Wills 1993, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Author Andrew Ward, however, writes, "In the spring of 1867, Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; 'ghost' masquerades; and 'whipping' and even 'killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office'".{{sfn|Ward|2005|p=386}}

In an 1868 interview by a [[Cincinnati]] newspaper, Forrest claimed that the Klan had 40,000 members in [[Tennessee]] and 550,000 total members throughout the Southern states.&lt;ref name="Gitlin2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marty Gitlin|title=The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJ4YHu0DX0AC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36576-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartoletti2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Campbell Bartoletti|title=They Called Themselves the K.K.K.: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnoQBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|date=10 June 2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-48803-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he sympathized with them, but denied any formal connection.

After the [[lynching|lynch mob]] murder of four blacks, arrested for defending themselves at a barbecue, Forrest wrote to Tennessee Governor [[John C. Brown]] in August 1874 and "volunteered to help ‘exterminate’ those men responsible for the continued violence against the blacks", offering "to exterminate the white marauders who disgrace their race by this cowardly murder of Negroes".&lt;ref name="Davison 2016, pp. 474–475"/&gt;

====Democratic convention 1868====
{{main|1868 Democratic National Convention}}
The Klan's activity infiltrated the Democrat's campaign for the [[United States presidential election, 1868|presidential election of 1868]]. Prominent ex-Confederates, including Forrest, the Grand Wizard of the Klan, and South Carolina's [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], attended as delegates at the 1868 Democratic Convention, held at [[Tammany Hall]] in New York City{{sfnm|Newton|2014|1p=12|Calhoun|2p=46}} (Tammany Hall was not a building). Forrest rode to the convention on a train that stopped in a small Northern town along the way, where he faced down a bully who wanted to fight the "damned butcher" of Fort Pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2011, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Former Governor of New York [[Horatio Seymour]] was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, while Forrest's friend, [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Frank Blair, Jr.]] was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Seymour's running mate. {{sfn|Newton|2014|p=12}} The Seymour-Blair Democratic ticket's campaign slogan was: "Our Ticket, Our Motto, This Is a White Man's Country; Let White Men Rule." {{sfn|Newton|2014|p=12}} The Democratic Party platform denounced the Reconstruction Acts as unconstitutional, void, and revolutionary.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} The party advocated termination of the Freedman's Bureau and any government policy designed to aid blacks in the South. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} All of this worked into the Republican's hands, who focused on the Democratic Party's alleged disloyalty during and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}}

====Election of 1868 and Grant====
[[image:George W. Ashburn.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Prominent Republican organizer George Ashburn as murdered in Georgia by the Ku Klux Klan on March 31, 1868.]]
During the presidential election of 1868, the Ku Klux Klan under the leadership of Forrest, and other terrorist groups, used brutal violence and intimidation against blacks and Republican voters.{{sfn|Grant,  Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}}{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} Forrest played a prominent role in the spread of the Klan in the South, meeting with conservative whites in Atlanta several times between February and March 1868. Forrest probably organized a state wide Klan network in Georgia during these visits.{{sfn|Bryant|2002}} On March 31 the Klan struck, killing prominent Republican organizer [[George W. Ashburn|George Ashburn]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]].{{sfn|Bryant|2002}}

The Republicans had nominated one of Forrest's battle adversaries, Union war hero [[Ulysses S. Grant]], for the Presidency at their convention held in October. Klansmen took their orders from their former Confederate officers.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} In Kansas, there were over 2,000 murders committed to suppress blacks and Republicans from voting. In Georgia, Republicans and blacks received threats and beatings at a higher rate. In Louisiana, 1,000 blacks were killed to suppress Republican voting. The Klan's violence was primarily designed to intimidate voters, targeting black and white supporters of the Republican Party.{{sfn|Bryant|2002}} The Klan's violent tactics backfired, as Grant, whose slogan was "Let us have peace," won the election and Republicans gained a majority in Congress.{{sfn|Grant,  Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}} Grant defeated [[Horatio Seymour]], the Democratic presidential candidate, by a comfortable electoral margin, 214 to 80.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=55}} The popular vote was much closer as Grant received 3,013,365 (''52.7 %'') votes, while Seymour received 2,708,744 (''47.3 %'') votes.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=55}} Grant lost Kansas, Georgia, and Louisiana, where the violence and intimidation against blacks was most prominent.

====Klan prosecution and Congressional testimony (1871)====
Many in the north, including President Grant, backed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, that gave voting rights to Americans regardless of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". Congress and Grant passed the [[Enforcement Acts]] from 1870 to 1871, to protect "registration, voting, officeholding, or jury service" of African Americans. Under these laws enforced by Grant and the newly formed [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], there were over 5,000 indictments and 1,000 convictions of Klan members across the South.{{sfn|Grant, Reconstruction and the KKK 2018}}

Forrest testified before the Congressional investigation of Klan activities on June 27, 1871. He denied membership, but his individual role in the KKK was beyond the scope of the investigating committee, which wrote, "our design is not to connect General Forrest with this order, (the reader may form his own conclusion upon this question... ."&lt;ref name="States1872"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

This contrast might be pursued further, but our design is not to connect General Forrest with this order, (the reader may form his own conclusion upon this question,) but to trace its development, and from its acts and consequences gather the designs which are locked up under such penalties.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also noted, "The natural tendency of all such organizations is to violence and crime; hence it was that General Forrest and other men of influence in the state, by the exercise of their moral power, induced them to disband".{{sfn|Select Committee|Poland|Scott|1872|p=463}} George Cantor, a biographer of Confederate generals, wrote, "Forrest ducked and weaved, denying all knowledge, but admitted he knew some of the people involved. He sidestepped some questions and pleaded failure of memory on others. Afterwards, he admitted to 'gentlemanly lies.' He wanted nothing more to do with the Klan, but felt honor bound to protect former associates."&lt;ref name="Cantor2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Cantor|title=Confederate Generals: Life Portraits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AW4VAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gentlemanly%20lies%22|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Taylor Trade Pub.|isbn=978-0-87833-179-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech to black Southerners (1875)====

On July 5, 1875, Forrest demonstrated that his personal sentiments on the issue of race now differed from those of the Klan when he was invited to give a speech before the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, a post-war organization of black Southerners advocating to improve the economic condition of blacks and to gain equal rights for all citizens. At this, his last public appearance, he made what ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a "friendly speech"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0713.html |title=On This Day: Death of General Forrest |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 30, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which, when offered a bouquet of flowers by a young black woman, he accepted them,&lt;ref name="Stephens2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Richard Stephens|title=Commanding the Storm: Civil War Battles in the Words of the Generals Who Fought Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2VBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT319|date=20 November 2012|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-7627-9002-9|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanked her and kissed her on the cheek as a token of reconciliation between the races.

In response to the Pole-Bearers speech, the [[Confederate Survivors Association|Cavalry Survivors Association of Augusta]], the first [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] organization formed after the war, called a meeting in which Captain F. Edgeworth Eve gave a speech expressing unmitigated disapproval of Forrest's remarks promoting inter-ethnic harmony, ridiculing his faculties and judgment and berating the woman who gave Forrest flowers as "a mulatto wench". The association voted unanimously to amend its constitution to expressly forbid publicly advocating for or hinting at any association of white women and girls as being in the same classes as "females of the negro race".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=Augusta Georgia Chronicle |location=Augusta, Georgia |date=July 31, 1875 |url=http://deadconfederates.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/augusta-chronicle-31-july-1875-p-4.pdf |title=Ex-Confederates: Meeting of Cavalry Survivor's Association |access-date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://deadconfederates.com/2013/08/20/veterans-on-pole-bearers-speech-unworthy-of-a-southern-gentleman/ |title=Confederate Veterans on Forrest: 'Unworthy of a Southern gentleman' |last=Hall |first=Andy |date=August 20, 2013 |work=Dead Confederates: A Civil War Era Blog |access-date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Telegraph (Macon)|Macon Weekly Telegraph]]'' newspaper also condemned Forrest for his speech, describing the event as "the recent disgusting exhibition of himself at the negro [sic] jamboree" and quoting part of a ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'' article, which read "We have infinitely more respect for [[James Longstreet|Longstreet]], who fraternizes with negro men on public occasions, with the pay for the treason to his race in his pocket, than with Forrest and [[Gideon Johnson Pillow|[General] Pillow]], who equalize with the negro women, with only 'futures' in payment".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://deadconfederates.com/2011/12/11/nathan-bedford-forrest-joins-the-klan/ |title=Macon Weekly Telegraph |work=Macon Weekly Telegraph |location=Georgia |date=July 20, 1875 |access-date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://deadconfederates.com/2011/12/11/nathan-bedford-forrest-joins-the-klan/|title=Nathan Bedford Forrest Joins the Klan |work=Dead Confederates: A Civil War Era Blog |last=Hall |first=Andy |date=December 11, 2011 |access-date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Forrest reportedly died from acute complications of [[diabetes]] at the Memphis home of his brother Jesse on October 29, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh 1999, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His eulogy was delivered by his recent spiritual mentor, former Confederate chaplain [[George Tucker Stainback]], who declared in his eulogy: "Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, though dead, yet speaketh. His acts have photographed themselves upon the hearts of thousands, and will speak there forever.&lt;ref&gt;Ashdown Caudill 2006, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest was buried at [[Elmwood Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Elmwood Cemetery]] in Memphis.&lt;ref name="Foote III, p. 1052"&gt;{{harvnb|Foote|1974|p=1052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the remains of Forrest and his wife Mary were [[Burial#Reinterment|disinterred]] from Elmwood and moved to a Memphis city park that was originally named Forrest Park in his honor, but has since been renamed Health Sciences Park.&lt;ref name="Sainz"&gt;{{citation |last=Sainz |first=Adrian |title=Memphis renames 3 parks that honored Confederacy |url=https://news.yahoo.com/memphis-renames-3-parks-honored-confederacy-010653790.html |access-date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the Memphis City Council unanimously voted to remove the statue of Forrest from Health Sciences Park, and to return the remains of Forrest and his wife to Elmwood Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Memphis2015"&gt;{{cite news|author1=staff|title=Council Votes To Move Nathan Bedford Forrest's Remains|publisher=LocalMemphis.com|url=http://www.localmemphis.com/story/d/story/council-votes-to-move-nathan-bedford-forrests-rema/12440/x-aa6bzx80iy91LMR_yQ-gQ-g|date=July 7, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718030300/http://www.localmemphis.com/story/d/story/council-votes-to-move-nathan-bedford-forrests-rema/12440/x-aa6bzx80iy91LMR_yQ-g|archivedate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 13, 2017, the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]] invoked the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013 and U.S. Public Law 85-425: Sec. 410 to overrule the city.&lt;ref name="TDEC2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee Heritage Protection Act|url=https://www.tn.gov/environment/about-tdec/tennessee-historical-commission/redirect---tennessee-historical-commission/tennessee-heritage-protection-act.html|website=www.tn.gov|publisher=Tennessee Department of Environment &amp; Conservation|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Memphis sold the park land to an entity not subject to the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act ([[Memphis Greenspace]]), which immediately removed the monument as explained below.

==Historical reputation and legacy==
[[File:NBFSP Camden TN 03 Museum NBF Bust.jpg|thumb|Bronze bust of Forrest at [[Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park]]]]
Many memorials have been erected to Forrest, especially in Tennessee and other Southern states. [[Forrest County, Mississippi]] is named after him, as is [[Forrest City, Arkansas]]. [[Obelisks]] in his memory were placed at his birthplace in [[Chapel Hill, Tennessee]] and at [[Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park]] near [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]].&lt;ref name="Loewen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Loewen|title=Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRtFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|date=7 September 2010|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1-59558-676-6|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest was elevated in Memphis in particular—where he lived and died—to the status of folk hero. "Embarrassed by their city's early capitulation during the Civil War, white Memphians desperately needed a hero and therefore crafted a distorted depiction of Forrest's role in the war."&lt;ref name=Carney&gt;{{cite news

High schools named for Forrest were built in [[Chapel Hill, Tennessee]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

In 1978, [[Middle Tennessee State University]] abandoned imagery it had formerly used (in 1951, the school's yearbook, ''The Midlander'', featured the first appearance of Forrest's likeness as MTSU’s official mascot) and MTSU president M.G Scarlett removed the General's image from the university's official seal. The Blue Raiders' athletic mascot was changed to an ambiguous swash-buckler character called the "Blue Raider", to avoid association with Forrest or the Confederacy.

Great-grandson [[Nathan Bedford Forrest III]] first pursued a military career in cavalry, then in aviation attained the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] where he became the first U.S. general to be killed in action in [[World War II]], while participating in a June 13, 1943 bombing raid over [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Hurst 2011, p. 387"/&gt; His family received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (second only to the [[Medal of Honor]]) he was awarded posthumously for staying with the controls of his [[B-17 bomber]] while his crew bailed out; the aircraft exploded before Forrest himself could bail out.

Forrest is considered one of the Civil War's most brilliant tacticians by the historian [[Spencer C. Tucker]].&lt;ref name="Tucker2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. W. R. Hawkins III|author2=Paul G.

Grant]] and considered him "the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side".&lt;ref name="Fredriksen2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

Forrest became well known for his early use of maneuver tactics as applied to a mobile horse cavalry deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sanders |first=John R. |date=August 17, 1994 |title=Operational Leadership of Nathan Bedford Forrest |location=Newport R.I. |publisher=Naval War College |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a283415.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grasped the doctrines of [[maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History |editor1-last=Heidler |editor1-first=David Stephen |editor2-last=Heidler |editor2-first=Jeanne T. |editor3-last=Coles |editor3-first=David J. |date=September 16, 2002 |publisher=W.

Paramount in his strategy was fast movement, even if it meant pushing his horses at a killing pace, to constantly harass his enemy during raids and disrupt supply trains and enemy communications by destroying railroad tracks and cutting telegraph lines, as he wheeled around his opponent's flank. Noted Civil War scholar [[Bruce Catton]] writes:
{{quote|Forrest ... used his horsemen as a modern general would use [[motorized infantry]]. He liked horses because he liked fast movement, and his mounted men could get from here to there much faster than any infantry could; but when they reached the field they usually tied their horses to trees and fought on foot, and they were as good as the very best infantry.{{sfn|Catton|1971|p=160}} }}

Forrest is often erroneously quoted as saying his strategy was to "git thar fustest with the mostest". Now often recast as "Getting there firstest with the mostest",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~fdillon/military.htm |title=for example |publisher=George Mason University |first=Francis H.|last=Dillon |access-date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this misquote first appeared in a ''New York Tribune'' article written to provide colorful comments in reaction to European interest in Civil War generals.

{{quote|Do not, under any circumstances whatever, quote Forrest as saying 'fustest' and 'mostest'. He did not say it that way, and nobody who knows anything about him imagines that he did.{{sfn|Catton|1971|pp=160–61}}}}

Modern historians generally believe that Forrest's attack on Fort Pillow was a massacre, noting high casualty rates, and the rebels targeting black soldiers.{{sfn|Buhk|2012|p=147}} The consensus of recent historians is that Forrest did not order the massacre; after thorough investigation he was not charged with a crime nor dereliction of duty. It was, however, the South's publicly stated position that slaves firing on whites would be killed on the spot, along with Southern whites that fought for the Union, whom the Confederacy considered traitors.&lt;ref name="Congress1863"&gt;{{cite web|title=May 1, 1863 [No. 5.] – Joint Resolution on the Subject of Retaliation.|url=https://deadconfederates.com/2014/04/15/|website=deadconfederates.com|publisher=Confederate States of America|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306033105/https://deadconfederates.com/2014/04/15/|archivedate=March 6, 2018|date=May 1, 1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this analysis, Forrest's troops were carrying out Confederate policy, and were simply obeying orders. By his inaction Forrest showed that he felt no compunction to stop the slaughter, and his repeated denials that he knew a massacre was taking place, or even that a massacre had occurred at all, are not credible. Consequently, despite this isolated incident in his otherwise distinguished career as a general, his role in it was a [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] one for him the rest of his life, both professionally and personally,&lt;ref name="Cimprich2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cimprich|title=Fort Pillow, a Civil War Massacre, and Public Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeFiumliWOEC&amp;pg=PR94|date=8 April 2011|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3918-9|page=xciv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tap2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tap|title=The Fort Pillow Massacre: North, South, and the Status of African Americans in the Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZC3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|date=23 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17390-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to his business problems after the war.

After Forrest's death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "General Bedford Forrest, the great Confederate cavalry officer, died at 7:30 o'clock this evening at the residence of his brother, Colonel Jesse Forrest," but also reported that it would not be for military victories that Forrest would pass into history.&lt;ref name="NYT1877"&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of Gen. Forrest|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0713.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 February 2018|date=October 30, 1877|quote=It is in connection with one of the most atrocious and cold-blooded massacres that ever disgraced civilized warfare that his name will for ever be inseparably associated. "Fort Pillow Forrest" was the title which the deed conferred upon him, and by this he will be remembered by the present generation, and by it he will pass into history. The massacre occurred on April 12, 1864. Fort Pillow is 65 miles above Memphis, and its capture was effected during Forrest's celebrated raid through Tennessee, a State which was at the time practically in possession of the Union forces. ...Forrest reported his own loss at 20 killed and 60 wounded; and states that he buried 228 Federals on the evening of the assault. Yet in the face of this he claimed that the Fort Pillow capture was "a bloody victory, only made a massacre by dastardly Yankee reporters." The news of the massacre aroused the whole country to a paroxysm of horror and fury. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest's claims that the Fort Pillow massacre was an invention of northern reporters were directly disputed in letters written by Confederate soldiers to their own families, which described wanton brutality on the part of Confederate troops.&lt;ref name="Clark, Achilles V"/&gt; The New York newspaper obituary stated:

{{quote|Since the war, Forrest has lived at Memphis, and his principal occupation seems to have been to try and explain away the Fort Pillow affair. He wrote several letters about it, which were published, and always had something to say about it in any public speech he delivered. He seemed as if he were trying always to rub away the blood stains which marked him.&lt;ref name="NYT1877" /&gt;}}

Historians have differed in their interpretations of the events at Fort Pillow. Richard L. Fuchs, author of ''An Unerring Fire'', concluded:
{{quote|The affair at Fort Pillow was simply an orgy of death, a mass lynching to satisfy the basest of conduct—intentional murder—for the vilest of reasons—racism and personal enmity.&lt;ref name="Fuchs2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard L. Fuchs|title=An Unerring Fire: The Massacre at Fort Pillow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFRqUSZUEOkC&amp;pg=PA14|date=November 2001|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-1824-0|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Andrew Ward (author)|Andrew Ward]] downplays the controversy:
{{quote|Whether the massacre was premeditated or spontaneous does not address the more fundamental question of whether a massacre took place... it certainly did, in every dictionary sense of the word.&lt;ref name="Ward2006227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Ward|title=River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLZ3KboxDBwC&amp;pg=PT412|date=31 October 2006|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4406-4929-5|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Cimprich states:
{{quote|The new paradigm in social attitudes and the fuller use of available evidence has favored a massacre interpretation... Debate over the memory of this incident formed a part of sectional and racial conflicts for many years after the war, but the reinterpretation of the event during the last thirty years offers some hope that society can move beyond past intolerance.&lt;ref name="Cimprich2011117"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cimprich|title=Fort Pillow, a Civil War Massacre, and Public Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeFiumliWOEC&amp;pg=PR117|date=8 April 2011|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3918-9|pages=cxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant himself described Forrest as "a brave and intrepid cavalry general" while noting that Forrest sent a dispatch on the [[Fort Pillow Massacre]] "in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read."&lt;ref name="Grant1895"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulysses Simpson Grant|title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrInAWjWVJ0C&amp;pg=PA411|year=1895|publisher=Sampson Low|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===

In the 1990 PBS documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], historian [[Shelby Foote]] states in Episode 7 that the Civil War produced two "authentic geniuses": [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Nathan Bedford Forrest. When expressing this opinion to one of General Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, "You know, we never thought much of Mr. Lincoln in my family".&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{Citation |last=Carter |first=William C. |year=1989 |title=Conversations with Shelby Foote |place=Jackson, MS |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=0-87805-385-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foote also made Forrest a major character in his novel ''[[Shiloh (Foote novel)|Shiloh]]'', which used numerous first-person stories to illustrate a detailed timeline and account of the battle.&lt;ref name="Abbott1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Abbott|title=Mississippi Writers: Reflections of Childhood and Youth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4T8zwODNhgC&amp;pg=PR26|year=1985|publisher=Univ.

===Continued controversies===
Forrest's legacy as "one of the most controversial – and popular – icons of the war" still draws heated public debate. A 2011 Mississippi license plate proposal to honor him, by the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], revived tensions and raised objections from Mississippi chapter of the NAACP president Derrick Johnson, who compared Forrest to [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/10/proposed-mississippi-license-plate-honor-early-kkk-leader/#  |work=Fox News |title=Proposed Mississippi License Plate Would Honor Early KKK Leader |date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonsson&gt;{{cite news

[[image:Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue.JPG|right|200px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue'''&lt;/center&gt;Forrest statue removed from Health Sciences Park December 20, 2017.]]
In 2000, a monument to Forrest in [[Selma, Alabama]], was unveiled.{{sfn|Cox|2012}} On March 10, 2012, it was vandalized and the bronze bust of the general disappeared. In August, a historical society called Friends of Forrest moved forward with plans for a new, larger monument, which was to be 12 feet high, illuminated by LED lights, surrounded by a wrought-iron fence and protected by 24-hour security cameras. The plans triggered outrage and a group of around 20 protesters attempted to block construction of the new monument by lying in the path of a concrete truck. Local lawyer and radio host Rose Sanders said, "Glorifying Nathan B. Forrest here is like glorifying a Nazi in Germany. For Selma, of all places, to have a big monument to a Klansman is totally unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/us/fight-rages-in-selma-ala-over-a-civil-war-monument.html |newspaper=New York Times |title=Bust of Civil War General Stirs Anger in Alabama |date=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition at Change.org asking the City Council to ban the monument collected 313,617 signatures by mid-September of the same year.&lt;ref name="Bass2018"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Erin Z.

Forrest Park in Memphis was renamed Health Sciences Park in 2013, amid substantial controversy.&lt;ref name="Sainz"/&gt; In light of the 2015 [[Charleston church shooting|church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina]], some Tennessee lawmakers advocated removing a bust of Forrest located in the state's Capitol building. Subsequently, then-Mayor [[A C Wharton|A.C. Wharton]] urged removal of the statue of Forrest in Health Sciences Park and suggested the relocation of Forrest and his wife to their original burial site in nearby [[Elmwood Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Elmwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brown |first=George |title=Mayor Wharton: Remove Nathan Bedford Forrest statue and body from park |website=WREG.com |date=June 25, 2015 |url=http://wreg.com/2015/06/25/mayor-wharton-wants-nathan-bedford-forrest-statue-and-body-removed-from-park/ |access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nearly unanimous vote on July 7, the Memphis City Council passed a resolution in favor of removing the statue and securing the couple's remains for transfer. The [[Tennessee Historical Commission]] denied removal on October 21, 2016 under its authority granted by the [[Tennessee Heritage Protection Act]] of 2013, which protects war memorials on public property from cities or counties relocating, removing, renaming, or otherwise disturbing them without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Nathan Bedford Forrest statue won't be relocated |newspaper=Knoxville News Sentinel |date=October 21, 2016 |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2016/10/21/nathan-bedford-forrest-wont-be-moved/92510072/ |access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Council then voted on December 20, 2017 to sell Health Science Park to [[Memphis Greenspace]], a new [[non-profit corporation]] not subject to the Heritage Protection Act, which removed the statue that same evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Necati "Neco" Arabaci''' (born 14 February 1972 in [[Cologne]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] businessman, criminal and high-ranking member of the [[Hells Angels]], who was formerly active in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] and now lives in Turkey. In 2002 he was arrested in Germany for [[pimp]]ing, [[human trafficking]], assault, extortion, weapons violations, and racketeering. He confessed during his trial in 2004 and was sentenced to nine years in prison.&lt;ref name="kölnerstadt1096374340433"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Drack|first=Hariett|url=http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1096374340433.shtml|title=Rotlicht-Pate muss neun Jahre hinter Gitter|trans-title=Red light district godfather gets 9 years behind bars|date=1 October 2004|work=[[Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger]]|language=German|accessdate=15 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804094208/http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1096374340433.shtml|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 2007 and deported to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2010sdafrika.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/hells-angels-prasident-necati-arabaci-in-bildern/|title=Hells Angels-Präsident Necati Arabaci in Bildern|date=19 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Paul Wallot''' (26 June 1841 [[Oppenheim]] am Rhein – 10 August 1912 [[Bad Schwalbach]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] of [[Huguenot]] descent, best known for designing the [[Reichstag building]] in [[Berlin]], erected between 1884 and 1894. He also built the adjacent Palace of the President of the Reichstag, finished in 1904, and the former [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] ''Ständehaus'' state diet building of 1906 at [[Brühl's Terrace]] in [[Dresden]].

== Life ==
[[Image:Oppenheim Krämerstraße7.jpg|thumb|portrait|Wallot’s birthplace in Oppenheim (Krämerstraße 7)]]
As a descendant of the Huguenot noble family Vallot, which originates in [[South of France]], Paul Wallot was born on 26 June 1841 at Krämerstraße 7 in Oppenheim. &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Glatz, Joachim Glatz: ''„… in einer steinernen Urkunde lesen“: Geschichts- und Erinnerungsorte in Rheinland-Pfalz.'' Nünnerich-Asmus Verlag, Mainz 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-943904-21-5}} ({{Google books|Mb2ZAwAAQBAJ|}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1856 to 1859 he attended the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]]. He then studied for a year at the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover]] with [[Conrad Wilhelm Hase]] and moved to the [[Berlin Bauakademie]] in 1861. He graduated from [[University of Giessen]] with Hugo von Ritgen.

Following his studies, Wallot worked for a year as a 'Bauakzessist' in [[Hessen]]. Between the years 1864 and 1868 he worked again in [[Berlin]] with the architects [[Heinrich Strack]], [[Richard Lucae]] and [[Friedrich Hitzig]]. Wallot was also able to sit in the common studio of the architects [[Martin Gropius]] and [[Heino Schmieden]].

From 1867 to 1868, Wallot undertook extensive study trips through [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland | Great Britain]]. In the year of his return, he settled in [[Frankfurt am Main]] as an independent architect. In this function, he was responsible for various private and commercial buildings and became a member of the [[Masonic lodge]] "Socrates to fortitude". In Frankfurt he also worked with the architects Heinrich Burnitz and [[Alfred Friedrich Bluntschli]].

In 1872, Wallot undertook a second study trip to Italy, where he became particularly interested in works by the architects [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Michele Sanmicheli]]. After returning from this trip, he took part in various architectural competitions, such as, the [[Frankfurt (Main) Central Station | Frankfurt Central Station]] in 1880 and the [[Niederwald Monument]] in 1883. However, his applications were not successful.

[[Image:Paul Wallot.JPG|thumb|Wallot in his studio]]

Wallot made his breakthrough when he won the second competition for the [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin victorious in 1882. With his colleague Friedrich von Thiersch, Wallot shared the competition’s first prize, but his design was almost unanimously voted by the jury. In 1883, Wallot settled in Berlin to better monitor the construction. On 9 June 1884, the foundation ceremony was celebrated, and a ten years later, on 5 December, 1894, the [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] was set solemnly.
The glazed iron dome above an official building, such as the Reichstag building, was astonishing and can be described as progressive in view of the further developments in architecture. Nevertheless, the construction was highly controversial throughout its construction period. With its original height of 67 meters, the dome was higher than that of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.berlinfuerblinde.de/top-berlin/reichstagsgebaeude/887-allgemeine-einfuehrung-zum-reichstag.html Die Geschichte des Berliner Reichstagsgebäudes.]'' In: ''Berlin für Blinde'', aufgerufen am 20.&amp;nbsp;Juli 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the construction commission for the Reichstag building sat competitors who were inferior to him in the competition. &lt;ref&gt;Ute Kastenholz: ''[http://programm.ard.de/TV/Programm/?sendung=2823117635313150 Dem Deutschen Volke. Paul Wallot, Architekt des Reichstags.]'' In: ''[[SWR Fernsehen|SWR]]'', 5.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2016, siehe Video-Abschnitt ab 19:40 Min.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor | Kaiser Wilhelm II]] called the Reichstag building ''Reichsaffenhaus '', (Reich monkey house),&lt;ref&gt;Karsten Packeiser (epd): ''[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/kultur-sonstige/gipfel-der-geschmacklosigkeit--63048737.html „Gipfel der Geschmacklosigkeit“.]'' In: ''[[Badische Zeitung]]'', 10.&amp;nbsp;August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which, however, also referred to the democratic legal form of parliamentarism. &lt;ref name="Fleckner"&gt;Uwe Fleckner: ''Die Demokratie der ästhetischen Erfahrung. Gerhard Richters Wandbild ''Schwarz Rot Gold'' im Berliner Reichstagsgebäude'', in: Inge Stephan, Alexandra Tacke (Hrsg.), ''NachBilder der Wende'', Böhlau Verlag, Köln Weimar, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-412-20083-1}}, S.&amp;nbsp;283–300, [https://books.google.de/books?id=WyXe0Q7qyt0C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=Wallot+Kaiser+Wilhelm+mein+sohn,+das+machen+wir+so&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XVXLYHWlu0&amp;sig=RU3ASrklJ-hk5Zzhx2b2XdjJYdI&amp;hl=de Zitat-Beleg, S.&amp;nbsp;286.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A key scene of the dispute between Wallot and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor | Wilhelm II]] is a visit by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor | Wilhelm II]] in Wallot’s studio. During his visit, Wilhelm grabbed a pen, edited the floor plan of the Reichstag building only to then tell the eighteen-years older Wallot “My son, this is how we do it.” Wallot replied "Your Majesty, that will not work!" &lt;ref name = "Fleckner" /&gt; In addition, the building commission made several major changes to the building, since not only the wishes of the Prussian government, but above all those of the German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor | Wilhelm II]], [[Frederick III, German Emperor | Friedrich III.]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor | Wilhelm II]] had to be considered.

In 1889, Wallot had already thought about the interior design and contracted the painter [[Franz von Stuck]] (two monumental ceiling paintings) and the sculptor [[Adolf von Hildebrand]] (two ballot boxes). When the drafts were presented on in the [[Reichstag (German Empire) | Reichstag]] on 1 March 1899 and were to be voted on, there were tumultuous scenes. Spokesman of the critics was the Philipp Ernst Maria Lieber of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] from [[Bad Camberg]]. The rejection was so great that Wallot resigned the same day as head of the Decoration Commission. Thereupon Lieber was accepted in this commission. The designs of the paintings and the urns have disappeared from this day.

Probably since Wallot had rejected in 1889 a change request Wilhelm II, the relationship between the two was disturbed. The emperor refused the architect, despite different recommendations, several awards. In 1894, Wallot received only the small gold medal, not the [[Roter Adlerorden]], but only the title of [[Geheimrat | Geheimer Baurat]] instead of the great gold medal of the [[Große Berliner Kunstausstellung] ]] '' he was awarded in 1894 for his services to the Reichstag.&lt;ref&gt;John C.G. Röhl: ''Wilhelm II. Der Aufbau der Persönlichen Monarchie'', S.&amp;nbsp;1003–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time he accepted teaching assignments at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] and at [[Dresden University of Technology]], which he held until 1911. In [[Dresden]], the new building of the [[Brühlsche Terrasse | Saxonian Estates Houses]] on the [[Brühlsche Terrasse]] was also transferred to him. Oswin Hempel, Karl Paul Andrae and Wilhelm Fränkel were some of his disciples.

From Dresden he also directed from 1897 to 1907 the establishment of the presidential building of the Reichstag.
In the years 1898 and 1899, Paul Wallot led the competition for the construction of Bismarck monuments in the German Reich, which had proclaimed the [[German Student Union]]. In 1911 he resigned all offices and retired. He retired to his retirement home in [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich | Biebrich]] on the Rhine. During a stay at the spa, Paul Wallot died at the age of 71 on August 10, 1912 in Langenschwalbach, today the county seat of the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis [[Bad Schwalbach]]. His burial took place in the family grave in Oppenheim, which was designed by [[Alfred Friedrich Bluntschli]].

In 1630-1640, the group lived south-west of the Ottawa river and may have been unrelated to the rest, "as nearly all the other bands are on or northeast of the Ottawa River". &lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangenealogy.net/indians/algonkin_indians.htm |title=Algonkin Indians of Canada |work=Canadian Genealogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived east of Georgian Bay and what is now know to locals as "The Big Three" lakes in Ontario ([[Lake Rosseau]], [[Lake Muskoka]], [[Lake Joseph]]). Very little is known about this group today, however the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] word "sagaigun" means lake&lt;ref name="zero"/&gt; and their name is still part of the local culture and language. The town of [[Seguin, Ontario]] and the steam ship [[RMS Segwun]] are good example of names that have carried into the modern age.

'''Sanmao''' ({{zh|c=三毛|p=Sānmáo}}) is a [[manhua]] character created by [[Zhang Leping]] in 1935.  He is one of the world's longest running cartoon characters and remains a landmark as one of the most famous and beloved fictional characters in China today.

The name Sanmao means "three hairs" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].  While the character has undergone a number of transitions over time, he has always been drawn with the trademark three strands of hair, which implies malnutrition as a result of poverty.

==History==
[[File:Sanmaonewspaper1948.jpg|thumb|200px|Sanmao in a 1948 Shanghai newspaper. He is a street acrobat in this segment. The poster on the electricity pole reads "Celebrate Fourth of April Children's Day."]]

Most Chinese comic books prior to Sanmao featured adults and the Sanmao stories were also unusual in that they lacked dialogue and could therefore be classified as [[pantomime comics]].  When Zhang Leping created the manhua comic series, his main goal was to dramatize the confusion brought about to society by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].  He wanted to express his concern for the young victims of the war, particularly the orphans living on the streets.  Most of the changes in the characters would come after World War II during the liberation in 1949.

Sanmao's image has also been evolving throughout time, and in some modern continuation of the comics, he is depicted as a healthy, normal student.&lt;ref&gt;China Daily. "[http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/28/content_464182_4.htm China Daily] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205063513/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/28/content_464182_4.htm |date=2007-02-05 }}." "Sanmao Chinas favorite son turns 70." Retrieved on 2007-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  The character has also been portrayed as living through some of the most important periods in Chinese history and to futuristic space explorations.

==Story==
The comic takes place mainly during the 1930s and early 1940s and is set in Old Shanghai in its "golden era".  Sanmao lived mostly in misery and stark poverty against a backdrop of war, [[colonization]], and [[inflation]].

==Adaptations==
The character made his first appearance in [[Comic]] and was later adapted into different formats.&lt;ref&gt;Sanmao Official Website. "[http://www.sanmao.com.cn/world/dimension/movie14.html Sanmao]." "Production Listing." Retrieved on 2007-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
* The renowned Taiwanese writer [[Sanmao (author)|Chen Ping]] (1943–91) chose "San Mao" as her pen name out of her deep sympathy for the lonely, homeless boy.
* The Hong Kong movie star [[Sammo Hung Kam-Bo]] was given the name Sammo because of his supposed resemblance to Sanmao.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">According to [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[oral history]], the '''Si-Te-Cah''', '''Saiduka''' or '''Sai'i''' are a legendary tribe whose mummified remains were allegedly discovered under four feet of [[guano]] by guano miners in what is now known as [[Lovelock Cave]] in [[Lovelock, Nevada]], United States. Although the cave had been mined since 1911, miners did not notify authorities until 1912. The miners destroyed many of the artifacts, but archaeologists were still able to retrieve 10,000 Paiute artifacts from the cave. Items included tule duck decoys, sandals, and baskets, several dating back over 2000 years.

{{unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
"Si-Te-Cah" literally means “tule-eaters”  in the language of the [[Paiute people|Paiute]]{{dn|date=April 2018}} Indians. [[Schoenoplectus acutus|Tule]] is a fibrous water plant. In order to escape harassment from the Paiutes, the Si-Te-Cahs  were said to have lived on [[Reed boat|rafts]] made of tule on the lake.

==Oral history==
According to the Paiutes, the Si-Te-Cah were a red-haired band of [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] giants.&lt;ref name=nvmag&gt;Johnston, Charlie. [http://nevadan.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/lovelock-cave-%E2%80%93-the-1929-book/ "Prehistoric Storage: Nevada’s ancient caves contain a "hole" lot of Native American history."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113060428/http://nevadan.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/lovelock-cave-%E2%80%93-the-1929-book/ |date=2011-01-13 }} ''Nevada Magazine.'' July/August 2011. Retrieved 18 Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Si-Te-Cah and the Paiutes were at war, and after a long struggle a coalition of tribes trapped the remaining Si-Te-Cah in Lovelock Cave. When they refused to come out, the Indians piled brush before the cave mouth and set it aflame. The Si-Te-Cah were annihilated.

[[Sarah Winnemucca|Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins]], daughter of Paiute [[Chief Winnemucca]], wrote about what she described as "a small tribe of barbarians" who ate her people in her book ''Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims'' - she wrote that "after my people had killed them all, the people round us called us Say-do-carah. It means conqueror; it also means "enemy." "My people say that the tribe we exterminated had reddish hair. I have some of their hair, which has been handed down from father to son. I have a dress which has been in our family a great many years, trimmed with the reddish hair. I am going to wear it some time when I lecture. It is called a mourning dress, and no one has such a dress but my family."&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins 75&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins does not mention giants.

==Archaeology==
[[Adrienne Mayor]] writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book ''Legends of the First Americans''.&lt;ref name="Mayor2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne|title=Fossil legends of the first Americans|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-11345-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange. Another explanation for the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons may also come from the fact that some of the first remains unearthed by the guano miners in 1911-12 were described as “giant".&lt;ref&gt;Loud and Harrington&lt;/ref&gt; 

A written report by James H. Hart, the first of two miners to excavate the cave in the fall of 1911, recalls that in the north-central part of the cave, about four feet deep, "was a striking looking body of a man “six feet six inches tall.” His body was mummified and his hair distinctly red."&lt;ref&gt;Loud and Harrington 87&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately in the first year of mining, some of the human remains and artifacts were lost and destroyed. "The best specimen of the adult mummies was boiled and destroyed by a local fraternal lodge, which wanted the skeleton for initiation purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Loud and Harrington 5&lt;/ref&gt; Also, several of the fiber sandals found in the cave were remarkably large, and one reported at over 15&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) in length was said to be on display at the Nevada Historical Society's museum in Reno in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Nevada State Journal, Reno, Nevada. Sunday, August 3, 1952 Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevada State Journal, Reno, Nevada. Sunday, February 22, 1953 p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reno Evening Gazette, Reno, Nevada. Thursday, Sep. 25, 1913 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paiute tradition asserts that the Si-Te-Cah people practiced cannibalism, and this may have had some basis in fact. During the 1924 excavation of the cave, a series of three human bones were found near the surface towards the mouth of the cave. "These had been split to extract the marrow, as animal bones were split, and probably indicate cannibalism during a famine."&lt;ref&gt;Loud and Harrington 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">{{DISPLAYTITLE:The kid (''Blood Meridian'')}}
'''The kid''' is a nameless central character in the 1985 historical novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]'', by [[Cormac McCarthy]]. The first sentence of the novel opens with "see the child", which tells the reader the significance of this character. These words also serve to advise the reader of the dissimilar nature of the kid in relation to the novel's antagonist, [[Judge Holden]], and the members of [[John Joel Glanton]]'s gang. When viewing the novel as a [[bildungsroman]], the story follows the maturation of the kid who had developed distinct values just before the end of the book.&lt;ref name=blm1&gt;

He is the focal point for the first six chapters, where he leaves Tennessee, rides with the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters]], and is jailed in Chihuahua City. There he meets Toadvine for the second time, eyes Holden for the second time, and joins Glanton's gang. However, in chapters seven through nineteen the focus is no longer exclusively on the kid. In this section of the book he disappears from the action and then reappears. The final chapters again focus on the kid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Bernard A.| last = Schopen | title = 'They Rode On': Blood Meridian and the Art of Narrative | journal = Western American Literature | publisher=[[University of Nevada, Reno]]|location=Reno, Nevada|volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages =  179–19 |date=Summer 1995|accessdate =August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Unlike Holden, the kid's physical description is sparse and bereft of details. All that is known is that he is "pale and thin", but he does have "big wrists, and big hands". In contrast to his outwardly violent lifestyle, his eyes are "oddly innocent". The kid's interior life is not explicitly expressed throughout the novel, and when he speaks it is very brief.&lt;ref name=clemment/&gt;

Major-General Dr. '''Walter Robert Dornberger''' (6 September 1895&amp;nbsp;– 27 June 1980) was a [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[artillery]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] whose career spanned [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

In January 1944, Dornberger was named Senior Artillery Commander 191 and was headquartered at Maisons-Lafitte near Saint Germain, and in December 1944, Dornberger was given complete authority for anti-aircraft rocket development (''Flak E Flugabwehrkanonenentwicklung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ordway|Sharpe|1979|pp=61, 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 1945 on Dornberger's proposal, [[Albert Speer]] replaced the Long-Range Weapons Commission with "Working Staff Dornberger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornberger|1954|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1945, Dornberger and staff relocated his headquarters from Schwedt-an-der-Oder to Bad Sachsa, then on 6 April 1945, from [[Bad Sachsa]] to ''Haus Ingeborg'' in Oberjoch near Hindelang in the Allgäu mountains of Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ordway|Sharpe|1979|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornberger|1954|pp=266, 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1945, Dornberger, von Braun, and five other men departed from Haus Ingeborg and travelled through [[Gaicht Pass]] and towards the little Austrian village of Schattwald. They met American soldiers who convoyed the group to the Tyrolean town of [[Reutte]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klee|Merk|1965|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the night.&lt;ref name=Huzel&gt;{{cite book |last=Huzel |first=Dieter K |title=Peenemünde to Canaveral |date=1960 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources place them being arrested by Patton's Third Army on May 3, 1945 near Prague, Czechoslovakia.{{According to whom|date=February 2017}}
At an [[internment]] camp after the war, known as "[[Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre|CSDIC]] Camp 11", the British bugged Dornberger, who in conversation with ''Generalmajor'' [[Gerhard Bassenge]] (GOC Air Defences, Tunis &amp; Biserta) said that he and Wernher von Braun had realized in late 1944 that things were going wrong and consequently was in touch with the [[General Electric]] Corporation through the German Embassy in [[Portugal]], with a view to coming to some arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;C.S.D.I.C Report Entitled G.R.G.G. 341 dated 7 August 1945 (summary of Dornberger's revelations)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War II==
In mid-August 1945, after taking part in [[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]], Dornberger was escorted from Cuxhaven to London for interrogation by the British War Crimes Investigation Unit in connection with the use of [[Slavery|slave labor]] in the production of V-2 rockets; he was subsequently transferred and detained for two years at Bridgend in South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ordway|Sharpe|1979|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with some other German rocket scientists, Dornberger was released and brought to the [[United States]] under the auspices of [[Operation Paperclip]], and worked for the [[United States Air Force]] for three years, developing [[Missile|guided missiles]]. From 1950 to 1965 he worked for the [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aircraft Corporation]] where he worked on several projects, rising to the post of Vice-President. He played a major role in the creation of the [[North American X-15]] aircraft and was a key consultant for the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] project.

Please improve in any way you see fit. --&gt;'''William Jordan Graves''' (1805 – September 27, 1848) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Kentucky]].

Graves was born in [[New Castle, Kentucky]], and pursued an academic course early in life, choosing to study law.  He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] and practiced law in Kentucky before serving as member of the State house of representatives in 1834. Graves was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the [[24th United States Congress|Twenty-fourth]] Congress and reelected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the [[25th United States Congress|Twenty-fifth]], and [[26th United States Congress|Twenty-sixth]] Congresses (March 4, 1835 – March 3, 1841).

He engaged in a [[duel]] at the [[Bladensburg dueling grounds]] on the Marlboro Road in Maryland with Congressman [[Jonathan Cilley]] in 1838. Graves was a stand-in for New York newspaper editor [[James Watson Webb]], whom Cilley had called corrupt. Cilley was inexperienced with guns, and Graves was a crack shot with a pistol.  As the challenged party, Cilley had the choice of weapons; he selected rifles at 80 yards, a distance that would negate Graves' shooting skill.  The actual distance at the first exchange of shots was later determined to be 94 yards; both participants missed.  They then agreed to shorten the distance and fire again; again both Graves and Cilley missed.  After again shortening the distance, on the third fire Graves hit Cilley in the femoral artery; he bled to death in ninety seconds. This duel prompted passage of a congressional act of February 20, 1839, prohibiting the issuing or accepting of a challenge within the District of Columbia, even if the duel was to be fought outside the district.

He was not a candidate for renomination in 1840.
He was again a member of the State house of representatives in 1843.
He died in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], September 27, 1848.
He was interred in the private burial grounds at his former residence in [[Henry County, Kentucky]].

[[Image:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|250px|thumb|right|William Kempe (right) from ''Nine Days Wonder'' (1600)]]
'''William Kempe''' (died 1603), commonly referred to as '''Will Kemp''', was an English actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by [[William Shakespeare]]. Roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation, [[Falstaff]], and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great [[Jester|clown]] of the previous generation, [[Richard Tarlton]].

Kempe's success and influence was such that in December 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] alongside Shakespeare and [[Richard Burbage]], but in a short time (possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe) he parted company with the group. Despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career, he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603.

==Life==
In a 1615 lawsuit brought by Thomasina (née Heminges) Ostler, widow of [[William Ostler]], against her father, [[John Heminges]], the recently deceased actor William Kempe was referred to as a gentleman (''Willelmo Kempe nuper de Londonia generoso defuncto''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1909|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that he was a member of the Kempe family of [[Olantigh]], a property {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of [[Wye, Kent|Wye]] in [[Kent]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517–1591) did indeed have a son named William;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125–9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay) . Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story—dramatized in the play The Travailes of the Three English Brothers (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins—that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kempe first enters the historical record as a performer with [[Leicester's Men]] at [[Essex House (London)|Leicester House]] in May 1585&lt;ref&gt;The Earl made a special payment of ten [[shilling]]s for this performance.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in this service after [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Leicester]]'s departure for the [[Low Countries]] to take part in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Leicester's nephew, [[Philip Sidney]], sent letters home by way of a man he called "Will, my Lord of Lester's jesting player" and it is now generally accepted this was Kempe. Sidney complained in a letter to [[Francis Walsingham]] that "Will" had delivered the letters to [[Lettice Knollys|Lady Leicester]] rather than Sidney's wife, [[Frances Walsingham]]. After a brief return to England, Kempe accompanied two other future Lord Chamberlain's Men, [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] and [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], to [[Elsinore]] where he entertained [[Frederick II of Denmark]].

Kempe's whereabouts in the later 1580s are not known, but that his fame as a performer was growing during this period is indicated by [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''An Almond for a Parrot'' (1590). Nashe dedicated this work to Kempe, calling him "vicegerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the title-page of the [[book size|quarto]] of ''A Knack to Know a Knave'' advertises Kempe's "merriments". (Because title-pages were a means to draw attention to a book, the mention of Kempe suggests that he had become an attraction in his own right.) Critics have generally viewed the scene in which Kempe performs as rather flat (Collier, 97) and it is assumed that the scene provided a framework within which Kempe could [[improvise]]. Entries in the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Register]] indicate that three jigs (short comic plays) perhaps written by Kempe were published between 1591 and 1595. Two of these have survived.

By 1592 Kempe was one of [[Lord Strange's Men]], listed in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] authorisation for that troupe to play seven miles out of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although he had been a sharer in the plans to construct the [[Globe Theatre]], he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', in which there is no promised continued role for Falstaff, and ''[[Hamlet]]'', containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, (2005). ''1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare''. Faber and Faber, London. pp.42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hornback ''The English Clown Tradition from the Middle Ages to Shakespeare'' 1843843560 - 2013 "nd of the stupid puritan stereotype generally, that Shakespeare wrote his own strict, stupid puritan clown for Kemp — for whatever reason, Kemp's last Shakespearean role — in 1598. Like the “foolish Mayre or foolish justice” ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Kemp's Men, Chapelfield Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 167501.jpg|thumb|left| [[Wood carving]] of Kempe in Chapelfield Gardens, [[Norwich]]]]
After his departure from the Chamberlain's Men in early 1599, Kempe continued to pursue his career as a performer. In February and March 1600, he undertook what he would later call his "Nine Days Wonder", in which he [[morris dance]]d from London to [[Norwich]] (a distance of over a hundred miles) in a journey which took him nine days spread over several weeks, often amid cheering crowds. Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true.&lt;ref&gt;The year Kempe gives was 1599 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], which has caused some later confusion. That Kempe's jig took place in 1600 (New Style) is established by a record of the payment of his prize money by the Norwich City Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from [[Philip Henslowe]] and had joined [[Worcester's Men]]. The last undoubted mention of him occurs in Henslowe's diary in late 1602.

Parish records record the death of "Kempe, a man" in ''[[Southwark St Saviour|St. Saviour]]'', [[Southwark]], late in 1603. While this is not necessarily the comedian, the record fits his departure from the documentary record.

==Performance style==
In his time, Kempe was as famous for his [[Jig (theatre)|stage jig]]s as for his acting in regular drama. The jig, a kind of rustic cousin to [[commedia dell'arte]], featured as many as five performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of [[John Dowland]] (now in the [[Cambridge University Library]]). A famous 17th century jig called [[Kemp's Jig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathew Holmes lute books: Kemp's jig|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DD-00002-00011/194|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by [[Profile (Jan Akkerman album)|Jan Akkerman]] and [[Gryphon (album)|Gryphon]].

As an actor, Kempe is certainly associated with two roles: [[Dogberry]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Peter in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. (In the quarto text of the latter, and in both quarto and [[First Folio]] text of the former, he is identified in speech prefixes and stage directions.) From these hints, a list of Kempe's parts has been deduced which, if conjectural, is not improbable: Costard in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'', [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Lancelot Gobbo in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and Cob in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''. [[Falstaff]] is a more ambiguous case. Though Falstaff presents some features of an Elizabethan dramatic clown, his character is higher in class and more complex than the other roles with which Kempe is associated.

==In period fiction==
*Kempe appears as a character in ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return from Parnassus, or The Scourge of Simony]]'', possibly written during his lifetime or very shortly after his death. In it he praises Shakespeare for outdoing university-educated playwrights.

==In modern fiction==

===Film and TV===
*In the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]'' Kempe is portrayed by [[Derek Royle]] as an oafish alcoholic. He is ousted from the troupe and replaced by [[Robert Armin]] when they think he has betrayed their involvement in the [[Essex Rebellion]]. In fact Armin is the informer, who has framed Kempe to replace him.
*In the 1998 [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', he is played by veteran [[character actor]] [[Patrick Barlow]].
*In 2005's TV-film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' he is portrayed by [[John Voce]].
*In the 2007 [[Doctor Who]] episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", Kempe is played by [[David Westhead]].
*In the 2016 [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', Kempe is played by [[Spencer Jones (actor)|Spencer Jones]] as a parody of modern comedian [[Ricky Gervais]].

===Literature===
*Kempe is a key character in [[Kevin Sylvester]]'s 2015 novel for young adults ''Neil Flambé and the Bard's Banquet'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster Books
*Kempe appears in Ann Young's 2002 novel for young adults ''The Nine Days Wonder'', published by East Hall Press.
*In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 1991 graphic novel [[The Sandman: Dream Country]], Kempe is depicted in the issue ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a short story about Shakespeare's first performance of the play.
*Kempe also appears in ''[[King of Shadows]]'', a 1999 children's fiction book which shows Kempe as a clown dancing a Nine Days' Morris.
*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[alternate history]] 2002 novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' Kempe is one of the main characters. His off-stage personality is indistinguishable from the characters he plays on stage, and his antics provide much of the humour in the novel, which is set during a time of grim peril.
*In J. B. Cheaney's 2004 novel ''The True Prince'' along with more of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].
*''Kempe's Jig'' is referenced in [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s poem "After Reading ''Children of Albion'' (1969)" from his ''A Treatise of Civil Power'', published in 2007.

*Kempe was the title character in Dan Roentsch's play ''Will Kemp''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zuYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22dan+roentsch%22+%22will+kemp%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-qTsDS5Mt&amp;sig=14WNgEIw-OijU_2GKCyLscghp94&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FkidUa-NOaXY0gGC3ICQAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q="dan roentsch" "will kemp"&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] depicts Kempe as a moody tragedian in his 1968 play ''[[A Cry of Players]]'', a significant departure from Kempe's actual performance style.

In 2008, comedian [[Tim FitzHigham]] re-enacted Kemp's Nine Day's Wonder by Morris dancing from London to Norwich, forming the basis of his play The Bard's Fool, performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tim Fitzhigham The Bard's Fool | work=Chortle  | url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2008/t/16406/tim_fitzhigham%3A_the_bards_fool |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zang Shiyi''' ({{zh|c=臧式毅|p=Zāng Shìyì|w='''Tsang Shih-i'''}} [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''Zō Shikiki''; October 1884 – November 13, 1956) was a Chinese general and Governor of [[Liaoning]] Province at the time of the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] in 1932.
 
==Biography==
Zang was born in [[Shenyang]] county of [[Liaoning]] Province in 1884. He traveled to Japan on a scholarship to the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]] and subsequently graduated from 9th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]], with a specialty in the [[cavalry]], in 1909. On his return to China he joined the pro-republican forces in [[Nanjing]] during the [[Xinhai Revolution]].

After the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1914 he became an instructor at the [[Baoding Military Academy]], where he soon caught the attention of Adm. Sheng Hung Leih, who appointed him to his staff. He rose to [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] for the [[Kuomintang]] forces in [[Jilin|Kirin Province]]. He participated in the [[Zhili–Anhui War]] in 1920 and the [[First Zhili–Fengtian War]] of 1923. Together with [[Yan Yuting]], he subsequently became Chief of Staff of the business administration section of the Kuomintang [[National Revolutionary Army]] headquarters in [[Nanjing]].

After the death of [[Manchuria]]n [[warlord]] [[Zhang Zuolin]], Zang supported the [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese Reunification Movement]] and was appointed governor of [[Liaoning]] Province in 1930.

After the [[Mukden Incident]] Zang initially refused to cooperate with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and was imprisoned. However, he later decided to defect and was re-appointed governor of Liaoning Province (renamed [[Liaoning|Fengtien]] Province) on 16 December 1931. He was part of the Northeastern Administrative Committee or "[[Self-Government Guiding Board]] that made plans for a new State of [[Manchukuo]] to be established in February 1932.

In 1932 Zang was re-appointed governor of Fengtian Province of Manchukuo, a position he retained after the administrative reorganization of the [[provinces of Manchukuo]] from four to ten provinces in October 1934. In March 1935 he was Emperor [[Puyi]]'s first choice to replace [[Zheng Xiaoxu]] as Prime Minister of Manchukuo (although [[Zhang Jinghui]] was appointed instead at the insistence of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] leadership). From 21 May 1935 Zang served in the largely ceremonial role as Speaker of the Manchukuo Senate—a post which he held until the collapse of Manchukuo in August 1945. He later served as Vice Minister for Home Affairs.

In 1940 Zang was appointed ambassador to the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] headed by [[Wang Jingwei]].

Following the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], he declared an emergency session of the Manchukuo legislature to promulgate the abdication of Emperor Puyi on 17 August 1945, effective 18 August, and attempted to open negotiations with the [[Soviet Union]]. However, the Manchukuo capital of [[Hsinking]] fell to the [[Red Army]] on 20 August 1945, and Zang was captured ten days later. He was initially held in custody in [[Siberia]], but was extradited to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1950, where he died of illness in captivity at the [[Fushun War Criminals Management Centre|War Criminals Management Centre]] in [[Fushun]], Liaoning, on 13 November 1956.
