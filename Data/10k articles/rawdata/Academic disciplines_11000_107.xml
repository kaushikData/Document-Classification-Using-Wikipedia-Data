The ways in which [[glass]] was exchanged throughout ancient times is intimately related to its production and is a stepping stone to learning about the economies and interactions of ancient societies.  Because of its nature it can be shaped into a variety of forms and as such is found in different archaeological contexts (window panes, jewellery, tableware...). This is important because it can inform on how different industries of sections of societies related to each other – both within a cultural region or with foreign societies.

Glass trade is mainly studied by compositional analysis of glass objects creating groups with specific chemical compositions that hopefully allow to differentiate between production centres (both geographically and chronologically). Complications arise from the fact that for long periods of time glass was made following very similar recipes and as such the major elements found do not vary significantly. It is made by a mixture of raw materials which means that different sources of each raw material even for the same production centre further complicate the situation. That it is a material that lends itself well to recycling can only add to this. However, as scientific techniques improve it is becoming increasingly possible to discern some compositional groups, together with other archaeological and textual evidence a picture of glass technology, industry and exchange is starting to emerge.

== Mesopotamia and Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age ==
{{see also|History of glass|Hellenistic glass}}
Glass beads are known from the 3rd millennium BC but it is only in the late 2nd millennium that glass finds start occurring more frequently, primarily in Egypt and Mesopotamia.  This is not to say that it was a widespread commodity, quite the contrary.  It was a material for high-status objects with archaeological evidence for the Late Bronze Age (LBA) also showing an almost exclusive distribution of glass finds at palace complexes such as that found in the city of Amarna – Egypt.  Texts listing offerings to Egyptian temples would start with gold and silver, followed by precious stones (lapis lazuli) and then bronze, copper and other not so precious stones with glass mentioned together with the lapis lazuli.  ''In this period it was rare and precious and its use largely restricted to the elite.'' &lt;ref&gt;Shortland 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest glass ingot was discovered in the 1300 B.C. Egyptian [[Uluburun]] shipwreck off the coast of Turkey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/travel/12-amazing-sunken-treasure-discoveries-20130816?pageno=13|title=Sunken Treasures: The World's Most Valuable Shipwreck Discoveries|author= Liz Burlingame| date=Aug 23, 2013|publisher=The Weather Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of raw glass occurred at primary workshops of which only 3 are known, all in Egypt:  [[Amarna]], [[Pi-Ramesses]] and [[Malkata]].&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"&gt;Walton et al 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the first two sites cylindrical ceramic vessels with vitrified remains have been identified as glass crucibles&lt;ref&gt;Rehren &amp; Push 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt; where the raw materials (quartz pebbles and plant ash) would be melted together with a colourant. The two sites seem to show a specialisation in colour, with blue glass, via the addition of cobalt, being produced at [[Amarna]] and red, through copper, at [[Pi-Ramesses]]. The resulting coloured glass would then be fashioned into actual objects at secondary workshops – far more common in the archaeological record. It seems certain that glass making was not exclusive to Egypt (in fact current scholarly opinion resides with the industry having originally been imported into the country) as there are Mesopotamian cuneiform texts which detail the recipes for the making of glass. Further supporting this hypothesis are the [[Amarna Letters]], a contemporaneous diplomatic correspondence detailing the demand and gift giving from vassal princes in Syro-Palestine to the Egyptian King, in these the most asked for item is glass.

The evidence then points to two regions that were making and exchanging glass. It seems logical to believe that at an initial stage it was glass objects, as opposed to raw glass, that were exchanged. The major element composition of glass finds from Mesopotamia and Egypt is indistinguishable with as much variation found within a specific assemblage than between different sites. This is indicative of the same recipe being used in both regions. As analytical techniques develop the presence of trace elements can be more accurately determined and it has been found that glass is compositionally identical within each region, but it is possible to discriminate between them.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be a huge step in uncovering trade patterns, however ''at present no Egyptian glass has been found in Mesopotamia, nor have any Mesopotamian glasses been found in Egypt''.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt;

Across the sea, Mycenaean glass beads were found to have been made with glass from both regions. The fact that the beads are stylistically Mycenaean would imply an import of raw glass.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt; Archaeological evidence for this trade comes from the [[Uluburun shipwreck]], dated to the 14th century BC.  As part of its cargo it carried 175 raw glass ingots of cylindrical shape. These ingots match the glass melting crucibles found at [[Amarna]] and [[Pi-Ramesses]]. 

It is not yet possible to discern if trade in glass was occurring directly between the glass producing regions and foreign consumers, it is quite possible that indirect routes via trading and seafaring partners along the Mediterranean coast,  trace element analysis of the Uluburun ingots might allow us to learn more.  At this point we know glass was being consumed by the elites of Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia, it was produced in Egypt and Mesopotamia with workshops possibly specialising in colour and distributed locally presumably through state control to state sponsored artisans, and exported further out as raw glass ingots.

== The Mediterranean during Roman times ==

From [[Hellenistic Glass|Hellenistic]] times glass production sees considerable technological developments culminating with the introduction of glass blowing in the 1st century BC. Glass objects could now be made in large scale production, with less raw material and faster and as a consequence became more common. From the early [[Roman glass|Roman times]], to Byzantine and early [[Glass in Islamic culture|Islamic]] periods the glass from Northern Europe to Eastern Mediterranean shows an incredible compositional homogeneity in its major elements. Unlike the LBA glass, Roman glass was made from the melting of sand and [[natron]] – mineral soda – from the Wadi Natron in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"&gt;Freestone et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With one raw material being common to all glass it should be possible to differentiate between glass made from different sands using composition variation of the trace elements and certain isotope ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter et al 2005, Freestone et al 2003, Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These compositional analyses aimed to investigate two models for glass production:
glass was produced in large scale primary workshops along the Levantine coast&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"/&gt; and Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Nenna et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; mixing natron and sand from the mouth of the Belus river – as mentioned by Pliny – and then traded to local glass working workshops. If natron was traded and mixed with local sands following a strict recipe could result in the homogeneous composition.

Glass making furnaces have been uncovered in Israel at two sites – 17 at Bet Eli'ezer and 3 at [[Apollonia-Arsuf|Apollonia]].&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"&gt;Gorin-Rosen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These are rectangular in shape measuring about 2m x 4m and matching in size a glass slab found inside a cave at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Bet She'arim]]. The resulting slabs would be broken up into chunks that were traded to glass workshops in the Middle East and across the Mediterranean as evidenced by the contemporaneous shipwrecks carrying such glass chunks.&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"/&gt;

The situation is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul – however ''the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry have yet to be located''.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jackson et al 2003, Baxter et al 2005 and Wolf et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and inferred for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  	
Evidence for large scale production has only come the Eastern Mediterranean and from latter dates and assumes a continuing glass making tradition. That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck – 3rd century – carrying 8 tons of raw glass.&lt;ref&gt;Foy &amp; Jezegou 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  This however does not exclude the smaller scale local production reported elsewhere.  The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo glass cullet presumably for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Trace element analysis of colourless glass showed these were made using sands from different sources and giving some support to the de-centralised production hypothesis.

By the 9th century the raw materials for glass shift again to quartz pebbles and plant ash and  the 'forest glass' of medieval Europe. Natron was no longer in use and the low lime composition of the Bet'eliezer glass would be suggestive of a decline in access to the material from at least the 6th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone &amp; Gorin-Rosen 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This could in turn be suggestive of a shift from a trade both in natron and raw glass to tighter control over natron and increase of centralised production.

== South East Asia,  Africa and the Indian Ocean ==

Glass shows up in Northern India at the end of the 2nd millennium BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. [[glass beadmaking|Glass beads]] in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sleen 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda-alumina glass&lt;ref&gt;Dussubieux et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD.  As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of ''reh'' with local, alumina rich, sands.&lt;ref&gt;Brill &amp; Rising 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Through LA-ICP-MS analysis, however, Carter found that Cambodia had a large amount of glass beads made of potash glass and predominantly high alumina soda glass. Potash glass is a glass that uses potash or K2O as a flux in order to decrease the melting point of the glass and is the most common type of glass found in SE Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Alison|title=Trade and Exchange networks in Iron Age Cambodia: Preliminary results from a compositional analysis of glass beads|journal=Journal of Indo-Pacific Archaeology|date=2011|pages=178–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed compositional data recently summarised by (Lankton, &amp; Dussubieux 2006) has uncovered several  distinct and yet contemporaneous glass technologies across the Indian Ocean, but the geographical assignment is not completely clear.  Two small groups show compositions matching those of natron based Mediterranean glass and Plant-ash Mesopotamian glass, demonstrating trade with these other regions. Trade in raw glass from Egypt to India was described in the 1st century texts of Periplus of the Erythraean, Mesopotamian glass increases in presence with increased [[sasanian glass|Sasanian]] control of the Indian Ocean from the 4th to 6th centuries. It is also possible that some glass was traded via the Silk Road.

The majority of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa pre dating European contact are from Indian or Sri Lankan origin with a recent paper (Dussubieux et al. 2008) demonstrating contact between Kenyan sites and Chaul in the West coast of India for the 9th to the 19th century.  Previously analysed samples from the East coast of Africa and Madagascar could potentially  fit this group but further work is still needed. Whether Chaul was the single port for trade in glass beads or if it was part of several competing ports on that coast is still unknown. Data from a site in South Africa, near the borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe, has tentatively assigned some beads to Islamic 8th century compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Prinsloo &amp; Colomban 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the old camel caravan routes that connected this region to Egypt and the Mediterranean were still in use even for glass at a site with easy access, via the Limpopo river, to the Indian Ocean trade and therefore to the West Indian glass that seem to be the most common.There is enough evidence that in ancient Sri Lanka, glass was manufactured in order to use for magnifying glasses or spectacles.

In [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]], '''basis pursuit denoising''' (BPDN) refers to a [[mathematical optimization]] problem of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\min_x \frac{1}{2}\|y-Ax\|^2_2+\lambda\|x\|_1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that controls the trade-off between [[Sparse vector|sparsity]] and reconstruction fidelity, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;N \times 1&lt;/math&gt; solution vector, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M \times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector of observations, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M \times N&lt;/math&gt; transform matrix and &lt;math&gt;M &lt; N&lt;/math&gt;. This is an instance of [[convex optimization]] and also of [[quadratic programming]].

Some authors refer to basis pursuit denoising as the following closely related problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_x \|x\|_1 \;\textrm{subject} \ \textrm{to}\;\;\|y-Ax\|^2_2 \le \delta&lt;/math&gt;
which, for any given &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is equivalent to the unconstrained formulation for some (usually unknown ''a priori'') value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The two problems are quite similar. In practice, the unconstrained formulation, for which most specialized and efficient computational algorithms are developed, is usually preferred.

Either types of basis pursuit denoising solve a [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] problem with a trade-off between having a small residual (making &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;Ax&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the squared error) and making &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; simple in the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt;-norm sense. It can be thought of as a mathematical statement of [[Occam's razor]], finding the simplest possible explanation (i.e. one that yields &lt;math&gt;\min_x \|x\|_1&lt;/math&gt;) capable of accounting for the observations &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;.

Exact solutions to basis pursuit denoising are often the best computationally tractable approximation of an underdetermined system of equations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Basis pursuit denoising has potential applications in statistics (c.f. the [[Lasso (statistics)#Lasso method|LASSO]] method of [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]), [[image compression]] and [[compressed sensing]].

As &lt;math&gt;\lambda \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; (or when &lt;math&gt;\delta = 0&lt;/math&gt;), this problem becomes [[basis pursuit]].

Basis pursuit denoising was introduced by Chen and Donoho in 1994, in the field of signal processing. In statistics, it is well known under the name [[Lasso (statistics)|LASSO]], after being introduced by Tibshirani in 1996.

==Solving basis pursuit denoising==
The problem is a convex quadratic problem, so it can be solved by many general solvers, such as [[interior point method]]s. For very large problems, many specialized methods that are faster than interior point methods have been proposed.

Several popular methods for solving basis pursuit denoising include the [[in-crowd algorithm]] (a fast solver for large, sparse problems&lt;ref&gt;See ''The In-Crowd Algorithm for Fast Basis Pursuit Denoising'', IEEE Trans Sig Proc 59 (10), Oct 1 2011, pp. 4595 - 4605, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5940245], demo [[MATLAB]] code available [http://molnargroup.ece.cornell.edu/files/InCrowdBeta1.zip]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[homotopy continuation]], [[fixed-point continuation]] (a special case of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140216231347/http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~srbecker/wiki/Forward_Backward_Algorithm forward backward algorithm]) and [[spectral projected gradient for L1 minimization]] (which actually solves [[Lasso (statistics)#Lasso method|LASSO]], a related problem).

'''Bonito Phase''' is an archeological term that refers to the period between 900 and 1140 CE, during which the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] area constructed numerous [[Great house (pueblo)|great house]]s. The system is divided into three parts: the '''Early Bonito phase''' from 900 to 1040; the '''Classic Bonito phase''' from 1040 to 1100, and the '''Late Bonito phase''' from 1100 to 1140. When the system was created in the 1980s, it was thought that construction at [[Pueblo Bonito]] began around 920, but it is now known that building at the great house started almost one hundred years earlier, {{circa|850}}.{{sfn|Vivian|Hilpert|2012|p=72}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sensor network does this by exchanging the measured value and accuracy value at every node with every other node,  and computes the accuracy range and a measured value for the whole network from all of the values collected.  Even if some of the data from some of the sensors is faulty, the sensor network will not malfunction. The algorithm is fault-tolerant and distributed. It could also be used as a sensor fusion method. The precision and accuracy bound of this algorithm have been proved in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ao|first=Buke|last2=Wang|first2=Yongcai|last3=Yu|first3=Lu|last4=Brooks|first4=Richard R.|last5=Iyengar|first5=S.

The algorithm assumes ''N'' processing elements (PEs), ''t'' of which are faulty and can behave maliciously. It takes as input either real values with inherent inaccuracy or noise (which can be unknown), or a real value with apriori defined uncertainty, or an interval. The output of the algorithm is a real value with an explicitly specified accuracy. The algorithm runs in O(''N''log''N'') where ''N'' is the number of PEs: see [[Big O notation]]. It is possible to modify this algorithm to correspond to Crusader’s Convergence Algorithm (CCA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Algorithm==

The Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is executed in every processing element (PE) of a distributed sensor network.  Each PE exchanges their measured interval with all other PEs in the network. The "fused" measurement is a weighted average of the midpoints of the regions found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/papers/sensors.pdf

 |publisher=University of Florida, Gainesville
 |date=September 7, 2004
 |accessdate=2010-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete steps of Brooks–Iyengar algorithm are shown in this section. Each PE performs the algorithm separately:

'''Input:'''

The measurement sent by PE ''k'' to PE ''i'' is a closed interval &lt;math&gt;[l_{k,i}, h_{k,i}]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq N&lt;/math&gt;

'''Output:'''

The output of PE ''i'' includes a point estimate and an interval estimate
# PE ''i'' receives measurements from all the other PEs.
# Divide the union of collected measurements into mutually exclusive intervals based on the number of measurements that intersect, which is known as the weight of the interval.
# Remove intervals with weight less than &lt;math&gt;N-\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the number of faulty PEs
# If there are ''L'' intervals left, let &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of the remaining intervals. We have &lt;math&gt;A_i = \{(I_1^i, w_1^i), \dots, (I_L^i, w_L^i)\}&lt;/math&gt;, where interval &lt;math&gt;I_l^i = [l_{I_l^i}, h_{I_l^i}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_l^i&lt;/math&gt;is the weight associated with interval &lt;math&gt;I_l^i&lt;/math&gt; . We also assume &lt;math&gt;h_{I_l^i} \leq h_{I_{l+1}^i}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Calculate the point estimate &lt;math&gt;v_i'&lt;/math&gt; of PE ''i'' as  &lt;math&gt;v_i' = \frac{\sum_l \frac{(l_{I_l^i}+h_{I_l^i})\cdot w_l^i}{2}}{\sum_l w_l^i}&lt;/math&gt; and the interval estimate is &lt;math&gt;[l_{I_1^i}, h_{I_L^i}]&lt;/math&gt;
'''Example:'''

Consider an example of 5 PEs, in which PE 5 (&lt;math&gt;S_5&lt;/math&gt;) is sending wrong values to other PEs and they all exchange the values.
[[File:Brooks-iyengar algorithm exchange values.png|center|300x300px|An Example of Brooks-Iyengar Algorithm]]

The values received by &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; are in the next Table.

!&lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt;[2.7, 6.7]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;[0, 3.2]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;[1.5, 4.5]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;[0.8, 2.8]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;[1.4, 4.6]&lt;/math&gt;
|}
[[File:An example of brooks-iyengar algorithm.png|WRD by Brooks-Iyengar Algorithm|center]]
We draw a Weighted Region Diagram (WRD) of these intervals, then we can determine &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; for PE 1 according to the Algorithm:

&lt;math&gt;A_1 = \{([1.5, 2.7], 4), ([2.7, 2.8], 5), ( [2.8, 3.2], 4) \}&lt;/math&gt;

which consists of intervals where at least 4(= &lt;math&gt;N-\tau&lt;/math&gt; = 5−1) measurements intersect. The output of PE 1 is equal to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{4*\frac{1.5+2.7}{2} + 5* \frac{2.7+2.8}{2} + 4*\frac{2.8+3.2}{2}} {13} = 2.625&lt;/math&gt;

and the interval estimate is &lt;math&gt;[1.5, 3.2]&lt;/math&gt;

Similar, we could obtain all the inputs and results of the 5 PEs:

We could use Approximate Consensus (scalar-based), Brooks-Iyengar Algorithm (interval-based) and Byzantine Vector Consensus (vector-based) to deal with interval inputs, and the paper &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; proved that Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is the best here.

== Application ==
Brooks–Iyengar algorithm is a seminal work and a major milestone in distributed sensing, and could be used as a fault tolerant solution for many redundancy scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Vijay|year=2012|title=Computational and Compressed Sensing Optimizations for Information Processing in Sensor Network|url=|journal=International Journal of Next-Generation Computing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is easy to implement and embed in any networking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ao|first=Buke|date=July 2017|title=Robust Fault Tolerant Rail Door State Monitoring Systems: Applying the Brooks-Iyengar Sensing Algorithm to Transportation Applications|url=|journal=International Journal of Next-Generation Computing |volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the algorithm was used in MINIX to provide more accuracy and precision, which leads to the development of the first version of RT-Linux.

In 2000, the algorithm was also central to the DARPA SensIT program’s distributed tracking program. Acoustic, seismic and motion detection readings from multiple sensors are combined and fed into a distributed tracking system. Besides, it was used to combine heterogeneous sensor feeds in the application fielded by BBN Technologies, BAE systems, Penn State Applied Research Lab(ARL), and USC/ISI.

Besides, the Thales Group, a UK Defense Manufacturer, used this work in its Global Operational Analysis Laboratory. It is applied to Raytheon’s programs where many systems need extract reliable data from unreliable sensor network, this exempts the increasing investment in improving sensor reliability. Also, the research in developing this algorithm results in the tools used by the US Nav in its maritime domain awareness software.

In education, Brooks–Iyengar algorithm has been widely used in teaching classes such as University of Wisconsin, Purdue, Georgia Tech, Clemson University, University of Maryland, etc.

In addition to the area of sensor network, other fields such as time-triggered architecture, safety of cyber-physical systems, data fusion, robot convergence, high-performance computing, software/hardware reliability, ensemble learning in artificial intelligence systems could also benefit from Brooks–Iyengar algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10874">The '''Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis''' ({{lang-nl|Centraal Planbureau}}, CPB, literal translation: Central Planning Bureau) is a part of the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Its goal is to deliver economic analysis and forecasts. In this process, the CPB tries to be scientifically sound and up-to-date. The CPB is an independent government agency founded at 15 September 1945 by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Jan Tinbergen]]. On 21 April 1947, it obtained its legal basis. It is located in [[The Hague]], on Bezuidenhoutseweg.

Clients of the CPB are mainly the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]], [[politician]]s and [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]], [[ministries of the Netherlands]], [[labour union]]s and [[Employers' organization|employers' organisations]]. It also provides reports and advice for [[European Union]] initiatives. One of the government appointed members in the [[Social-Economic Council]] is Chair of the CPB.

==Status==
The CPB is financed by the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]], but it operates independently. This means it does have a stable income but also does not have to follow the ministry. This combination is the foundation for the unique status of the CPB. The CPB is asked to analyze the election platforms of the major parties for the effects of proposed policies on the budget deficit, unemployment, inflation, income differentials, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Faludi A. 2005. “The Netherlands: A Country with a Soft Spot for Planning.” In Comparative Planning Cultures, edited by Sanyal B. 285–307. New York/London: Routledge. [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.faludi/2_1%20A%20Country%20with%20a%20Soft%20Spot_Proofs.doc Download]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes a clear guide for voters because of the following advantages:&lt;ref&gt;Bos, F. (2007). The Dutch fiscal framework: History, current practice and the role of the CPB. Current Practice and the Role of the CPB, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1000121 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The same underlying economics base scenario for the next government's term is used to evaluate each election program. This means that differences in the outcomes between the parties cannot be due to diverging assumptions about economic developments.
*The political parties have to elaborate and explain their proposals in such a way that the CPB is able to analyze them. This means that the parties cannot (on the basis of unfounded optimism) exaggerate the benefits and/or understate the costs of their proposals.
*The policy proposals and their financial consequences are presented in a comparable way. This means that the parties' commitments in the financial and economic sphere can be compared to each other
*The CPB systematically investigates the consistency of the programs. In their initial proposals there maybe some "miscalculations", but such issues are invariably resolved in the detailed discussions between the party in question and the CPB.
*The CPB only includes in its analysis measures which are expected to be technically and legally feasible. If the CPB does not have the in-house expertise to judge the feasibility or the legality of certain proposals, it obtains advice from other institutions.

It is also not uncommon to use the results of the CPB to defend attack or compare the different policies.

Parties voluntarily subject their programs to CPB analysis. However, after the elections of 1986, it became a custom that each major party asked the CPB to forecast the consequences of their election program. In general, the parties seem to worry more about being accused of not wanting to face the economic consequences of their proposals than showing negative results. In 2002, the party "List Pim Fortuyn" did not submit their elections platform, although it came in as second largest party.&lt;ref name=double&gt;Kraan, D. (2005). Typically Dutch. OECD Journal on Budgeting, 4(4), 103-125. [http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/typically-dutch_budget-v4-art23-en DOI:10.1787/16812336]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPB analyzes government budget proposals on its own initiative. The analysis is considered a key document when determining how successful a government is with it policies. The results of this analysis is the basis for the income and expenditure for the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]]. Through the independent status of the CPS, it is in practice impossible for the Dutch government to use their own models and interpretations of statistics. This forces the government, regardless of who is in power, to stay within the given boundaries and lowers the chance of budget surprises. It also increases the credibility of the ministry estimates.

Twice a year, the CPB publishes a macroeconomic forecast called the "Central Economic Plan (CEP)" and the "Macroeconomic Explorations (MEV)".&lt;ref name="double" /&gt;

The CEP is published in March. It includes the forecast for all the major variables and the current policies. At this point in time, new policies are decided or changed and they have a chance to look at the coming economic situation. For this purpose, it updates the forecasts of the previous MEV about the effects of the policies. A provisional version of the CEP is supplied to the cabinet in January or February, which is used by the minister of finance for the expenditure targets.

The MEV is published in September simultaneously with the publication of government budgets for the following year. It includes forecast for all the major variables and the effects of the new policies since last year. A preliminary, confidential, draft is sent to the government in June. Some adjustments of expenditures and revenues between the draft and the final version can be made.

== Models ==
The CPB uses several models to analyze policies and the economy. Their main model is SAFFIER II, next to this there are several small models which can be attached to SAFFIER II.

In May 2010 the CPB changed from SAFFIER to SAFFIER II. It is an actualized and modernized version of SAFFIER and therefore the name is maintained. The special features of SAFFIER II are that it consist of one model, which has two time frames (quarterly and yearly) which is applied on three states (short term, medium term and long term). The major differences with SAFFIER are:&lt;ref&gt;SAFFIER II: 1 model voor de Nederlandse economie, in 2 hoedanigheden, voor 3 toepassingen (in dutch)[http://www.cpb.nl/sites/default/files/publicaties/download/doc217.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt;
*All behavioral equations have been re-estimated
*Some changes on the production function, wage rate, private consumption and export have been made

SAFFIER II is built around a core of 25 equations, the behavioral equations. Then there are 270 heuristics, which are non estimated, easy equations. The major part of the are 1455 identities{{clarify|date= April 2016}}, these are technical equations and definition equations, which do not change over time. The model thus uses a total of 1750 equations. Next to these equations, in the model itself, there are 1250 additional equations, which do not influence outcomes of the model but help analyzing and checking the results.

The models are constructed with high detail and a lot of attention. However, models do not always reflect reality and are based on theories. In the case of CPB models, there is a generally a deviation of up to 1 percentage point. The models are regularly updated to reflect new theoretical insights and needs for outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Don, F., &amp; Verbruggen, J. P.

== International coordination ==
The CPB is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015. In addition to the CPB, the Netherlands is also represented by the [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Council of State]].

==Controversy==
In 2011, the CPB conducted a study on the effects of the [[Euro]] for the Netherlands. The results were, among others, published in the book 'Europa in crisis' (Europe in crisis). One of the conclusions of the research was that the [[Euro]] had brought about a week's pay in benefits to the Dutch population (i.e. about 2% income). In an interview in 'De Telegraaf' (the Dutch The Telegraph) in May 2014, the former director [[Coen Teulings]] stated that the study performed under his supervision should be taken with a grain of salt, adding that the economic advantages "aren't very clear".&lt;ref&gt;Telegraaf.nl (2014) (in Dutch): [http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/22634501/__CPB_overdreef_voordeel_euro__.html CPB overdreef voordeel euro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''casebook method''', similar to but not exactly the same as the [[case method]], is the primary method of teaching [[law]] in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].  It was pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]].  It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn [[Law of the United States|American law]] is to read the actual judicial [[opinion]]s which become the law under the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (due to its Anglo-American [[common law]] origin).

==History and technique==
To set up the case method of law study, American law [[professor]]s traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called [[casebook]]s.  Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between.  One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule.  
  
Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the [[Socratic method]] in American law schools.  For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases.  In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will ''not'' be any ''one'' correct rule.

A typical example in the law of contracts is ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today.  Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches.  Thus stated, ''Hadley'' seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will ''never'' say that.  Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.

This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.

In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction.  This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward [[statutory law]], such as [[tax law]] (which in the USA is governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) and certain areas of [[commercial law]] (particularly courses dealing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]).

This method is also used in other [[common law]] countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

===Law school outlines===
To facilitate the case method of study, "law school outlines" are used as legal topic [[study aid]]s. Typically, the outlines are created by [[law school]] students; however, there are professional outlines also available.  An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of [[law]], organized according to the typical law school [[curriculum]]. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in [[case law]] to establish more generalized legal principles.  Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases.  They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated.  Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

'''Computational sustainability''' is a broad field that attempts to optimize societal, economic, and environmental resources using methods from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computational-sustainability.org/|title=www.computational-sustainability.org|website=www.computational-sustainability.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainability]] in this context is the ability to produce enough energy for the world to support its biological systems.  Using the power of computers to process large quantities of information, decision making algorithms allocate resources based on real-time information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unknown|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf?ip=73.234.206.61&amp;id=1562174&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E6D218144511F3437&amp;CFID=594460368&amp;CFTOKEN=33596010&amp;__acm__=1458873213_60e5758f5509c54d6c6abc8c305ffbc8|doi=10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are widespread. [[Smart grid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s implement renewable resources and storage capabilities to control the production and expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compsust.net/|title=CompSustNet: Home|website=www.compsust.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent transportation system]] analyze road conditions and relay information to drivers so they can make smarter decisions based on real time traffic information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero-ibanez|first=J. A.|last2=Zeadally|first2=S.|last3=Contreras-Castillo|first3=J.|date=2015-12-01|title=Integration challenges of intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicle, cloud computing, and internet of things technologies|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7368833|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=22|issue=6|pages=122–128|doi=10.1109/MWC.2015.7368833|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. [[Data collection]] can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a [[mobile app]], like [[Waze]], to report its whereabouts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44160-2_5|title=Transportation Systems: Monitoring, Control, and Security|last=Timotheou|first=Stelios|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Christos G.|last3=Polycarpou|first3=Marios M.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783662441596|editor-last=Kyriakides|editor-first=Elias|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|pages=125–166|language=en|editor-last2=Polycarpou|editor-first2=Marios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders.  Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their [[smart card]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at stations and online.  APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones.  Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are.  [[Ramp meter]]s regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups.  Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road.  Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers ability to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/shift-to-constant-connectivity.html|title=The Shift to Constant Connectivity|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Maps]] uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/how-google-tracks-traffic/|title=How Google Tracks Traffic|website=www.ncta.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars communicate with their manufacturers to remotely install software updates when new features are added or bugs are being patched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/wireless-updates-to-core-automotive-functions-could-spell-privacy-troubles/|title=Your next car will update itself while you sleep, and maybe watch you too|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tesla Motors]] even uses these updates to increase their cars efficiency and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11378880/Tesla-software-update-did-your-car-just-get-faster.html|title=Tesla software update: did your car just get faster?|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections give ITS a means to accurately collect information and even relay that information to drivers with no other infrastructure needed.

Future ITS systems will aid in car communication with not just the infrastructure, but with other cars as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Utilities ==
The [[electrical grid]] was designed to send consumers electricity from [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] for a monthly fee based on usage. Homeowners are installing [[solar panel]]s and large batteries to store the power created by these panels.  A [[smart grid]] is being created to accommodate the new energy sources.  Rather than just electricity being sent to a household to be consumed by the various appliances in the home, electricity can flow in either direction.  Additional sensors along the grid will improve information collection and decreased downtime during power outages. These sensors can also relay information directly to consumers about how much energy they're using and what the costs will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/fa14-solar-power-on-the-rise.html#.VwbE4hMrKu4|title=Solar Power on the Rise|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corps Altsachsen''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Dresden]], Germany. It was  founded on October 31, 1861 and is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical [[Corporation (university)|Fraternities]] in Europe with roots dating back to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps.

Four presidents ("[[Rector (academia)|Rektor]]") of [[Dresden University of Technology]], Dresden's largest university with approximately 30.000 students, are among the list of members of the fraternity, underlining the deep connection between the Corps and the local alma mater.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The connections with the university and the city of Dresden go far back to the fraternity's early beginnings in the late 19th century, with members aspiring to drive developments for the university over the course of history. Two major accomplishments were (1) ensuring the university's recognition by developing the former Technical Institute into the Royal Saxon Technical College of Dresden in the late 1800s and (2) founding of today's [[Studentenwerk]] Dresden in the early 1900s as the university's student council.&lt;ref name="AS1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; Outside of the university's circles, many of the fraternity's members  drove developments in the architectural style and design of several of Dresden's buildings such as the "Dresden's Neuer Bahnhof".&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Dresden's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Altsachsen's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in grey-green-gold. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, who are stemming from very diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Altsachsen expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Altsachsen as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

[[File:Mühlberg - Säbelmensur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Academic fencing|Academic "Mensur" fencing]] in 1900. Steel goggles were added to protect the eyes and nose nowadays.]]
Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Altsachsen's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

[[File:Knight academy lecture (Rosenborg Palace).jpg|thumb|''[[Rhetoric]] evenings'' in the fraternity's old-school bar are similar in style to a knight academy lecture as depicted.]]
Altsachsen's members value the art of ''[[rhetoric]]''. The tradition is kept alive by both impromptu or "stand-up and talk" speeches (''Stegreifrede'' in German) as well as elaborate platform presentations typical of industry and academia. All members must present a significant number of such talks and are graded on their presentation skills. In order to become a full member, pledge members must pass a curriculum of predetermined talks in front of their peers and guests.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network ([[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent|WSC]]/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

{{Quote|The '''object and purpose of the Corps''' was and still is solely the education of students to become a strong, free and cosmopolitan personality who is not held back by religious, racist, national, scientific or philosophical limitations of the mind. Three primary institutions within the fraternity aid with achieving this aim; including the '''Corpsconvent''' [regular council meetings of the Corps Brothers], the '''Kneipe'''  [celebratory get-together of Corps Brothers with speeches, beer and songs], and today's '''Bestimmungsmensur'''  [the event of academic fencing with sharp blades for the first or one of the first times], where the ones to fence are chosen on the basis of placing two equal opponents in front of each other. [...] This experience, and the intertwined need to overcome one's own fear, dedicated to the union of his Corps, and the connected strengthening of the sense of community aids the personal growth just as does taking a hit without losing one's stand and accepting the assessment of the '''Mensur'''  by the own Corps Brothers.|[[:de:Hermann Rink]]&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Rink: ''Die Mensur, ein wesentliches Merkmal des Verbandes.''

=== Foundation as Rhetoric Society in 19th century Dresden ===
[[File:Dresden photochrom2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brühl's Terrace]] in 1890.]]

The fraternity was founded on October 31, 1861, at the [[Brühl's Terrace]] in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former [[Institute of Technology]], now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally ''[[Polyhymnia]]'', after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and [[eloquence]]. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse should be part of a complete humanistic higher education. The colors ''grey-green-gold'' were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy and hope for its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at Brühl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river [[Elbe]] as well as lavish [[Ball (dance)|balls]] throughout the year.

[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by Altsachsen's members then and now.]]
By 1868, the fraternity had adopted the tradition of academic fencing or ''"Mensur"'' challenges (back then "duels"&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;) with members of other proper fraternities&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; and had changed its official name to ''Akademische Verbindung Polyhymnia'' (Academic Fraternity Polyhymnia). The motto "Litteris et amicitiae" (Science and Friendship) was adopted on June 25, 1880.&lt;ref name="AS1911"&gt;Festschrift zur Feier des fünfzigjährigen Bestehens der freischlagenden Verbindung "Polyhymnia" an der Technischen Hochschule zu Dresden. Technische Hochschule Dresden, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternity's [[Coat of arms of Germany|coat of arms]] was chosen in the same year, depicting the one-headed black eagle of the time of the German Empire (1871-1918) instead of the two-headed eagle at the time of the fraternity's foundation.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

=== Influencing the development of the Technical Institute of Dresden ===
Dresden's main university, today's Technical University (short: TU) Dresden was founded in 1828 as one of the first [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]] of the world, then called "Technical School of Saxony". After Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire in 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (Königlich-Sächsisches Polytechnikum). At this point in time, topics not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced to the school curriculum. Several of Altsachsen's fraternity members were in high-ranking institute and government positions and had an influential role by lobbying Saxony's state government to recognize the technical institute as a higher education provider with polytechnical merits, which resulted in yet another name change to ''Königlich-Sächsischen Technischen Hochschule Dresden'' (Royal-Saxon Technical College of Dresden) in 1890.&lt;ref name="AS1961"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961, S. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To honor the recognition of the educational institution, the fraternity established the ''academic principle'' (''akademische Prinzip''). This meant that every member could only become an alumnus after graduating with a higher academic degree and in good academic standing, an initiative by fraternity member and Honorary Senator Fritz Zeuner, son of the former president of the Poly-technical Institute Gustav Zeuner. They and others in the fraternity significantly influenced the college's course, eventually leading to the college's privilege to graduate students with doctoral degrees in 1900. Aside from traditional doctoral graduations, the university was also allowed to honor exceptional scientists and businessmen as honorary doctors; the first such honor was granted to Friedrich August Siemens.&lt;ref name="AS1961"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift Der Technischen Universität Dresden, Volume 18, Issue 5, Technischen Universität Dresden, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TU-Dresden-Georg-Schumann-Bau 2.jpg|thumb|The typical, early 1900s style of campus architecture is exemplified in today's nearby Schumann-Building at the [[Dresden University of Technology|TU Dresden]].]]

=== Foundation of Franconia ===
During the late 1800s, fraternities began forming fraternity circles and umbrella organizations. Differences in opinion about tolerance and general politics led to the end of ''honorable greeting and fencing'' with certain types of fraternities, such as the Cheruscia Dresden in 1899. This led to problems trying to maintain a high level of fencing engagements among similar fraternities, which is why five of Polyhymnia's fraternity brothers founded the "fencing fraternity Franconia Dresden" ("Freischlagende Verbindung Franconia", later "Corps Franconia Dresden") in Juli of 1899. Monetary stimulus for the new fraternity was provided by Polyhymnia's alumni-organisation. Both "fencing fraternities", not yet Corps at that point, formed the Dresden Fraternity Cartel ("Dresdner Verbindungs-Cartell" D.V.C.) to rival and engage in regular social and fencing events.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schüler: Weinheimer S.C.-Chronik, Darmstadt 1927, S. 434-454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Michael Doeberl, Alfred Bienengräber: Das akademische Deutschland, Volume 2, C.A. Weller, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joining the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent ===
To guarantee her members reliable means to fence with other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen.&lt;ref name="PG81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz Blaschke, Holger Starke, Uwe John: Geschichte der Stadt Dresden, Volume 3, Theiss Verlag, 2006, S. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The name change from ''Polyhymnia'' to ''Corps Altsachsen'' happened in compliance with WSC rules for fraternity names at that time.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

=== Suspension during times of the national socialist rule ===
Similar to other fraternities who encouraged their members to have their own free thought and will, members of the Corps Altsachsen felt the increasing pressure of national socialist surveillance as well as political pressure in the early 1930s. A similar-minded fraternity, ''Corps Makaria Dresden'', fused with the Corps Altsachsen in 1934, which strengthened bonds and numbers within the fraternity. Still, as political pressures in Nazi Germany had increased to dangerous levels for fraternities during the next years, Corps Altsachsen officially suspended activities in 1936.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;  During the 1930s, eventually all corps abiding by a free democratic order did the same as their view of the world was in stark contrast to the so-called [[Führerprinzip]] (Führer-principle), where one person governs essentially as dictator instead of relying on a democratic, consensus-based majority in a convent.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;

[[File:Corps Altsachsen Winternacht.png|thumb|House of the fraternity in a snowy Christmas winter night in Dresden.]]

=== Post-war reconstitution and return to Dresden ===
After the war, the fraternity was reconstituted at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1950&lt;ref name="Asta1972"&gt;Universitätsführer. Universität zu Köln, Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and soon fused with the smaller ''Corps Gothia Dresden'' in 1953. Originally located in Köln-Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to Köln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the [[Iron Curtain]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asta1972"/&gt; During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again not allowed to exist as they could not be controlled by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Party]]. Following [[Germany's reunification]] in 1989, the fraternity returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'', a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The ''Blaues Kartell'' today includes the [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München]] in [[Munich]], Corps Hannoverania in [[Hanover]] and [[Corps Berlin]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, right in the middle of the [[Campus]] of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

[[File:Dresden Weiße Flotte Terrassenufer.jpg|thumb|[[:de:Dresden (Schiff, 1926)|Steamboat]] at [[Brühl's Terrace]]]]

=== Today ===
The fraternity is known for its strong commitment to the university and its rhetoric traditions as well as lavish social events. Among these are regular boat parties on Dresden's [[Paddle steamer|steam boats]] as well as traditional balls allowing the Corps brothers to enjoy [[Waltz dance|waltz]], [[latin dance|Latin]] or many other forms of [[ballroom dance]].&lt;ref name="AShp"&gt;Webpage of the Corps Altsachsen - "Aktuelles" showing current events http://www.altsachsen.de Retrieved on Oct. 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these events are not limited to the region of Dresden, as there are several trips per year to other cities.

== Relationships with other fraternities ==
Corps Altsachsen is a member of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'', a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as "one fraternity spanning four cities" (Dresden, Munich, Hanover, and Berlin).

{{cosmology}}
In [[astronomy]], a '''correlation function''' describes the distribution of [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the universe.  By default, "correlation function" refers to the two-point [[correlation function|autocorrelation function]]. The two-point autocorrelation function is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] (distance); it describes the excess [[probability]] of finding two galaxies separated by this distance (excess over and above the probability that would arise if the galaxies were simply scattered independently and with uniform probability).  It can be thought of as a lumpiness factor - the higher the value for some distance scale, the more lumpy the universe is at that distance scale.

The following definition (from Peebles 1980) is often cited: 

: ''Given a random galaxy in a location, the correlation function describes the [[probability]] that another galaxy will be found within a given distance.''

However, it can only be correct in the statistical sense that it is averaged over a large number of galaxies chosen as the first, ''random'' galaxy. If just one ''random'' galaxy is chosen, then the definition is no longer correct, firstly because it is meaningless to talk of just one "random" galaxy, and secondly because the function will vary wildly depending on which galaxy is chosen, in contradiction with its definition as a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

The spatial correlation function &lt;math&gt;\xi(r)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the [[Fourier space]] [[power spectrum]] of the galaxy distribution, &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt;, as
&lt;math&gt;\xi(r)  = \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \int dk \, k^2 P(k) \, \frac{\sin(kr)}{kr}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''n''-point autocorrelation functions for ''n'' greater than 2 or [[cross-correlation]] functions for particular object types are defined similarly to the two-point autocorrelation function.

The correlation function is important for theoretical models of [[physical cosmology]] because it provides a means of testing models which assume different things about the contents of the universe.

'''Cultural identity''' is the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and [[self-perception]] and is related to [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], [[generation]], [[locality (settlement)|locality]] or any kind of social group that has its own distinct [[culture]]. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the [[individual]] but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Moha Ennaji, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXsF7fT318QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22cultural%20identity%22&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco]'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2005, pp.19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Child With Flag.jpg|thumb|Child with flag and a gun]]
Various modern [[cultural studies]] and [[social theories]] have investigated cultural identity and understanding . In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged which breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: [[Location (geography)|location]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[history]], [[nationality]], [[language]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious beliefs]], [[ethnicity]], [[aesthetics]], and even [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing Taste: TheWalrus.ca&lt;/ref&gt; As one author writes, recognizing both coherence and fragmentation:

{{cquote|categorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url=https://www.academia.edu/11768378 | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195 | doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.993332}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.

As a "historical reservoir," culture is an important factor in shaping identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicola |last=Pratt |title=Identity, Culture and Democratization: The Case of Egypt |journal=New Political Science |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=69–86 |doi=10.1080/07393140500030832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its "historical reservoir," many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society, and that [[cosmopolitanism]] gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_A6qIkbYB_kC ''The Limits of Nationalism''] by Chaim Gans. {{ISBN|978-0-521-00467-1}} {{ISBN|0521004675}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their 'make up' that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other.&lt;ref&gt;C Brown (2001) ''Understanding International Relations''. Hampshire, Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; Nations provide the framework for culture identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence N TiceTHE EDUCATION DIGEST, V. 64 (9), 05/1999, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of interest is the interplay between cultural identity and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = C. L. | year = 2010 | title = New media and cultural identity | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+media+and+cultural+identity.-a0219656567 | journal = China Media Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than necessarily representing an individual's interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the [[agenda setting|social norms as presented by the media]]. Accordingly, instead of learning [[behaviour]] and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insanbilimleri.com/ojs/index.php/uib/article/view/406|title=Media and cultural identity - Mora - International Journal of Human Sciences|website=insanbilimleri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of cultural complexities structure the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. [[Nation]] is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for individual's identity but it may contrast with ones cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones [[religion]], ancestry, skin colour, language, [[Class (social)|class]], education, profession, skill, family and political [[Propositional attitude|attitudes]]. These factors contribute to the development of one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Adrian|title=Complexity in cultural identity|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|date=May 2010|volume=10|issue=2|page=177|doi=10.1080/14708470903267384-2196217058202341170.pdf|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural identity is essentially how we as individuals cater to all positions of our lives. We may be teachers, students, friends, bosses, employees, etc. How we act and how our schemas contribute to our positions are the building blocks of your overall cultural identity.

==Cultural arena==
It is also noted that an individual's "[[Social environment|cultural arena]]", or place where one lives, impacts the culture that that person chooses to abide by. The surroundings, the environment, the people in these places play a factor in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to [[Acculturation|fit into the culture]] of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant's current [[World view|belief in their culture]] and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.

Some might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by [[Biculturalism|committing to two or more cultures]]. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The nature of the impact of cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real world cultural arena. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holliday | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity in cultural identity | url = | journal = Language and Intercultural Communication | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 165–177 | doi = 10.1080/14708470903267384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Language develops from the wants of the people who tend to disperse themselves in a common given location over a particular period of time. This tends to allow people to share a way of life that generally links individuals in a certain culture that is identified by the people of that group. The affluence of communication that comes along with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Language can function as a fluid and ever changing identifier, and can be developed in response or rebellion of another cultural code, such as creole languages in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Stuart|last2=Ghazoul|first2=Ferial|date=2012-01-01|title=Cultural identity and diaspora|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA302403835&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=fulltext&amp;issn=11108673&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1&amp;isAnonymousEntry=true|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|language=English|issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Language also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language.

Language learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a [[Multilingualism|second language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Bok-Myung|title=Cultural Identity in Korean English|journal=Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics|year=2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=131–145|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ920507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many aspects of a person's cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures can change cultural traditions, language is a main component of cultural identity.

==Education==
Kevin McDonough pointed out, in his article, several factors concerning support or rejection of the government for different cultural identity education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDonough | first1 = Kevin | year = 1998 | title = Can the Liberal State Support Cultural Identity Schools? | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 463–499 | doi=10.1086/444195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have also shown concern for the state support regarding equity for children, school transitions and multicultural education. During March 1998, the two authors, Linda D. Labbo and Sherry L. Field collected several useful books and resources to promote multicultural education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tice, Terrence N. [http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cultural+identity&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Education+Digest&amp;rft.au=Terrence+N+Tice&amp;rft.date=1999-05-31&amp;rft.issn=0013-127X&amp;rft.eissn=1949-0275&amp;rft.volume=64&amp;rft.issue=9&amp;rft.spage=43&amp;rft.externalDBID=GTED&amp;rft.externalDocID=40876855 "Cultural Identity"], ''The Education Digest'', May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigrant identity development ==
Identity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of [[acculturation]].  Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a [[qualitative study]] through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish Refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity.  The results indicated that, “…[[acculturation]] appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing.  However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country” (Birman &amp; Trickett, 2001).

In a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society in order to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, having a combination of having a strong ethnic and national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence.  An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural.  It is shown that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one’s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990).  Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, classes, after–school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures.  It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants’ identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the study cited, a combination of family workshops and teacher professional development aimed to improve the language learning and emotional development of these youths and families &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==School transitions==
How great is "Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School"? John W. Alspaugh's research is in the September/October 1998 ''Journal of Educational Research'' (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.&lt;ref name="Copyright Prakken Publications, Inc. May 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrence N|first=Tice|title=Cultural Identity|year=1999|publisher=Prakken Publications, Inc.|pages=43–44|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218180019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.

Unexamined cultural identity: "a stage where one's cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues." This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn't distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.

An example of thought in this stage: "I don't have a culture I'm just an American." "My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I've never lived there."

Cultural identity search: "is the process of exploration and questioning about one's culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture." During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.

An example of thought in this stage: "I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others." "There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am."

Cultural identity achievement: "is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one's cultural identity." In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination, and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment

== The role of the internet ==
There is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between [[Cyberculture|virtual culture]] – understood as the modes and norms of behaviour associated with the [[internet]] and the [[online world]] – and [[youth culture]]. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and [[Reality|real]] sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a [[Moebius Strip|Moebius strip]] where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of [[active learning]], of [[googling]] 'when you don’t know', of recourse to tutorials for 'learning' a programme or a game, or the expression 'I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing' are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Políticas TIC en los Sistemas Educativos de América Latina. Informe sobre tendencias sociales y educativas en América Latina|last=SITEAL, IIPE-UNESCO y OEI|first=|publisher=Buenos Aires, IIEP-UNESCO Regional Office in Buenos Aires.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today's youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependency for peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of [[Identity formation|identity construction]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Youth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the ‘real’ world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Los adolescentes y las redes sociales|last=Morduchowicz|first=R.|last2=Marcon|first2=A.|last3=Sylvestre|first3=A.|last4=Ballestrini|first4=F.|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

From other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of ‘identity laboratory’ and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet|last=Turkle|first=S.|publisher=New York, Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of the Internet|last=Wallace|first=P.|publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. [[video game]]s or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zegers|first=B.|last2=Larraín|first2=M.E.|year=2011|title=El impacto de la Internet en la definición de la identidad juvenil: una revisión|url=http://www.psykhe.cl/index.php/psykhe/article/view/469/448|journal=Psykhe|volume= 11| issue =  1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8541">'''Cyber Insider Threat''', or '''CINDER''', is a digital threat method. In 2010, DARPA initiated a program under the same name (Cyber Insider Threat (CINDER) Program) to develop novel approaches to the detection of activities within military-interest networks that are consistent with the activities of cyber espionage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Cyber-Insider_Threat_(CINDER).aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The CINDER threat is unlike other vulnerability based attacks in that the action taken by the initiator is not based on unauthorized access by unauthorized objects or authorized objects, it is based on the concept that authorized access by authorized objects will normally occur (along with their subsequent actions) within the security boundary. This object action will not be viewed as an attack, but normal use when analyzed by standard IDS-IPS, logging and expert systems. The CINDER Mission will be seen as an unauthorized disclosure once data exfiltration has been realized. At that time, the resultant CINDER Case would change all object actions related to the disclosure from "Authorized Use by an Authorized Object" to "Unauthorized Use by an Authorized Object".&lt;ref name=Cod1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.CodeCenters.com | title=Mission and Case Analysis of Cyber Insider (CINDER) Methods within Military and Corporate Environments|publisher=CodeCenters International Training Press |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: For the initial CINDER case, the controlling agent&lt;ref name=UNSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~wobcke/COMP4416/readings/Wooldridge.Jennings.95.pdf|title=Intelligent Agents: Theory and Practice|publisher=Knowledge Engineering Review|accessdate=2012-05-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107112735/http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~wobcke/COMP4416/readings/Wooldridge.Jennings.95.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will still be seen as an Authorized Object based on the fact that the security system has passed an evaluation for Assurance and Functionality.

The Cyber Insider Threat has continued to be a known issue since the mid-1980s. The following [[NIST]] material dated March 1994, "Internal Threats", shows how it was defined in its infancy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"System controls are not well matched to the average organization's security policy. As a direct result, the typical user is permitted to circumvent that policy on a frequent basis. The administrator is unable to enforce the policy because of the weak access controls, and cannot detect the violation of policy because of weak audit mechanisms. Even if the audit mechanisms are in place, the daunting volume of data produced makes it unlikely that the administrator will detect policy violations. Ongoing research in integrity and intrusion detection promise to fill some of this gap. Until these research projects become available as products, systems will remain vulnerable to internal threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/threats/subsubsection3_4_4_2.html |title=Trends for the future - Internal Threats|publisher=NIST |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CINDER behaviors and methods==

===CINDER prerequisites===
There are many prerequisite dimensions to CINDER activity, but one primary dimension must always be met. That is one of System Ownership. Prerequisite principles of system ownership and information dominance within the area of object action must be part of any CINDER mission.

===CINDER system ownership and object action===
In CINDER action, each mission dimension and each resulting case issue can be distilled down to one entity, one agent.&lt;ref name=UNSW /&gt; and one action. At the specific time an agent completes an action, that entity, agent and action owns the environment they are transiting or using. And if they are successful in committing that specific transaction and are not interrupted or at least measured or monitored by the owner, that entity will have, if for only a moment in time, dominance and ownership over that object.&lt;ref name=Cod1 /&gt;

==CINDER detection methods==

===Methods for detecting past CINDER actions===
To detect past CINDER activity when an exposure has been realized, one must reconcile all object actions (any exchange or transaction between two agents that can be measured or logged) and analyze the result.

===Methods for detecting current and future CINDER actions===
Present concepts of how one detects current or future CINDER activity has followed the same path as detecting past CINDER activity: A reconciliation of all data from all object action, then the application of heuristics, expert system logic and mining models to the data aggregated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA456356| title=DTIC Analysis and Detection of Malicious Insiders |publisher=[[DTIC]] Defense Technical Information Center - MITRE Corporation |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But building automated logic and analysis models have proved difficult since once again, the insider does not attack they use (authorized access by authorized objects). Breaking this "use" and "how they use" out in a system that has low assurance and a low percentage of reconciliation will always cause the system to produce far too many false positives for the method to be acceptable as a true CINDER security solution.

One main tenet of CINDER detection has become that only a system that has high assurance and high reconciliation can be controlled (Owned) to the extent that current and future CINDER actions can be identified, monitored or terminated.

==Ongoing projects to detect CINDER action==

===Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA===
[[DARPA]] has an ongoing '''Cyber Insider Threat''' or '''CINDER''' program to detect insider threats to computer systems. It is under DARPA's Strategic Technology Office (STO).&lt;ref name=fbo1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=16a7be70c7ef8c965da695fe8f0ecb50|title=Broad Agency Announcement Cyber Insider Threat (CINDER)|publisher=[[DARPA]] Strategic Technology Office|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ackerman1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/08/darpas-star-hacker-looks-to-wikileak-proof-the-pentagon/|title=Darpa’s Star Hacker Looks to WikiLeak-Proof Pentagon|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=2010-08-31|accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was timed to begin around 2010/2011.&lt;ref name=infosec1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/12085/darpa-seeks-assistance-with-insider-threats/|title=DARPA seeks assistance with insider threats|publisher=infosecurity-magazine.com|date=2010-08-30|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with traditional [[computer security]], CINDER assumes that malicious insiders already have access to the internal network; thus it attempts to detect a threat's "mission" through analysis of behavior rather than seeking to keep a threat out. The government documentation uses an analogy of the "[[Tell (poker)|tell]]" idea from the card game of [[poker]].&lt;ref name=fbo1 /&gt;

According to Ackerman in Wired, the impetus for the program came after [[WikiLeaks]] disclosures such as the [[Afghan War documents leak]]. [[Robert Gates]]' philosophy of information in the military was to emphasize the access for frontline soldiers. In the face of mass-leaking, the CINDER type of response allows the military to continue that philosophy, rather than simply cutting off access to information en masse.&lt;ref name=ackerman1 /&gt; The project was started by [[Peiter Zatko]], a former member of the [[L0pht]] and [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]] who left DARPA in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google’s Motorola Mobility Taps U.S. Defense Agency for Talent|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-15/google-s-motorola-mobility-taps-u-s-defense-agency-for-talent.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date=15 April 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of Computer Studies''' ('''CCS''') is one of the seven colleges of [[De La Salle University]]. It was established in 1981 as the '''Center for Planning, Information, and Computer Science''' offering only a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Computer Science]]. The department was formally declared as a college in 1984. In 1990, the college was transferred to its new building, the INTELLECT (Information Technology Lecture) Building, which was eventually renamed as the Gokongwei Building. In 1996 the college was granted semi-autonomous status along with the Graduate School of Business which led into the establishment of [[De La Salle-Professional Schools, Inc.]]. The college became a part of De La Salle Professional Schools but later transferred back to the university.

==Accreditation==
The BS Computer Science program of the college was the first Computer Science program in the country to be given accreditation by the [[Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities]] in 1989. It was granted a Level II accreditation in 1993, and was re-accredited to Level II in 1998. In 2000, the college was named as one of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]'s Center of Development and Excellence in [[Information Technology]]. In 2005, the [[Computer Science]] program of the college received a Level III accreditation by PAASCU, becoming the first Level III Accredited Computer Science Program in the Philippines {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. It is the highest accreditation granted in the [[Philippines]] to this date for Computer Science programs. In March 2007, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] recognized the college as Center of Excellence in [[Information Technology]].

==Academic Research Centers==
[[Image:Gox.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gokongwei Hall Administration and Faculty Offices]]

===Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking (AdRIC)===
Formerly known as Advanced Research Institute for Computing (AdRIC), the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking is the research center of the college. The aim of the center is to produce both local and international researches through faculty researchers. The center was established in 1994 to facilitate research directives of the college. It also has its research laboratories on the fourth floor of the Gokongwei Hall. The following are the activities done by the center:
*Symposium on Semantic Web and Ontology
*2nd Natural Language Processing Research Symposium
*Constraint-based Action Planning
*De La Salle University Science and Technology Congress 2005
*[[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|DOST]] Research Proposal Preparation
*Machine Translation Project

===Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)===
The Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET) is a multidisciplinary research and professional laboratory at the College of Computer Studies that investigates the science of complex adaptive systems and explores innovative ways of interacting with computing solutions. Aside from performing research, the center also functions as a development laboratory for the creation of various civic computing solutions, integrating research done internally.

COMET is currently composed of lead researchers, cohorts, and research assistants. The lead researchers come from the fields of computing, statistics, mathematics and physics. The cohorts and research assistants are students from the different programs and specializations under the College of Computer Studies. The research lab also leverages its research in complex adaptive systems and computer-human interaction with the development of civic computing solutions. It also provides avenues for the professional growth of its lead researchers and cohorts.

The lab has three divisions, namely: Complex Systems, Seamless Interactions (Human-Computer Interaction), and Civic Services.

===Consulting and Education Center===
Consulting and Education Center is a continuing non-degree computer training center of the college currently headed by Engr. Jesus Gonzalez. The center provides quality education for both professionals and students. Included in its services are corporate trainings, tutorials, and summer classes catering children, secondary students, and professionals. As an academic center of the college, it also holds seminars and major conferences such as the Emerging Technologies for Philippines 2020 (ETFP) held last April 17–18, 2006 at the New World Renaissance Hotel.

===Cisco Academy Training Center ===
The college is the Cisco Academy Training Center for Expanded Courses (Sponsored Curriculum) or CATC-SC of the country. The center is responsible for conducting trainings on sponsored curriculum courses such as Fundamentals of Unix, Fundamentals of Java, IT Essentials, and Voice and Data Cabling. Under DLSU, trainings for sponsored curriculum courses are categorized into two: instructor and professional trainings.

===Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions (CEHCI)===
The Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions laboratory investigates the problem of multimodal emotion modeling and empathic response modeling to build human-centered design systems. By multimodal, we mean we recognize a human’s emotion based on facial expressions, speech, and movement (such as posture and gait). Because we extend a computing system from a  software to a physical space, novel approaches to providing empathic responses are required.  To achieve this, we  use emotion-based interactions together with sensor-rich, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence.

Currently, we are focused on the development of a self-improving, ambient intelligent empathic space. It is a three-year project funded by the Philippine Government's Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development. It is on its first year with an initial grant of PhP 3,300,000.

For example, the names of [[Class hierarchy|classes, sub-classes]], properties, and restrictions on allowable values.  The classifier determines if the various declarations are logically consistent and if not will highlight the specific inconsistent declarations and the inconsistencies among them. If the declarations are consistent the classifier can then assert additional information based on the input. For example, it can add information about existing classes, create additional classes, etc. This differs from traditional inference engines that trigger off of IF-THEN conditions in rules. Classifiers are also similar to [[Automated theorem proving|theorem provers]] in that they take as input and produce output via [[First Order Logic]]. Classifiers originated with [[KL-ONE]] [[Frame language]]s. They are increasingly significant now that they form a part in the enabling technology of the [[Semantic Web]]. Modern classifiers leverage the [[Web Ontology Language]]. The models they analyze and generate are called [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A classic problem in [[knowledge representation]] for artificial intelligence is the trade off between the expressive power and the computational efficiency of the knowledge representation system. The most powerful form of knowledge representation is First Order Logic (FOL). However, it is not possible to implement knowledge representation that provides the complete expressive power of first order logic. Such a representation will include the capability to represent concepts such as the set of all integers which are impossible to iterate through. Implementing an assertion quantified for an infinite set by definition results in an undecidable non-terminating program. However, the problem is deeper than not being able to implement infinite sets. As Levesque demonstrated, the closer a knowledge representation mechanism comes to FOL, the more likely it is to result in expressions that require infinite or unacceptably large resources to compute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levesque|first=Hector|title=Reading in Knowledge Representation|year=1985|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=0-934613-01-X|page=49|author2=Ronald Brachman |editor=Ronald Brachman and Hector J. Levesque|chapter=A Fundamental Tradeoff in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning|quote=The good news in reducing KR service to theorem proving is that we now have a very clear, very specific notion of what the KR system should do; the bad new is that it is also clear that the services can not be provided... deciding whether or not a sentence in FOL is a theorem... is unsolvable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this trade-off, a great deal of early work on knowledge representation for artificial intelligence involved experimenting with various compromises that provide a subset of FOL with acceptable computation speeds. One of the first and most successful compromises was to develop languages based predominately on [[modus ponens]], i.e. IF-THEN rules. [[Rule-based systems]] were the predominate knowledge representation mechanism for virtually all early [[expert systems]]. Rule-based systems provided acceptable computational efficiency while still providing powerful knowledge representation. Also, rules were highly intuitive to knowledge workers. Indeed, one of the data points that encouraged researchers to develop rule-based knowledge representation was psychological research that humans often represented complex logic via rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|pages=6–7|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the early success of rule-based systems there arose more pervasive use of frame languages instead of or more often combined with rules. Frames provided a more natural way to represent certain types of concepts, especially concepts in subpart or subclass hierarchies. This led to development of a new kind of inference engine known as a classifier. A classifier could analyze a class hierarchy (also known as an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and determine if it was valid. If the hierarchy was invalid the classifier would highlight the inconsistent declarations. For a language to utilize a classifier it required a formal foundation. The first language to successfully demonstrate a classifier was the KL-ONE family of languages. The [[Loom (ontology)|LOOM language]] from ISI was heavily influenced by KL-ONE.  LOOM also was influenced by the rising popularity of object-oriented tools and environments. Loom provided a true object-oriented capability (e.g. message passing) in addition to Frame language capabilities. Classifiers play a significant role in the vision for the next generation Internet known as the Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Language provides a formalism that can be validated and reasoned on via classifiers such as Hermit and Fact++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacGregor|first1=Robert|title=A Descriptive Classifier for the Predicate Calculus|journal=AAAI - 94 Proceedings|date=1994|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1994/AAAI94-033.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotics]], '''denotation''' is the surface or the [[literal and figurative language|literal]] [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. The [[definition]] most likely to appear in a [[dictionary]].

==Discussion ==
Drawing from the original word or definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857-1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
To transmit [[information]], both the addresser and the addressee must use the same [[code (Semiotics)|code]], whether in the literal sense, e.g. [[Morse Code]] or in the form of a [[language]]. The denotative meaning of a signifier is intended to communicate the objective [[semantic]] content of the represented thing. So, in the case of a [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word, say "book", the intention is to do no more than describe the physical object. Any other meanings or implications will be [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings.

The distinction between denotation and connotation can be made in textual analysis and the existence of dictionaries is used to support the argument that the [[sign system]] begins with a simple meaning that is then glossed as new usages are developed. But this argument equally means that no sign can be separated from both its denotational and connotational meanings, and, since the addresser is always using the sign for a particular purpose in a context, no sign can be divorced from the [[value (Semiotics)|values]] of the addresser. [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899-1965) therefore proposes that although the [[grammatical function|function]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] may be a single process, denotation is the first step, and connotation the second. [[Roland Barthes]] (1915-1980) added a third possible step in [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' in which metacognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] such as ''liberty'', ''sexuality'', ''autonomy'', etc. create a framework of reference from which more abstract meanings may be attributed to the signs, depending on the context.

Barthes and others have argued that it is more difficult to make a clear distinction when analysing [[image]]s. For example, how is one to interpret a photograph? In the real world, a human observer has binocular vision, but the two-dimensional picture must be analysed to determine depth and the relative size of objects depicted by applying rules of perspective, the operation of which can be confused by focus and composition. One view might be that the picture as interpreted is evidence of what it depicts and, since the technology collects and stores data from the real world, the resulting picture is a definition of what the camera was pointed at, and so denotational. Adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],  this would be considered an indexical sign,  i.e. there is a direct connection between the signifier and the signified. While it is true that an unedited photograph may be an index, digital technology is eroding the viewer's confidence that the image is an objective representation of reality. Further, the photographer made conscious decisions about the composition of the image, how to light it, whether to take a close-up or long shot, etc. All of these decisions represent both the intention and the values of the photographer in wishing to preserve this image. This led John Fiske to suggest that, "denotation is what is photographed, connotation is how it is photographed". Such problems become even more difficult to resolve once the audience knows that the photograph or moving image has been edited or staged. (See also [[Modality (Semiotics)|modality]])

'''Digital humanities''' ('''DH''') is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of [[computing]] or [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and the disciplines of the [[humanities]]. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the [[humanities]], as well as the reflection on their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/?page_id=13|title=Intro to Digital Humanities: Introduction|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|date=September 2013|website=UCLA Center for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/melissa-terras/DigitalHumanitiesInfographic.pdf|title=Quantifying Digital Humanities|last=Terras|first=Melissa|date=December 2011|website=UCL Centre for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|title=Digital_Humanities|last=Burdick|first=Anne|last2=Drucker|first2=Johanna|last3=Lunenfeld|first3=Peter|last4=Presner|first4=Todd|last5=Schnapp|first5=Jeffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=November 2012|isbn=9780262312097|location=Open Access eBook|quote=|via=|access-date=2016-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026210950/https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously.

==Definition==
The definition of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the field is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hla3uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Digital+Humanities+in+practice|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|first3=Julianne|date=2012-10-09|publisher=Facet Publishing|isbn=9781856047661|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' (2016) acknowledges the difficulty in defining the field: "Along with the digital archives, quantitative analyses, and tool-building projects that once characterized the field, DH now encompasses a wide range of methods and practices: visualizations of large image sets, 3D modeling of historical artifacts, 'born digital' dissertations, [[hashtag activism]] and the analysis thereof, [[alternate reality game]]s, mobile makerspaces, and more. In what has been called 'big tent' DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/2|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the digital humanities developed out of humanities computing and has become associated with other fields, such as humanistic computing, social computing, and media studies. In concrete terms, the digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections of primary sources (primarily textual) to the [[data mining]] of large cultural data sets to [[topic modeling]]. Digital humanities incorporates both digitized (remediated) and [[born-digital]] materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[art]], [[archaeology]], [[music]], and [[cultural studies]]) and social sciences,&lt;ref name="digital-humanities-network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Humanities Network|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.cam.ac.uk/|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tools provided by [[computing]] (such as [[hypertext]], [[hypermedia]], [[data visualisation]], [[information retrieval]], data mining, [[statistics]], [[text mining]], [[digital mapping]]), and [[electronic publication|digital publishing]]. Related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like [[software studies]], platform studies, and [[critical code studies]]. Fields that parallel the digital humanities include [[new media studies]] and [[information science]] as well as [[media theory of composition]], [[game studies]], particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production, and [[cultural analytics]].

[[File:Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord 2017- 18).jpg|thumb|The Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord, ''Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age'')]]

Berry and Fagerjord have suggested that a way to reconceptualise digital humanities could be through a "digital humanities stack". They argue that "this type of diagram is common in computation and computer science to show how technologies are ‘stacked’ on top of each other in increasing levels of abstraction. Here, [they] use the method in a more illustrative and creative sense of showing the range of activities, practices, skills, technologies and structures that could be said to make up the digital humanities, with the aim of providing a high-level map."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the "diagram can be read as the bottom levels indicating some of the fundamental elements of the digital humanities stack, such as computational thinking and knowledge representation, and then other elements that later build on these.

==History==

Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to the 1930s and1940s in the pioneering work of English professor [[Josephine Miles]] and Jesuit scholar [[Roberto Busa]] and the women they employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Laura|last2=Sagner Buurma|first2=Rachel|date=2018-04-11|title=Search and Replace: Josephine Miles and the Origins of Distant Reading|url=https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace|journal=Modernism / Modernity Print+|volume=3|issue=1|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svensson&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1938-4122| volume = 3| issue = 3| last = Svensson| first = Patrik| title = Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities| journal = Digital Humanities Quarterly| accessdate = 2012-05-30| year = 2009| url = http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000065/000065.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hockney&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Blackwell| isbn = 1405103213| editors = Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth (eds.)| last = Hockney| first = Susan| title = Companion to Digital Humanities| chapter = The History of Humanities Computing| location = Oxford| series = Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture| year = 2004| url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-2-1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-2-1&amp;brand=9781405103213_brand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[IBM]], they created a computer-generated concordance to [[Thomas Aquinas]]' writings known as the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster than processing information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor=20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Polity| isbn = 978-0-7456-9765-9 | last1 = Berry| first1 = David M. | last2 = Fagerjord| first2 = Anders | title = Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age | location = Cambridge | year = 2017 | url=http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745697658,subjectCd-CO30.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tara McPherson has pointed out, the digital humanities also inherit practices and perspectives developed through many artistic and theoretical engagements with electronic screen culture beginning the late 1960s and 1970s. These range from research developed by organizations such as [[SIGGRAPH]] to creations by artists such as [[Charles and Ray Eames]] and the members of [[Experiments in Art and Technology|E.A.T.]] (Experiments in Art and Technology). The Eames and E.A.T. explored nascent computer culture and intermediality in creative works that dovetailed technological innovation with art.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Tara. "DH by Design: Feminism, aesthetics + the digital.” Congress of the Social Science and Humanities. University of Calgary, 2016-05-31. Keynote.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first specialized journal in the digital humanities was ''Computers and the Humanities'', which debuted in 1966. The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) were then founded in 1977 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Soon, there was a need for a standardized protocol for tagging digital texts, and the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) was developed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The TEI project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the ''TEI Guidelines'' in May 1994.&lt;ref name=hockney /&gt; TEI helped shape the field of electronic textual scholarship and led to [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML), which is a tag scheme for digital editing. Researchers also began experimenting with databases and hypertextual editing, which are structured around links and nodes, as opposed to the standard linear convention of print.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the ''[[Women Writers Project]]'', the ''[http://www.rossettiarchive.org/ Rossetti Archive]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, University of Virginia| editor = Jerome J. McGann | title = Rossetti Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.rossettiarchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The William Blake Archive]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| title = The William Blake Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0093-1896| volume = 31| issue = 1| pages = 49–84| last = Liu| first = Alan| title = Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse| journal = Critical Inquiry| year = 2004| jstor = 10.1086/427302| doi=10.1086/427302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of personal computing and the World Wide Web meant that Digital Humanities work could become less centered on text and more on design. The multimedia nature of the internet has allowed Digital Humanities work to incorporate audio, video, and other components in addition to text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The terminological change from "humanities computing" to "digital humanities" has been attributed to [[John Unsworth]], Susan Schreibman, and Ray Siemens who, as editors of the anthology ''A Companion to Digital Humanities'' (2004), tried to prevent the field from being viewed as "mere digitization."&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Fitzpatrick| first = Kathleen| title = The humanities, done digitally| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2011-07-10| date = 2011-05-08| url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Humanities-Done-Digitally/127382/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the hybrid term has created an overlap between fields like rhetoric and composition, which use "the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects,"&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"/&gt; and digital humanities, which uses "digital technology in studying traditional humanities objects".&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick" /&gt; The use of computational systems and the study of computational media within the arts and humanities more generally has been termed the 'computational turn'.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Berry| first = David| title = The Computational Turn: Thinking About the Digital Humanities| work = Culture Machine| accessdate = 2012-01-31| date = 2011-06-01| url = http://culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewDownloadInterstitial/440/470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) launched the Digital Humanities Initiative (renamed Office of Digital Humanities in 2008), which made widespread adoption of the term "digital humanities" all but irreversible in the United States.&lt;ref name="kirschenbaum-dept" /&gt;

== Values and methods ==
Although digital humanities projects and initiatives are diverse, they often reflect common values and methods.&lt;ref name="Northwestern University Library"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Honn|first1=Josh|title=A Guide to Digital Humanities: Values Methods|url=http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2015|publisher=Northwestern University Library|accessdate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can help in understanding this hard-to-define field.&lt;ref&gt;Find accessible, brief descriptions of each at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/ A Guide to Digital Humanities archived site].&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the value of being open and accessible, many digital humanities projects and journals are [[open access]] and/or under Creative Commons licensing, showing the field's "commitment to [[open standards]] and [[open source]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities|last=Bradley|first=John|publisher=Ashgate|year=2012|isbn=9781409410683|editors=Marilyn Deegan and Willard McCarty (eds.)|location=Farnham and Burlington|pages=11–26 [14]|chapter=No job for techies: Technical contributions to research in digital humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open access is designed to enable anyone with an internet-enabled device and internet connection to view a website or read an article without having to pay, as well as share content with the appropriate permissions.

Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars,&lt;ref name="neh-odh-grant-opportunities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Grant|title=Grant Opportunities|work=National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities Grant Opportunities|accessdate=25 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is done in contemporary empirical [[social sciences]]. Yet despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in [[media studies]], [[information studies]], [[communication studies]], and [[sociology]]. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship that transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of [[multimedia]], [[metadata]], and dynamic environments (see [[The Valley of the Shadow]] project at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular]] at [[University of Southern California]], or Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pioneers.darthcrimson.org/|title=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing - Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing|website=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the [[Google Books]] corpus.&lt;ref name="Roth 2014"&gt;Roth, S. (2014), "Fashionable functions. A Google n-gram view of trends in functional differentiation (1800-2000)", ''International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction'', Band 10, Nr. 2, S. 34-58 (online: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2491422).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such projects were highlighted by the Humanities High Performance Computing competition sponsored by the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/grant-announcement-humanities-high-performance-computing-program|title=Grant Announcement for Humanities High Performance Computing Program|last=Bobley|first=Brett|date=December 1, 2008|work=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the Digging Into Data challenge organized in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/tabid/175/Default.aspx|title=Awardees of 2009 Digging into Data Challenge|work=Digging into Data|year=2009|accessdate=May 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517011354/http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/tabid/175/Default.aspx|archivedate=May 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2012-01-03|title=NEH Announces Winners of 2011 Digging Into Data Challenge|date=January 3, 2012|work=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by NEH in collaboration with NSF,&lt;ref name="cohen-embrace"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/arts/17digital.html?pagewanted=all|title=Humanities Scholars Embrace Digital Technology|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=2010-11-16|work=The New York Times|location=New York|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in partnership with [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] in the UK, and [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|SSHRC]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub151|title=Computationally Intensive Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences: A Report on the Experiences of First Respondents to the Digging Into Data Challenge|last=Williford|first=Christa|date=June 2012|work=Council on Library and Information Resources|last2=Henry|first2=Charles|ISBN=978-1-932326-40-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to books, historical newspapers can also be analyzed with big data methods.

Digital humanities is also involved in the creation of software, providing "environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is 'born digital' and lives in various digital contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cnx.org/content/m34246/latest/|title=Digital Humanities 2.0: A Report on Knowledge|last=Presner|first=Todd|work=Connexions|year=2010|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the field is sometimes known as computational humanities.[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Tools ==
Digital humanities scholars use a variety of digital tools for their research, which may take place in an environment as small as a mobile device or as large as a [[virtual reality]] lab. Environments for "creating, publishing and working with digital scholarship include everything from personal equipment to institutes and software to cyberspace."&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Eileen and Ronald G. Musto. (2015). [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/general/digital-humanities-primer-students-and-scholars?format=PB ''The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars.''] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars use advanced programming languages and databases, while others use less complex tools, depending on their needs. DiRT (Digital Research Tools Directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dirtdirectory.org/|title=Welcome // - DiRT Directory|website=dirtdirectory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) offers a registry of digital research tools for scholars. TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170929202656/http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-09-29|title=TAPoR|website=tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a gateway to text analysis and retrieval tools. An accessible, free example of an online textual analysis program is [[Voyant Tools]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyant-tools.org/|title=Voyant Tools|website=voyant-tools.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only requires the user to copy and paste either a body of text or a URL and then click the 'reveal' button to run the program. There is also an online list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital|title=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding [licensed for non-commercial use only] / Digital Humanities Tools|website=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of online or downloadable Digital Humanities tools that are largely free, aimed toward helping students and others who lack access to funding or institutional servers. Free, open source web publishing platforms like [[WordPress]] and [[Omeka]] are also popular tools. [[File:Poemage.png|thumb|300px|Example of a visualization tool used to study poetry in a new way with [http://www.sci.utah.edu/~nmccurdy/Poemage/ Poemage] ]]

== Projects ==
Digital humanities projects are more likely than traditional humanities work to involve a team or a lab, which may be composed of faculty, staff, graduate or undergraduate students, information technology specialists, and partners in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Credit and authorship are often given to multiple people to reflect this collaborative nature, which is different from the sole authorship model in the traditional humanities (and more like the natural sciences).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are thousands of digital humanities projects, ranging from small-scale ones with limited or no funding to large-scale ones with multi-year financial support. Some are continually updated while others may not be due to loss of support or interest, though they may still remain online in either a [[beta version]] or a finished form. The following are a few examples of the variety of projects in the field:&lt;ref&gt;See [https://wiki.commons.gc.cuny.edu/Sample_Projects/ CUNY Academic Commons Wiki Archive] for more.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital archives===

The [[Women Writers Project]] (begun in 1988) is a long-term research project to make pre-Victorian women writers more accessible through an electronic collection of rare texts. The Walt Whitman Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/|title=The Walt Whitman Archive|website=www.whitmanarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (begun in the 1990s) sought to create a hypertext and scholarly edition of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]]’s works and now includes photographs, sounds, and the only comprehensive current bibliography of Whitman criticism. The Emily Dickinson Archive (begun in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/dickinson/|title=Emily Dickinson, From Fascicle to Open Access {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|access-date=2016-12-26}}. See [http://www.edickinson.org/ Emily Dickinson Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of high-resolution images of [[Emily Dickinson|Dickinson]]’s poetry manuscripts as well as a searchable lexicon of over 9,000 words that appear in the poems. [[File:Humanités Numériques.JPG|thumb|300px|Example of [[social network analysis|network analysis]] as an archival tool at the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

The Slave Societies Digital Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/esss/|title=Homepage|website=Slave Societies Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies), directed by Jane Landers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/jane-landers/|title=People|website=Department of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted at Vanderbilt University, preserves endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and African-descended peoples in slave societies. This Digital Archive currently holds 500,000 unique images, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, and documents the history of between 6 and 8 million individuals. They are the most extensive serial records for the history of Africans in the Atlantic World and also include valuable information on the indigenous, European, and Asian populations who lived alongside them. 

The involvement of librarians and archivists plays an important part in digital humanities projects because of the recent expansion of their role so that it now covers [[digital curation]], which is critical in the preservation, promotion, and access to digital collections, as well as the application of scholarly orientation to digital humanities projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities: Preserving and Promoting Archival and Special Collections|last=Sabharwal|first=Arjun|publisher=Elsevier|year=2015|isbn=9780081001431|location=Waltham, MA|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example involves the case of initiatives where archivists help scholars and academics build their projects through their experience in evaluating, implementing, and customizing metadata schemas for library collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Supporting Digital Humanities for Knowledge Acquisition in Modern Libraries|last=Sacco|first=Kathleen|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466684447|location=Hershey, PA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiatives at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] is another example of a digital humanities project. These include the digitization of 17th-century manuscripts, an electronic corpus of Mexican history from the 16th to 19th century, and the visualization of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in [[3D computer graphics|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|publisher=Facet Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781856047661|location=London|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cultural analytics===

"Cultural analytics" refers to the use of computational method for exploration and analysis of large visual collections and also contemporary digital media. The concept was developed in 2005 by [[Lev Manovich]] who then established the Cultural Analytics Lab in 2007 at Qualcomm Institute at California Institute for Telecommunication and Information (Calit2). The lab has been using methods from the field of computer science called Computer Vision many types of both historical and contemporary visual media—for example, all covers of ''Time'' magazine published between 1923 and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/timeline-4535-time-magazine-covers-1923.html|title=Timeline: 4535 Time Magazine Covers, 1923-2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20,000 historical art photographs from the collection in Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/exploratory-visualizations-of-thomas.html|title=A View from Above: Exploratory Visualizations of MoMA Photography Collection|last=|first=|authorlink=Nadav Hochman and Lev Manovich|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one million pages from Manga books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2010/11/one-million-manga-pages_14.html|title=Exploring One Million Manga Pages with Supercomputers and HIPerSpace|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 million images shared on Instagram in 17 global cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/instagram-and-contemporary-image|title=Instagram and Contemporary Image|last=Manovich|first=Lev|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural analytics also includes using methods from media design and data visualization to create interactive visual interfaces for exploration of large visual collections e.g., Selfiecity and On Broadway.

Cultural Analytics research is also addressing a number of theoretical questions. How can we "observe" giant cultural universes of both user-generated and professional media content created today, without reducing them to averages, outliers, or pre-existing categories? How can work with large cultural data help us question our stereotypes and assumptions about cultures? What new theoretical cultural concepts and models are required for studying global digital culture with its new mega-scale, speed, and connectivity? 

The term “cultural analytics” (or “culture analytics”) is now used by many other researchers, as exemplified by two academic symposiums,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/events/uc/cultural_analytics/ Cultural Analytics: Computational Approaches to the Study of Culture],” the University of Chicago, May 2015 and “[https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/ca2017/home Cultural Analytics symposium],” Notre Dame University, May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a four-month long research program at UCLA that brought together 120 leading researchers from university and industry labs,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/culture-analytics/ Culture Analytics program],” Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA, March 7–June 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; an academic peer-review ''Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA'' established in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalanalytics.org/about/|title=Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic job listings.

===Textual mining, analysis, and visualization===

WordHoard (begun in 2004) is a free application that enables scholarly but non-technical users to read and analyze, in new ways, deeply-tagged texts, including the canon of Early Greek epic, [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. The Republic of Letters (begun in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/novemberdecember/feature/mapping-the-republic-letters|title=Mapping the Republic of Letters|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to visualize the social network of Enlightenment writers through an interactive map and visualization tools. Network analysis and data visualization is also used for reflections on the field itself – researchers may produce network maps of social media interactions or infographics from data on digital humanities scholars and projects.[[File:Digital Humanities on Twitter.png|thumb|Network analysis: graph of Digital Humanities Twitter users]]

A 2017 study&lt;ref name="Lansdall-Welfare 201606380"/&gt; published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] compared the trajectory of n-grams over time in both digitised books from the 2010 [[Science (journal)|Science]] article&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt; with those found in a large corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom over the course of 150 years. The study further went on to use more advanced [[Natural language processing]] techniques to discover macroscopic trends in history and culture, including gender bias, geographical focus, technology, and politics, along with accurate dates for specific events.

===Online publishing===

The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (begun in 1995) is a dynamic reference work of terms, concepts, and people from philosophy maintained by scholars in the field. [https://mla.hcommons.org/ MLA Commons] offers an open peer-review site (where anyone can comment) for their ongoing curated collection of teaching artifacts in ''[https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/ Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments]'' (2016). The ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' platform contains volumes of the open-access book of the same title (2012 and 2016 editions) and allows readers to interact with material by marking sentences as interesting or adding terms to a crowdsourced index.

==Criticism==
Lauren F. Klein and Matthew K. Gold have identified a range of criticisms in the digital humanities field: "'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities".&lt;ref name="dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Berry and Fagerjord have argued that a digital humanities should "focus on the need to think critically about the implications of computational imaginaries, and raise some questions in this regard. This is also to foreground the importance of the politics and norms that are embedded in digital technology, algorithms and software. We need to explore how to negotiate between close and distant readings of texts and how micro-analysis and macro-analysis can be usefully reconciled in humanist work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Liu has argued, "while digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically, therefore (e.g., debating the ‘ordered hierarchy of content objects’ principle; disputing whether computation is best used for truth finding or, as Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann put it, ‘deformance’; and so on) rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these concerns have given rise to the emergent subfield of Critical Digital Humanities (CDH): &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some key questions include: how do we make the invisible become visible in the study of software? How is knowledge transformed when mediated through code and software? What are the critical approaches to Big Data, visualization, digital methods, etc.? How does computation create new disciplinary boundaries and gate-keeping functions? What are the new hegemonic representations of the digital – ‘geons’, ‘pixels’, ‘waves’, visualization, visual rhetorics, etc.? How do media changes create epistemic changes, and how can we look behind the ‘screen essentialism’ of computational interfaces? Here we might also reflect on the way in which the practice of making- visible also entails the making-invisible – computation involves making choices about what is to be captured. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Negative publicity===

Klein and Gold note that many appearances of the digital humanities in public media are often in a critical fashion. Armand Leroi, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', discusses the contrast between the algorithmic analysis of themes in literary texts and the work of Harold Bloom, who qualitatively and phenomenologically analyzes the themes of literature over time. Leroi questions whether or not the digital humanities can provide a truly robust analysis of literature and social phenomenon or offer a novel alternative perspective on them. The literary theorist [[Stanley Fish]] claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of "pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power."&lt;ref name="fish-mortality"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/|title=The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality|last=Fish|first=Stanley|date=2012-01-09|work=The New York Times|location=New York|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, digital humanities scholars note that "Digital Humanities is an extension of traditional knowledge skills and methods, not a replacement for them. Its distinctive contributions do not obliterate the insights of the past, but add and supplement the humanities' long-standing commitment to scholarly interpretation, informed research, structured argument, and dialogue within communities of practice".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some have hailed the digital humanities as a solution to the apparent problems within the humanities, namely a decline in funding, a repeat of debates, and a fading set of theoretical claims and methodological arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leroi|first1=Armand|title=Digitizing the Humanities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/opinion/digitizing-the-humanities.html|website=The New York Times Online|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Kirsch, writing in the ''New Republic'', calls this the "False Promise" of the digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsch|first1=Adam|title=Technology Is Taking Over English Departments|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch|website=The New Republic|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the rest of humanities and many social science departments are seeing a decline in funding or prestige, the digital humanities has been seeing increasing funding and prestige.  Burdened with the problems of novelty, the digital humanities is discussed as either a revolutionary alternative to the humanities as it is usually conceived or as simply new wine in old bottles. Kirsch believes that digital humanities practitioners suffer from problems of being marketers rather than scholars, who attest to the grand capacity of their research more than actually performing new analysis and when they do so, only performing trivial parlor tricks of research. This form of criticism has been repeated by others, such as in Carl Staumshein, writing in ''Inside Higher Education'', who calls it a "Digital Humanities Bubble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities Bubble|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/08/digital-humanities-wont-save-humanities-digital-humanists-say|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same publication, Straumshein alleges that the digital humanities is a 'Corporatist Restructuring' of the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities as 'Corporatist Restructuring'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/06/article-criticizes-impact-digital-humanities-colleges|website=Inside Higher Education|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the alliance of the digital humanities with business to be a positive turn that causes the business world to pay more attention, thus bringing needed funding and attention to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Tracy|title=Humanities and business go hand in hand|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/04/24/humanities-and-business-hand-hand/9nG9n04SSF1Ko0MRJjguxK/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were not burdened by the title of digital humanities, it could escape the allegations that it is elitist and unfairly funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pannapacker|first1=William|title=Stop Calling It 'Digital Humanities'|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Calling-It-Digital/137325/|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black box===

There has also been critique of the use of digital humanities tools by scholars who do not fully understand what happens to the data they input and place too much trust in the "black box" of software that cannot be sufficiently examined for errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dobson|first=James E.|title=Can an Algorithm be Disturbed? Machine Learning, Intrinsic Criticism, and the Digital Humanities|year=2015|periodical=College Literature |volume=42|issue=4 |pages= 543–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johanna Drucker]], a professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Department of Information Studies, has criticized the "epistemological fallacies" prevalent in popular visualization tools and technologies (such as [[Google]]'s n-gram graph) used by digital humanities scholars and the general public, calling some network diagramming and topic modeling tools "just too crude for humanistic work."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/140307034|title=Johanna Drucker (UCLA) Lecture, "Should Humanists Visualize Knowledge?"|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of transparency in these programs obscures the subjective nature of the data and its processing, she argues, as these programs "generate standard diagrams based on conventional algorithms for screen display...mak[ing] it very difficult for the semantics of the data processing to be made evident."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt;

===Diversity===

There has also been some recent controversy among practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of [[Unix|UNIX]] and computers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|title=Open Thread: The Digital Humanities as a Historical "Refuge" from Race/Class/Gender/Sexuality/Disability?|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021953/http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson posits that there needs to be an understanding and theorizing of the implications of digital technology and race, even when the subject for analysis appears not to be about race.

Amy E. Earhart criticizes what has become the new digital humanities "canon" in the shift from websites using simple [[HTML]] to the usage of the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] and visuals in textual recovery projects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/16|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Works that has been previously lost or excluded were afforded a new home on the internet, but much of the same marginalizing practices found in traditional humanities also took place digitally. According to Earhart, there is a "need to examine the canon that we, as digital humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward traditional texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Issues of access===

Practitioners in digital humanities are also failing to meet the needs of users with disabilities. George H. Williams argues that universal design is imperative for practitioners to increase usability because "many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources are useless for people who are—for example—deaf or hard of hearing, as well as for people who are blind, have low vision, or have difficulty distinguishing particular colors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44|title=Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities|work=Debates in the Digital Humanities |author=George H. Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide accessibility successfully, and productive universal design, it is important to understand why and how users with disabilities are using the digital resources while remembering that all users approach their informational needs differently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Cultural criticism===

Digital humanities have been criticized for not only ignoring traditional questions of lineage and history in the humanities, but lacking the fundamental cultural criticism that defines the humanities. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the humanities have to be tied to cultural criticism, per se, in order to be the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord/&gt; The sciences{{vague|date=June 2017}} might imagine the Digital Humanities as a welcome improvement over the non-quantitative methods of the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Poetry in Motion'|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474420b.html|website=Nature|publisher=Nature|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirschenbaum|first1=Matthew|url=https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dhterriblethingskirschenbaum.pdf|website=Wordpress|publisher=Matthew Kirschenbaum|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=What Is "Digital Humanities," and Why Are They Saying Such Terrible Things about It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty of evaluation===

As the field matures, there has been a recognition that the standard model of academic peer-review of work may not be adequate for digital humanities projects, which often involve website components, databases, and other non-print objects. Evaluation of quality and impact thus require a combination of old and new methods of peer review.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One response has been the creation of the ''DHCommons Journal''. This accepts non-traditional submissions, especially mid-stage digital projects, and provides an innovative model of peer review more suited for the multimedia, transdisciplinary, and milestone-driven nature of Digital Humanities projects. Other professional humanities organizations, such as the [[American Historical Association]] and the [[Modern Language Association]], have developed guidelines for evaluating academic digital scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media|title=Guidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and Digital...|website=Modern Language Association|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians|title=Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of focus on pedagogy===

The 2012 edition of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' recognized the fact that pedagogy was the “neglected ‘stepchild’ of DH” and included an entire section on teaching the digital humanities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Part of the reason is that grants in the humanities are geared more toward research with quantifiable results rather than teaching innovations, which are harder to measure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In recognition of a need for more scholarship on the area of teaching, ''Digital Humanities Pedagogy'' was published and offered case studies and strategies to address how to teach digital humanities methods in various disciplines.

==Organizations==

The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) is an umbrella organization that supports digital research and teaching as a consultative and advisory force for its constituent organizations. Its governance was approved in 2005 and it has overseen the annual [[Digital Humanities conference]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adho.org/about|title=About {{!}} ADHO|website=adho.org|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current members of ADHO are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Dissociated press''' is a [[parody generator]] (a [[computer program]] that generates [[nonsense|nonsensical]] text). The generated text is based on another text using the [[Markov chain]] technique. The name is a play on "[[Associated Press]]".

An implementation of the algorithm is available in [[Emacs]]. Another implementation is available as a [[Perl]] module in [[CPAN]], [https://metacpan.org/module/Games::Dissociate Games::Dissociate].&lt;ref name="burke_and_finkel"&gt;[[Sean M. Burke|Burke, Sean M.]] and Avi Finkel. [https://metacpan.org/module/Games::Dissociate Games::Dissociate distribution in CPAN]. Retrieved 2012-11-13. Most recent release: 2010, "v1.0".&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==
The algorithm starts by printing a number of consecutive words (or letters) from the source text. Then it searches the source text for an occurrence of the few last words or letters printed out so far. If multiple occurrences are found, it picks a random one, and proceeds with printing the text following the chosen occurrence. After a predetermined length of text was printed out, the search procedure is repeated for the newly printed ending.

Considering that words and phrases tend to appear in specific grammatical contexts, the resulting text usually seems correct grammatically, and if the source text is uniform in style, the result appears to be of similar style and subject, and takes some effort on the reader's side to recognize as not genuine. Still, the randomness of the assembly process deprives it of any logical flow - the loosely related parts are connected in a nonsensical way, creating a humorously abstract, random result.

==Examples==
Here is a short example of word-based Dissociated Press applied to the [[Jargon File]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/Dissociated-Press.html |title=Dissociated Press |accessdate=2007-04-10 |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |date=2003-12-29 |work=Jargon File 4.4.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:wart: n. A small, crocky feature that sticks out of an array (C has no checks for this). This is relatively benign and easy to spot if the phrase is bent so as to be not worth paying attention to the medium in question.

Here is a short example of letter-based Dissociated Press applied to the same source:
:window sysIWYG: n. A bit was named aften /bee´t@/ prefer to use the other guy's re, especially in every cast a chuckle on neithout getting into useful informash speech makes removing a featuring a move or usage actual abstractionsidered interj. Indeed spectace logic or problem!

==History==
The dissociated press algorithm is described in [[HAKMEM]] (1972) Item #176. The name "dissociated press" is first known to have been associated with the Emacs implementation.

Brian Hayes discussed a Travesty algorithm in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in November 1983.{{r|byte198411}} The article provided a garbled [[William Faulkner]] passage:
{{quote|When he got on the table, he come in. He never come out of my own pocket as a measure of protecting the company against riot and bloodshed. And when he said. "You tell me a bus ticket, let alone write out no case histories. Then the law come back with a knife!"}}

Hugh Kenner and Joseph O'Rourke of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] discussed their [[frequency table]]-based Travesty generator for microcomputers in ''[[BYTE]]'' in November 1984. The article included the [[Turbo Pascal]] source for two versions of the generator, one using Hayes' algorithm and another using [[Claude Shannon]]'s Hellbat algorithm.&lt;ref name="byte198411"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-11/1984_11_BYTE_09-12_New_Chips#page/n129/mode/2up |title=A Travesty Generator for Micros |work=BYTE |date=November 1984 |accessdate=23 October 2013 |author1=Kenner, Hugh |author2=O'Rourke, Joseph |pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Lesser offered a [[compiled BASIC]] version in the magazine in July 1985,&lt;ref name="lesser198507"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-07/1985_07_BYTE_10-07_Computers_and_Space#page/n183/mode/2up |title=Travesty Revisited |work=BYTE |date=July 1985 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |author=Lesser, Murray |pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1985 Peter Wayner offered a version that used [[tree data structure]]s instead of frequency tables,&lt;ref name="wayner198509"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n165/mode/2up |title=Build a Travesty Tree |work=BYTE |date=September 1985 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |author=Wayner, Peter |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 1985 Neil J. Rubenking offered a version written in [[Turbo Pascal]] that stored frequency information in a [[B-tree]].&lt;ref name="rubenking198512"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-12/1985_12_BYTE_10-13_Computer_Conferencing#page/n133/mode/2up |title=Travesty with Database |work=BYTE |date=December 1985 |accessdate=28 October 2013 |author=Rubenking, Neil J. |pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Egyptian Petroleum Research Institution''' ('''EPRI''') is a governmental organization in [[Egypt]] founded by the [[decree | presidential decree]] 541 in 1974. It is under the umbrella of the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology, to help advance the development of studies and applications within the oil sector, and to find solutions to both long and short term technical problems.

To effectively carry out this role the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Egypt)|Ministry of petroleum]] is authorized for up to 50% of the EPRI's board of director shares; the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and Development is the head of the EPRI board, other members who are appointed by him to support and back the EPRI mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epri.sci.eg/Default2.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China."

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of "vital'' qi''". Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital'' qi'' by appropriate siting of graves and structures.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"/&gt; Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/arts/200908/t20090810_1079619.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|work=stnn.cc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 房山金陵探寻_秦关汉土征未还_洪峰_博联社] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181644/http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_01/11/293453_77.shtml|title=凤凰网读书频道|work=ifeng.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html 蒋介石挖毛泽东祖坟的玄机] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620232203/http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |title=丧心病狂中国历史上六宗罕见的辱尸事 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061329/http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |archive-date=2007-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Cody. Striking a Harmonious Chord: Foreign Missionaries and Chinese-style Buildings, 1911–1949. ''Architronic''. 5:3 (ISSN 1066-6516)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M. Holson, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/business/worldbusiness/the-feng-shui-kingdom.html "The Feng Shui Kingdom"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studia Geophysica Et Geodaetica, 55(1), 159–74. {{doi|10.1007/s11200-011-0009-2}}. Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the exclamation attributed to Archimedes|Eureka (word)}}
'''Heureka''' is a Finnish [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], north of [[Helsinki]], designed by [[Heikkinen – Komonen Architects]]. The aim of the science centre, which opened its doors to the public in 1989, is to popularize scientific information and to develop the methods used to teach science and scientific concepts. The name ‘Heureka’ (eureka in English) refers to the Greek exclamation, presumably uttered by Archimedes, to mean “I’ve found it!” (made a discovery). The Science Centre Heureka features both indoor and outdoor interactive exhibitions with exhibits that enable visitors to independently test different concepts and ideas. There is also a digital planetarium with 135 seats.

The Heureka Science Centre is a non-profit organization run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation. The Finnish Science Centre Foundation is a broadly based co-operation organization that includes the Finnish scientific community, education sector, trade and industry, and national and local government. The ten background organisations of the Foundation support, develop and actively participate in the activities of Heureka. The foundation’s highest body is the Board of Trustees, whose decisions are implemented by the Governing Board. Everyday activities are the responsibility of Heureka’s Director assisted by a management team and other staff.

==History==
[[File:Vantaa-heureka.jpg|thumb|320px|The Heureka science center]]
The roots of the Finnish Science Centre Heureka can be traced back to the University of Helsinki and scientists, who had become acquainted with different science centres located around the world. The initial spark was lit by Adjunct Professors Tapio Markkanen, Hannu I. Miettinen and Heikki Oja. It all began with the Physics 82 exhibition held at the [[House of the Estates]] in Helsinki on 20–26 May 1982. During autumn of that same year, the science centre project was launched with the initial support of the Academy of Finland, the Ministry of Education, and various foundations. The project led to the establishment of the Finnish Science Centre Foundation during 1983-1984. The original founding members of the foundation included the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology, the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries.

In 1984, the City of Vantaa offered to be the host city and partial financier for the Science Centre, and also designated a property lot located in the southern end of Tikkurila as the future site of the centre. An architectural competition, held in 1985, turned out two first prizes from which the winning design was selected; namely the “Heureka” design submitted by Mikko Heikkinen, Markku Komonen and Lauri Anttila. That's how the Finnish Science Centre Heureka got its apt name!
Before the building was completed, a number of test exhibitions were set up at other sites. The interior plan for the Science Centre was completed in 1986. The foundation for the building was laid in October 1987, and the construction work was completed one year later. The overall area of the building is 8,200 m2, of which 2,800 m2 is exhibition space. The Finnish Science Centre Heureka opened its doors to the public on 28 April 1989.

==Exhibitions and planetarium==
[[File:Cubes at Heureka, optical illusion.jpg|thumb|The symbol of Heureka, ''Neljä kuutiota'' ("Four cubes"), is an optical illusion appearing to be a group of cubes]]

===Interior of the building===

The main exhibition hall houses about 200 exhibits related to different fields of science. The main exhibition was renewed completely in 1999, but there are small changes taking place in the main exhibition hall each year as well. The topics include, for example, digestion and the functions of the intestines, the production of money and traffic. The exhibition ‘The Wind in the Bowels’ has been designed in co-operation with the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim.  The exhibition ‘About a Coin’ was implemented through collaboration with the Mint of Finland to mark the company’s 150th anniversary.

As an extension of the main exhibition, the Heureka Classics exhibition was opened in 2009 in honour of Heureka’s 20th anniversary. From the beginning of August 2009, Heureka has also had the Science on a Sphere exhibit on display. 

In addition to the main exhibition, Heureka generally also houses two temporary exhibitions. The topics of past temporary exhibitions have included, for example, dinosaurs, humans, sports, forests, the art of film, flying and ancient cultures. Since Heureka’s opening, the most successful exhibitions have been the dinosaur exhibitions. The 2001 exhibition about the family life of dinosaurs, for example, attracted 406,000 visitors. Many of the exhibitions independently produced by Heureka have made guest appearances in numerous science centres all over the world. Heureka also features exhibitions imported from abroad.

===Outdoor areas===

Heureka’s outdoor exhibition area, Science Park Galilei, opened in 2002. This area of the centre can be visited annually during the summer season. Galilei is a sort of “scientific playground”. The 7,500 m2 area holds dozens of exhibits, many of which feature water as the primary element. The exhibits are based on mathematical, physical and musical phenomena. The outdoor park also contains moving works of art, such as the sand plotter created by well-known Finnish artist Osmo Valtonen. Galilei also features an arboretum with species of conifers from the northern hemisphere.

The area in front of Heureka features a permanent bedrock exhibition, which contains both common and rare types of rocks found in Finland’s bedrock. The rocks are situated to reflect their distribution throughout different geographical provinces of Finland. Leading up to the front entrance, visitors are also greeted by perennial gardens that were planted in accordance with the historical classification system designed by Carolus Linnaeus. The front of the entrance is tiled in [[Penrose tiling]].

===Heureka’s planetarium===

The hemispheric-shaped planetarium primarily presents films dealing with astronomy. Until 2007, the theatre was called the Verne Theatre, and it ran super films and multimedia programmes made with special slide projectors that took advantage of the entire 500 m2 surface of the hemispheric screen. At the end of 2007, the theatre was entirely renovated, and reopened on 26 December 2007 as one of Europe’s most modern digital planetariums. There are altogether 135 seats in Heureka’s planetarium.

===Other daily programmes===

In addition to the exhibitions and planetarium films, Heureka also offers the opportunity to view daily science theatre shows, to participate in supervised programmes and to watch Rat Basketball games. Furthermore, a number of other individual events, such as Science Days, science holidays and science camps in the summer are organised at Heureka. Public lectures with different themes are also regularly held in Heureka’s auditorium. Public lectures are given in the planetarium as well. Other services at Heureka include a science shop and a restaurant, as well as conference facilities and a 220-seat auditorium for meetings.

==Facts about Heureka==

===Visitors===

From 1989 to 2011, an average of about 280,000 people has visited Heureka each year. The total number of visitors exceeded six million in May 2010. Altogether more than 22 million people have viewed Heureka’s exhibitions on display both in Finland and abroad.
Of the average 280,000 people who visit Heureka each year, more than half represent families, one fourth school students, about 10% are corporate visits, and the rest are individual visitors. About 6-10% of the visitors arrive from abroad, with the highest percentage coming from Russia and Estonia. The number of visitors is affected by, for example, the general economic situation, the weather and the excursion funds available to school groups.

===The Finnish Science Centre Foundation and funding===

Heureka is run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation, whose original members include the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology (nowadays Aalto University), the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries (nowadays Confederation of Finnish Industries, EK), the City of Vantaa, the Ministry of Education (nowadays Ministry of Education and Culture), the Ministry of Trade and Industry (nowadays Ministry of Employment and the Economy), the Ministry of Finance, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and the Trade Union of Education in Finland (OAJ).

Heureka’s funding is provided through subsidies from the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture, as well as through its own operational revenue: admission and rental fees, fundraising and exhibition export. Heureka’s overall funding is approximately nine million euro, of which the revenue from own operations was 48% in 2011. The share of the funding provided by the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture was altogether 52% in 2011. The public support is notably less than for many other cultural institutions. Part of the funding also comes through corporate co-operation. The temporary exhibitions are often sponsored by main partners and other partners. Heureka also has two companies owned entirely by the Foundation, namely the Science Shop Magneetti Oy, which runs the Heureka Shop at Heureka and at the Kamppi Shopping Centre in central Helsinki, and Heureka Overseas Productions Oy Ltd, which manages the export activities of Heureka.

===Other===

At the end of 2014, the Foundation had a staff of 68 full-time salaried employees and 32 part-time or fixed-term employees. The total number of person-years was 77. Additionally 7 206 hours were carried out by volunteers. There have been volunteers in Heureka since 1998, and there are currently about 60-70 volunteers in the service of Heureka.

The center is a member of three associations of science centers:
*ASTC ([[Association of Science-Technology Centers]])
*ECSITE ([[The European Collaborative for Science, Industry and Technology]])
*NSCF ([[Nordic Science Centre Association|Nordisk Science Centerförbundet]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">In [[astrophysics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], '''Jeans's theorem''', named after [[James Jeans]], states that any steady-state solution of the collisionless [[Boltzmann equation]] depends on the phase space coordinates only through [[constant of motion|integrals of motion]] in the given potential, and conversely any function of the integrals is a steady-state solution.

Jeans's theorem is most often discussed in the context of potentials characterized by three, global integrals. In such potentials, all of the orbits are regular, i.e. non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]]; the [[Orbital elements|Kepler potential]] is one example. In generic potentials, some orbits respect only one or two integrals and the corresponding motion is chaotic. Jeans's theorem can be generalized to such potentials as follows:&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-12101-7|lccn=2013936624|pages=67–68|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The phase-space density of a stationary stellar system is constant within every well-connected region.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A well-connected region is one that cannot be decomposed into two finite regions such that all trajectories lie, for all time, in either one or the other. [[Invariant torus|Invariant tori]] of regular orbits are such regions, but so are the more complex parts of phase space associated with chaotic trajectories. Integrability of the motion is therefore not required for a steady state.

==As healing==

Mental health professionals argue that humor and satire can alleviate the mental health impact of terror attacks, helping to heal the survivors of terror attacks and rescue personnel suffering the consequences of exposure to the horrors of deliberate mass murder.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Anne Pasquali, "Humor; An Antidote for Terrorism", ''[[Journal of Holistic Nursing]]'', Vol. 21, No. 4, 398-414 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Michael Bongar, ''Psychology of Terrorism'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mental health's role in combating terror,’" Derrick Hamaoka, Jun Shigemura, Molly Hall, Robert Ursano, ''Journal of Mental Health,'' 2004, Vol. 13, No. 6 : Pages 531-535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political strategy==

Arab-American comedian [[Ray Hanania]] has written, "If there were a bit of humor in the Middle East, I think that there might not be so much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the environment that breeds fanaticism and terrorism."&lt;ref name=Hanania&gt;Ray Hanania, ''I'm Glad I Look Like a Terrorist: Growing up Arab in America,'' U. S. G. Publishing, 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Psychology Today]]'',  humor is the most powerful tool to prevent individuals from becoming  Islamic suicide bombers, however, to be effective, the humor has to come from within the Muslim community and it has to be "aimed at the culture's sacred values."&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-me-in-we/201001/comedy-counter-terrorism  “Comedy as Counter-Terrorism; Comedy as a Strategy of Counter-Terrorism,”] Molly Castelloe Fong, Ph.D. , Jan 26, 2010, Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Molly Castelloe Fong, "Humor has the potential to gradually, over time, alter what it means to be a heroic martyr in the mind of extremist groups."&lt;ref name=Fong/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] has reported that "Satire and ridicule can help win the fight against Al-Qaeda by stripping it of its glamour and mystique."&lt;ref name=Moutot&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtBqws_tP_7eOFEw0cdih33DNN_A "Fight Al-Qaeda with satire, ridicule: researchers"], Michel Moutot (AFP) – Apr 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63E6JT20100415 “Defeat al Qaeda by removing its "cool" image; The way to beat al Qaeda and stop Islamist groups gaining recruits to violent causes is to remove their "cool" image and make fun of terrorists instead, according to a major international study published on Friday,”] Michael Holden, April 15, 2010, Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] group, a think tank in the United Kingdom, is among the academic institutions that have suggested that satire can be an effective tool in undermining support for  violent jihad.&lt;ref name=Gardham/&gt;  According to some terrorism experts, successful recruitment for violent jihad depends upon convincing potential recruits that jihadis are "pious warriors of God".

[[Image:Kohn Hall, UCSB.jpg|thumb|300px|Kohn Hall, which houses the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.]]

The '''Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics''' ('''KITP''') is a research institute of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. KITP is one of the most renowned institutes for [[theoretical physics]] in the world, and brings theorists in physics and related fields together to work on topics at the forefront of theoretical science. The [[National Science Foundation]] has been the principal supporter of the Institute since it was founded as the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1979. In a 2007 article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', KITP was given the highest impact index in a comparison of nonbiomedical research organizations across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17943.full National scientific facilities and their impact on nonbiomedical research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directors of the KITP since its beginning have been:
* [[Walter Kohn]], 1979–1984 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1998)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Robert Schrieffer]], 1984–1989 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize for Physics, 1972)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[James S. Langer]], 1989–1995
* [[James Hartle]], 1995–1997 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;([[Einstein Prize (APS)]], 2009)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[David Gross]], 1997–2012 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Lars Bildsten]], 2012–present

The Director and the permanent members of the KITP (Leon Balents, David Gross, Alexei Kitaev, Joseph Polchinski, and Boris Shraiman) are also on the faculty of the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department]].  Former permanent members include Physics Nobel Laureate [[Frank Wilczek]].

In the early 2000s, the institute, formerly known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, or ITP, was named for the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] and [[businessman]] [[Fred Kavli]], in recognition of his donation of $7.5 million to the Institute.

Kohn Hall, which houses KITP, is located just beyond the Henley Gate at the East Entrance of the UCSB campus.  The building was designed by the architect [[Michael Graves]], and a new wing designed by Graves was added in 2003-2004.

== Research ==
Folta's laboratory has two primary research areas: [[photomorphogenesis|controlling plant traits using light]], and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits.

=== Plants and light ===
Folta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the [[phytochrome]] response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' through [[cryptochrome]] and [[phototropin]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Plant Journal | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=471–478 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x | last1=Folta | first1=Kevin M. | last2=Spalding | first2=Edgar P. | title=Unexpected roles for cryptochrome 2 and phototropin revealed by high-resolution analysis of blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition. | date=2001 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x/full | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=EurekAlert! | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/ajob-sjf010213.php | title=Scientists join forces to bring plant movement to light | author=American Journal of Botany | date=2 January 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in plant biology would later extend to using [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futurity.org/fruit-could-taste-better-with-far-red-light/ | work=Futurity | title=Fruit Could Taste Better With Far-Red Light | last=Anderson-Florida | first=Mickie | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through [[photomorphogenesis]]. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.&lt;ref name="Decoded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.decodedscience.org/controlling-plants-light-leds-change-plant-growth/39190 | title=Controlling Plants with Light: LEDs to Change Plant Growth | work=Decoded Science | last=Latchman | first=David | date=19 November 2013 | accessdate=2 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification,&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2013-07-flavor-scent-volatiles-fruits.html | title=Light can change flavor, scent volatiles in plants and fruits, study finds | author=[[University of Florida]] | work=[[Phys.org]] | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawberry genomics and flavors ===
Folta's work in [[strawberry]] genomics began in 2002.&lt;ref name="ufgi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sharing science: Kevin Folta’s career in horticulture, research advocacy | url=http://ufgi.ufl.edu/sharing-science-kevin-foltas-career-in-horticulture-research-advocacy/ | first=Ellison | last=Langford |  work=University of Florida Genetics Institute | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShulaevSargent2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shulaev|first1=Vladimir|display-authors=et al. |title=The genome of woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca)|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=109–116|issn=1061-4036|doi=10.1038/ng.740|pmid=21186353|pmc=3326587}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

Folta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor.&lt;ref name="LS 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/10932-future-flavor-strawberry-genetic-code-sequenced.html | title=The Future of Flavor: Strawberry's Genetic Code Sequenced | work=[[LiveScience]] | last=Parry | first=Wynne | date=26 December 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/bland-strawberries-genetic-tweak-flavor-204757153.html | title=Bland Strawberries Get a Genetic Tweak for Flavor | work=[[Yahoo! News]] | last=Perry | first=Wynne | date=4 February 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as [[grape]]s and [[pineapple]]s, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UF 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2014/03/healthier-processed-food-essence-of-strawberry-could-be-the-key.html | title=Healthier processed food? Essence of strawberry could be the key | work=[[University of Florida]] | last=Anderson | first=Mickie | date=3 March 2014 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] such as [[peach]]es, [[almond]]s, [[apple]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[blackberry|blackberries]],&lt;ref name="LS 2010" /&gt; and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar.&lt;ref name="UF 2014" /&gt; Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using [[selective breeding|conventional breeding techniques]], without the use of genetic modification.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;

== Science communication ==
[[File:Kevin Folta.jpg|thumb|[[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 8 in 2010]]
Folta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions.&lt;ref name="TB bio" /&gt; He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.&lt;ref name="TB bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | work=Talking Biotech (blog) | title=Instructor — Talking Biotech | accessdate=28 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233020/http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | archivedate=20 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' described Folta as "a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

In 2016, Folta was awarded the [[Borlaug CAST Communication Award]] by the [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Norman Borlaug]]. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on "clear, credible information" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, "[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology."&lt;ref name=CAST/&gt; Writing about the award in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta "wants to replace fear with fact" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Jack|title=Good science conquers greatest fear: the unknown|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/10/11/good-science-conquers-greatest-fear-unknown/91911900/|website=The DesMoines Register|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science "won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth."&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

{{quote|When you see what it takes to produce a tomato—the number of people involved from breeding all the way to post-harvest, people who pick it, out in the hot sun, really doing really tough work, the huge amounts of fuel and labor that are involved—that I can buy this thing for 50 cents?

From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=This is Genetic Engineering 2.0|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/this_is_genetic_engineering_2.0|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Skeptical Inquirer|issue=July/August 2017|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has compared the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the safety of [[genetically modified organisms|genetically modified foods]] to those regarding [[global warming]] and [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/anti-gmo-activist-seeks-expose-emails-food-scientists/ | title=Anti-GMO Activist Seeks to Expose Scientists' Emails With Big Ag | work=Wired | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | last=Levinovitz |  first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an outspoken critic of food blogger [[Vani Hari]]'s claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-food-babe-enemy-of-chemicals/385301/ | title=The Food Babe: Enemy of Chemicals | work=The Atlantic | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Hamblin, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta advocates for a "soft and effective" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="Fear mongers" make good living by misrepresenting science, says GMO expert | url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2015/09/fear-mongers-make-a-good-living-off-of-misrepresenting-science-says-gmo-expert/ | accessdate=23 September 2015 | work=[[McGill Reporter]] | date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta regards the term "GMO" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term "genetic engineering".&lt;ref name="GerbicCSICOP2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=The Challenges of Science Communication: An Interview with Kevin Folta|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|website=CSICOP.org|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|archivedate=8 November 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's  recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Jarry|title=An interview with Kevin Folta at CSICon|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_kevin_folta_at_csicon|website=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)|publisher=CSICOP, an independent nonprofit organization|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: "Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017 /&gt;

===Podcasting===
Folta operates the ''Talking Biotech'' [[podcast]] which is billed as "A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genome Center Director features in ‘Talking Biotech’ podcast | website=UC Davis Genome Center | url=http://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/2015/07/29/genome-center-director-features-in-talking-biotech-podcast/ | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Talking Biotech Podcast | url=http://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com | title=Talking Biotech Podcast - Evidence-Based Discussion with Dr. Kevin Folta | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also created the ''Science Power Hour'' podcast, which is a [[parody]] of an [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[talk radio]] show hosted by Folta's alter ego "Vern Blazek". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is VB?|url=http://www.sciencepowerhour.com/?page_id=124|website=sciencepowerhour.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seed Money|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/brookeborel/when-scientists-email-monsanto|accessdate=1 February 2016|publisher=buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict of interest allegations ==
In February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an [[Oakland, California]]-based group whose sole major funder is the [[Organic Consumers Association]],&lt;ref name="Kloor"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Keith Kloor | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/02/agricultural-researchers-rattled-demands-documents-group-opposed-gm | title=Updated: Agricultural researchers rattled by demands for documents from group opposed to GM foods | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Folta told ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to "smear" him.&lt;ref name="Kloor"/&gt;

In a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article from August 2015 [[Keith Kloor]] wrote that Folta had "close ties to [[Monsanto]] and other biotechnology interests".&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Folta denied these claims,&lt;ref name=ihe&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/14/researcher-finds-himself-center-battle-over-gmos-and-corporate-support | title=Casualty of GMO Wars | work=Inside Higher Education | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Flaherty, Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014.&lt;ref name=kfolta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-are-deep-ties-to-monsanto.html| title= What are "Deep Ties" to Monsanto? | work=Illumination (blog)| date=13 September 2015 | accessdate=13 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s20&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science20.com/kevin_folta/setting_a_new_standard_for_science_transparency-157244 | title= Setting A New Standard For Science Transparency | work=Science 2.0 | date=22 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.&lt;ref name=ihe/&gt;

In September 2015, [[Eric Lipton]] writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their "independent voices" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/us/food-industry-enlisted-academics-in-gmo-lobbying-war-emails-show.html | title=Food Industry Enlisted Academics in G.M.O. Lobbying War, Emails Show | work=[[New York Times]] | date=5 September 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Lipton, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the University of Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto to be used at the university's discretion which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food.&lt;ref name=kfolta/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20150828/articles/150829661 |title= UF to donate Monsanto funds to food pantry | work=Gainesville Sun | date=28 August 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | author=Schweers, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt;&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt; Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says "defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;

In October 2015, ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' wrote that scientists like Folta have been "targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology" and stated that the funds "were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain." The journal criticized the journalists for "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]]" and creating "hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]]| department=Editorial| title=Standing up for science | year=2015| issue=10| volume=33| pages=1009| publisher=Nature Publishing Group| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3384| accessdate=10 October 2015| doi=10.1038/nbt.3384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a "[[spiral of silence]]".&lt;ref name=tampa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/perspective-records-requests-hijack-scientists-time/2245131 | title=Perspective: Records requests hijack scientists' time| work= Tampa Bay Times | date=12 September 2015 | accessdate=12 September 2015 | author=Payne, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretchen Goldman, writing for the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being "overly wide", saying it would create "chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science."&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/no-scientist-should-face-harassment-period-637| title=No Scientist Should Face Harassment.

Professor and science communicator [[Steven Novella]] wrote that "The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues."&lt;ref name="neurologica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/how-to-attack-a-public-scientist/ | title=How To Attack a Public Scientist| work=Neurologica (blog) | date=11 September 2015 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Novella,Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During college Folta was a member of many bands. The oddest was named "Red Lobster Cult", but the one he played with the longest was "Insane War Tomatoes", according to Folta, "One of the greatest bands to ever miss the mark&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;it was a unique show at a time when uniqueness wasn't wanted."&lt;ref name="Enthusiast interview"&gt;{{cite podcast | title=tSE 015 – Kevin Folta, Chairman of Horticultural Sciences at University of Florida | url=http://ascienceenthusiast.com/ep015/ | website=A Science Enthusiast | time=35:15–45:50 | date=August 31, 2016 | accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He trained and competed in [[karate]] for many years, and he won a bronze metal in [[kumite]] (sparring) at the 2012 [[USA National Karate-do Federation]] national tournament (over 45 Masters division).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tournament Results: 2012 USA Karate Nationals|url=http://www.teamusa.org/~/media/USA_Karate/Documents/Event-Results/2012-Nationals.pdf?la=en|publisher=[[USA National Karate-do Federation]]|accessdate=5 November 2016|page=50|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7382">[[Image:Lesbian sign.svg|thumb|right|A [[lesbian]] sign made from two linked [[astronomical symbols]] for [[Venus]]. In ancient times the metal [[copper]] was associated with the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in line with traditional planetary metallurgy. Copper's ancient [[alchemy]] symbol, a circle (for [[spirit]]) above a cross (for [[matter]]), became a sign for both the goddess and the [[Venus|planet]]. It was later also used to represent the female in [[biology]] and popular culture. Here, it is doubled and twined in symbolic hues of [[Lilac (color)|lilac]] as a sign for ''lesbian''.]]
'''Lesbian utopia''' refers to a conceptual community made up entirely of [[Woman|women]] who are not dependent on [[Man|men]] for anything.&lt;ref&gt;Usage example: ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', "[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/051007/news1.html A Condo of One's Own] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912002817/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/051007/news1.html |date=12 September 2007 }}", Jane Shulman, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Usage example: Off Our Backs, ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_200110/ai_n8980189 Sexual violence within lesbian battering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124013155/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_200110/ai_n8980189 |date=24 November 2007 }}'', Lori B Girshick, Oct 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an all-female society is mentioned in [[Greek mythology]] through a [[legend]] of [[Amazons|the Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors. In this legend, once each year the Amazons call upon [[Gargareans|the Gargareans]] and mate with them.

==Reproduction==
It could be argued that a major hurdle for a philosophical lesbian utopia would be that, as with many [[species]], [[human reproduction]] requires an [[Ovum|egg]] (from the [[female]]), a [[sperm]] (from the [[male]]) and a [[Uterus|womb]] as a suitable environment with an available source of [[nutrients]] in which an [[embryo]] can develop into a [[fetus]] and [[Gestation|gestate]] until [[childbirth]].

Scientists have created [[mouse]] pups from two female mice, including [[Kaguya (mouse)|Kaguya]].&lt;ref name="BBC News:"&gt;''[[BBC News]]'', [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3643847.stm Mice created without fathers], 21 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was conducted by researchers from the [[Tokyo University of Agriculture]], led by Dr. [[Tomohiro Kono]]. The research uncovered that by suppressing the activity of a certain hormone from the original mouse eggs, they could initiate growth of the eggs by using two sets of ''female'' DNA, by increasing the activity of another hormone contained within the egg.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

However, Dr. Komo has stated that the extremely low success rate of the procedure uncovered by his team meant that just 2 out of 598 mice were able to be produced both successfully and ''safely'' using this method (Giving an estimated success rate of about 0.334%). He said that many of the mice died during the trial, with just two of them surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

Researchers have also dismissed the use of this technology in fertility treatment for the time being, citing that it is impossible to tell whether this treatment would even be applicable for use in this area without further research.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt; Dr. Komo has also expressed reservations regarding human [[fertility]] treatments, stating, "This is a very complicated thing. So no, It is impossible to do this experiment in a human. And I don't want to do it".&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt; However, some researchers still believe the methods could have potential applications in [[stem cell research]].&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

Scientists have also found a way to fertilise human eggs using [[genetic material]] from any [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the body.&lt;ref name="BBC News2:"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1431489.stm Eggs fertilised without sperm], 10 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
This could eventually allow [[Three-parent baby|two or more females to conceive]] and bring a baby to term without male assistance. There have been some public health concerns amongst a vocal minority about the viability of the techniques put forward in this instance, particularly regarding the health of the children conceived through [[biotechnology]], as well as the "high risk of creating damaged people" through genetic engineering of this type.&lt;ref name="BBC News2:"/&gt;

It is as of yet unknown if any new biotechnology could be applied to humans, regardless of any [[Ethics|ethical]] issues which may arise.&lt;ref&gt;About.com, ''[http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/families/a/Parthenogenesis.htm Parthenogenesis: Do We Need Men Anymore?

==In fiction==
A historical fictional example of this concept is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s feminist novel ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).

More contemporary examples of lesbian utopian fiction include [[John Wyndham]]'s ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'' (1956); [[Poul Anderson]]'s  ''Virgin Planet'' (1959); [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975); [[Nicola Griffith]]'s ''[[Ammonite (novel)|Ammonite]]'' (1993); and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story "The Manikins". These stories often include the premise that a gender-specific [[pandemic]] has eradicated all male human life on Earth or another world. The female survivors usually reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], whether through benign [[mutation]] or technological progress.

The 1984 Polish science fiction comedy ''[[Sexmission]]'' features two men, subjects of a hibernation experiment, who wake to find themselves in a post-apocalyptic, all female society.

[[Lithia (The Outer Limits)|Lithia]], Episode 17 of the fourth season of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' features a man who was cryogenically frozen and awakens in a world populated only by women.

British sci-fi writer [[Edmund Cooper]] explored the subject in several of his novels, including ''Five to Twelve'' (1968) and ''Who Needs Men'' (1972).

In the [[Mass Effect|Mass Effect universe]], the ''Asari'' are a [[agender|monogender]]-[[pansexuality|pansexual]] "female" species.

[[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] was created by [[William Moulton Marston]] to allegorize the safety and security of the home where women thrived apart from the hostile, male-dominated work place. It is governed by ''[[Aphrodite (DC Comics)|Aphrodite's Law]]'', which stated: "Penalty of death to any [[Man]] attempting to set foot on Themyscira."&lt;ref&gt;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4763e71ec804b0998e4d29162420de87.webp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-outlandish-examples-of-subtext-in-comic-books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/573997914979868676/&lt;/ref&gt;

In reasoning to [[argument|argue]] a claim, a [[fallacy]] is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]] of the argument and permits its recognition as [[soundness|unsound]]. Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.

Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006" /&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies.{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=This needs examples, and/or to be broken into different sentences—this is difficult to follow, and "in turn" to what? The previous sentence? Things within this long sentence?}} Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=fallacy |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |publisher= Encyclopedia Brittanica |website= Brittanica.com |accessdate= 13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty inferences in [[deductive reasoning]] are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of [[inductive reasoning]] is based on [[probability]], a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as "weak".

The conscious or habitual use of fallacies as [[rhetorical device]]s are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hornby |first1=A.S. |title= Oxford advanced learner's dictionary of current English |date=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [England] |isbn= 978-0194799003 |edition=8th |quote= sophist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal fallacies ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}
A formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the [[argument form|argument's form]].{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067957_ss1-95 "formal fallacy"]}} All formal fallacies are specific types of [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequiturs]].  
* [[Appeal to probability]] – a statement that takes something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might be the case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leon|first1=Joseph|title=Appeal to Probability|url=http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|website=Logical &amp; Critical Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130844/http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|archivedate=27 September 2013|date=23 April 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Simon|title=Appeal to probability|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|website=Toolkit For Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219013634/http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|archivedate=19 February 2015|date=2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from fallacy]] (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – assumption that if an ''argument'' for some conclusion is fallacious, then the ''conclusion'' is false.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/fallfall.html "Fallacy Fallacy"]}}
* [[Base rate fallacy]] – making a probability judgment based on [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]], without taking into account the effect of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Base%20Rate%20Fallacy |title=Base Rate Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=Psychology Glossary |publisher=AlleyDog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conjunction fallacy]] – assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/conjunction_fallacy.htm |title=Conjunction Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=ChangingMinds.org |last=Straker |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Masked-man fallacy]] (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/illisubs.html "The Masked Man Fallacy"]}}

=== Propositional fallacies ===
A propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: &lt;and&gt;, &lt;or&gt;, &lt;not&gt;, &lt;only if&gt;, &lt;if and only if&gt;). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.
&lt;br /&gt;Types of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] fallacies:
* [[Affirming a disjunct]] – concluding that one disjunct of a [[logical disjunction]] must be false because the other disjunct is true; ''A or B; A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Affirming the consequent]] – the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the [[consequent]] is true; ''if A, then B; B, therefore A''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Denying the antecedent]] – the [[consequent]] in an [[indicative conditional]] is claimed to be false because the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false; ''if A, then B; not A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}

=== Quantification fallacies ===
A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.
&lt;br /&gt; Types of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] fallacies:
* [[Existential fallacy]] – an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}

=== Formal syllogistic fallacies ===
[[Syllogistic fallacy|Syllogistic fallacies]] – logical fallacies that occur in [[syllogisms]].
* [[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]] (illicit negative) – a categorical [[syllogism]] has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of exclusive premises]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of four terms]] (''quaternio terminorum'') – a categorical syllogism that has four terms.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|pp=133–36}}
* [[Illicit major]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not [[distribution of terms|distributed]] in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Illicit minor]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]] (illicit affirmative) – a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of the undistributed middle]] – the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=316–17}}
* [[Modal fallacy]] – confusing possibility with necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/127/Modal_Scope_Fallacy|title=Modal (Scope) Fallacy|last=Bennett|first=Bo|date=|website=Logically Fallacious|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal fallacies ==
{{Main|Informal fallacy}}
Informal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679510_ss1-120 "informal fallacy"]}}
* [[Argument to moderation]] (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad temperantiam}}'') – assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=150}}
* [[Continuum fallacy]] (fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, sorites fallacy, fallacy of the heap, bald man fallacy) – improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise.{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Line-Drawing "Line-Drawing"]}}
* [[Correlative-based fallacies]]
** [[Suppressed correlative]] – a correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Theory: An Anthology |chapter=Psychological Egoism |page=193 |first=Joel |last=Feinberg |editor-first=Russ |editor-last=Shafer-Landau |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |series=Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3320-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By9nCkAvS6EC&amp;pg=PT211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Divine fallacy]] (argument from incredulity) – arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Robert T.|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|url=http://skepdic.com/dvinefal.html|title=divine fallacy (argument from incredulity)|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double counting (fallacy)|Double counting]] – counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding [[unity (number)|unity]].
* [[Equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time).{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=121}}
** [[Ambiguous middle term]] – a common ambiguity in syllogisms in which the [[middle term]] is equivocated.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=206}}
** Definitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word to deal with an objection raised against the original wording.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirie|first=Madsen|authorlink=Madsen Pirie|title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=10 September 2015|year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Motte-and-bailey fallacy – The arguer conflates two similar positions, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial (the "bailey"). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position.&lt;ref name="mott-and-bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackel|first1=Nicholas|title=The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]|date=2005|volume=36|issue=3|quote=For my purposes the desirable but only lightly defensible territory of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|Motte and Bailey castle]], that is to say, the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or position with similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible. The Motte is the defensible but undesired position to which one retreats when hard pressed...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Accent (fallacy)|Fallacy of accent]] – a specific type of ambiguity that arises when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual prosodic stress, or when, in a written passage, it's left unclear which word the emphasis was supposed to fall on.
** {{crossref|printworthy=y|(See also the [[#If-by-whiskey|if-by-whiskey]] fallacy, below.)}}
* [[Ecological fallacy]] – inferences about the nature of specific individuals are based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which those individuals belong.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=119}}
* [[Etymological fallacy]] – reasoning that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=70}}
* [[Fallacy of composition]] – assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=31}}
* [[Fallacy of division]] – assuming that something true of a thing must also be true of all or some of its parts.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=53}}
* [[False attribution]] – an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.
** [[Fallacy of quoting out of context]] (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) – refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=97}}
* [[False authority]] (single authority) – using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to sell a product or idea.  Related to the [[appeal to authority]] (not always fallacious).
* [[False dilemma]] (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) – two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options when in reality there are more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html |title=Fallacy – False Dilemma |accessdate=2011-02-01 |publisher=The Nizkor Project |work=Nizkor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[False equivalence]] – describing a situation of logical and apparent equivalence, when in fact there is none.
* [[Historian's fallacy]] – the assumption that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=209}} (Not to be confused with [[presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], which is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas, such as moral standards, are projected into the past.)
* [[Historical fallacy]] – a set of considerations is thought to hold good only because a completed process is read into the content of the process which conditions this completed result.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology", John Dewey, ''The Psychological Review'', Vol. III. No. 4. July 1896. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homunculus fallacy]] – a "middle-man" is used for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. Explains without actually explaining the real nature of a function or a process. Instead, it explains the concept in terms of the concept itself, without first defining or explaining the original concept. Explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker, a sort of [[homunculus]] inside the head, merely explains it as another kind of thinking (as different but the same).{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120113200604/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?query=homunculus&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;book_id=g9781405106795_9781405106795&amp;from=search&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;type=std&amp;id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067959_ss1-77&amp;slop=1 "Homunculus"]}}
* {{vanchor|Inflation of conflict}} – arguing that if experts of a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point, the experts must know nothing, and therefore no conclusion can be reached, or that the legitimacy of their entire field is put to question.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments"&gt;{{cite web|title=A List Of Fallacious Arguments|url=http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{vanchor|[[If-by-whiskey]]}} – an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are selectively emotionally sensitive.
* [[Incomplete comparison]] – insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison.
* [[Inconsistent comparison]] – different methods of comparison are used, leaving a false impression of the whole comparison.
* [[Intentional Fallacy|Intentionality fallacy]] – the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so.)&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K. Wimsatt|Wimsatt, William K.]] and [[Monroe Beardsley|Monroe C. Beardsley]]. "The Intentional Fallacy." ''[[Sewanee Review]]'', vol. 54 (1946): 468–88. Revised and republished in [https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22William%20Kurtz%20Wimsatt%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry''],  U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kettle logic]] – using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position.{{dubious|Kettle logic|date=August 2016}}
* [[Ludic fallacy]] – the belief that the outcomes of non-regulated random occurrences can be encapsulated by a statistic; a failure to take into account [[there are known knowns|unknown unknowns]] in determining the probability of events taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nassim |last=Taleb |title=The Black Swan |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |isbn=1-4000-6351-5 |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMuF4A4XF8C&amp;pg=PA127 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[McNamara fallacy]] (quantitative fallacy) – making a decision based only on quantitative observations, discounting all other considerations.
* [[Mind projection fallacy]] – subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perceptions of that object.
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]. For instance, inferring ''is'' from ''ought'' is an instance of moralistic fallacy. Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy defined below.
* [[Moving the goalposts]] (raising the bar) – argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded.
* [[Nirvana fallacy]] (perfect-solution fallacy) – solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.
* ''[[Philosophic burden of proof|Onus probandi]]'' – from the Latin ''onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat'' the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions the claim). It is a particular case of the ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad ignorantiam}}'' fallacy, here the burden is shifted on the person defending against the assertion. Also known as "[[shifting the burden of proof]]".
* [[Proof by assertion]] – a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with [[argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'')
* [[Prosecutor's fallacy]] – a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of {{em|some}} false match being found.
* [[Proving too much]] – using a form of argument that, if it were valid, could be used to reach an additional, invalid conclusion.
* [[Psychologist's fallacy]] – an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.
* [[Direct reference theory|Referential fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics Glossary R, [http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/semiotics/glossaryR/section81/main.html ''Referential fallacy or illusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; – assuming all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object or that the meaning of words often comes from how they are used.
* [[Reification (fallacy)|Reification]] (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity. In other words, it is the error of treating as a "real thing" something that is not a real thing, but merely an idea.
* [[Retrospective determinism]] – the argument that because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made its occurrence inevitable.
* [[Special pleading]] – a proponent of a position attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption.

=== Improper premise ===
* [[Begging the question]] (''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'') – providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question|title=Your logical fallacy is begging the question|work=Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html|title=Fallacy: Begging the Question|work=nizkor.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/61-begging-the-question|title=Begging the Question|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Begging-the-Question.html|title=Begging the Question|work=txstate.edu|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of [[begging the question]] fallacy.  When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion.  For example, an organic foods advertisement that says "Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives." Use of the term "unhealthy additives" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John D. Ramage|author2=John C. Bean|author3=June Johnson|title=Writing Arguments: A Rhetoric with Readings, Concise Edition, MLA Update Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-HEjwEACAAJ|year=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-458649-6|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in demonstrando}}'') – the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with; sometimes called ''assuming the conclusion''.
* [[Loaded question|Fallacy of many questions]] (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, ''{{lang|la|plurium interrogationum}}'') – someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda.

=== Faulty generalizations ===
[[Faulty generalization]] – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.
* [[Accident (fallacy)|Accident]] – an exception to a generalization is ignored.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=5}}
** [[No true Scotsman]] – makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample.{{sfn|Flew|1984|loc="No-true-Scotsman move"}}
* [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) – act of pointing at individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=155}}
** [[Survivorship bias]] – a small number of successes of a given process are actively promoted while completely ignoring a large number of failures
* [[False analogy]] – an [[argument by analogy]] in which the analogy is poorly suited.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=151}}
* [[Hasty generalization]] (fallacy of insufficient statistics, fallacy of insufficient sample, fallacy of the lonely fact, hasty induction, ''secundum quid'', converse accident, [[jumping to conclusions]]) – basing a broad conclusion on a small sample or the making of a determination without all of the information required to do so.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=134}}
* [[Inductive fallacy]] – A more general name to some fallacies, such as hasty generalization. It happens when a conclusion is made of premises that lightly support it.
* [[Misleading vividness]] – involves describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is an exceptional occurrence, to convince someone that it is a problem; this also relies on the [[appeal to emotion]] fallacy.
* [[Overwhelming exception]] – an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=127}}
* [[Thought-terminating cliché]] – a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell [[cognitive dissonance]], conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. – but in any case, to end the debate with a cliché rather than a point.

=== Questionable cause ===
[[Questionable cause]] - Is a general type error with many variants.  Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation.  Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect.  
* ''{{lang|la|[[Cum hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "with this, therefore because of this"; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) – a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=41}}
** ''{{lang|la|[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"; temporal sequence implies causation) – X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=180}}
** [[Wrong direction]] (reverse causation) – cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=135}} The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause.
** [[Ignoring a common cause]]
* [[Fallacy of the single cause]] (causal oversimplification{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=178}}) – it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.&lt;!-- Damer describes this in more general terms. --&gt;
* [[Furtive fallacy]] – outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers.
* [[Gambler's fallacy]] – the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is "due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails" is incorrect.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=186}}
** [[Inverse gambler's fallacy]]
* [[Magical thinking]] – fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In [[anthropology]], it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In [[psychology]], it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.
* [[Regression fallacy]] – ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of ''post hoc'' fallacy.

=== Relevance fallacies ===
* [[Appeal to the stone]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad lapidem}}'') – dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2709600|title=Johnson's Refutation of Berkeley: Kicking the Stone Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from ignorance]] (appeal to ignorance, ''argumentum ad ignorantiam'') – assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false, or vice versa.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=165}}
* [[Argument from incredulity]] (appeal to common sense) – "I cannot imagine how this could be true; therefore, it must be false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toolkit for Thinking|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/denial-arguments/argument-from-personal-incredulity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ad nauseam|Argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'') – repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/repetition.htm|title=Repetition|work=changingminds.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/ad-nauseam|title=Ad nauseam – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes confused with [[proof by assertion]]
* [[Argument from silence]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ex silentio}}'') – assuming that a claim is true based on the absence of textual or spoken evidence from an authoritative source, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/inductive-logic-arguments/argument-from-silence|title=Argument from silence – Toolkit For Thinking|work=toolkitforthinking.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/55-argument-from-silence|title=Argument from Silence|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'' (irrelevant conclusion, missing the point) – an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=105}}

==== Red herring fallacies ====
A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/redherrf.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Red Herring|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/red-herring/|title=Logical Fallacies|work=logicalfallacies.info|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red herring]] – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=208}} Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. ''See also [[ignoratio elenchi|irrelevant conclusion]].''
* ''{{lang|la|[[Ad hominem]]}}'' – attacking the arguer instead of the argument.
**''[[Ad hominem#Circumstantial|Circumstantial ad hominem]]'' - stating that the arguers personal situation or perceived benefit from advancing a conclusion means that their conclusion is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/circumstantial-ad-hominem.html |title=Circumstantial Ad Hominem |author=Nizkor |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Poisoning the well]] – a subtype of ''{{lang|la|ad hominem}}'' presenting adverse information about a target person with the intention of discrediting everything that the target person says.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=187}}
** [[Abusive fallacy]] – verbally abusing the opponent rather than arguing about the originally proposed argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/10-ad-hominem-abusive|title=Ad Hominem (Abusive)|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to motive]] – dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer.
** [[Kafka-trapping]] – a sophistical and unfalsifiable form of argument that attempts to overcome an opponent by inducing a sense of guilt and using the opponent's denial of guilt as further evidence of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/wendy-mcelroy-beware-of-kafkatrapping/ |title= Beware of Kafkatrapping |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |date=14 August 2014 |website=The Daily Bell |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Tone policing]] – focusing on emotion behind (or resulting from) a message rather than the message itself as a discrediting tactic.
** [[Ergo decedo|Traitorous critic fallacy]] (''{{lang|la|ergo decedo}}'', 'thus leave') – a critic's perceived affiliation is portrayed as the underlying reason for the criticism and the critic is asked to stay away from the issue altogether.  Easily confused with the [[association fallacy]] ("guilt by association"), below.
**Empathy justifies the argument -  using personal empathy with the exponent of a view to justify the view. (Cf. ''argumentum ad misericordiam'', the "argument from pity.")
**Identify politics - reducing a view down to the identity of the exponent determines their right or lack of right to speak on the topic. For example, "Only a person of the African-American race has the  right to speak on African-American racial topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/theminefield/francis-fukuyama-and-the-problem-of-identity-politics/10558930|title=Francis Fukuyama and the problem of identity politics|date=2018-11-27|website=Radio National|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it.{{sfn|Clark|Clark|2005|pp=13–16}}{{sfn|Walton|1997|p=28}} The term is also used more broadly to describe arguments that are not always fallacious; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see entry in the [[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]] section}}.
** [[Appeal to accomplishment]] – an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/19-appeal-to-accomplishment|title=Appeal to Accomplishment|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below).
** [[Courtier's reply]] – a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
* [[Appeal to consequences]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad consequentiam}}'') – the conclusion is supported by a premise that asserts positive or negative consequences from some course of action in an attempt to distract from the initial discussion.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=27}}
* [[Appeal to emotion]] – an argument is made due to the manipulation of emotions, rather than the use of valid reasoning.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=111}}
** [[Appeal to fear]] – an argument is made by increasing fear and prejudice towards the opposing side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/32-appeal-to-fear|title=Appeal to Fear|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_fear.htm|title=Appeal to Fear|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to flattery]] – an argument is made due to the use of flattery to gather support.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=12}}
** [[Appeal to pity]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad misericordiam}}'') – an argument attempts to induce pity to sway opponents.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=128}}
** [[Appeal to ridicule]] – an argument is made by incorrectly presenting the opponent's argument in a way that makes it appear ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_ridicule.htm|title=Appeal to Ridicule|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/42-appeal-to-ridicule|title=Appeal to Ridicule|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to spite]] – an argument is made through exploiting people's bitterness or spite towards an opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_spite.htm|title=Appeal to Spite|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Judgmental language]] – insulting or pejorative language to influence the audience's judgment.
** [[Pooh-pooh]] – dismissing an argument perceived unworthy of serious consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munson |first1=Ronald |last2=Black |first2=Andrew |date=2016 |title=The Elements of Reasoning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr4aCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257 |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=257 |isbn=1305886836}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Wishful thinking]] – a decision is made according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=146}}
* [[Appeal to nature]] – judgment is based solely on whether the subject of judgment is 'natural' or 'unnatural'.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnature.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Appeal to Nature|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sometimes also called the "naturalistic fallacy", but is not to be confused with the other fallacies by that name.)
* [[Appeal to novelty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum novitatis}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatis}}'') – a proposal is claimed to be superior or better solely because it is new or modern.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=116}}
* [[Appeal to poverty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad Lazarum}}'') – supporting a conclusion because the arguer is poor (or refuting because the arguer is wealthy). (Opposite of [[appeal to wealth]].){{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=104}}
* [[Appeal to tradition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatem}}'') – a conclusion supported solely because it has long been held to be true.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=14}}

* {{lang|la|[[Ipse dixit]]}} (bare assertion fallacy) – a claim that is presented as true without support, as self-evidently true, or as dogmatically true. This fallacy relies on the implied expertise of the speaker or on an unstated truism.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179 "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B.

The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bulverism]] (psychogenetic fallacy) – inferring why an argument is being used, associating it to some psychological reason, then assuming it is invalid as a result. The assumption that if the origin of an idea comes from a biased mind, then the idea itself must also be a falsehood.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments" /&gt;
* [[Chronological snobbery]] – a thesis is deemed incorrect because it was commonly held when something else, known to be false, was also commonly held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidlavery.net/Barfield/Encyclopedia_Barfieldiana/Lexicon/Chronological.html|title=Encyclopedia Barfieldiana|work=davidlavery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021701/http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{visible anchor|Fallacy of relative privation}} (also known as "appeal to worse problems" or "not as bad as") – dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument. [[First World problem]]s are a subset of this fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZXSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22first+world%22+%22relative+privation%22|title=All about Them: Grow Your Business by Focusing on Others|first=Bruce|last=Turkel|date=6 September 2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genetic fallacy]] – a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=93}}
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises, in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]; e.g. making statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. This is the inverse of the naturalistic fallacy.
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Naturalistic "Naturalistic"]}}&lt;ref name="nat-fal"&gt;{{cite web |work=TheFreeDictionary.com |title=Naturalistic fallacy |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/naturalistic+fallacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of [[fact–value distinction]].  ''Naturalistic fallacy'' in the stricter sense defined in the section "[[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]]" (below) is a variety of this broader sense. Naturalistic fallacy (sometimes confused with [[appeal to nature]]) is the inverse of [[moralistic fallacy]].
** [[Is–ought problem|Is–ought fallacy]]{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Is-Ought "Is-Ought"]}} – statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. 
* {{sic|hide=y|reason=This is not a typo; the naturalistic fallacy fallacy and the naturalistic fallacy are different.|''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy}}&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183201 How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is']", ''The Philosophical Review'', '''73''':1 (January 1964), 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; (anti-naturalistic fallacy)&lt;ref&gt;Alex Walter, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209025135/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep043348.pdf The Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts]", ''Evolutionary Psychology'', '''4''' (2006), 33–48&lt;/ref&gt; – inferring an impossibility to infer any instance of ''ought'' from ''is'' from the general invalidity of ''is-ought fallacy'', mentioned above. For instance, ''is'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; does imply ''ought'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, although the ''naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy would falsely declare such an inference invalid. ''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy is a type of [[argument from fallacy]].
* [[Straw man]] fallacy – an argument based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=22}}
* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] – improperly asserting a cause to explain a cluster of data.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/texsharp.html "The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"]}}
* ''[[Tu quoque]]'' ('you too' – appeal to hypocrisy, [[whataboutism]]) – the argument states that a certain position is false or wrong or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with that position.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=164}}
* [[Two wrongs make a right]] – occurs when it is assumed that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will rectify it.{{sfn|Johnson|Blair|1994|p=122}}
* [[Vacuous truth]] – a claim that is technically true but meaningless, in the form of claiming that no ''A'' in ''B'' has ''C'', when there is no ''A'' in ''B''. For example, claiming that no mobile phones in the room are on when there are no mobile phones in the room at all.

== Conditional or questionable fallacies ==
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – a form of [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. The argument may actually be cogent when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. {{crossref|See the [[#Red herring fallacies|Red herring fallacies]] section, above, for the fallacious variant.}}
* [[Broken window fallacy]] – an argument that disregards lost opportunity costs (typically non-obvious, difficult to determine or otherwise hidden) associated with destroying property of others, or other ways of externalizing costs onto others. For example, an argument that states breaking a window generates income for a window fitter, but disregards the fact that the money spent on the new window cannot now be spent on new shoes.
* [[Definist fallacy]] – involves the confusion between two notions by defining one in terms of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Naturalistic Fallacy |first=W. K. |last=Frankena |work=Mind |volume=48 |date=October 1939 |pages=464–77 |publisher=Oxford University Press |jstor=2250706 |issue=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ends justify the means – an assertion that may or may not be defensible depending on the ends and means in question. The various approaches to this sort of question are the subject of the normative ethical theories of [[consequentialism]].
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – attempts to prove a claim about ethics by appealing to a definition of the term "good" in terms of either one or more claims about natural properties. The naturalistic fallacy also has a more general version, covered in the [[#Informal fallacies|"Red herring fallacies" section]], above.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org" /&gt;
* [[Slippery slope]] (thin edge of the wedge, [[camel's nose]]) – asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact/event that should not happen, thus the first step should not happen. It is, in its essence, an appeal to probability fallacy.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=315}}

Each layer of platelets is oriented in a different direction, giving the resulting object greater strength. The inventors claimed that the process is 10x faster than commercial [[3D printing]]. The magnetisation and orientation of the ceramic platelets has been patented.&lt;ref name=zme&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artificial tooth is as good as the real deal|url = http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/magnetic-casting-artificial-enamel-827834/|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |date= September 29, 2015 |first=Alexandru |last=Micu |publisher=ZME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The technique involves pouring a suspension of magnetized ceramic micro-plates. Pores in the plaster mold absorb the liquid from the suspension, solidifying the material from the outside in. The particles are subjected to a strong [[magnetic field]] as they solidify that causes them to align in one direction. The field’s orientation is changed at regular intervals, moving the plates still in suspension, without disturbing already-solidified plates. By varying the composition of the suspension and the direction of the platelets, a continuous process can produce multiple layers with differing material properties in a single object. The resulting objects can closely imitate their natural models.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt;

== Artificial tooth ==

Researchers produced an artificial tooth whose microstructure mimicked that of a real tooth. The outer layers, corresponding to enamel, were hard and structurally complex. The outer layers contained glass [[nanoparticles]] and [[aluminium oxide]] plates were aligned perpendicular to the surface. After the outer layers hardened, a second suspension was poured. It contained no glass, and the plates were aligned horizontally to the surface of the tooth.  These deeper layers were tougher, resembling [[dentine]]. The tooth was then cooked at 1,600 degrees to compact and harden the material — a process known as [[sintering]]. The last step involved filling remaining pores with a synthetic [[monomer]] used in [[dentistry]], which [[polymerizes]] after treatment.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt; Hardness and durability approximated that of both the enamel and dentine of a tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creating Fake Teeth as Strong as the Real Deal|url = http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2015/09/creating-fake-teeth-strong-real-deal|date=September 29, 2015 |first=Greg |last=Watry,|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |publisher=R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Make Trade Fair''' is a campaign organized by [[Oxfam|Oxfam International]] to promote [[trade justice]] and [[fair trade]] among governments, institutions, and multinational corporations.

==Objectives==
The campaign has focused on the elimination of several trade practices:

* [[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]], which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.   It is believed that this creates an uneven playing field where farmers in developing countries are unable to compete in the market with cheaper foreign produce and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm#|title=Rigged Rules - Dumping |accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tariffs]], where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Market Access|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040624/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unbalanced [[labour rights]] for women, who often perceive that they earn lower wages than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Labour Rights|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162419/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stringent [[patent]] issues, that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. [[Gene patent]]s, [[Chemical patent]]s, and [[Software patent]]s) from being lowered.  Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Patents|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322075359/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|archivedate=March 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key events==

===The Big Noise===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MakeTradeFairStipe.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|REM]] is "dumped" with milk to highlight dumping practices as part of the Big Noise petition]] --&gt;
Launched in April 2002, the Big Noise is a worldwide petition that calls for governments to help end unfair trade practices. By the end of 2005, some 17.8 million signatures have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm|title=Oxfam International  - Make Trade Fair |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104033924/http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm |archivedate = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desmond Tutu]] was the honorary 1 millionth signee to the petition in 2003.  Other celebrities who have lent their names to the petition include the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], and musicians [[Bono]] and [[Coldplay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |title=Make Trade Fair - Oxfam Global Petition Hits One Million Mark |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103065246/http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically [[Chris Martin]] who would, before performing on stage, draw an [[equal sign]] (mistaken by many to be a tattoo) on his hand. However, this could also be a reference to the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

The petition was also coupled with a popular photo campaign, where celebrities were "dumped" with various crops and foodstuffs to highlight the practice of [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], which some perceive to be unfair. [[Colin Firth]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Jamelia]], and [[Haile Gebrselassie]] were a few of the celebrities to take part in this venture.

===Make Trade Fair concerts===
In 2002 and 2004, special benefit concerts were held in [[London]] to promote the Make Trade Fair campaign.  Proceeds from the shows went to aid Oxfam's promotional campaigns. Produced by [[Emily Eavis]], [[Marianne Troup]], and [[Lily Sobhani]], performers from the 2002 "Fairplay" gig include [[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] from [[Coldplay]], [[Noel Gallagher]], and [[Ms. Dynamite]], while the 2004 event included Michael Stipe, [[Razorlight]], and [[The Thrills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/stars/mtf_concert.htm|title= 	
Make Trade Fair Concert 2004|accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, the Make Trade Fair support CD ''The Cake Sale'' was produced. The 9 songs were performed by [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Nina Persson]], [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Gemma Hayes]], [[Glen Hansard]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Conor Deasy]] and [[Neil Hannon]], and written by Deasy, Hansard, [[Emm Gryner]], [[Paul Noonan]], [[Ollie Cole]], [[Damien Rice]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |title=Make Trade Fair CD 2008 |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121174042/http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |archivedate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005===
The Make Trade Fair campaign was active at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]], held in [[Hong Kong]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Various demonstrations and activities were held, including the handover of some 17.8 million signatures on the Big Noise petition to WTO Director General [[Pascal Lamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|title=WTO summit photos|accessdate=February 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706203209/http%3A//www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|archivedate=July 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''maritime simulator''' or '''ship simulator''' is a system that [[simulation|simulates]] [[ship]]s and maritime environments for training, research and other purposes. Today, simulator training given by maritime schools and academies is part of the basic training of maritime professionals.

At minimum, a maritime simulator consists of a software that realistically simulates the dynamic behavior of a vessel and its systems in a simulated maritime environment and an interface that allows the person using the simulator to control the vessel and interact with its simulated surroundings. In case of so-called full mission bridge simulators, this interface consists of a realistic mock-up of the vessel's [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and control consoles, and screens or projectors providing up to 360-degree virtual view of the ship's surroundings similar to [[flight simulator]]s in the aviation industry. Without the real-time visualization, the simulation software can also be used for "fast time" simulations where the vessels are controlled by autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marin.nl/web/Facilities-Tools/Simulators/Simulator-Facilities/Fasttime-Simulators.htm Fast-time Simulators].

'''Media linguistics''' is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] study of media speech. It studies the functioning of [[language]] in the [[Mass media|media]] sphere, or the modern [[mass communication]] presented by print, audiovisual and networked media.

Media linguistics is being formed in the process of [[Differentiation (linguistics)|differentiation]] of [[linguistics]] as a general theory of language, and its term turned out to be in line with [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[developmental linguistics]], [[legal linguistics]], [[political linguistics]], etc.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

== Object ==
Modern media linguistics examines not only the language of media, but also media speech. Media linguistics includes such discipline as ''media speech studies'' that examines (1) the speech behavior of [[mass communication]] participants and (2) specific areas, textures and genres of media texts. 

Thus, in principle, media linguistics seeks to explain the particular case of the functioning of language—in mass communications with its complex structure and diverse trends of change—amid the overall trends of language and speech culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. &lt;I&gt;Language Problems and Language Planning, 34&lt;/i&gt;(2), 158-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Media linguistics is closely related to the contemporary media practices and intends to impact on them, in particular, by means of media education.

== In various countries ==
* In '''English-speaking countries''' the terms ''[[Media studies|media study]]'' and ''media [[discourse analysis]]'' are used, corresponding with such interdisciplinary approach as [[Critical discourse analysis]].

[[File:A cosmic megamaser.jpg|thumb|300px|A megamaser acts as an astronomical [[laser]] that beams out microwave emission rather than visible light (hence the ‘m’ replacing the ‘l’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A cosmic megamaser|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1652a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''megamaser''' is a type of [[astrophysical maser]], which is a naturally occurring source of [[stimulated emission|stimulated]] [[spectral line]] emission. Megamasers are distinguished from astrophysical masers by their large [[isotropic]] [[luminosity]]. Megamasers have typical luminosities of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]] ({{Solar luminosity}}), which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the [[Milky Way]], hence the prefix [[Mega-|mega]]. Likewise, the term '''kilomaser''' is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order {{Solar luminosity}}, or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, '''gigamaser''' is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, and '''extragalactic maser''' encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way. Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers, and the majority of megamasers are [[hydroxyl]] (OH) megamasers, meaning the [[spectral line]] being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule. There are known megamasers for three other molecules: [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO), and [[methine]] (CH).

Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in [[NGC 4945]], a galaxy in the nearby [[Centaurus A/M83 Group]]. The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in [[Arp 220]], which is the nearest [[luminous infrared galaxy|ultraluminous infrared galaxy]] to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of [[star formation]]. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the [[Milky Way]], including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The [[population inversion]] in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding [[interstellar dust]]. [[Zeeman splitting]] of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure [[magnetic field]]s in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.

Water megamasers and kilomasers are found primarily associated with [[active galactic nuclei]], while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers are found in star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not seem to be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the [[Hubble constant]].

==Background==
===Masers===
{{main|maser}} 
[[File:Stimulated Emission.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram showing the process of stimulated emission]]
The word maser derives from the acronym MASER, which stands for "[[microwave|'''M'''icrowave]] [[optical amplification|'''A'''mplification]] by [[Stimulated Emission|'''S'''timulated '''E'''mission]] of [[Radiation|'''R'''adiation]]". The maser is a predecessor to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of "microwave" with "light". Given a system of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] a [[photon]] and move to a higher [[energy level]], or the photon may [[stimulated emission|stimulate emission]] of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires [[population inversion]], which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in [[thermal equilibrium]], and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a [[photon]] with a [[photon energy]] corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, and there will be two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is [[monochromatic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Griffiths|Griffiths (2005)]], pp. 350–351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TownesNobelLecture"&gt;{{cite web

===Astrophysical masers===
{{main|astrophysical maser}}
Masers and lasers built on [[Earth]] and masers that occur in space both require population inversion in order to operate, but the conditions under which population inversion occurs are very different in the two cases. Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities, which limits the transitions that may be used for masing, and requires using a [[resonant cavity]] in order to bounce light back and forth many times. Astrophysical masers are at low densities, and naturally have very long path lengths. At low densities, being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions, meaning population inversion can occur. Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission, and produce amplification of a background source of radiation. These factors accumulate to "make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally. In radiative pumping, [[infrared]] photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce population inversion. In collisional pumping, this population inversion is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level, and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 628–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1965, twelve years after the first [[maser]] was built in a [[laboratory]], a hydroxyl (OH) maser was discovered in the plane of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Weaver1965"&gt;[[#Weaver1965|Weaver et al. (1965)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Masers of other [[molecule]]s were discovered in the Milky Way in the following years, including water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[silicon monoxide]] (SiO), and [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH).&lt;ref name="Reid1981"&gt;[[#Reid1981|Reid and Moran (1981)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical isotropic luminosity for these galactic masers is {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moran1976FAS"&gt;[[#Moran1976|Moran (1976)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first evidence for extragalactic masing was detection of the hydroxyl molecule in [[NGC 253]] in 1973, and was roughly ten times more luminous than galactic masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the first megamaser was discovered in the [[ultraluminous infrared galaxy]] [[Arp 220]].&lt;ref name="Baan1982"&gt;[[#Baan1982|Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The luminosity of the source, assuming it emits [[isotropic]]ally, is roughly {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This luminosity is roughly one hundred million times stronger than the typical maser found in the [[Milky Way]], and so the maser source in Arp 220 was called a megamaser.&lt;ref name="Baan1984"&gt;[[#Baan1984|Baan and Haschick (1984)]]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, extragalactic [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) masers were already known. In 1984, water maser emission was discovered in [[NGC 4258]] and [[NGC 1068]] that was of comparable strength to the hydroxyl maser in Arp 220, and are as such considered water megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, megamasers were also discovered for [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) and [[methine]] (CH). Galactic formaldehyde masers are relatively rare, and more formaldehyde megamasers are known than are galactic formaldehyde masers. Methine masers, on the other hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in galaxies in which hydroxyl had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption, while formaldehyde is found in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption as well as those with hydroxyl megamaser emission.&lt;ref name="Baan1993"&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, 109 hydroxyl megamaser sources were known, up to a [[cosmological redshift|redshift]] of &lt;math&gt;z \approx 0.27&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Chen2007"&gt;[[#Chen2007|Chen, Shan, and Gao (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] water masers are known,&lt;ref name="BraatzSite"&gt;{{cite web

and of these, 65 are bright enough to be considered megamasers.&lt;ref name="Lo 2005, p. 668"&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General requirements==
[[File:From microwaves to megamasers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Galaxies [[MCG+01-38-004]] (upper) and [[MCG+01-38-005]] (lower) - the microwave emissions from MCG+01-38-005 were used to calculate a refined value for the [[Hubble constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From microwaves to megamasers|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1735a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regardless of the masing molecule, there are a few requirements that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]], pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by the fact that there is no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water.&lt;ref name="Lo 2005, p. 668"/&gt; As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.

==Hydroxyl megamasers==
[[Arp 220]] hosts the first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy, and has been studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the prototype of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used as a guide for interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], pp. 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hosts and environment===
[[File:Galaxy arp 220.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Arp 220]], the prototypical hydroxyl megamaser host galaxy {{small|([[Hubble Space Telescope]])}}]]
Hydroxyl megamasers are found in the nuclear region of a class of [[galaxy|galaxies]] called [[luminous infrared galaxy|luminous infrared galaxies]] (LIRGs), with far infrared luminosities in excess of one hundred billion [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]], or L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;}} are favored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; These infrared luminosities are very large, but in many cases LIRGs are not particularly luminous in [[visible light]]. For instance, the ratio of infrared luminosity to luminosity in [[photometric system|blue light]] is roughly 80 for Arp 220, the first source in which a megamaser was observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the LIRGs show evidence of interaction with other galaxies or having recently experienced a [[galaxy merger]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andreasian1994|Andreasian and Alloin (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the same holds true for the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Megamaser hosts are rich in [[molecular cloud|molecular gas]] compared to [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], with molecular [[hydrogen]] masses in excess of one billion [[solar mass]]es, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Burdyuzha1990a_86"&gt;[[#Burdyuzha1990a|Burdyuzha and Vikulov (1990)]], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers help funnel molecular gas to the nuclear region of the LIRG, producing high molecular densities and stimulating high [[star formation]] rates characteristic of LIRGs. The starlight in turn heats [[interstellar dust|dust]], which re-radiates in the far infrared and produces the high L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; observed in hydroxyl megamaser hosts.&lt;ref name="Burdyuzha1990a_86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mirabel1987|Mirabel and Sanders (1987)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The dust temperatures derived from far infrared fluxes are warm relative to spirals, ranging from 40–90 K.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The far infrared luminosity and dust temperature of a LIRG both affect the likelihood of hosting an hydroxyl megamaser, through correlations between the dust temperature and far infrared luminosity, so it is unclear from observations alone what the role of each is in producing hydroxyl megamasers. LIRGs with warmer dust are more likely to host hydroxyl megamasers, as are ULIRGs, with L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; {{Solar luminosity|10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;}}. At least one out of three ULIRGs hosts an hydroxyl megamaser, as compared with roughly one out of six LIRGs.&lt;ref name="Darling2002_p117"&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Early observations of hydroxyl megamasers indicated a correlation between the isotropic hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity, with L&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baan 1989"&gt;[[#Baan1989|Baan (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As more hydroxyl megamasers were discovered, and care was taken to account for the [[Malmquist bias]], this observed relationship was found to be flatter, with L&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;FIR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.2&lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;0.1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Darling2002_p118"&gt;[[#Darling2002|Darling and Giovanelli (2002)]], pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early spectral classification of the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers indicated that the properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as [[starburst galaxy|starburst galaxies]], one quarter are classified as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert 2 galaxies]], and the remainder are classified as [[low-ionization nuclear emission-line region]]s, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not [[statistical significance|significantly]] different.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2006|Darling and Giovanelli (2006)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent infrared observations using the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an [[active galactic nucleus]], compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.&lt;ref name="Willett 2011"&gt;[[#Willett2011|Willett et al. (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers may be distinguished from the general population of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular [[hydrogen]], and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas [[density|densities]] greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) relative to the luminosity of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2007|Darling (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line characteristics===
[[File:Arp220 OHmegamaser.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The 1665 and 1667 MHz maser lines in [[Arp 220]], which have been [[redshift]]ed to lower frequencies {{small|([[Arecibo Observatory]] data)}}]]
The emission of hydroxyl megamasers occurs predominantly in the so-called "main lines" at 1665 and 1667 [[megahertz|MHz]]. The hydroxyl molecule also has two "satellite lines" that emit at 1612 and 1720&amp;nbsp;MHz, but few hydroxyl megamasers have had satellite lines detected. Emission in all known hydroxyl megamasers is stronger in the 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz line; typical ratios of the flux in the 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz line to the 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz line, called the hyperfine ratio, range from a minimum of 2 to greater than 20.&lt;ref name="Randell 1995 p. 660"&gt;[[#Randell1995|Randell et al. (1995)]], p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; For hydroxyl emitting in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], this ratio will range from 1.8 to 1, depending upon the [[optical depth]], so line ratios greater than 2 are indicative of a population out of thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Baan1982_p51"&gt;[[#Baan1982|Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982)]], p. L51.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers in [[star formation|star-forming]] regions, where the 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz line is typically strongest, and hydroxyl masers around [[stellar evolution|evolved stars]], in which the 1612&amp;nbsp;MHz line is often strongest, and of the main lines, 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz emission is frequently stronger than 1612&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid1981|Reid and Moran (1981)]], pp. 247–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The total width of emission at a given [[Frequency#Physics of light|frequency]] is typically many hundreds of kilometers per second, and individual features that make up the total emission profile have widths ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Randell 1995 p. 660"/&gt; These may also be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers, which typically have linewidths of order a kilometer per second or narrower, and are spread over a velocity of a few to tens of kilometers per second.&lt;ref name="Baan1982_p51" /&gt;

The radiation amplified by hydroxyl masers is the [[radio astronomy|radio]] continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of [[synchrotron radiation]] produced by [[Type II supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan2006|Baan and Klockner (2006)]], p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, ranging from a few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baan1993|Baan (1993)]], p. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hydroxyl megamasers, including Arp 220, have been observed with [[very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher [[angular resolution]]. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics are similar to those seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667&amp;nbsp;MHz to flux at 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lonsdale1998|Lonsdale et al. (1998)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diamond1999|Diamond et al. (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one [[parsec]] that give rise to the compact emission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parra2005|Parra et al. (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parra2005|Parra et al. (2005)]], p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumping mechanism===
The observed relationship between the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped.&lt;ref name="Baan 1989"/&gt; Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present a problem with this model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lonsdale1998|Lonsdale et al. (1998)]], pp. L15–L16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 985.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 [[micrometre]]s are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockett2008|Lockett and Elitzur (2008)]], p. 991.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent observations with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] confirm this basic picture, but there are still some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] for megamaser emission.&lt;ref name="Willett 2011"/&gt;

===Applications===
Hydroxyl megamasers occur in the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and appear to be a marker in the stage of the [[galaxy formation|formation of galaxies]]. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] by [[interstellar dust]] in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Darling2005|Darling (2005)]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[cosmological redshift|redshifts]] of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Burdyuzha1990b|Burdyuzha and Komberg (1990)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 656–657.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detection of the [[Zeeman effect]] in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robishaw2008|Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008)]], p. 981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a [[spectral line]] due to the presence of a [[magnetic field]], and the size of the splitting is linearly [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robishaw2008|Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water megamasers==
Whereas hydroxyl megamasers seem to be fundamentally distinct in some ways from galactic hydroxyl masers, water megamasers do not seem to require conditions too dissimilar from galactic water masers. Water masers stronger than galactic water masers, some of which are strong enough to be classified "mega" masers, may be described by the same [[luminosity function]] as galactic water masers. Some extragalactic water masers occur in star forming regions, like galactic water masers, while stronger water masers are found in the circumnuclear regions around [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN). The isotropic luminosities of these span a range of order one to a few hundred {{Solar luminosity}}, and are found in nearby galaxies like [[Messier 51]] ({{Solar luminosity|0.8}}) and more distant galaxies like [[NGC 4258]] ({{Solar luminosity|120}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1992Book|Elitzur (1992)]], p. 314–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Line characteristics and pumping mechanism===
Water maser emission is observed primarily at 22&amp;nbsp;GHz, due to a transition between [[rotational spectroscopy|rotational energy level]]s in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lo2005|Lo (2005)]], pp. 629–630.&lt;/ref&gt; Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind [[shock wave]]s propagating through dense regions in the [[interstellar medium]]. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elitzur1999|Elitzur, Hollenbach, &amp; McKee (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Water megamasers may be used to provide accurate distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a [[Keplerian orbit]], measuring the [[centripetal acceleration]] and [[velocity]] of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the [[angular diameter]] measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herrnstein1999|Herrnstein et al. (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the [[Hubble constant]] that does not rely upon use of [[standard candle]]s. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the [[Hubble flow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid2009|Reid et al. (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a [[supermassive black hole]]. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the [[M-sigma relation]], an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic bulge]]s and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kuo2011|Kuo et al. (2011)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesopredators often vary in ecosystems depending on the food web.

== The Mesopredator Release Effect==
When populations of [[apex predator]]s decrease, populations of mesopredators often increase. This is the [[mesopredator release effect]]. "Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When apex predators are removed from the ecosystem, this gives the mesopredator have less competition and conflict. They are able to catch more prey and have fewer causes of death. Often times mesopredators can take over the role as apex predators. This happens when new species are introduced into an ecosystem or when species leave or are killed off of an ecosystem. When this happens, and the new apex predator or former mesopredator, becomes the new species on top of the food chain, it is important to remember that they are not ecologically identical to the former apex predator, and is likely a smaller species having different effects on the structure and stability of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mesopredators that become the new apex predators are the species that benefit from this mesopredator release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apex predators reduce mesopredator populations, and change mesopredator behaviors and habitat choices, by preying on and intimidating mesopredators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Euan G.|last2=Johnson|first2=Christopher N.|date=2009-09-01|title=Predator interactions, mesopredator release and biodiversity conservation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=9|pages=982–998|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in any ecosystem with any type of relationship between predator and prey. However, in the case of the relationship between apex predator and mesopredator, it could mean that the apex predator causes the mesopredator to leave the ecosystem, again, creating room for a new species to become mesopredator. 

Mesopredator outbreaks are increasing over the last little while in fragmented habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by a few reasons. A main cause is by the disappearance of apex species within the habitat. Apex species are usually larger animals who require a bigger area and will often leave if the habitat is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the apex predator leaves the ecosystem, the former mesopredator will become the new apex predator, and a new species becomes the mesopredator. Another cause created also created by the apex predators being larger animals is that they will often have more encounters with humans, leaving them more susceptible to harmful conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These harmful conflicts can either cause the apex predator to leave the ecosystem in fear of danger, or if the situation is extreme enough, the humans will have killed off the apex predator from their habitat. Again, this is another example showing how the role of mesopredator and apex predator is constantly changing. Another reason why mesopredator outbreaks are becoming more popular is because of certain resources being added in fragmented areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources such as pet food, trash, crop, and crop pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources often appear when development is occurring on land near the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario is the most ideal for mesopredator outbreaks to occur.

[[File:Postilion.png|thumb|300px|right|This English etching from 1793 shows a postillion mounted on the front left horse]]
"'''My [[postillion]] has been struck by lightning'''", "'''Our postillion has been struck by lightning'''", and other variations on the same pattern, are often given as examples of the ridiculous phrases supposed to have been found in [[phrase book]]s or language instruction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The word ''postillion'' may occur in its alternative spelling ''[[postilion]]''.

Although various forms of the sentence are widely cited, the exact wording and the context in which it is said to have originally been used vary.  For example, a teaching manual attributes it to a Portuguese-English phrasebook:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language

|isbn=0-415-05882-1
|page=41
|edition=2nd
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIancY-fnR0C
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase-book for Portuguese learners of English which included the often-quoted and bizarre sentence  'Pardon me, but '''your postillion has been struck by lightning'''' demonstrates a total lack of sense of context: who can have said this, to whom and in what circumstances?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By contrast a linguistics textbook mentions the supposedly "apocryphal" phrase during a description of foreign language teaching in "the schoolrooms of Europe at the close of the nineteenth century":&lt;ref&gt;

|pages=31–32
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]entences—especially constructed to contain only the grammar and vocabulary which had already been covered—were laboriously translated, in writing, into and out of the student's first language. Such sentences, often bizarrely remote from any conceivable use, have been the occasion for jokes ever since.  We have probably all heard references to the apocryphal "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''" and the infamous ''[[La plume de ma tante (linguistics)|plume de ma tante]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
During the nineteenth century, publishers began producing multilingual phrase-books for businessmen and wealthy travellers. An early example is Georg Wolfrum's ''Handbuch für Jünglinge'' (1825), which gives English, German, French and Italian versions of "Are the postilions insolent?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same question is found in [[Baedeker]]'s ''Conversationsbuch für Reisende''.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]'s ''Handbook of Travel-Talk'' (1847) includes a section entitled "Accidents on a Journey".  It gives English, French, German and Italian translation suggestions for a variety of mishaps which might befall a traveller, such as one's postillion becoming injured, or finding oneself in stormy weather:&lt;ref&gt;

Oh, dear! The postilion has been thrown (off) down.&lt;br&gt;

I am afraid he has broken his leg {{--}} his arm.&lt;br&gt;
He has been bruised on his head.&lt;br&gt;
He must be carried home gently.&lt;br&gt;
It rains in torrents.&lt;br&gt;
It lightens{{--}}it thunders.

A theatre review in the September 14, 1889 issue of the London illustrated weekly ''The Graphic'' includes a phrase very similar to the one under discussion, attributing it to Murray's travel guide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=The Graphic |date=1889-09-14 |title=Theatres |page=335 |location=London |volume=xl |issue=1033 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Graphic_1889-09-14_335.png}}; emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The proprietor of the {{sc|Greenwich}} Theatre has hit on the notion of ornamenting his playbills with a picture of the house, on which every exit is marked in conspicuous fashion.  Somebody has objected that in the face of fire or panic no one would be likely to consult this guide to the methods of escape.  This reminds one of the criticism of a gentleman on Mr. Murray's "Travel Talk," when he found the exclamation, "'''Dear me, our postillion has been struck dead by lightning!'''" set forth for his convenience in four languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The August 30, 1916 issue of the [[United Kingdom|British]] magazine [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] includes this item:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019661831?urlappend=%3Bseq=170 ''Punch'', August 30, 1916; v. 151, p.162, col. 3]; emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; An officer serving in the Balkans writes to say that he has just come across a Hungarian-English phrase-book which starts with the useful phrase, "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another usage of the phrase occurs in a 1932 book entitled ''Little Missions'', written by "Septimus Despencer":&lt;ref&gt;Despencer (1932), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was my fortune once to be marooned for twenty-four hours in a siding of a railway station in what is now [[Yugoslavia|Jugoslavia]] but was then South Hungary.   I wandered into the village, and in the village shop which sold everything I found a dozen of old second-hand books.  One of them was a Magyar-English Manual of Conversation containing useful phrases such as every traveller needs to know. The first section was headed  'On the road', and the first sentence in it (which I instantly mastered) was: ''''Dear me, our postilion has been struck by lightning'''.'  This is the sort of thing that only happens in Hungary; and, when it happens, this is the sort of remark that only Hungarians make.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to its introduction, the travels reported in the book occurred during "[t]he three years following the armistice of 1918":&lt;ref&gt;
Despencer (1932), [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/paultabaka/0/etc/despencer/septimus.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:19:34 p. 5]; emphasis added.
&lt;/ref&gt; thus Despencer's discovery of the phrase would be dated during the period 1919-1921.  In the April 2008 issue of the ''Quote ... Unquote'' newsletter, Nigel Rees speculates that the phrase "passed into general circulation" from Despencer's book.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable sightings==
In [[James Thurber]]'s 1937 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "There's No Place Like Home", a phrasebook from "the era of Imperial Russia" contains the "magnificent" line: "Oh, dear, our postillion has been struck by lightning!".  Thurber speculates that such a "fantastic piece of disaster" must have been rare, "even in the days of the Czars".&lt;ref name="thurber"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thurber heard of the quote from "an writer in a London magazine".&lt;ref name="thurber"/&gt;

In [[James Michener]]'s 1954 novel [[Sayonara]], the heroine Hana-Ogi tries to learn a little English from a phrasebook to communicate with her American lover and based on its recommendation starts with this phrase, much to his bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, the author laments the death in a thunderstorm of "the best postilion I ever had".

In 1977 actor [[Dirk Bogarde]] titled the first volume of his autobiography ''A Postillion Struck By Lightning''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bogarde, he heard of the sentence while on a childhood holiday in France.  It came from an old French phrase-book belonging to the nanny of another family.&lt;ref&gt;Bogarde, op. cit., pp. 102, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 paper, linguist [[David Crystal]] defined "postilion sentences" as "sentences introduced in teaching [that] seem to have little or no chance of ever being used in real life".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  They are named after the phrase "The postilion has been struck by lightning", which Crystal describes as a famous example of such a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to suggest that "an unexpectedly large number of sentences, used routinely with children with language impairment, are of this type",&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and gives as examples "That table's got four legs", and "Clap (your) hands!".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that, "if teaching and therapeutic time is to be truly efficacious", postilion sentences should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NIMBY''' (an [[acronym]] for the phrase "'''Not In My Back&lt;!-- Do Not Remove This Space.--&gt;  &lt;!--It is correct, and otherwise would be NIMB, which would clearly be wrong--&gt;Yard'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/nimby |title= Cambridge Dictionaries Online - meaning of NIMBY |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Nimby |title= Oxford Dictionaries - definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''Nimby''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/nimby |publisher= Macmillan Dictionary |title= Definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a characterization of opposition by residents to a proposed development in their local area. It often carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them, and that they would tolerate or support it if it was built further away. The residents are often called '''Nimbys''', and their viewpoint is called '''Nimbyism'''.

Examples of projects likely to be opposed include any sort of [[housing development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/mayor-of-london/10984944/Boris-Johnson-Nimbies-pretend-to-care-about-architecture-to-block-developments.html |title= Boris Johnson: Nimbies pretend to care about architecture to block developments |author=Matthew Holehouse |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle]] and [[Pedestrian crossing|pedestrian]] [[Sidewalk|infrastructure]], [[skyscraper]]s, [[homeless shelters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |title= Anywhere but here |date= 28 August 2015 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |author= Andrew Galvin |newspaper= OC Weekly |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160130210045/http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |archive-date= 30 January 2016 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[oil well]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[industrial park]]s, [[military base]]s, [[fracking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/04/fracking-resistance-southern-nimbys-minister |title= Fracking will meet resistance from southern nimbys, minister warns |author= Patrick Wintour |date= 4 August 2013 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind turbines]], [[desalination plant]]s, [[Landfill|landfill sites]], [[Incineration|incinerators]], [[power plant]]s, [[Quarry|quarries]], [[prison]]s,&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web |url= http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nimby |title= Dictionary and Thesaurus - Merriam-Webster |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pub]]s, [[Strip club|adult entertainment clubs]], [[Music venue|concert venues]], [[Gun shop|firearms dealers]], [[Cell site|mobile phone masts]], [[Transmission Tower |electricity pylons]], [[abortion clinic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/24/what-north-dakota-and-mississippi-reveal-about-anti-choice-nimbyism-and-hypocrisy/ |title=What North Dakota and Mississippi Reveal About Anti-Choice NIMBYism and Hypocrisy |first=Amanda |last=Marcotte |work=RH Reality Check |date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orphanage|children's homes]], [[Nursing home care|nursing homes]], [[youth hostel]]s, [[Stadium|sports stadiums]], [[shopping mall]]s, [[retail park]]s, [[Rail transport|railways]], [[road]]s, [[airport]]s, [[Port|seaports]], [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste repositories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/businessspecial3/07nuke.html?_r=0 |title= Radioactive Nimby: No one wants nuclear waste |author= James Kanter |date=7 November 2007 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weapons of mass destruction|storage for weapons of mass destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13176440.Trident_removal_is_a_Nimby_position/ |title= Trident removal is a Nimby position |date=24 August 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Herald |author=Mick Common |location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|cannabis dispensaries]], [[Cannabis shop|recreational cannabis shops]] and the accommodation of persons applying for asylum, refugees (e.g. of war) and displaced persons (e.g. Jews during/after [[the Holocaust]]).

The NIMBY concept may also be applied to people who advocate some proposal (e.g., budget cuts, tax increases, layoffs, immigration or energy conservation) but oppose implementing it in a way that might affect their lives or require any sacrifice on their part.

==Claimed rationale==
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

* Infrastructure development, such as new roads and [[motorway service areas]], [[light rail]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] lines, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, airports, [[power plant]]s, retail developments, sales of public assets, [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission lines]], [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]], [[landfill]]s, [[sewage treatment|sewage outfalls]] and [[prison]]s;
* The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from [[mining|mines]], [[quarries]] and [[oil well]]s or [[gas well]]s, respectively;
* [[renewable energy]] generators, such as [[wind farm]]s and [[solar panel]]s;
* businesses trading in goods perceived as [[immoral]], such as [[pornographic film|adult video]], [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] [[liquor store|stores]], and [[medical cannabis|medical]] [[marijuana|cannabis]] [[dispensaries]];
* accommodations perceived as primarily benefitting disadvantaged people, such as [[subsidized housing]] for the [[poverty|financially disadvantaged]], [[supportive housing]] for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[halfway house]]s for drug addicts and [[criminal]]s, and [[homeless shelter]]s for those with [[homeless|no fixed address]];
* services catering to certain stigmatised groups (for example, [[addiction|injection drug users]]), such as [[methadone clinic]]s, [[syringe exchange programme]]s, [[drug detoxification]] facilities, [[supervised injection site]]; 
* large-scale developments of all kinds, such as [[big-box store]]s and housing [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s.

The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

* ''Increased traffic:''  More jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or [[landfill]]s often increase the volume of truck traffic.
* ''Harm to locally owned [[small business]]es:''  The development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less travelled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation costs, or to loss of respected local businesses.
* ''Loss of residential property value:''  Homes near an undesirable development may be less desirable for potential buyers. The lost revenue from property taxes may, or may not, be offset by increased revenue from the project.
* ''[[Environmental pollution]] of land, air, and water:''  Power plants, factories, chemical facilities, [[crematorium]]s, [[sewage treatment facilities]], airports, and similar projects may, or may be claimed to, contaminate the land, air, or water around them. Especially facilities assumed to smell might cause objections.
* ''[[Light pollution]]:''  Projects that operate at night, or that include security lighting (such as street lights in a parking lot), may be accused of causing light pollution.
* ''[[Noise pollution]]:''  In addition to the noise of traffic, a project may inherently be noisy. This is a common objection to [[Windmill syndrome|wind power]], [[Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact#Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions|airports]], roads, and many industrial facilities, but also stadiums, [[music festival|festivals]], and [[nightclub]]s which are particularly noisy at night when locals want to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102034/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Visual blight and failure to "blend in" with the surrounding architecture:''  The proposed project might be ugly or particularly large, or cast a [[shadow]] over an area due to its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/2/20/10141252/hundreds-fret-about-superscrapers-shadows-as-extell-rebuts|title=Hundreds Fret About Superscrapers' Shadows As Extell Rebuts|first=|last=Curbed|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Loss of a community's [[new urbanism|small-town feel]]:'' Proposals that might result in new people moving into the community, such as a plan to build many new houses, are often claimed to change the community's character.
* ''Strain of public resources and schools:''  This reason is given for any increase in the local area's population, as additional school facilities might be needed for the additional children, but particularly to projects that might result in certain kinds of people joining the community, such as a [[group home]] for people with disabilities, or immigrants.
* ''Disproportionate benefit to non-locals:'' The project appears to benefit distant people, such as investors (in the case of commercial projects like factories or big-box stores) or people from neighboring areas (in the case of regional government projects, such as airports, highways, sewage treatment, or landfills).
* ''Increases in crime:'' This is usually applied to projects that are perceived as attracting or employing low-skill workers or racial minorities, as well as projects that cater to people who are thought to often commit crimes, such as the mentally ill, the poor, and drug addicts. Additionally, certain types of projects, such as [[Bar (establishment)|pubs]] or [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries, might be perceived as directly increasing the amount of crime in the area.
*''Risk of an (environmental) disaster'', such as with drilling operations, chemical industry, [[dams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esydBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=dam&amp;f=false|title=Nimby Is Beautiful: Cases of Local Activism and Environmental Innovation Around the World|first1=Carol|last1=Hager|first2=Mary Alice|last2=Haddad|date=30 March 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nuclear power plants.
* ''Historic areas:'' The affected area is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], because of its many older properties that are being preserved as such.

Generally, many NIMBY objections are guessed or feared, because objections are more likely to be successful before the construction start. It is often too late to object to the project after its completion, since new additions are unlikely to be reversed.
As hinted by the list, protests can occur for opposite reasons. A new road or shopping center can cause increased traffic and work opportunities for some, and decreased traffic for others, harming local businesses.

People in an area affected by plans sometimes form an organization which can collect money and organize the objection activities. NIMBYists can hire a lawyer to do formal [[appeal]]s, and contact media to gain public support for their case.

==Origin and history==

The word appears in a June 1980 newspaper article from [[Virginia]], with the origin of the phrase explanained thus: {{quote|Some call it the Nimby Syndrome.  That's Nimby, as in "Not-in-my-back-yard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA |date=1980-06-29 |issue=181 |volume=85 |page=1 |title=No One Wants Backyard Nuclear Dump |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24587650/nimby_1980/ |first=Ernie |last=Gates  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The phrase '"not in my back yard" syndrome', without the acronym, is found from February of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The 'not in my back yard' syndrome is a compound of fears about health, safety, and environmental quality |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/enviroviews2n6/page/4 |title=Hazardous Wastes |first=Gillian |last=Sniatynski |work=Environment Views |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=February-March 1980  |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' earliest citation is a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' article from November 1980, although even there the author indicates the term is already used in the hazardous waste industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/nimby.asp|title=NIMBY - Word Spy|first=Word|last=Spy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1106/110653.html|title=Hazardous waste|first=Emilie Travel|last=Livezey|date=6 November 1980|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept behind the term, that of locally organized resistance to unwanted land uses, is likely to have originated earlier. One suggestion is it emerged in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorino, Al. (22 March 2011)  [http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5384/do-you-have-control-over-nimbyism/ "Do You Have Control Over NIMBYism?"] ''Biomass Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was popularized by British politician [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], who was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Comedian [[George Carlin]] used the term in a comedy skit, implying that people had already heard of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43Egm0j_p1A |title=George Carlin on N.I.M.B.Y. |publisher=''YouTube'' |format=video |accessdate=25 April 2012 |quote=We &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; got somethin' in this country (you've heard of it) -- it's called NIMBY -- n-i-m-b-y -- Not In My BackYard!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIMBY acronym has also been used by social scientists since the early 1980s to describe the resistance of communities to the siting of controversial facilities and land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Borell |first= Klas |last2= Westermark |first2= Åsa |date= 31 October 2016 |title= Siting of human services facilities and the not in my back yard phenomenon: a critical research review |journal= Community Development Journal |doi= 10.1093/cdj/bsw039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
''NIMBY'' and its derivative terms ''NIMBYism'', ''NIMBYs'', and ''NIMBYists'', refer implicitly to debates of development generally or to a specific case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1968870.ece You can’t park here: it’s my retreat, says ‘Nimby’ Clooney] (''[[The Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not in My Neighborhood===
The term ''Not in My Neighborhood'' (or ''NIMN'') is also frequently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hull
 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966534,00.html
 | work = Time | publisher = Time Inc | title = Not In My Neighborhood
 | date = 25 January 1988 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "NIMN" additionally refers to legislative actions or private agreements made with the sole purpose of maintaining racial identity within a particular neighborhood or residential area by forcefully keeping members of other races from moving into the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scharper|first1=Diane|title=Ex-Sun author traces bigotry's role in shaping Baltimore|journal=The Baltimore Sun|date=21 March 2010|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-21/entertainment/bal-ae.bk.neighborhood21mar21_1_blacks-and-jews-rouse-white-woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, "Not in My Neighborhood," by author and journalist Antero Pietila, describes the toll NIMN politics had on housing conditions in Baltimore throughout the 20th century and the systemic, racially based citywide separation it caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietila|first1=Antero|title=Not in my neighborhood : how bigotry shaped a great American city|date=2010|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=1566638437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIABY===
Opposition to certain developments as inappropriate anywhere in the world is characterised by the acronym ''NIABY'' ("Not In Anyone's Backyard"). The building of [[nuclear power plant]]s, for example, is often subject to NIABY concerns.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"&gt;[http://www.translationconference.com/2008_eload/droth_julia_en.pdf translationconference.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAMBI===
''NAMBI'' ("Not Against My Business or Industry") is used as a label for any business concern that expresses umbrage with actions or policy that threaten that business, whereby they are believed to be complaining about the principle of the action or policy only for their interests alone and not for all similar business concerns who would equally suffer from the actions or policies.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"/&gt; The term serves as a criticism of the kind of outrage that business expresses when disingenuously portraying its protest to be for the benefit of all other businesses. Such a labelling would occur, for example, when opposition expressed by a business involved in urban development is challenged by activists&amp;nbsp;– causing the business to in turn protest and appealing for support from fellow businesses lest they also find themselves challenged where they seek urban development. This term also serves as a rhetorical counter to NIMBY. Seen as an equivalent to NIMBY by those opposing the business or industry in question.

===BANANA===
''BANANA'' is an acronym for "Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything" (or "Anyone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/l-absolute-banana-756593.html|title=Absolute Banana|date=23 December 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/152|title=From NIMBYs To DUDEs: The Wacky World Of Plannerese|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain [[advocacy groups]] to [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/banana.asp BANANA] at Wordspy&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent opposition of some [[activist]]s to every instance of proposed development suggests that they seek a complete absence of new growth. The term is commonly used within the context of [[Land use planning|planning]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Sunderland City Council]] lists the term in their online dictionary of jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|title=Sunderland City Council|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508043826/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|archivedate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIBBY===
''PIBBY'' is an acronym for "Place In Blacks' Back Yard." This principle indicates that the people with social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people might not want to hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The [[environmental justice]] movement has pointed out Nimbyism leads to [[environmental racism]]. [[Robert D. Bullard]], Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James B.

===SOBBY===
''SOBBY'' is an acronym for  "Some Other Bugger's Back Yard" and refers to the state of mind which agrees that a particular project may be desirable and perhaps necessary – but only if it is placed somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Liz|title=Move over Yuppies - the Magpies have arrived|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/2014/03/05/move-over-yuppies-the-magpies-have-arrived/|website=dictionaryblog.cambridge.org|publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of debate==
Although often used rather pejoratively, the use of the concept NIMBY and similar terms have been critiqued. For instance, the term is frequently used to dismiss groups as selfish or ill-informed, yet these same groups may have virtues that are overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcclymont|first=Katie|last2=O'hare|first2=Paul|date=1 June 2008|title="We're not NIMBYs!" Contrasting local protest groups with idealised conceptions of sustainable communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549830701803273|journal=Local Environment|volume=13|issue=4|pages=321–335|doi=10.1080/13549830701803273|issn=1354-9839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of development ===
Frequently argued debate points in favor of development include higher employment, tax revenue, marginal cost of remote development, safety, and environmental benefits. Proponents of development may accuse locals of [[egotism]], [[elitism]], parochialism, [[drawbridge mentality]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Multiculturalism|diversity]], the inevitability of criticism, and misguided or unrealistic claims of prevention of [[urban sprawl]]. If people who don't want to be disturbed see the general need of an establishment, such as an airport, they generally suggest another location. But seen from society's perspective, the other location might not be better, since people living there get disturbed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdner, A. &amp; Borell, K. 2003. Neighbourhood Reactions toward Facilities for Residential Care: A Swedish Survey Study. ''Journal of Community Practice'' 11(4):59-81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of local sovereignty ===
Those labeled as NIMBYs may have a variety of motivations and may be unified only because they oppose a particular project. For example, some may oppose any significant change or development, regardless of type, purpose, or origin. Others, if the project is seen as being imposed by outsiders, may hold strong principles of [[self-governance]], local [[sovereignty]], local autonomy, and [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. These people believe that local people should have the final choice, and that any project affecting the local people should clearly benefit themselves, rather than corporations with distant investors or central governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Impact of Corporations on the Commons'', Address by Mary Zepernick at the Harvard Divinity School's Theological Opportunities Program, 21 October 2004, [http://www.poclad.org/?pg=Articles&amp;show=a041021.txt poclad.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still others may object to a particular project because of its nature, e.g., opposing a nuclear power plant over fear of radiation, but accepting a local [[waste management]] facility as a municipal necessity.

The plant would offer 75 jobs to the community of roughly 5,900 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/negative-feedback-towards-new-development-in-n-s-community-1.1191335 |title=Negative feedback towards new development in N.S. community |publisher=CTV Atlantic News |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the municipal councilors of Chester, Nova Scotia, approved the building of wind turbines in the area in a 6–1 vote, despite some local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/15/ns-south-canoe-approved.html |title=Chester approves Nova Scotia's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|nail house}}

In China there were many famous cases of nail houses, including one property holdout who had expressways built around and completely encircled his apartment building in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Varinsky | first=Dana | title=The owners of these defiant 'nail houses' in China refuse to give in to developers | website=Business Insider | date=2016-08-20 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-chinese-nail-houses-2016-8 | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China's 'nail houses': The homeowners who refused to budge | website=CNN | date=2015-05-19 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/asia/gallery/china-nail-houses/index.html | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
When Christian Zheng Sheng College, a correctional school for young drug addicts, opened in 1998, several people called it an eyesore. In June 2009, residents of Mui Wo voiced objection when they announced they are planning to move their campus into an empty school building there.

===Italy===
The [[No TAV]] opposition to the [[Turin–Lyon high-speed railway]] is often characterized as a NIMBY movement.

===Japan===
The Muraiken Undō or [[No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement]], was a government funded Japanese public health and social movement which began between 1929 and 1934.

In 2001, when the leprosy prevention law was ruled unconstitutional, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Welfare, and the National Diet published statements of apology to leprosy patients and their families. Several prefectural governors made apologies at public sanatoriums.

Two famous incidents where NIMBY's ruled over Greater Tokyo interests. [[Shinkansen]] have been extensively engineered to mitigate impacts of [[tunnel boom]] due to complaints by nearby residents, such that Japan is the only country with such strict regulations (and accompanying financial burdens) on tunnel and aerodynamic designs.  This is one of the key reasons there are so many Shinkansen trainset designs that have been developed.

==== Narita Airport ====
One is the farmers of [[Narita International Airport]], the metropolis' only international link to the outside world, who resisted since 1974 any tiny bit of land allocation.  Originally the plan for the airport also includes a [[Narita Shinkansen|high speed railway]] line that was scrapped.  The NIMBYs additionally prevented extension of the congested airport's very short 2nd runway (unusable for anything but short haul [[Narrow-body aircraft]]) until the late 2000s, when finally cross town [[Haneda Airport]] was opened to international traffic as additional runways on landfill were completed at many billions of dollars of extra costs, as the 2nd runway was lengthened to 2,500 meters.  The 2nd Narita runway still runs short of its original 1974 blueprints and impacts airport operational capacity.

==== Odakyu Double Tracking ====
[[Odakyu Electric Railway]], now providing transit along a corridor with 5 million people living in walking distance of its rail and feeder bus service area&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;, was originally built prewar era, and as the city of Tokyo's population ballooned rail demand in suburbs exploded.  By 1960s, [[Pusher (railway station attendant)|''oshiya'' pushers]] were required to squash people into packed trains, and Odakyu Railway sought to expand its two-track lines to four&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"&gt;https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/How-do-railways-figure-out-congestion-on-their-trains-&lt;/ref&gt;, thus allowing more passing trains and faster run times as well as less crowding and congestive wait and hold of trains.  NIMBY residents aside the line in [[Setagaya]] ward fought off attempts by the railway to acquire land, Odakyu did not want to make a scene so they attempted to buy land one by one by offering high prices.  The Setagaya Residents' opposition set the stage for a long-term and remarkable NIMBY cases in the courts and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;https://science-train.com/w/Odakyu_Electric_Railway/History.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1993, after 3 decades of trying, it was apparent this plan was failing, and the company decided to go for an multi-billion dollar solution: tunneling two lines underground, and then adding back two new lines stacked on top, to make 4 tracks in each direction for 12 stations and 10.4 km, instead of acquiring the land.&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;  The company's decision began in 1993 and completed in 2004 for 1 critical section, meanwhile, for the 2nd smaller section, this same decision was made in 2003 with project completion finally approaching fruition in March 2018, nearly 6 decades later.&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odakyu"&gt;http://www.odakyu.jp/ir/shared/pdf/annual/2015/fukufuku.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Ashtead, Surrey====
In the affluent [[England|English]] village of [[Ashtead]], [[Surrey]], which lies on the outskirts of [[London]], residents objected in 2007&lt;ref name="ylg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/epsomnews/display.var.1558300.0.0.php|title=No heroes in my backyard|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the conversion of a large, [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million residential property into a family support centre for relatives of wounded British service personnel. The house was to be purchased by a registered charity, [[SSAFA|SSAFA Forces Help]].&lt;ref name="ylg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html ''Headley Court Families Accommodation'' (SSAFA Forces Help)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090820/http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=468619&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=Smart school uniforms linked to academic success of UK's schools|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents objected to the proposal out of fear of increased traffic and noise, as well as the possibility of an increased threat of terrorism. They also contended that the SSAFA charity is actually a business, thereby setting an unwelcome precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mole-valley.gov.uk/cwi/getDocument?docId=112803&amp;account=planning&amp;amp;ref=MO/2007/0863&amp;filename=Letter%20of%20Representation|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local newspapers ran articles titled "Nimby neighbours' war with wounded soldiers' families" and "No Heroes in my Backyard."

Ex-servicemen and several members of the British general public organised a petition in support of SSAFA, and even auctioned the "Self Respect of Ashtead" on [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3641566/Legless-boys-mammas-Not-in-Ashtead.html | work=telegraph.co.uk | title=Legless boys' mammas?

====High Speed 2====
Particularly in the run up to the final decision on the route of the high-speed railway known as [[High Speed 2]], BBC News Online reported that many residents of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12037578|title=The farm lying in the path of the new rail route|date=20 December 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12002171|title=Tory vs Tory on high speed rail|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Labour MP [[Natascha Engel]]—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a "passionate defence of nimbyism" in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/chan24.pdf|date=26 June 2013|speaker=[[Natascha Engel]]|house=House of Commons|column_start=378|column_end=380|volume=565|no=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS2 has also been characterised by residents of the [[Chilterns]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] making arguments against the supposed lack of a business case for the line, often as a smokescreen for NIMBYism. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden's NIMBYs were successful in their campaign to derail the HS1–HS2 link railway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26604074&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heathrow Airport====
In November 2007 a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway and a sixth terminal and it was controversially&lt;ref name="Ref_2009"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/01/15/heathrow.third.runway/index.html | work=CNN | title=Britain: Third Heathrow runway approved despite opposition - CNN.com | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved on 15 January 2009 by UK Government ministers.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7829676.stm|title=BBC News - Go-ahead for new Heathrow runway|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was then cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Government]].&lt;ref name=Cancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8678282.stm|title=BBC News - Heathrow runway plans scrapped by new government|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coventry Airport====
The airport is owned by CAFCO (Coventry) Limited, a joint venture between Howard Holdings plc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardholdings.com|title=Howardholdings.com|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Convergence-AFCO Holdings Limited (CAFCOHL), and in June 2007 had its application to build permanent terminal and passenger facilities turned down by the UK government due to public pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copybook.com/airport/news/shock-rejection-hits-plan-for-coventry-airport-terminal|title=Shock Rejection Hits Plan for Coventry Airport Terminal|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/grounded-another-victory-in-battle-to-curb-airport-growth-456650.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Herbert | title=Grounded: Another victory in battle to curb airport growth | date=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/WDC/Your-Council/News/Warwick+District+Council+Archived+News/News+-+2008/Coventry+Airport.htm Warwickdc.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181429/http://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/WDC/Your-Council/News/Warwick+District+Council+Archived+News/News+-+2008/Coventry+Airport.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/tm_objectid=16571762&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50002&amp;headline=brum-airport-s-opposition-is--naked-commercialism--name_page.html|title=Birmingham Post politics news plus reports council and Government issues affecting Birmingham, the Black Country and the West Midlands|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:suGb6LcN8gwJ:www.aqconsultants.co.uk/AQC-CMS/media/PDF-Documents/Capability-Statement.Airports.pdf+3rd+runway+at+coventry+airport&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShltQpXsU8ET_abP8jJYMebaxew1BLV4mY5TVPrj1B0ymmwhrTDIo9tE_eYcnpiE3aBP1HiBo4TbpTFkiivscukBgxuF476Tjsjv4zJ_YMDT9dujQIl8lIVm0OT9yBX9P8sg7_E&amp;sig=AHIEtbQgH2dFnu1eDY4UVX5eUPVyT550uQ Docs.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=132195|title=Breaking News - Coventry Airport Goes Bust And Shuts - House prices and the economy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wimbledon, London====

The [[London Borough of Merton]] did not have enough school places for local children who would be reaching school age in 2012 and 2013. Almost all local schools had expanded, but the NIMBY group "Save Our Rec" opposed the expansion of Dundonald school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307070255/http://www.merton.gov.uk/council/getinvolved/consultation/dundonald_public_consultation_leaflet.pdf|title=Dundonald Primary School and Dundonald Park.

===United States===
Research shows that NIMBYism is bipartisan in the United States, with both conservatives and liberals opposing new housing developments in their localities. White neighborhoods and cities tend to favor more restrictive housing development policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&amp;smtyp=cur|title=The Bipartisan Cry of ‘Not in My Backyard’|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'' found that "individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate" in local government, and that "these individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4kzph3ynal3xai/ZoningParticipation_Perspectives_Final.pdf?dl=0|title=Who Participates in Local Government?

According to a 2017 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for rent to extremely low income (ELI) households in the United States.  As a result, seventy-one percent of ELI households are forced to spend over half of their income on housing costs leading to severe financial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Gap-Report_2017.pdf|title=The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/assessing-the-severity-of-rent-burden-on-low-income-families-20171222.htm|title=Assessing the Severity of Rent Burden on Low-Income Families|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while the need for more affordable housing is evident, opposition from “Not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY activists present significant challenges to affordable housing developments, resulting in costly design changes, construction delays, and permit denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|title=Democracy in Action?: NIMBY as Impediment to Equitable Affordable Housing Siting|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that proactive outreach and communication by affordable housing developers and proponents through the leveraging of social marketing and positive messaging can overcome common NIMBY barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beben|first=Robert|title=The Role of Social Marketing in Overcoming the NIMBY Syndrome|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockne|first=Anna|title=Not in My Backyard: Using Communications to Shift "NIMBY" Attitudes about Affordable Housing|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/198187/ARockne%20Capstone%206.28.18.pdf?sequence=1|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
A small number of residents (mostly farmers) in [[Hanford, California]] and surrounding areas are opposed to the [[California High-Speed Rail Authority]] building high-speed rail near farmland, citing that it will bring environmental and economic problems.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Wealthy residents of southern Orange County, CA defeated a local measure that proposed to convert the decommissioned El Toro Marine Base into a commercial airport, claiming that the airport would be "unsafe" during landings and take-offs as well as create air quality issues. The real issue was the FAA planned the flight paths for the airport over expensive neighborhoods of the south Orange County and residents feared that their property values would decrease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The airport proposal, however, was strongly supported by Northern Orange County residents. The defeat of the local measure resulted in the creation of the [[Orange County Great Park]].

National, state and local environmentalists, historic preservationists and long time residents of South [[Pasadena, California]] have been successfully opposing the completion of the highly controversial State Route 710 through the cities of Los Angeles (El Sereno), South Pasadena and Pasadena for over 60 years. There has been a federal injunction in place for 41 years stopping construction of the surface freeway. USC and UCLA urban and transportation planning students study this 80-year-old controversy because it is a classic example of sustained grass-roots opposition to a government proposal.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Now and for over a decade, a struggle has been brewing in [[San Francisco, California]] between the voting public and the influx of young professionals and tech workers. With no room to expand, construction companies can only build up in order to meet the increasing housing demand. However, NIMBYism has prevented high rise construction from spreading in San Francisco, citing restrictions on buildings' shadows and the dramatic changes proposed to the waterfront skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dineen|first=J.K.|title=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/07/nimbys-are-back-sf-builders-face.html|work=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|publisher="Biz Journals"|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition argues that new construction will increase the supply of luxury housing without creating affordable housing, thus raising the average rent while by attracting a wealthier population to the city of San Francisco and forcing middle and lower income families out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|title=8 Washington Luxury Waterfront Condo Development Project Vote Likely To Make It Onto November Ballot|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/8-washington_n_1690575.html|accessdate=29 January 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2017, 15 housing bills were signed into law by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] to combat the state's [[California housing shortage|housing shortage]].

====Florida====
Similar to the situation in Nantucket Sound, Mass., a minority of residents in [[St. Lucie County]], Florida have vehemently opposed the construction of wind turbines in the county. The construction of the wind turbines was strongly supported by over 80% of county residents according to a 2008 [[Florida Power and Light]] (FPL) poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617010520/https://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/tcoast/epaper/2008/04/03/m1b_slwind_0402.html|title=Survey supports turbines, FPL says|last=Quinlan|first=Paul|date=2008-04-03|website=The Palm Beach Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the power company proposed building the turbines in a location on a beach near a prior existing nuclear power plant owned by the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the 1980s, a agency known as the Palm Beach County Expressway Authority was formed to develop a series of east/west highways to take people from suburban Palm Beach County into downtown [[West Palm Beach]]. This was done in anticipation of [[population growth]] that would happen over the next decades in Palm Beach County that would bring in more traffic. Many neighbors in areas such as Westgate and Lake Belvedere Estates strongly opposed this plan citing it would wipe out their neighborhoods. Ultimately the plan was revised to create [[Florida State Road 80|SR-80]] Boulevard into an express like roadway by eliminating traffic lights and overpassing other local roadways.

====Illinois====
In 1959, when [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]] officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to [[African Americans]], they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of the residents, community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as "the Little Rock of the North."&lt;ref name="ros001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosen | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Rosen (author) |author2=David Rosen  | title = But Not Next Door | publisher = Astor-Honor Inc | year = 1962 | isbn = 0-8392-1007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials.&lt;ref name="ros001" /&gt; Otherwise, the land lay dormant for years before it was developed into what is now Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. The first black family did not move into Deerfield until much later, and in years since Deerfield has seen a greater influx of minorities, including Jews, Asians, Greeks and others. This episode in Deerfield's history is described in ''But Not Next Door'' by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield.

==== Massachusetts ====
Opposition to two proposed freeways within the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|MA Route 128]] beltway road around Boston—the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] and the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts]] into downtown Boston via the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]]—were opposed from their proposals during the 1950s era, and finally cancelled by the actions of then-Governor [[Francis Sargent]] in 1970. The [[MBTA Orange Line]] heavy rail rapid transit line's southern route was eventually re-located along much of the Southwest Corridor right-of-way for the cancelled I-95's roadbed in the late 1980s, when the Orange Line's [[Washington Street Elevated]] tracks were torn down at the time.

Some residents and businesses of [[Cape Cod]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket Island]] have opposed construction of [[Cape Wind]], a proposed offshore [[wind farm]] in [[Nantucket Sound]]. Proponents cite the environmental, economic, and [[energy security]] benefits of clean, [[renewable energy]], while opponents are against any obstruction to the views from oceanfront vacation homes and tourist destinations based in the region.

====Minnesota====
In the late 1990s a proposal for [[commuter rail]] on the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] between [[Minneapolis]] and [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]] was studied. In 2002, due to opposition from neighborhoods along the corridor, two state representatives from the suburbs of [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] and [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]] passed a legislative ban not allowing further study, discussion, funding, and construction of the project. While the ban is still in place despite numerous attempts to repeal it, the two suburbs that sponsored the ban are now open to the proposal. [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]] and [[St. Louis Park]] remain opposed to the project and repealing the ban.

====New York====
In [[Long Island]], various electrification and expansion projects of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) were substantially delayed due to the protests of people living near the railroad. For example, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] has proposed to build a [[Third Track Project|third track]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] from [[Floral Park station]] to [[Hicksville station]] in order to increase capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/News/2008/MainLineCorridorImprovements.pdf|title=MTA Long Island Rail Road East Side Access and Third Track – Main Line Corridor Improvements|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=4 July 2018|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rather | first=John | title=Third-Track Project Finds Its Nemesis | website=The New York Times | date=10 July 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/nyregion/thirdtrack-project-finds-its-nemesis.html | access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most communities along the route supported [[grade crossing]] eliminations as part of the project, there was fierce opposition for building a third track from the villages of [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]], and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], which said the construction and the resulting increased train service will reduce the quality of life in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |title=Floral Park Mayor To Address LIRR Expansion |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322080533/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=22 March 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |title=Residents: MTA/LIRR Needs to Get on Right Track |author=Carisa Keane |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=New Hyde Park Illustrated News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195104/http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |archivedate=27 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |title=Village Meets With LIRR On "Third Track" Project |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112195001/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=12 January 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third track project was suspended indefinitely in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14lirrli.html |title=Third-Track Plan Isn’t Dead, L.I.R.R.

In [[Port Washington, New York]], a dispute broke out between the town of [[North Hempstead, New York|North Hempstead]] and the LIRR over a proposed yard expansion at [[Port Washington station]]. To expand the yard, a parking lot belonging to the town would need to be reduced in size, but a local councilperson stated that the addition of the tracks "will completely ruin the character of the town."&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/lirr-plan-would-run-more-trains-to-nyc-1.5263966 |title=LIRR plan would run more trains to NYC |publisher=Newsday |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LIRR was able to expand the yard without the agreement of North Hempstead by tearing up 140 parking spaces of its own parking lot, also adjacent to the station.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

Community opposition also led to the cancellation of a proposed extension of the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] (carrying the {{NYCS trains|Astoria}}) to [[LaGuardia Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2003/0716/Front_Page/002.html|title=N Train Extension To LaG Scrapped|last=Toscano|first=John|date=July 16, 2003|newspaper=Queens Gazette|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-06-27/Features/Flashback_To_1999_001.html|title=Flashback To 1999 &amp;#124; www.qgazette.com &amp;#124; Queens Gazette|date=June 27, 2007|publisher=www.qgazette.com|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, opposition has killed any proposal to build a [[Long Island Sound link|bridge or tunnel across the Long Island Sound]] with some believing it will harm their communities with an influx of unwanted traffic as well as concerns regarding the environment and the number of homes that would be cleared as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Steve|last2=Herman|first2=Ralph|last3=Willinger|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Schlictman|first4=Paul|title=Overview: Oyster Bay-Rye Bridge (I-287, unbuilt)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/oysterbay-rye/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
* 1921: First poison laboratory within the Soviet secret services was established under the name "Special Office". It was headed by professor of medicine Ignatii Kazakov, according to [[Pavel Sudoplatov]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"&gt;Vadim J. Birstein. ''The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.'' Westview Press (2004) {{ISBN|0-8133-4280-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1926: The laboratory was under the supervision of [[Genrikh Yagoda]], a deputy of [[OGPU]] chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]], who became [[NKVD]] chief in 1934 after Menzhinsky's death.
*February 20, 1939: It becomes ''Laboratory 1'' headed by [[Grigory Mairanovsky]]. The laboratory was under the direct supervision of NKVD director [[Lavrenty Beria]] and his deputy [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] from 1939 to March 1953.
*March 14, 1953: It was renamed to ''Laboratory 12''. V. Naumov is the newly appointed head. [[Lavrenty Beria]] and [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] were executed after Stalin's death. Immediate NKVD supervisor of the laboratory, [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], received a long term in prison.
*1978: Expanded into the ''Central Investigation Institute for Special Technology'' within the [[First Chief Directorate]] of the [[KGB]].
*Since 1991: Several laboratories of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (headquartered in [[Yasenevo District|Yasenevo]] near [[Moscow]]) are responsible for the "creation of biological and toxin weapons for clandestine operations in the West".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kouzminov ''Biological Espionage: Special Operations of the Soviet and Russian Foreign Intelligence Services in the West'', Greenhill Books, 2006, {{ISBN|1-85367-646-2}} {{cite web |url=http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425151231/http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human experimentation==

Mairanovsky and his colleagues tested a number of deadly poisons on prisoners from the [[Gulag]]s ("[[enemies of the people]]"), including [[mustard gas]], [[ricin]], [[digitoxin]], [[curare]], cyanide, and many others.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;Andrew Meier. 2008. ''The Lost Spy: An American in Stalin's Secret Service'', W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the experiments was to find a tasteless, odourless chemical that could not be detected ''post-mortem''. Candidate poisons were given to the victims, with a meal or drink, as "medication".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

Finally, a preparation with the desired properties called C-2 or K-2 (carbylamine choline chloride) was developed.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Laurence, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXiJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Murder Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Volodarsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFd-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The KGB's Poison Factory], page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to witness testimonies, the victim changed physically, became shorter, weakened quickly, became calm and silent, and died within fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; Mairanovsky brought to the laboratory people of varied physical condition and ages in order to have a more complete picture about the action of each poison.

[[Pavel Sudoplatov]] and [[Nahum Eitingon]] approved special equipment (i.e., poisons) only if it had been tested on "humans", according to testimony of Mikhail Filimonov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|Vsevolod Merkulov]] said that these experiments were approved by NKVD chief [[Lavrenty Beria]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; After his arrest, Beria himself testified on August 28, 1953, that "I gave orders to Mairanovsky to conduct experiments on people sentenced to the highest measure of punishment, but it was not my idea".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

In addition to human experimentation, Mairanovsky personally executed people with poisons, under the supervision of Sudoplatov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grani"&gt;[http://grani.ru/Politics/World/Europe/Ukraine/m.81346.html History of Soviet poisonings (Russian)] by [[Boris Vadimovich Sokolov|Boris Sokolov]] grani.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged victims==
* Russian writer [[Maksim Gorky]] and his son. During the [[Trial of the Twenty One]] in 1938, NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] admitted that he poisoned to death Maksim Gorky and his son and unsuccessfully tried to poison future NKVD boss [[Nikolay Yezhov]]. The attempted poisoning of Yezhov was later officially dismissed as falsification, but [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] believed that the poisoning accusations were true. Yagoda was never officially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] (recognized as an innocent victim of political repressions) by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;
* Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Russian historians [[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]] and [[Edvard Radzinsky]] believe that Stalin was poisoned by associates of NKVD chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], based on the interviews of a former Stalin bodyguard and numerous circumstantial evidence. Stalin planned to dismiss and execute [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] and other senior members of the Soviet regime in 1953.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]] Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives (1997) {{ISBN|0-385-47954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radzinsky, Stalin was poisoned by Khrustalev, a senior bodyguard briefly mentioned in the memoirs of [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]], Stalin's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alliluyeva]] ''Twenty Letters To A Friend'' (autobiography, published 1967, London, written 1963) {{ISBN|0-06-010099-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgi Dimitrov]], the first Communist leader of Bulgaria, fell ill in 1949 and was sent to a Moscow hospital.  His body was mummified and placed in a mausoleum.  Stalin had no reason to have Dimitrov killed, because Dimitrov was his most loyal servant. However, Dimitrov had an idea of joining Bulgaria with Tito's Yugoslav Federation, which was not in the plans of Stalin.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''Purple Earth hypothesis''' is an [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] hypothesis that life forms of early Earth were [[retinal]]-based rather than [[chlorophyll]]-based, making Earth appear purple rather than green. An example of a retinal-based organism today is the photosynthetic microbe collectively called [[halobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/070410_purple_earth.html LiveScience.com: Early Earth Was Purple, Study Suggests] Accessed May 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparks, William B.; DasSarma, S.; Reid, I. N.|title=Evolutionary Competition Between Primitive Photosynthetic Systems: Existence of an early purple Earth?|bibcode=2006AAS...209.0605S|website=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 38, p.901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=R.H.|last2=Bogomolni|first2=R.A.|last3=Stoeckenius|first3=W.|title=Bacteriorhodopsin: a light-driven proton pump in Halobacterium Halobium|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=September 1975|volume=15|issue=9|pages=955–962|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(75)85875-9|bibcode=1975BpJ....15..955L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty with this hypothesis is that retinal-based photosynthesis requires either [[arginine]] or oxygen in the environment. As a complex amino acid, arginine is not likely to have been available in the levels needed. Oxygen only became available in earth's environment after the development of chlorophyll-based photosynthesis, and given that retinal organisms also require oxygen to synthesize critical substances for life, the possibility that retinal life-forms could have preceded chlorophyll-based ones as the most common photosynthetic organisms is unlikely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12370">In response to the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (DESD, 2005-2014), the [[United Nations University]] (UNU) called for the development of regional networks for the promotion of [[Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD). These networks address local sustainable development challenges through research and capacity development. This was the birth of '''Regional Centres of Expertise''' on ESD (RCEs). RCEs are acknowledged by the UNU based on recommendations of the Ubuntu Committee of Peers for the RCEs, which consists of signatories of the [https://www.un.org/events/wssd/pressconf/020901conf1.htm Ubuntu Declaration] signed in 2002.

RCEs aspire to achieve the goals of the DESD by translating its global objectives into the context of the local communities in which they operate. This is then accomplished by acting as a catalyst for institutions that promote ESD through formal, non-formal and informal education, and by providing suitable platforms to share information and experiences and to promote dialogue among regional stakeholders through partnerships for sustainable development. They also develop regional knowledge bases to support ESD and promote its goals in a resource effective manner. This can be achieved through the delivery of training programmes, by facilitating research into ESD, through public awareness raising, and by increasing the quality and access to ESD in the region.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |archivedate = 2007-06-11
 |df          = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An RCE should have four core elements:

* Governance - addressing issues of RCE management and leadership
* Collaboration - addressing the engagement of actors from all levels of formal, non-formal and informal education
* Research and development - addressing the role of research and its inclusion in RCE activities, as well as contributing to the design of strategies for collaborative activities, including those with other RCEs
* Transformative education - contributing to the transformation of the current education and training systems to satisfy ambitions of the region regarding sustainable living and livelihood.

RCEs also have four major ESD goals to be promoted in an effective way:

* Re-orienting education towards SD, by covering integrating SD and ESD into the current curriculum and tailoring it to address issues and local context of the community in which they operate;
* Increase access to quality education that is most needed in the regional context;
* Deliver trainers’ training programmes and to develop methodologies and learning materials for them;
* Lead advocacy and awareness raising efforts to raise public awareness about the importance of educators and the essential role of ESD in achieving a sustainable future. RCEs promote the long-term goals of ESD, such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and improvement of the quality of life.

RCEs are not only significant for the region itself, where they provide a unique opportunity to promote learning and development for SD, but also important at international level where they help to constitute the Global Learning Space for Sustainable Development. Globally, RCEs are facilitated through the [http://www.ias.unu.edu United Nations University Institute for Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS)] who provide a framework for strategy, best practice and techniques for success, which can then be translated to the regional level.

RCEs have recently{{when|date=November 2018}} been acknowledged in the 2009 Bonn Declaration which calls for action to “develop knowledge through ESD networking” through “networks that could serve as centres of expertise and innovation”.&lt;ref&gt;

He has written three non-fiction books - ''[[Rescuing Da Vinci]]'' (2006),  ''[[Monuments Men]]: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History'' (2007); and ''Saving Italy'' (2013) - chronicling the recovery of artwork stolen by Nazi Germany during [[World War II]]. A film based on his book, ''[[The Monuments Men]],'' directed by and starring Academy Award winner [[George Clooney]], was released in February 2014.

Edsel is the co-producer of the Emmy-nominated documentary film, ''The Rape of Europa'' (2007). He is also founder and Chairman of the [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art]], which received the 2007 National Humanities Medal under President [[George W. Bush]]. The foundation has donated four albums of photographic evidence of the [[Third Reich]]'s theft of art treasures to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|United States National Archives]].

==Early life and education==
Robert M. Edsel was born in 1956, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], and raised in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324030704578424750585179628 | title = He Drills for Answers | author = Joanne Kaufman | date = May 1, 2013 | work = WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Norma Louise (née Morse), a housewife, and Alpha Ray Edsel, a stockbroker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rapeofeuropa.com/aboutTheCreators.asp | title = The Rape of Europa – About Creators of the Film | work = rapeofeuropa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E4D8163AF931A15752C0A96E9C8B63 | work = The New York Times | title = Paid Notice: Deaths EDSEL, ALPHA RAY (RAY) | date = January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edsel was formerly a nationally ranked tennis player.

In 1981, he began his business career in oil and gas exploration. His company, Gemini Exploration, pioneered the use of [[horizontal drilling]] technology throughout the early 1990s. Gemini Exploration grew from a company of eight employees to almost 100. By 1995, Gemini had become the second most active driller of horizontal wells in the United States. Edsel sold the company’s assets to Union Pacific Resources Company, and the following year, he moved to Europe with his family.

In the late 1990s, while living in [[Florence]], Edsel began to think about the methods and planning used to keep art out of the hands of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Following a divorce in 2000, Edsel moved to [[New York City]], where he began a serious effort to learn about and understand the issue.

By 2004, those efforts had become a full-time career, and he established a research office in [[Dallas]], his hometown.&lt;ref name="gijoe" /&gt;  By 2005, he had gathered thousands of photographs and other documents, and began writing the manuscript for ''[[Rescuing Da Vinci]]'', which was published in 2006. The book received wide attention.&lt;ref name="gijoe"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kennedy | first = Randy | title = G.I.

In September 2009, Edsel’s second book, ''[[The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History]]'', a narrative account of the Monuments Men, was published by Center Street, a division of [[Hachette Book Group]]. The book has been translated and published in more than 25 languages. [[George Clooney]] wrote, directed and starred in a movie of the same name based on Edsel's book, ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' (2014).

Edsel's third book, entitled ''[[Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis]]'' (2013), was published by W. W. Norton and debuted on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list. ''Saving Italy'' tells the dramatic story of the Monuments Men's efforts to locate and recover that country’s innumerable art treasures that had been stolen by the Nazis. Beginning with the near destruction of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]’s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' by British bombing, Edsel introduces a major but largely overlooked Nazi figure, SS General [[Karl Wolff]]. Edsel describes Wolff's harrowing negotiations with OSS leader [[Allen Dulles]], America’s senior spy in Europe, related to the artworks and preserving Paris after the Nazis' retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Italy-Rescue-Nations-Treasures/dp/0393082415 | title = Saving Italy: The Race to Rescue a Nation's Treasures from the Nazis: | last = Edsel| first =Robert M. | isbn=9780393082418| publisher=Center Street | work = amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edsel co-produced a documentary film, ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'' (2007), based on [[Lynn Nicholas]]' eponymous book. Narrated by [[Joan Allen]], the film was well received by critics and began a theatrical run in September 2007 at the [[The Paris Theater (Manhattan)|Paris Theatre]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Scheib | first = Ronnie | author2 = Variety Staff | title = The Rape of Europa | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932640.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Rachel | title = Art, Lost &amp; Found | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 14, 2007 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/movies/14euro.html?ref=arts | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Edsel has created ''The Greatest Theft in History''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greatesttheft.com | title = The Monuments Men – Official Site | work = greatesttheft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program, which includes the two-hour documentary film and seven hours of additional clips, as well as a companion website featuring lesson plans, glossaries, timelines, and other resources to enable teachers to easily use this material in the classroom.

==Monuments Men Foundation==
[[File:Bush 2007 National Humanities Medal.jpg|thumb|left|Edsel with President [[George W. Bush]] and four Monuments Men.]]

In 2007, Edsel created the [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art]]. The foundation's mission is "to preserve the legacy of the unprecedented and heroic work of the men and women who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (“MFAA”) section, known as “Monuments Men,” during World War II, by raising public awareness of the importance of protecting and safeguarding civilization’s most important artistic and cultural treasures from armed conflict, but incorporating these expressions of man's greatest creative achievements into our daily lives." He announced the foundation's creation during a ceremony on June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of [[D-Day]], to celebrate [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House]] concurrent resolutions honoring the Monuments Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = H.Con.Res 48 | work = thomas.loc.gov | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c110:./temp/~c110vfeVIa | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = S.

The Monuments Men Foundation was one of ten recipients of the 2007 [[National Humanities Medal]], an honor which was presented by President Bush during a ceremony held in the East Room of The White House on November 15, 2007. The National Humanities Medal is the highest honor given for excellence in the Humanities field.

==Photograph albums==
[[File:NARA shaking hands.jpg|thumb|[[Archivist of the United States]] [[Allen Weinstein]] with Edsel after the donation of Nazi photograph albums.]]

During the course of their research into the whereabouts of lost art, Edsel and the staff of the Monuments Men Foundation discovered four large, leather-bound photograph albums which documented portions of the European art looted by the Nazis. The albums were in the possession of heirs to an American soldier stationed in the [[Berchtesgaden]] area of Germany, in the closing days of World War II.

The albums were created by the staff of the Third Reich’s ''[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (ERR), a special unit that found and confiscated the best material in Nazi-occupied countries, to use for exploitation. In [[France]], the ERR engaged in an extensive and elaborate art looting operation, part of Hitler’s much larger premeditated scheme to steal art treasures from conquered nations. The albums were created for Hitler and high-level Nazi officials as a catalogue and, more importantly, to give Hitler a way to choose the art for his art museum in [[Austria]]. A group of these photograph albums was presented to Hitler on his birthday in 1943, to "send a ray of beauty and joy into [his] revered life."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} ERR staff stated that nearly 100 such volumes were created during the years of their art looting operation.

In November 2007, at a ceremony with [[Archivist of the United States]] [[Allen Weinstein]], Edsel announced the discovery of the first two photograph albums and, separately, donated the albums to the [[National Archives]].  Weinstein called the discovery "one of the most significant finds related to Hitler’s premeditated theft of art and other cultural treasures to be found since the [[Nuremberg trials]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = National Archives Announces Discovery of "Hitler Albums" Documenting Looted Art | publisher = [[National Archives and Records Administration]] | date = November 1, 2007 | url = https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-22.html | accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2014, Edsel received the Records of Achievement award from the [[Foundation for the National Archives]], for "'bringing to life the storied history of the men and women' who served in the [[Monuments Men]]...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/michael-granberry/20141029-national-archives-honors-dallas-author-robert-edsel.ece | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141029180107/http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/michael-granberry/20141029-national-archives-honors-dallas-author-robert-edsel.ece | date = October 29, 2014 | archivedate = October 29, 2014 | last = Granberry | first = Michael | website = The Dallas Morning News | title = GuideLIVE: National Archives honors Dallas author Robert Edsel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
[[File:Parallax scrolling example scene.gif|thumb|[[Parallax scrolling]]]]
In [[computer display]]s, [[filmmaking]], [[television production]], and other kinetic displays, '''scrolling''' is sliding text, images or video across a monitor or display, vertically or horizontally. "Scrolling", as such, does not change the layout of the text or pictures, but moves ([[panning (camera)|pans]] or [[Tilt (camera)|tilts]]) the user's view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen. A common television and movie special effect is to scroll credits, while leaving the background stationary. Scrolling may take place completely without user intervention (as in film credits) or, on an interactive device, be triggered by [[touchscreen]] or a keypress and continue without further intervention until a further user action, or be entirely controlled by [[input device]]s.

Scrolling may take place in discrete increments (perhaps one or a few lines of text at a time), or continuously ('''smooth scrolling'''). [[Frame rate]] is the speed at which an entire image is redisplayed. It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be redisplayed. When frame rate is a limiting factor, one smooth scrolling technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to "jump".

==Computing==

=== Implementation ===
{{anchor|software scrolling|hardware scrolling}}
Scrolling is often carried out on a computer by the CPU (''software scrolling'') or by a [[graphics processor]]. Some systems feature ''hardware scrolling'', where an image may be offset as it is displayed, without any [[frame buffer]] manipulation (see also [[hardware windowing]]). This was especially common in 8 and 16bit video game consoles.

=== UI paradigms ===
In a [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]-style [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), user-controlled scrolling is carried out by manipulating a [[scrollbar]] with a mouse, or using [[keyboard shortcut]]s, often the [[arrow key]]s. Scrolling is often supported by [[text user interface]]s and [[command line interface]]s. Older [[computer terminal]]s changed the entire contents of the display one screenful ("page") at a time; this paging mode requires fewer resources than scrolling. Scrolling displays often also support page mode. Typically certain keys or [[key combination]]s page up or down; on [[PC-compatible]] keyboards the [[page up and page down keys]] or the [[space bar]] are used; earlier computers often used [[control key]] combinations.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The widely used [[Wordstar]] word processor used the "diamond" of Ctrl-S/E/D/X to move the cursor left, up, right, and down, and Ctrl-R and Ctrl-C to page up and down.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Computer mouse|computer mice]] have a [[scroll wheel]], which scrolls the display, often vertically, when rolled; others have [[scroll ball]]s or [[tilt wheel]]s which allow both vertical and horizontal scrolling.

Some software supports other ways of scrolling. [[Adobe Reader]] has a mode identified by a small hand icon ("[[hand tool]]") on the document, which can then be dragged by clicking on it and moving the mouse as if sliding a large sheet of paper. When this feature is implemented on a [[touchscreen]] it is called ''kinetic scrolling''. [[Touchscreen|Touch-screens]] often use ''inertial scrolling'', in which the scrolling motion of an object continues in a decaying fashion after release of the touch, simulating the appearance of an object with [[inertia]]. An early implementation of such behavior was in the "Star7" [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] of [[Sun Microsystems]] ca. 1991&amp;ndash;1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsTH9S79qI&amp;t=4m28s&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrolling can be controlled in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some scroll wheels can be pressed down, functioning like a button.  Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, scrolling stops.  A few scroll wheels can also be tilted, scrolling horizontally in one direction until released. On [[touchscreen]] devices, scrolling is a [[multi-touch]] gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to scroll to.

If any content is too wide to fit on a display, horizontal scrolling is required to view all of it. In applications such as [[graphics]] and [[spreadsheet]]s there is often more content than can fit either the width or the height of the screen at a comfortable scale, and scrolling in both directions is necessary.

===Text===
In [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|languages written horizontally]], such as most Western languages, text documents longer than will fit on the screen are often displayed [[Word wrap|wrapped]] and sized to fit the screen width, and scrolled vertically to bring desired content into view. It is possible to display lines too long to fit the display without wrapping, scrolling horizontally to view each entire line. However, this requires inconvenient constant line-by-line scrolling, while vertical scrolling is only needed after reading a full screenful.

Software such as [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s normally uses word-wrapping to display as many words in a single line as will fit the width of the screen or window or, for text organised in columns, each column.

====Demos====
Scrolling texts, also referred to as ''scrolltexts'' or ''scrollers'', played an important part in the birth of the computer [[Demo (computer programming)|demo culture]]. The [[Software cracking|software cracker]]s often used their deep knowledge of [[computer platform]]s to transform the information that accompanied their releases into [[crack intro]]s. The sole role of these intros was to scroll the text on the screen in an impressive way.&lt;ref&gt;http://tomaes.32x.de/text/faq.php#2.3{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scrollers were plain horizontal scrollers, but [[demoscene|demo coders]] also paid a lot of attention to creating new and different types of scrolling. The characters could, for example, continuously alter their shape, take unusual flying paths or incorporate color effects such as [[raster bar]]s. Sometimes it makes the text nearly unreadable.

==Film and television==
Scrolling is commonly used to display the credits at the end of [[film]]s and [[television program]]s.

Scrolling is often used in the form of a [[news ticker]] towards the bottom of the picture for content such as [[television news]], scrolling sideways across the screen, delivering short-form content.

== Video games ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bubble Bobble]] --&gt;
{{see also|Side-scrolling video game|Parallax scrolling|2.5D}}

In [[Video game|computer and video games]], scrolling of a playing field allows the player to control an object in a large contiguous area. Early examples of this method include [[Taito]]'s 1974 vertical-scrolling [[racing video game]] ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|id=9709|name=Speed Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sega]]'s 1976 [[2.5D|forward-scrolling]] [[racing game]]s ''[[Fonz (arcade)|Moto-Cross]]''&lt;ref name=Moto-Cross&gt;{{KLOV game|12812|Moto-Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Fonz'')&lt;ref name=Fonz&gt;{{KLOV game|id=12812|name=Fonz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Road Race'',&lt;ref name=Road-Race&gt;{{KLOV game|12733|Road Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Super Bug''.

The [[Namco Galaxian]] [[arcade system board]] introduced with ''[[Galaxian]]'' in 1979 pioneered a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] system that animated pre-loaded sprites over a scrolling background, which became the basis for [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' arcade hardware and [[home console]]s such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505103737/http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/making-the-famicom-a-reality/ Making the Famicom a Reality], ''Nikkei Electronics'' (September 12, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parallax scroll]]ing, which was first featured in ''[[Moon Patrol]]'', involves several [[transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] layers (called playfields), which scroll on top of each other at varying rates in order to give an early [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] illusion of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3|title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions|page=3|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''{{vanchor|Belt scrolling}}''' is a method used in side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] games with a downward camera angle where players can move up and down in addition to left and right. A previously much used alternative to video game scrolling is the [[flip-screen]] method.

== Studies ==
A 1993 article by George Fitzmaurice studied spatially aware [[palmtop computer]]s. These devices had a 3D sensor, and moving the device caused the contents to move as if the contents were fixed in place. This interaction could be referred to as “moving to scroll.” Also, if the user moved the device away from their body, they would zoom in; conversely, the device would zoom out if the user pulled the device closer to them. [[Smartphone]] [[camera]]s and “[[optical flow]]” image analysis utilize this technique nowadays. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzmaurice|first=George W.|date=1993-07-01|title=Situated Information Spaces and Spatially Aware Palmtop Computers|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/159544.159566|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=36|issue=7|pages=39–49|doi=10.1145/159544.159566|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 research paper by Jun Rekimoto analyzed tilting operations as scrolling techniques on small screen interfaces. Users could not only tilt to scroll, but also tilt to select menu items. These techniques proved especially useful for field workers, since they only needed to hold and control the device with one hand. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rekimoto|first=Jun|date=1996-01-01|title=Tilting Operations for Small Screen Interfaces|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/237091.237115|journal=Proceedings of the 9th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology|series=UIST '96|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=167–168|doi=10.1145/237091.237115|isbn=0897917987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study from 2013 by Selina Sharmin, Oleg Špakov, and Kari-Jouko Räihä explored the action of reading text on a screen while the text auto-scrolls based on the user’s eye tracking patterns. The control group simply read text on a screen and manually scrolled. The study found that participants preferred to read primarily at the top of the screen, so the screen scrolled down whenever participants’ eyes began to look toward the bottom of the screen. This auto-scrolling caused no statistically significant difference in reading speed or performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharmin|first=Selina|last2=Špakov|first2=Oleg|last3=Räihä|first3=Kari-Jouko|date=2013-01-01|title=Reading On-screen Text with Gaze-based Auto-scrolling|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2509315.2509319|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Eye Tracking South Africa|series=ETSA '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=24–31|doi=10.1145/2509315.2509319|isbn=9781450321105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intended to become one of the preeminent centers for [[biodefense]] research in the nation to provide some assistance to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).

[[Bioterrorism]] is considered by some experts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dorothy |last=Wright |title=Bioterrorism: The New Threat of Infectious Diseases |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/sandt/2004_october/index.html |work=Science and Technology Newsletter |publisher=Bryn Mawr College |date=October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goss warns of terror threat to U.S. |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/02/16/intelligence.threats/index.html |date=2005-02-17 |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be one of the greatest current threats to human health and National Security in the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax mailings to Congress and news media]]. Founded by an increase in research funding for bioterrorism defense (biodefense), including development of vaccines, by the [[NIH]] and other government organizations. Fields of study at the Center include [[microbiology]], [[virology]], [[immunology]], [[mycology]], and [[genomics]].

The major focus of the STCEID is to research emerging infectious diseases (i.e. [[cholera]], [[SARS]], [[anthrax]], [[AIDS]]) and their mechanisms of pathogenesis. One of the main research issues is microorganisms that are potentially usable for biological warfare, like cholera, anthrax, [[ebola]], etc.

Current Directors of the Center are:

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Ronan Point - Daily Telegraph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ronan Point, following the gas explosion.]] --&gt;
'''Robustness''' is the ability of a structure to withstand events like fire, explosions, impact or the consequences of [[human error]], without being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original cause - as defined in EN 1991-1-7 of the Accidental Actions [[Eurocode]].&lt;ref name=1991-1-7&gt;{{cite book|title=EN 1991-1-7 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-7: General actions - Accidental actions|publisher=CEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A structure [[Structural design|designed]] and [[construction|constructed]] to be robust should not suffer from [[disproportionate collapse]] (progressive collapse) under accidental loading.&lt;ref name=steel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steelconstruction.info/Structural_robustness|title=Structural robustness|publisher=SteelConstruction.info|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings of some kinds, especially [[large-panel system building | large-panel system]]s and [[precast concrete]] buildings, are disproportionately more susceptible to collapse; others, such as [[reinforced concrete|in situ cast concrete structures]], are disproportionately less susceptible. The method employed in making a structure robust will typically depend on and be tailored to the kind of structure it is, as in [[steel frame]]d building structural robustness is typically achieved through appropriately designing the system of connections between the frame's constituents.&lt;ref name=steel /&gt;

==Design considerations==
Three alternative measures are used, sometimes jointly, to achieve structural robustness and reduce the risk of disproportionate collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pci.org/resources/sustainability/cfcs/cmsIT/baseComponents/fileManagerProxy.cfc?method=GetFile&amp;fileID=44F28004-F174-BEA5-48CC735D83EBA0B0|title=FIB bulletin 43 Structural connections for precast concrete buildings|publisher=FIB|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.fct.unl.pt/sites/www.dec.fct.unl.pt/files/documentos/formacao/ispcs/accidental_actions.pdf|title=International seminar on Precast Concrete Structures Accidental Actions and Progressive Collapse Arnold Van Acker|publisher=Department of Civil Engineering Universidade Nova de Lisboa|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These are: 
* Reducing the possibility of occurrence of accidental loading.
* Preventing the propagation of a possible initial failure and increasing redundancy. Which includes the indirect method and the alternative load path method.
* Designing the structure to withstand accidental loading. Sometimes referred to as specific load resistance method.

==Robustness requirements in Eurocodes==
The requirements for structures in consequence classes 2 and 3 can be found in [[EN_1991#Part_1-7:_General_actions_-_Accidental_Actions|EN 1991-1-7]] Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-7: General actions - Accidental actions. Additional requirements and requirements for structures in consequence class 1 can be found in the material specific Eurocode parts, [[EN 1992]] for concrete structures, [[EN 1993]] for steel structures and so on.

In EN 1991-1-7 buildings are categorised in consequences classes, considering the building type, occupancy and size.&lt;ref name=1991-1-7 /&gt;

'''Consequence class 1''', low consequences of failure:
*Single occupancy houses not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Agricultural buildings.
*Buildings into which people rarely go, provided no part of the building is closer to another building, or area where people do go, than a distance of 1.5 times the building height.

'''Consequence class 2a''', lower risk group - medium consequences of failure: 
*5 storey single occupancy houses.
*Hotels not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Flats, apartments and other residential buildings not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Offices not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Industrial buildings not exceeding 3 storeys.
*Retail premises not exceeding 3 storeys of less than 1000 m² floor area in each storey.
*Single storey educational buildings.
*All buildings not exceeding two storeys to which the public are admitted and which contain floor areas not exceeding 2000 m² at each storey.

'''Consequence class 2b''', upper risk group - medium consequences of failure: 
*Hotels, flats, apartments and other residential buildings greater than 4 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Educational buildings greater than single storey but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Retail premises greater than 3 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Hospitals not exceeding 3 storeys.
*Offices greater than 4 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*All buildings to which the public are admitted and which contain floor areas exceeding 2000 m² but not exceeding 5000 m² at each storey.
*Car parking not exceeding 6 storeys.

'''Consequence class 3''', high consequences of failure:
*All buildings defined above as Class 2 Lower and Upper Consequences Class that exceed the limits on area and number of storeys.
*All buildings to which members of the public are admitted in significant numbers.
*Stadia accommodating more than 5000 spectators.
*Buildings containing hazardous substances and / or processes.

For buildings intended for more than one type of use, the consequences class should be that of the most onerous type.&lt;ref name=steel /&gt;

Buildings in consequence class 1 should be designed and constructed in accordance with EN 1990 - 1999 for satisfying stability in normal use, no specific consideration (required by EN 1991-1-7) is necessary with regard to accidental actions from unidentified causes.

Buildings in consequence class 2a (in addition to what is recommended for consequence class 1) should be provided with effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of suspended floors to walls.

Buildings in consequence class 2b (in addition to what is recommended for consequence class 1 and 2a) should be provided with effective vertical ties in all supporting columns and walls, or alternatively the building should be checked to ensure that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting a column, or any nominal section of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building) the building remains stable and the local damage does not exceed a certain limit. Where the removal of such columns and sections of walls would result in an extent of damage in excess of the agreed limit, such elements should be designed as a key element.

For buildings in consequence class 3 a systematic risk assessment of the building taking into account both foreseeable and unforeseeable hazards, is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8163">In [[astronomy]], '''surface brightness''' quantifies the [[apparent brightness]] or [[spectral flux density|flux density]] per unit [[Solid angle|angular area]] of a spatially extended object such as a [[galaxy]] or [[nebula]], or of the [[night sky]] background.  An object's surface brightness depends on its surface luminosity density, i.e., its [[luminosity]] emitted per unit surface area. In [[Visible-light astronomy|visible]] and [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] astronomy, surface brightness is often quoted on a [[Astronomical magnitude|magnitude]] scale, in magnitudes per square [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] in a particular [[Astronomical filter|filter band]] or [[photometric system]].

Measurement of the surface brightnesses of celestial objects is called surface [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]].

==General description==
The total magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an extended object such as a nebula, cluster, galaxy or comet. It can be obtained by summing up the luminosity over the area of the object. Alternatively, a [[photometer]] can be used by applying apertures or slits of different sizes of diameter.&lt;ref name=daintith_gould2005&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting magnitude value is the same as a point-like source that is emitting the same amount of energy.&lt;ref name=sherrod_koed2003&gt;{{cite book

The [[apparent magnitude]] of an astronomical object is generally given as an integrated value—if a [[galaxy]] is quoted as having a magnitude of 12.5, it means we see the same total amount of light from the galaxy as we would from a star with magnitude 12.5. However, a [[star]] is so small it is effectively a [[wikt:point source|point source]] in most observations (the largest [[angular diameter]], that of [[R Doradus]], is 0.057&amp;nbsp;± 0.005 [[Arcsecond|arcsec]]), whereas a galaxy may extend over several [[arcsecond]]s or [[arcminute]]s. Therefore, the galaxy will be harder to see than the star against the [[airglow]] background light. Apparent magnitude is a good indication of visibility if the object is point-like or small, whereas surface brightness is a better indicator if the object is large. What counts as small or large depends on the specific viewing conditions and follows from [[Ricco's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1093/mnras/stu992  | author=Crumey, Andrew | title= Human contrast threshold and astronomical visibility | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | date=2014 | volume=442 | pages=2600 | bibcode=2014MNRAS.442.2600C | arxiv=1405.4209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, in order to adequately assess an object's visibility one needs to know both parameters.

==Calculating surface brightness==
Surface brightnesses are usually quoted in magnitudes per square arcsecond.  Because the magnitude is logarithmic, calculating surface brightness cannot be done by simple division of magnitude by area.  Instead, for a source with a total or integrated magnitude ''m'' extending over a visual area of ''A'' square arcseconds, the surface brightness ''S'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;S = m + 2.5 \cdot \log_{10} A.&lt;/math&gt;

For astronomical objects, surface brightness is analogous to photometric [[luminance]] and is therefore constant with distance: as an object becomes fainter with distance, it also becomes correspondingly smaller in visual area. In geometrical terms, for a nearby object emitting a given amount of light, radiative [[flux]] decreases with the square of the distance to the object, but the physical area corresponding to a given [[solid angle]] or visual area (e.g. 1 square arcsecond) decreases by the same proportion, resulting in the same surface brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sparke|Gallagher|2000|loc=&amp;sect; 5.1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For extended objects such as nebulae or galaxies, this allows the estimation of spatial distance from surface brightness by means of the distance modulus or [[luminosity distance]].{{Clarify|date=February 2018|reason=How can we get a distance from the surface brightness if it doesn't depend on distance?}}

==Relationship to physical units==
The surface brightness in magnitude units is related to the surface brightness in physical units of [[solar luminosity]] per square [[parsec]] by

&lt;math&gt;S({\rm mag}/{\rm arcsec}^2)=M_{\odot}+21.572-2.5\log_{10} S (L_{\odot}/{\rm pc}^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; L_{\odot} &lt;/math&gt; are the [[absolute magnitude]] and the luminosity of the Sun in chosen [[Photometric system|color-band]]&lt;ref&gt;Absolute magnitudes of the Sun in different color-bands can be obtained from {{harvtxt|Binney|Merrifield|1998}} or [http://www.ucolick.org/~cnaw/sun.html Absolute Magnitude of the Sun in Several Bands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718015507/http://www.ucolick.org/~cnaw/sun.html |date=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Surface brightness can also be expressed in [[candela per square metre]] using the formula [value in cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10.8×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;(-0.4*[value in mag/arcsec2])&lt;/sup&gt;. 

There is an online calculator available here http://unihedron.com/projects/darksky/magconv.php?ACTION=SOLVE&amp;txtMAGSQA=21.83

==Examples==
A truly dark sky has a surface brightness of {{val|2|e=-4}} &amp;nbsp;cd&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or 21.8&amp;nbsp;mag&amp;nbsp;arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Crumey"&gt;Based on the equivalence 21.83&amp;nbsp;mag&amp;nbsp;arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|2|e=-4}} &amp;nbsp;cd&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, from description of a "truly dark sky", Section 1.3 of Crumey, A. (2014). [http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/442/3/2600.full.pdf+html Human contrast threshold and astronomical visibility.] MNRAS 442, 2600–2619.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clarify|date=February 2018|reason=A surface brightness in mag/arcsec^2 is only meaningful if a filter band or wavelength band is specified. Also useful to specify Vega or AB mag.}}

The peak surface brightness of the central region of the [[Orion Nebula]] is about 17 Mag/arcsec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 14 [[milli]][[nit (unit)|nits]]) and the outer bluish glow has a peak surface brightness of 21.3 Mag/arcsec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 0.27 millinits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''University of California, Santa Cruz''' (also known as '''UC Santa Cruz''' or '''UCSC''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  It is one of 10 campuses in the [[University of California]] system. Located 75 miles (120&amp;nbsp;km) south of San Francisco at the edge of the coastal community of Santa Cruz, the campus lies on {{convert|2001|acres|ha}} of rolling, forested hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean and [[Monterey Bay]].

Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz began as a showcase for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.

==History==
Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the [[Regents of the University of California|University of California Regents]] in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref name="City council hasn't told"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Doyle | first = William T.| title = What the city council has not told us about university expansion| newspaper = Santa Cruz Sentinel| publisher = MediaNews Group| date = October 1, 2006| url = http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=42181| accessdate =February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Santa Cruz site was selected over a competing proposal to build the campus closer to the population center of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, however, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus.&lt;ref name="McHenry UCSC origins"&gt;{{Cite book| last = McHenry | first = Dean E.| editor1-last = Spedding Calciano | editor1-first = Elizabeth| title = Volume II The University of California, Santa Cruz: Its Origins, Architecture, Academic Planning and Early Faculty Appointments 1958–1968| publisher = UC Santa Cruz | year = 1974 | page = 59| url = http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p265101coll13/id/3700 | format = PDF |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal design process of the Santa Cruz campus began in the late 1950s, culminating in the Long Range Development Plan of 1963.&lt;ref name="1963 LRDP"&gt;{{cite web| title = Long Range Development Plan, University of California Santa Cruz| publisher = UC Santa Cruz Campus Planning Committee| date = October 21, 1963| url = http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = February 19, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624040556/http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| archivedate = June 24, 2010| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction had started by 1964, and the university was able to accommodate its first students (albeit living in trailers on what is now the East Field athletic area) in 1965.

===Impact on Santa Cruz===
Although the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] already exhibited a strong [[conservation ethic]] before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=27810|title=35 years later, students’ environmental report seems prescient|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 3, 2008|last=Seals|first=Brian|date=July 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc.&lt;ref name="Burchins3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40020|title=1980s ushered in discussion of UCSC expansion that continues today |newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 9, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large and growing population of politically [[progressivism|liberal]] UCSC [[alumnus|alumni]] changed the electorate of the town from predominantly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Honig|first=Tom|title=Santa Cruz was once Reagan country|date=June 4, 2004|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to markedly [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]], consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both [[town and gown]].

===Expansion plans===
{{main|Long Range Development Plan (UCSC)}}
Plans for increasing enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 faculty and staff by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Marshall | first=Carolyn | title=As College Grows, a City Is Asking, ‘Who Will Pay?’ | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/us/19campus.html | date=January 27, 2007 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40191|title=Tie-dyed philosophy majors of the past make way for pencil-protected science majors|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 16, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.&lt;ref name="bookwalter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|title=Suits over UCSC growth settled: City, county, neighbors reach deal; university agrees to concessions over roads, water and housing|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=August 9, 2008|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=September 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815200839/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|archive-date=August 15, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intends to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[NASA Ames Research Center]] campus is planned to ultimately hold 2,000 UCSC students – about 10% of the entire university's future student body as envisioned for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Krieger | first= Lisa M. | title= Think of UCSC as UC-Silicon Valley, new chancellor says | url= http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_7044109 | publisher= [[Mercury News]] | date= September 30, 2007 | accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mills | first=Kay | title=Changes at "Oxford on the Pacific," UC Santa Cruz turns to engineering and technology | url=http://www.highereducation.org/crosstalk/ct0401/news0401-changesoxfordpacific.shtml | journal=National Crosstalk | publisher=National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | volume=9 | date=Spring 2001 | accessdate=January 28, 2008 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz Aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz aerial view. The Great Meadow is the undeveloped area between city and university]]
The {{convert|2000|acre|ha|adj=on}} UCSC campus is located {{convert|75|mi|km}} south of San Francisco, in the Ben Lomond Mountain ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Elevation varies from {{convert|285|ft|m}} at the campus entrance to {{convert|1195|ft|m}} at the northern boundary, a difference of about {{convert|900|ft|m}}. The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open [[meadow]], locally known as the Great Meadow. To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] groves. The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Harvey West Park |url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/harvey.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pogonip (park)|Pogonip open space preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Pogonip|url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/pogo.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the north by [[Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Cowell Redwoods SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=546|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the town of [[Felton, California|Felton]], and on the west by [[Gray Whale Ranch]], a portion of [[Wilder Ranch State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilder Ranch SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=549|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The campus is built on a portion of the [[Cowell Lime Works|Cowell Family ranch]], which was purchased by the University of California in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=11341|title=The original City on a Hill|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 5, 2008|last=Redfern|first=Cathy|date=September 2, 2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails. The heavily forested area has allowed UC Santa Cruz to operate a [[RV park|recreational vehicle park]] as a form of student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UC Santa Cruz – University Family Student Housing| url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| accessdate=October 27, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026004728/http://housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| archive-date=October 26, 2006| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[shrines]], dens and other student-built curiosities are scattered around the northern campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the university razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|title='An Unnatural History of UCSC' traces the evolution of a magical campus setting – Santa Cruz Sentinel|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|date=April 13, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2008|last=Baine|first=Wallace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413062824/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|archive-date=April 13, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173AF931A25752C0A964958260

Creeks traverse the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCSC Walking Map | url=http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901143913/http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flickr: Oaks Path Night | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/exitfromreality/55520898/ |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of natural points of interest throughout the UCSC grounds. The "Porter Caves" are a popular site among students on the west side of campus. The entrance is located in the forest between the [[Porter College]] meadow and Empire Grade Road. The caves wind through a set of caverns, some of which are challenging, narrow passages. Tree Nine is another popular destination for students. A large [[Douglas fir]] spanning approximately {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, Tree Nine is located in the upper campus of UCSC behind [[College Nine]]. The tree had been a popular climbing spot for many years but due to environmental corrosion and fear of student injuries, UC ground services sawed off the limbs to make it nearly impossible to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Tovin Lapan, [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 "UCSC attempts to stop students from climbing campus favorite 'Tree Nine' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520114146/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 |date=May 20, 2013 }} ' 'Santa Cruz Sentinel' ' , October 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For specific directions, reference: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100111072232/http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Tree-Nine-at-the-University-of-California-in-Santa-Cruz directions to Tree Nine] For the less experienced tree-climber, students also frequent Sunset Tree located on the east side of the meadow behind the UCSC Music Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|title=UCSC Campus Field Trip|date=April 17, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417170443/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|archivedate=April 17, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|title=Empire Cave|date=April 20, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420140510/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|archivedate=April 20, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCSC campus is also one of the few homes to [[Mima Mounds]] in the United States. They are rare in the United States and in the world in general.

==Academics==
[[File:UCSC farm rows.jpg|left|thumb|Organic farm rows]]
The university offers 63 undergraduate majors and 35 minors, with graduate programs in 33 fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz – Academic Programs|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/academics/
|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popular undergraduate majors include Art, [[Business management|Business Management Economics]], [[Molecular biology|Molecular and Cell Biology]], and [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Interdisciplinary programs, such as Computational Media, Feminist Studies, [[Environmental studies|Environmental Studies]], Visual Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, and the prestigious [[History of Consciousness]] Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.

A joint program with [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|UC Hastings]] enables UC Santa Cruz students to earn a bachelor's degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven.  The "3+3 BA/JD" Program between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco accepted its first applicants in fall 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/|title=3 Plus 3|website=3plus3.ucsc.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UCSC students who declare their intent in their freshman or early sophomore year will complete three years at UCSC and then move on to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum. Credits from the first year of law school will count toward a student's bachelor's degree. Students who successfully complete the first-year law course work will receive their bachelor's degree and be able to graduate with their UCSC class, then continue at UC Hastings afterwards for two years.

===Research===
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], UC Santa Cruz spent $155.5 million on research and development in 2012, ranking it 120th in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site;jsessionid=519A925E61C6701A1CAB3D9DDC0EE0B8?method=rankingBySource&amp;ds=herd |title=Rankings by total R&amp;D expenditures |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level [[natural science]] research component with the appointment of plant physiologist [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] as the first provost of [[Crown College, University of California, Santa Cruz|Crown College]]. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714160609/http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2006|title=Kenneth V.

UC Santa Cruz was tied for 47th in the list of Best Global Universities and tied for 70th in the list of Best National Universities in the United States by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''{{'}}s 2019 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321 |title=University of California--Santa Cruz |publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 ''[[Kiplinger]]'' ranked UC Santa Cruz 50th out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation, and 3rd in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/tool/college/T014-S001-kiplinger-s-best-values-in-public-colleges/index.php |publisher=''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' |title=Kiplinger's Best Values in Public Colleges - 2017 |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money Magazine ranked UC Santa Cruz 41st in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2016 Best Colleges ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MONEY's Best Colleges |url=http://new.time.com/money/best-colleges/rankings/best-colleges/ |publisher=''Money''|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016–2017, UC Santa Cruz was rated 146th in the world by ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]''. In 2016 it was ranked 83rd in the world by the ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' and 296th worldwide in 2016 by the ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.

In 2009, RePEc, an online database of research economics articles, ranked the UCSC Economics Department sixth in the world in the field of international finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economics web site ranks UCSC sixth in the world for research on international finance|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|accessdate=November 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528041409/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|archivedate=May 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''High Times'' magazine placed UCSC as first among US universities as a "counterculture college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked 1st in High Times 2007|url=http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|accessdate=October 14, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920125855/http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|archivedate=September 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' (with ''[[Gamepro]]'' magazine) ranked UC Santa Cruz's Game Design major among the top 50 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked in top 50 for Game Design |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/game-design.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''The Princeton Review'' and ''Gamepro Media'' ranked UC Santa Cruz's graduate programs in Game Design as seventh in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Graduate Schools for Video Game Design 2011|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, UCSC was ranked No. 3 in the Most Beautiful Campus list of ''Princeton Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Franek, Robert. The Best 376 Colleges, 2012 Edition. The Princeton Review. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residential colleges==
The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the university's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the "[[residential college|residential college system]]" outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see [[University of California, Santa Cruz#History|History]], above). Upon admission, all undergraduate students have the opportunity to choose one of ten colleges, with which they usually stay affiliated for their entire undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name="collegesection"&gt;
{{cite web|title=UCSC General Catalog 2004–2006 (The Colleges section)|accessdate=June 29, 2006|url=http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/html/04_06colleges.htm

There are cases where some students switch college affiliations as each college holds a different graduation ceremony. Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Other universities with similar college systems include [[Rice University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty [[provost (education)|provost]], who is the nominal head of his or her college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; An incoming first-year student will take a mandatory "core course" within his or her respective college, with a curriculum and central theme unique to that college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments. Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges. The ten colleges are, in order of establishment:

===Grading===
For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique [[Grading in the United States|student evaluation]] system. With the exception of the choice of letter grades in science courses the only [[grade (education)|grades]] assigned were "pass" and "no record", supplemented with [[narrative evaluation]]s. Beginning in 1997, UCSC allowed students the option of selecting letter grade evaluations, but course grades were still optional until 2000, when faculty voted to require students receive letter grades. Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades. {{As of|2010}}, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure. Still, some professors write evaluations for all students while some would write evaluations for specific students upon request.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/02/24/MN88561.DTL|title=UC Santa Cruz To Start Using Letter Grades|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 2, 2008|last=Schevitz|first=Tanya|date=February 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can still elect to receive a "pass/no pass" grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading. A grade of C and above would receive a grade of "pass". Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a "pass/no pass" basis. Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now "graded", most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC Discover – Academics

==Library==
[[File:McHenry Library stacks, University of California Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|McHenry Library stacks]]
The [[McHenry Library]] houses UCSC's arts and letters collection, with most of the scientific reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library. The McHenry Library was designed by [[John Carl Warnecke]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In addition, the colleges host smaller libraries, which serve as quiet places to study.  The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the papers of [[Anaïs Nin]], the papers and drawings of [[Beat poet]] [[Kenneth Patchen]], the largest collection of [[Edward Weston]] photographs in the country, the [[mycology]] book collection of composer [[John Cage]], a large collection of works by [[Satyajit Ray]], the [[Hayden White]] collection of 16th-century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive. The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to [[Lick Observatory]] dating back to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

UCSC students are known for political activism.

UC Santa Cruz is also well known for its [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2,000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual "[[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]". Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark pot holiday

Another well known tradition is what is known as "[[First Rain]]". Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain.

===Housing===
Most of the UCSC undergraduate housing is affiliated with one of the ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, [[gender-neutral housing|gender-neutral]] and substance-free floors are also available.

All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.

In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services | url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | accessdate=April 16, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404191759/http://housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | archive-date=April 4, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
UCSC is home to few fraternities and sororities. The first Greek organization on campus, [[Theta Chi]], was given colony status on January 10, 1987 and chartered on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like [[Theta Chi]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student groups like P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxucsc.com/history.html|title=Wayback Machine|date=August 31, 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831231223/http://oxucsc.com/history.html|archivedate=August 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek life at UCSC includes fraternities [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Phi Zeta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Pi Alpha Phi]], and [[Delta Lambda Psi]], the nation's first gender neutral queer Greek organization. Sororities that are members of the [[National Panhellenic Council]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz include [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]. Recently in June 2016 the Theta Xi chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] was chartered to bring a third National sorority to UC Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kappaalphatheta.org/whatsnew/index.cfm?entryId=86CC0556-DDF7-2DE8-A1591D25B14DFC64|title=Kappa Alpha Theta - What's New - Kappa Alpha Theta Welcomes UC Santa Cruz!|website=Kappaalphatheta.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sororities on campus include [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Pi Alpha]], [[Tri Chi]], [[Sigma Omicron Pi]], [[Kappa Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]] and [[Alpha Psi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/studentorgs/rso-glo/glolist.html|title=List of Greek Organizations|website=soar.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent Greek lettered organization added to the campus was [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority, which chartered its chapter Gamma Phi as of Spring 2016.

Aside from social fraternities and sororities on campus, there are also a number of professional organizations as well. There are [[Kappa Gamma Delta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgdatucsc.org|title=Kappa Gamma Delta- UC Santa Cruz, Zeta Chapter|website=KGD|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prehealth sorority, [[Sigma Mu Delta]], a prehealth fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a coed service fraternity, [[Phi Alpha Delta]], a pre-law fraternity, and [[Delta Sigma Pi]], a co-ed professional business fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|title=UCSC Discover - Student Life|date=May 31, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531010536/https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|archivedate=May 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Though UCSC has been known for its conservation efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sustainability Office|url=http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|work=Sustainability Office|publisher=UCSC Sustainability Office|accessdate=May 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060403/http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.

==Athletics==
{{main|UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs}}
[[File:UCSC East Field.jpg|thumb|East Field]]
UCSC competes in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as an Independent member. There are fifteen [[varsity team|varsity]] sports – men's and women's basketball, tennis, soccer, volleyball, swimming, cross country and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and women's golf. UCSC teams have been Division III nationally ranked in tennis, soccer, men's volleyball, and swimming. The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of successful club teams. It has won multiple club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.

In 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.

[[Histogram]]s are most commonly used as visual representations of data. However, [[Database management system|database systems]] use histograms to summarize data internally and provide size estimates for [[Query language|queries]]. These histograms are not presented to users or displayed visually, so a wider range of options are available for their construction. Simple or exotic histograms are defined by four parameters, Sort Value, Source Value, Partition Class and Partition Rule. The most basic histogram is the equi-width histogram, where each [[Bucket (computing)|bucket]] represents the same range of values. That histogram would be defined as having a Sort Value of Value, a Source Value of Frequency, be in the Serial Partition Class and have a Partition Rule stating that all buckets have the same range.

'''V-optimal histograms''' are an example of a more "exotic" histogram. V-optimality is a Partition Rule which states that the bucket boundaries are to be placed as to minimize the cumulative weighted variance of the buckets. Implementation of this rule is a complex problem and construction of these histograms is also a complex process.

==Definition==
A v-optimal histogram is based on the concept of minimizing a quantity which is called the ''weighted variance'' in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Poosala at al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;W=\sum_{j=1}^Jn_jV_j \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the histogram consists of ''J'' bins or buckets, ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of items contained in the ''j''th bin and where ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the variance between the values associated with the items in the ''j''th bin.

==Examples==
The following example will construct a V-optimal histogram having a Sort Value of Value, a Source Value of Frequency, and a Partition Class of Serial. In practice, almost all histograms used in research or commercial products are of the Serial class, meaning that sequential sort values are placed in either the same bucket, or sequential buckets. For example, values 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be in buckets 1 and 2, or buckets 1, 2 and 3, but never in buckets 1 and 3. That will be taken as an assumption in any further discussion.

Take a simple set of data, for example, a list of integers:

1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3, 6, 3, 6, 8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 5, 3, 4, 7, 2, 6, 7, 2

Compute the value and frequency pairs
(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2)

Our V-optimal histogram will have two buckets. Since one bucket must end at the data point for 8, we must decide where to put the other bucket boundary. The V-optimality rule states that the cumulative weighted variance of the buckets must be minimized. We will look at two options and compute the cumulative variance of those options.

Option 1:
Bucket 1 contains values 1 through 4. Bucket 2 contains values 5 through 8.

Bucket 1: &lt;br&gt;
Average frequency 3.25&lt;br&gt;
Weighted variance 2.28

Bucket 2: &lt;br&gt;
Average frequency 2.5&lt;br&gt;
Weighted variance 2.19

Sum of Weighted Variance 4.47

Option 2:
Bucket 1 contains values 1 through 2. Bucket 2 contains values 3 through 8.

Bucket 1: &lt;br&gt;
Average frequency 3&lt;br&gt;
Weighted variance 1.41

Bucket 2: &lt;br&gt;
Average frequency 2.83&lt;br&gt;
Weighted variance 3.29

Sum of Weighted Variance 4.70

The first choice is better, so the histogram that would wind up being stored is
Bucket 1: Range(1 - 4), Average Frequency 3.25
Bucket 2: Range(5 - 8), Average Frequency 2.5

==Advantages of V-optimality vs. equi-width or equi-depth==
V-optimal histograms do a better job of estimating the bucket contents. A histogram is an estimation of the base data, and any histogram will have errors. The partition rule used in VOptimal histograms attempts to have the smallest variance possible among the buckets, which provides for a smaller error. Research done by Poosala and Ioannidis [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/poosala96improved.html 1] has demonstrated that the most accurate estimation of data is done with a VOptimal histogram using value as a sort parameter and frequency as a source parameter.

==Disadvantages of V-optimality vs. equi-width or equi-depth==
While the V-optimal histogram is more accurate, it does have drawbacks. It is a difficult structure to update. Any changes to the source parameter could potentially result in having to re-build the histogram entirely, rather than updating the existing histogram. An equi-width histogram does not have this problem. Equi-depth histograms will experience this issue to some degree, but because the equi-depth construction is simpler, there is a lower cost to maintain it. The difficulty in updating VOptimal histograms is an outgrowth of the difficulty involved in constructing these histograms.

==Construction issues==
The above example is a simple one. There are only 7 choices of bucket boundaries. One could compute the cumulative variance for all 7 options easily and choose the absolute best placement. However, as the range of values gets larger and the number of buckets gets larger, the set of possible histograms grows exponentially and it becomes a dauntingly complex problem to find the set of boundaries that provide the absolute minimum variance. A solution is to give up on finding the absolute best solution and attempt to find a good solution instead. By creating random solutions, using those as a starting point and improving upon them, one can find a solution that is a fair approximation of the "best" solution. One construction method used to get around this problem is the Iterative Improvement algorithm. Another is Simulated Annealing. The two may be combined in Two Phase Optimization, or 2PO. These algorithms are put forth in "Randomized Algorithms..." (cited below) as a method to optimize queries, but the general idea may be applied to construction of V-optimal Histograms.

===Iterative improvement===
Iterative Improvement (II) is a fairly naive greedy algorithm. Starting from a random state, iterative steps in many directions are considered. The step that offers the best improvement of cost (in this case Total Variance) is taken. The process is repeated until one settles at the local minimum, where no further improvement is possible. Applied to the construction of V-optimal histograms, the initial random state would be a set of values representing the bucket boundary placements. The iterative improvement steps would involve moving each boundary until it was at its local minimum, then moving to the next boundary and adjusting it accordingly.

===Simulated Annealing===
A basic explanation of Simulated Annealing is that it is a lot like II, only instead of taking the greedy step each time, it will sometimes accept a step that results in an increase in cost. In theory, SA will be less likely to stop at a very local minimum, and more likely to find a more global one. A useful piece of imagery is an "M" shaped graph, representing overall cost on the Y axis. If the initial state is on the "V" shaped part of the "M", II will settle into the high valley, the local minimum. Because SA will accept uphill moves, it is more likely to climb up the slope of the "V" and wind up at the foot of the "M", the global minimum.

===Two Phase Optimization===
Two Phase Optimization, or 2PO, combines the II and SA methods. II is run until a local minimum is reached, then SA is run on that solution in an attempt to find less obvious improvements.

==Variations of V-optimal Histograms==
The idea behind V-optimal histograms is to minimize the variance inside each bucket. In considering this, a thought occurs that the variance of any set with one member is 0. This is the idea behind "End-Biased" V-optimal Histograms. The value with the highest frequency is always placed in its own bucket. This ensures that the estimate for that value (which is likely to be the most frequently requested estimate, since it is the most frequent value) will always be accurate and also removes the value most likely to cause a high variance from the data set.

Another thought that might occur is that variance would be reduced if one were to sort by frequency, instead of value. This would naturally tend to place like values next to each other. Such a histogram can be constructed by using a Sort Value of Frequency and a Source Value of Frequency. At this point, however, the buckets must carry additional information indicating what data values are present in the bucket. These histograms have been shown to be less accurate, due to the additional layer of estimation required.

A '''virtual finite state machine''' ('''VFSM''') is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[#Virtual Environment|Virtual Environment]]. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input '''control properties''' and of output '''actions'''.

The VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates  the idea of an '''executable specification'''. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation and telecommunication applications.

== Why ==
The major problem by implementing of a state machine is the generation of logical conditions (State transition conditions and Action conditions). In the hardware environment, where state machines have found their original use, this problem does not exist: all signals are Boolean. In contrary the state machines specified and implemented in the software require logical conditions that are per se multivalued ones.

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
-	Temperature can be at least Low , OK, High&lt;br&gt;
-	Commands may have several values: Init, Start, Stop, Break, Continue&lt;br&gt;
-	In a (hierarchical) system of state machines the Slaves state machines have many states that are used in conditions of a Master state machine.&lt;br&gt;
In addition many input signals can be not known due for instance to a broken cable which means that even a digital input signals (considered as classical Boolean values) are in fact 3 values signals: Low, High, Unknown. The Temperature example needs probably also the value Unknown.

A Positive Logical Algebra solves this problem by creating a Virtual Environment which allows specification of state machines for software using multivalued variables.

== Control Properties ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may have one or more values which are relevant for the control &amp;ndash; in such a case it is an input variable. Those values are the control properties of this variable. Control properties are not necessarily specific data values but are rather certain states of the variable. For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED, RUNNING etc...

== Actions ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions - in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be  triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.

== Virtual Environment ==
The virtual environment characterises the environment in which a VFSM operates. It is defined by three sets of names:
*'''input names''' represent the control properties of all available variables
*'''output names''' represent the available actions on the variables
*'''state names''', as defined  for each of the states of the  FSM.
The input names  build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the '''[[positive logic algebra]]'''. The output names  trigger actions (entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions).

For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED, RUNNING etc...

== Actions ==
A variable in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions - in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be  triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.

== Virtual Environment ==
The virtual environment characterises the environment in which a VFSM operates. It is defined by three sets of names:
*'''input names''' represent the control properties of all available variables
*'''output names''' represent the available actions on the variables
*'''state names''', as defined  for each of the states of the  FSM.
The input names  build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the '''[[positive logic algebra]]'''. The output names  trigger actions (entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions).

== Positive Logic Algebra ==
The rules to build a virtual condition are as follows:

=== Input Names and Virtual Input ===
A state of an input is described by Input Names which create a set.

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
- for the input A: Anames = {''A1'', ''A2'', ''A3''}&lt;br&gt;
- for the input B: Bnames = {''B1'', ''B2''}&lt;br&gt;
- for the input C: Cnames = {''C1'', ''C2'', ''C3'', ''C4'', ''C5''}&lt;br&gt;
etc.

Virtual Input VI is a set of mutually exclusive elements of input names. A VI contains always the element always.

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always''}&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always'', ''A1''}&lt;br&gt;
VI = {''always'', ''A1'', ''B2'', ''C4''}

=== Logical operations on Input Names ===
'''&amp;''' (AND) operation is a set of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
	''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' &amp; ''C2''= &gt; {''A1'', ''B3'', ''C2''}

'''|''' (OR) operation is a table of sets of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' &amp; ''C2'' =&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; B3 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; C2 &amp; \} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''~''' (Complement) is a compliment of a set of input names.

For instance&lt;br&gt;
	 ~''A2'' = {''A1'', ''A3''}

=== Logical expression ===
A logical expression is an OR-table of AND-sets (corresponds to disjunctive form of a boolean expression).

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
''A1'' &amp; ''B3'' | ''A1'' &amp; ''B2'' &amp; ''C4'' | ''C2''  =&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; B3 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; A1 &amp; B2 &amp; C4 &amp; \} \\
\{ &amp; C2 &amp; \} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Logical expressions are used to express any logical function.

=== Evaluation of a logical expression ===
The logical value (true, false) of a logical expression is calculated by testing whether any of the AND-sets in the OR-table is a subset of VI.

=== Output Names and Virtual Output ===
A state of an output is described by Output Names which create a set.

For instance:&lt;br&gt;
for an output Xnames = {''X1'', ''X2''}&lt;br&gt;
for an output Ynames = {''Y1'', ''Y2'', ''Y3''}&lt;br&gt;
Virtual output VO is a set of mutually exclusive elements of output names.

=== Virtual Environment===
The Virtual Name and Virtual Output completed by State Names create a Virtual Environment VE where the behavior is specified.

== VFSM Execution Model ==
[[Image:Virtual finite state machine executor flow chart.gif|thumbnail|Figure 2: VFSM Executor Flow Chart]]
A subset of all defined input names, which can exist only in a certain situation, is called virtual input (VI). For instance temperature can be either "too low", "good" or "too high". Although there are three input names defined, only one of them can exist in a real situation. This one builds the VI.

A subset of all defined output names, which can  exist only in a certain situation is called virtual output (VO). VO is built by the current action(s) of the VFSM.

The behaviour specification is built by a state table which describes all details of all states of the VFSM.

The VFSM executor is triggered by VI and the current state of the VFSM. In consideration of the  behaviour specification of the current state, the VO is set.

Figure 2 shows one possible implementation of a VFSM executor. Based on this implementation a typical behaviour characteristics must be considered.

== State Table ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finite state machine]] --&gt;
:''main page: [[state transition table]].''
A ''state table'' defines all details of the behaviour of a state of a VFSM. It consists of three columns: in the first column state names are used, in the second the virtual conditions built out of input names using the positive logic algebra are placed and in the third column the output names appear:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! State Name
! Condition(s)
! Actions(s)
|-
| rowspan=4 valign="top" | Current state || Entry action || Output name(s)
|-
| Exit action || Output name(s)
|-
| Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| ... || ...
|-
| Next state name || Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| Next state name || Virtual condition || Output name(s)
|-
| ... || ... || ...
|-
|}

Read the table as following: the first two lines define the entry and exit actions of the current state. The following lines which do not provide the next state represent the input actions. Finally the lines providing the next state represent the state transition conditions and transition actions. All fields are optional. A pure combinatorial VFSM is possible in case only where input actions are used, but no state transitions are defined. The transition action can be replaced by the proper use of other actions.
