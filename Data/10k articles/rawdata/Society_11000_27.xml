'''Arubans in the Netherlands''' consist of migrants from [[Aruba]] to the [[Netherlands]] and their descendants. Aruba was part of the former [[Netherlands Antilles]] until 1986 when the country seceded remaining a constituent country of [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As of 2014, figures from [[Statistics Netherlands]] showed 142,953 people of Dutch Antillean origin in the Netherlands, of which 23,800 are Aruban.&lt;ref&gt;http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37325&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=a&amp;D6=l&amp;VW=T&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Aruban communities in the Netherlands can be found in [[Amsterdam]], [[Almere]], [[Haarlem]], [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Alkmaar]] and [[Amersfoort]].

'''Baozou''' ({{zh|s=暴走}}) is a [[website]] featuring comics and animations. The Baozou style of comics, originally inspired by [[rage comic]]s of the US, was popularized in China and later developed into its own style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=14906&amp;offset=1 "He is even on top of the Baozou comics that have become popular in China lately, as well as the mobile social hook-up app Momo that is popular with the new ...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauzou is an Internet phenomenon, emerging from the specific sociopolitical context of contemporary China, and a staple in Chinese popular online culture.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

Still or animated Baozou figures are created and used as emoticons to depict simple and crude visuals used in electronic or web messages. Internet users often use Baozou figures in parody of a range of different emotions. Baozou (which roughly translates to "out of control" or rage in Chinese)&lt;ref name=animation/&gt; also produces ''[[Baozou Big News Events]]'', a popular humorous show covering news, literature, history, psychology, politics, chemistry and biology.&lt;ref name=news/&gt;

==Background==
In 2008, Wang Nima founded the baozoumanhua.com website to spread the popularity of images he created from rage comics. The new form of [[comics|comic]] became known as Baozou comics. The rough, unpolished comics are typically created by amateurs and spread across the internet.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10304312.2014.941334?journalCode=ccon20| title=Baozou manhua (rage comics), Internet humour and everyday life| author=Shih-Wen Chen| date=2014| journal=Contunuum| volume=28| issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=human&gt;{{cite book| title=Human-Computer Interaction, Novel User Experiences| publisher=HCI International| author=Masaaki Kurosu| date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baozou is known as a [[parody]] franchise, but the website has expanded to include live action stand-up, [[Flash animation]] shorts, apps, anime parodies, and an animated series of short stories. One of the website's developments is the app, Baozou Daily. The website's videos also appear on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=animation&gt;{{cite book| title=Animation in China: History, Aesthetics, Media| author=Sean Macdonald| date=November 6, 2015| publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang Nima, founder and editor in chief of Baozou, was named one of the top 10 web celebrities of the decade in China by search engine [[Baidu]], in part for his work on ''[[Baozou Big News Events]]'', an internet show by Baozou that covers news and other popular subjects.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2016-05/15/content_38456103.htm| title=Top 10 web celebrities of the decade in China| author=Lu Na| date=May 15, 2016| publisher=China.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baozou founded the Baozou Foundation that aims to help young people in need.&lt;ref name=ent&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20160906/42679815_0.shtml| title=How does Baozou connect people to brand values through online entertainment?| date=September 6, 2016| publisher=iFent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emoticons==
Emoticons made in the Baozou style are often parodies of emotions. 400 Baozou faces have been pulled from baozoumanhua.com, and over 300 Baozou faces can be found on WeChat. The faces are universal, using exaggerated facial expressions for comedic effect. They often mock common experiences rather than targeting insults. Baozou emoticons also tend to be general-neutral. Premade faces that can be found on the baozoumanhua.com website include celebrity faces such as [[Yao Ming]] and [[Jackie Chan]]. Users take the pre-made faces or other images and alter them using [[Microsoft Paint]] or [[Adobe Photoshop]] to depict a desired emotion.&lt;ref name=human/&gt; Baozou established the UGC platform which allows users to create and share content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=The Economic Observer| date=March 26, 2016| title=Key words of Baozou: Internet &amp; Youth Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baozou Big News Events==
{{Main|Baozou Big News Events}}

''Baozou Big News Events'', also referred to as ''Baozou Big News'', is a Chinese internet talk-variety show which is produced by Baozoumanhua. The show has created Internet buzzwords that are widely used in China. The host, Wang Nima, wears a headpiece with a comic face on it and reports ridiculous news events. The show imitate the [[BBC]] comedy news show [[Russell Howard's Good News]]. The first season aired from March 29 to August 8, 2013, the second season from December 20, 2013 to June 20, 2014, the third season from June 27, 2014 to June 26, 2015, and the fourth season was released on July 10, 2015. The initial season aired ever two weeks with short episodes. As the show evolved, the style and schedule changed to being released once a week.&lt;ref name=ent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Baozou Big News Events| publisher=America Pink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In China, Baozou has gained public attention. The comics appear in online communications including instant messaging platforms such as [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] as well as [[Microblogging|micro blogs]], e-bulletin boards and forums. The popularity of the comics is in part due to the growing sensation of [[emoticon]]s in China. Baozou comic creators have created facial expressions from online photos and videos that are used across the web to express feelings.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;

[[File:Be Best Campaign.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|President [[Donald Trump]] and First Lady [[Melania Trump]] with students in the [[Oval Office]] at the announcement of the initiative]]

'''Be Best''' is a public awareness campaign promoted by United States First Lady [[Melania Trump]], focusing on well-being for youth, and advocating against [[cyberbullying]] and drug (particularly [[opioid]]) use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/politics/article/Melania-Trump-launches-BE-BEST-awareness-12894525.php|title=Melania Trump launches 'BE BEST' awareness campaign for kids|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhodan |first=Maya |url=http://time.com/5268266/be-best-first-lady-melania-trump-launches-official-white-house-project/ |title=Melania Trump Launches 'Be Best' to Focus on Cyberbullying |work=Time |date=May 7, 2018 |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Melania Trump made the initiative as a way to address online behavior and the opioid crisis, and came with the name "Be Best". Her husband [[Donald Trump]] reportedly tried to persuade her to change topics so she could avoid dealing with [[Donald Trump on social media|his own Twitter habits]], but Mrs. Trump said she was willing to face any criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rogers |first1=Katie |last2=Davis |first2=Julie Hirschfeld |last3=Haberman |first3=Maggie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html |title=Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House |work=The New York Times |date=August 17, 2018 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wise |first=Justin |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/402435-trump-didnt-want-melanias-platform-to-be-anti-bullying-initiative |title=Trump tried to dissuade Melania from 'Be Best' anti-bullying campaign: report |date=August 17, 2018 |work=The Hill |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She formally introduced the campaign on May 7, 2018. Following her speech in the [[White House Rose Garden]], President [[Donald Trump]] signed a [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|proclamation]] declaring May 7 "Be Best" day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44034723|title=Melania Trump unveils 'Be Best' campaign|date=May 7, 2018|work=''BBC News''|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/melania-trump-platform/|title=Melania Trump speaks: Live updates|date=May 7, 2018|publisher=CNN|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/07/melania-trump-unveils-be-best-initiative-to-help-kids.html|title=Melania Trump unveils ‘Be Best’ initiative to help kids|last=Pappas|first=Alex|date=May 7, 2018|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike policy initiatives by previous first ladies (such as [[Michelle Obama]]'s [[Let's Move!]] campaign against childhood obesity, or [[Nancy Reagan]]'s [[Just Say No]] to drugs campaign), Be Best is broad in scope. The initiative focuses on physical and emotional well-being, and also advocates against [[cyberbullying]] and [[opioid abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCammon |first1=Sarah |title=First Lady Melania Trump Unveils 'Be Best' Campaign, Focusing On Children |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/05/07/609180852/first-lady-melania-trump-unveils-be-best-campaign-focusing-on-children |accessdate=July 31, 2018 |publisher=NPR |date=May 7, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative began with a slow start, as Mrs. Trump underwent kidney surgery one week after the campaign was launched. She made no public appearances for the next several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCammon |first1=Sarah |title=One Month Later, What's Become Of Melania Trump's 'Be Best' Campaign? |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/07/617642736/1-month-later-whats-become-of-melania-trumps-be-best-campaign |accessdate=July 31, 2018 |publisher=NPR |date=June 7, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2018, she visited the [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and talked about children with [[neonatal withdrawal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/melania-trump-be-best-nashville/index.html |title=Melania Trump pushes 'Be Best' initiative with trip to Nashville |publisher=CNN |date=July 24, 2018 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2018, she tweeted, "It's #Backtoschool for many youth this month.

The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written  "by First Lady Melania Trump and the [[Federal Trade Commission]]" (FTC), but it was nearly identical to a document prepared by the commission in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/07/melania-trump-plagiarism-row-be-best-campaign|title=Melania Trump in new plagiarism row over online safety pamphlet|last=Smith|first=David|date=May 8, 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities prompted accusations of plagiarism, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/melania-trump-plagiarism-be-best-initiative.html|title=As Melania Trump Faces Plagiarism Claims, Her Staff Lashes Out at News Media|date=May 8, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 8, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the plagiarism accusations the White House's website changed the copy to read "a Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/386641-melania-be-best-campaign-booklet-copies-from-obama-era-ftc-brochure|title=Melania Trump 'Be Best' pamphlet was first published by Obama's FTC|last=Seipel|first=Brooke|date=May 8, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact checking site [[Snopes]] found the charge of plagiarism "Mostly False" saying, "Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the First Lady's "Be Best" campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did Melania Trump Plagiarize a Pamphlet for the ‘Be Best’ Campaign? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-melania-trump-plagiarize-pamphlet/ |website=Snopes |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">'''Belgranodeutsch''' or '''Belgrano-Deutsch''' is a [[macaronic language|macaronic]] mixture of [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in [[Buenos Aires]], specifically in the neighborhood of [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vecoli | first = Rudolph J. | authorlink = |author2=Judy Galens|author3=Anna Jean Sheets|author4=Robyn V.

It was spoken by the German community living in both Belgrano "R" (residential) and Belgrano "C" (commercial).
There were two main schools in the neighborhood, the Goethe Schule and the Pestalozzi Schule.  Around the [[Second World War]] there was a certain division of political and religious origin between the two schools.

Belgranodeutsch still survives today and can be compared to "[[Spanglish]]," a blend of [[Mexican Spanish]] and [[American English]] spoken in the [[United States]].

==Examples==

* ''Traducierst'' du das mal?  (Could you translate this?)
* Das ist ''ein asco''.  (That is disgusting)

'''Bissa''' (or '''Busanga''' (singular), '''Bisa''', '''Busansi''' (plural)), is a [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] ethnic group of south-central [[Burkina Faso]], northeastern [[Ghana]], the northernmost tip of [[Togo]] and northern [[Benin]]. Their language, [[Bissa language|Bissa]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Mande language]] that is related to, but not the same as, a cluster of languages in the old [[Borgu]] Kingdom area of Northeast [[Benin]] and Northwest [[Nigeria]], including [[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]], [[Boko language|Boko]], and [[Kyenga language|Kyenga]]. An alternate name for the Bissa is '''Busansi''' which is used by the [[Mossi people]].

Daniel McFarland's ''Historical Dictionary of Upper Volta'' refers to them as "intrusive [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] who settled the area along the [[White Volta]] below [[Tenkodogo]] by 1300. Some live across the border in modern northern Ghana and Togo. According to some traditions, Rialle, progenitor of the Nakomse line of Mossi rulers was Busansi."&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bissa are known for their cultivation of peanuts. Traditionally, a Bissa man who wants to court a Bissa girl must work in her mother's peanut field, and be able to provide the girl with her own peanut field if they get married.&lt;ref&gt;An actual member of the Bissa tribe - which is probably a better source than any book written by Western scholars. There is not much information on the Bissa tribe at all in the literature.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The Bissa are divide into two major language groups, that is the Barka and Lerre.  They are further divided into several clans.  Each clan has a name and an appellation normally called ''dedaa'' by the Bissa. The appellation is now used as a surname in Burkina Faso  

==Some notable clans of the Bissa Tribe==
* Monnie
* Lingani
* Bara
* Bambara
* Burma (Wannor)
* Burma (Chennor)
* Zeba 
* Zigila
* Bitugunno
* Ledda
* Wareh
* Zuuro
* Tunugu
* Sambanno
* Geero
* Bance
* Bandaogo
* Gulagun(Nombone)
* Saaror
* Barka
* Gamine
*Sarreguno
*Lerro
The Bissa people are divided into numerous clans. Their language differs slightly; primary dialects are Barka, [[Lere language|Lere]], Ladda, Zeba, [[Zigula language|Zigila]].

Most Bissa are [[Islam|Muslim]].
The bisa of the Garango Circle are among the most representative of the north. The Garango township, which forms the center of the northern Bisa, remained independent, while the northwestern districts were under the tutelage of the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou and the northeastern townships under the supervision of the Mossi kingdom of Tenkodogo. In Accra, Ghana, some of the established and notable towns are Busanga line in the North Kaneshie area of the Okai Koi constituency. Other towns noted for their Bissa people are Town Council line or Lartebiokorshie and shukura in the Ablekuma central constituency, and Nima in Ayawaso central constituency.
In Bissa's tribes, Lingani's are the holder of both the political power and the mystical power. The person that hold the power is not the one with the crown but the one that gives the crown. No one can access to the power and wear the crown prior being mystically prepared by the Lingani's in Tangaré village of Garango in the province of Boulgou (Burkina Faso). The Lingani's are hunters and the ceremonial fig tree with their ancestors centenary hunting spear is still visible today near Tangaré mountain facing Lingani's famillial house. Bissas live with their dead ancestors buried in front of their houses in order to honor them. Bissa burial sites are  dug in shape of  traditional building but underground with a small hole for the body entrance and the person that receive the body to lay him for rest. Several people can be buried in the same familial grave. The grave entrance is covered with a clay vase that can be removed for future burial. Barso the ancestor of the bissas were hunter.

The '''Boruca language''' (also known as '''Bronka''', '''Bronca''' or '''Brúnkajk'''.) is the native language of the [[Boruca]] people of [[Costa Rica]]. It is one of the [[Chibchan languages]]. It is nearly extinct; it was spoken fluently by only five women in 1986, while 30 to 35 others spoke it nonfluently. The rest of the tribe's 1,000 members speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The language is taught as a second language at the local primary school Escuela Doris Z. Stone. One can hear Bronka words and phrases mixed into Spanish conversations but it is extremely rare to hear prolonged exchanges in Bronka.

Greeting:
'''¿Ishójcre rában?''' = ¿Qué tal? = What's up?
'''Morén, morén.''' = Bien = Fine, well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maroto Rojas|first=Espíritu Santo|title=Lengua o dialecto boruca o brunkajk|year=1999|publisher=Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica|location=San José, Costa Rica|isbn=9977-67-554-6|page=49|language=Spanish, Boruca|chapter=Palabras varias Saludos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bété''' are a little-studied [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]] group with strong cultural and artistic links to the [[Dan people|Dan]], the We ([[Gwere people|Gwere]]) and the Guro, among others. There are 93 distinct groups within the Bété polity. 

== Culture ==
They are only united in that they are [[subsistence farm|subsistence farmers]], but base most of their culture around hunting. Social control was exercised by the leading member of individual lineages (several in each village) who exercises judicial and financial power within the community. 

Bété are known for their focus on [[individual rights]]. A male "chief" is chosen by the people based on the criterion of wisdom. This leader stays in power until his death or any wrongdoing.

Men and women play equal roles in society as well, and Bete women are the most outspoken among the tribes. 

=== Religion ===
Spiritual authority was wielded with an array of paraphernalia, notably including the “gre” mask, a horned and decorated creation (originating with the We) designed to instill terror in the onlooker, to quell social unrest, and to be worn when meting out justice after conflict.
 
Statuary is uncommon, and is based around feminine iconography that refers to a mythical mother figure. No recognized liturgical function was found, although some reports indicate that a pair of figures was often placed under a village rain shelter to represent its founders. This evocation of a primeval couple has widespread resonance in [[African culture]]. Rare figures with exaggerated [[genitalia]] are probably linked to a magico-religious [[fertility]] appeal. Alternatively, they may have constituted a more general role, evoking or celebrating the fertility of the village/land, its founders or the forest from which the people made their living.

=== Marriage ===
The men of the Bete tribe travel outside of the village to find marriage partners. Choosing a partner within the tribe is not allowed because of the belief that the village is a family unit. Ethnically diverse marriages are strongly encouraged. Before dating begins men ask about the woman's family to prevent an intra-familial match. Marriage is forbidden if the couple is related in any way. Husbands remain in their home village after marriage. Wives join the husband's tribe. The husband is expected to provide a home and land (usually inherited) for his wife. 

The marriage is discussed only among the bride and groom and is meant to be a surprise for the parents, particularly the woman's parents. The date of the wedding is set and the wife's family is invited to the groom's village to celebrate. The woman's family then visits to make sure the woman is marrying of her own free will. This is a polite formality. When she has said that she is sure of her decision, then congratulations are welcomed. The wedding ceremony takes one week. Each day is a celebration of the bride and she is treated royally.

[[Polygamy]] is common. Husbands typically have no more than three wives. When a man decides to marry again, the first wife becomes a sort of mother to her. The original wife may choose to become the head of the group of wives. This is a common practice but not an obligation. Any wife may choose to separate if her husband marries another woman. The original wife may attempt to make the second wife feel unwelcome to make her leave instead. Alternatively, the wives get along.

Divorce is very common. A wife can leave her husband and return to her home village whenever she chooses without notice or explanation. The husband in turn can choose to kick his wife out. Counseling among friends is very common in marital disputes.

Traditions are mostly practiced by people still living in villages. When the children move to cities, they usually adopt Western traditions.

'''''Canada (AG) v Lavell''''', [1974] S.C.R. 1349, was a landmark 5–4 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision holding that Section 12(1)(b) of the ''[[Indian Act]]''&lt;ref&gt;R.S.C. 1970, c. I-6.&lt;/ref&gt; did not violate the respondents' right to "equality before the law" under Section 1 (b) of the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]]. The two respondents, [[Jeannette Vivian Corbiere Lavell|Lavell]] and Bédard, had alleged that the impugned section was discriminatory under the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' by virtue of the fact that it deprived Indian women of their status for marrying a non-Indian, but not Indian men.

The Supreme Court's decision proved very controversial, later influencing the wording of [[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] during the drafting process.

==Background to Mrs. Lavell==
Mrs. Lavell,&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Lavell was born Jeannette Vivian Corbiere.&lt;/ref&gt; a member of [[Wiikwemkoong First Nation]], married David Lavell, a journalism student at [[Ryerson University|Ryerson Institute]] in Toronto, on April 11, 1970. She was promptly delivered a notice from the [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] indicating that due to her marriage to a person not registered as Indian, she would no longer be considered an Indian by law. On December 7, 1970, the Indian Registrar deleted her name from the [[Indian Register|Registry]] in accordance with Section 12(1)(b) of the ''[[Indian Act]]''. Mrs. Lavell disputed her loss of status to the registrar, but without success.

At Mrs. Lavell's request for judicial review of the Registrar's decision, Mrs. Lavell's case was referred to Judge B.W. Grossberg of the York County Court as per section 9(3) of the ''Indian Act''.&lt;ref&gt;[1974] S.C.R. 1349 at 1376.&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Lavell argued that Section 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'' was inoperative due to an irreconcilable abridgement of her right to equality before the law, guaranteed by the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''. In particular, Mrs. Lavell asserted that the ''Indian Act'' discriminated against Indian women since only they lost their status as an Indian under the ''Act'', whereas Indian men could marry whomever they so desired without adverse legal consequence. The decision of registrar, she argued, must therefore be reversed.

In the case's proceedings, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada presented evidence to the court demonstrating that Mrs. Lavell had not lived on a single reserve for a period of nine years before her marriage and that she had only made a few "sporadic" visits to her family.&lt;ref&gt;''RE Lavell v. Attorney General of Canada'' (1972), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 182 at 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, counsel argued that as far as the law was concerned, the ''Indian Act'' did not discriminate against Indian women. In defence of this proposition, counsel noted that the Supreme Court has rejected the 'similarly-situated doctrine' as the appropriate measure of a party's equality before the law.&lt;ref name=drybones&gt;''[[R. v. Drybones|The Queen v. Drybones]]'', [1970] S.C.R. 282, overruling ''R. v. Gonzales'' (1962), 32 D.L.R. (2d) 290, 132 C.C.C. 237, 37 C.R. 56 (B.C.C.A.). In ''Drybones'' discrimination was ruled to have occurred between Indians and Canadians (i.e. Indians were prohibited from becoming intoxicated off a reserve, whereas Canadians were free to become intoxicated without penalty) and not between fellow Indians (e.g. the law prohibited all Indians from becoming intoxicated off a reserve).&lt;/ref&gt; The appellant, Mrs. Lavell, therefore, counsel for the Attorney General argued, must be compared not to married Indian men, but to all married Canadian women in order to establish whether or not discrimination has in fact occurred by reason of sex.

===Judgement of Judge B. W. Grossberg as ''persona designata'' (York County Court)===
Grossberg affirmed and upheld the Registrar's decision, holding that the impugned Section of the ''Indian Act'' did not discriminate against the appellant on the basis of sex. Judge Grossberg noted that the ''Indian Act'' treated all married women equally, Indian or not:

::The appellant entered into a voluntary marriage which gave her the status and all the rights enjoyed by all other Canadian married females. Her marriage also imposed on her the same obligations imposed on all other Canadian married females&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=lavell186&gt;''RE Lavell v. Attorney General of Canada'', at 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Grossberg also dismissed the appellant's arguments regarding the different distinctions between male and female Indians, stating that he had difficulty fathoming how such alleged inequalities within different groups of Canadian society are necessarily offensive to the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''. As a matter of fact, Judge Grossberg suggests that it is a laudable point in Canadian history that the appellant is no longer an Indian, since she now she enjoys the same rights and freedoms of all Canadians; a feat which he construes as consistent to the recommendations of the "Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada".&lt;ref name=lavell186/&gt;

To that end Section 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'', the Judge concludes, is not inoperative in the face of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.

===Judgement of the Federal Court of Appeal===
Mrs. Lavell appealed Judge Grossberg's decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, arguing that Judge Grossberg erred in his determination that the impugned Section of the ''Indian Act'' was not in violation of the appellant's right to equality before the law.

Mr. Justice Thurlow, writing for a unanimous court, agreed, declaring the impugned section discriminatory on the basis of sex. Citing the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in ''[[R. v. Drybones|Drybones]]'',&lt;ref name=drybones/&gt; Justice Thurlow rejected the reasoning of Judge Grossberg that since all women, Canadian and Indian, were being treated the same under the ''Act'' that there was no deprivation of the appellant's equality before the law. Rather, Justice Thurlow determines that in order for the ''Indian Act'' to respect the equality of the appellants, the law must treat Indian women by the same fashion as it treats Indian men: as equals. Section 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'', Justice Thurlow reasons, does not treat Indian women in such a manner:

::It is clear that both male Indians and female Indians have capacity to marry and that each has the capacity and the right to contract a marriage either with another Indian or with a person who is not an Indian. ''The Indian Act'', however, which is a law made by the Parliament of Canada for Indians, prescribes a different result with respect to the rights of an Indian woman who marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian of another band, from that which is to obtain when a male Indian marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian who is a member of another band.&lt;ref name=lavell-1971&gt;''RE Lavell and Attorney General of Canada'' (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 188 at 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Thurlow also noted that should a male Indian marry a non-Indian, not only will his legal status as an Indian remain unchanged, the ''Indian Act'' also provides that his wife may also be registered as an Indian.&lt;ref&gt;''RE Lavell and Attorney General of Canada'' (1971) at 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being of the opinion that the Court could not apply the ''Indian Act'' in the case at bar without infringing the appellant's rights under the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'', Justice Thurlow declared the impugned provision inoperative.

==Background to Mrs. Bédard==
Yvonne Bédard was born in the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Brantford as a member of the Iroquois Nation. On May, 1964, Mrs. Bédard married a non-Indian, begetting two children with him. Mrs. Bédard and her spouse lived together off the Reserve until June 23, 1970, when they separated. Mrs. Bédard returned with her two children to the Reserve to live in a house bequeathed to her by her mother, Carrie Williams.&lt;ref&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'' (1971), 25 D.L.R. (3d) 551 (Ont. S.C.) at 552–553.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Mrs Bédard had married a non-Indian, she was no longer listed in the Registry as an Indian. When she began to occupy the house on the reserve, the Six Nations Band Council passed a resolution ordering Mrs. Bédard to dispose of the property within the next six months, during which time she could live there. The Council latter adopted two additional resolutions allowing Mrs. Bédard to live in the house for another six months, and then another two months, but no longer than that. In order to act in accordance with the Council's resolutions, Mrs. Bédard eventually transferred ownership of the property to her brother (a registered member of the Band) who was granted a Certificate of Possession of the property on March 15, 1971, by the Minister of Indian Affairs as required by the ''Indian Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1355&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bédard and her children, with her brother's consent, remained to occupy the premises without rent. On September 15, 1971, the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, requesting the Brantford District Supervisor to serve notice to Mrs. Bédard that she shall quit the Reserve.&lt;ref name=lavell-1377/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'' (1971) at 553–554.&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bédard would later lose her status as an Indian shortly after taking the Six Nations Band Council to Court, slightly before she could deliver her [[statement of claim]] against the Council.&lt;ref name=lavell-1377/&gt;

After the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, Mrs. Bédard immediately sought an [[injunction]] in court to enjoin her expulsion from the Reserve as well as an order setting aside Resolution 15, passed by the Band Council. The motion for an injunction was later withdrawn in court, with Mrs. Bédard's counsel agreeing that only a declaratory relief against the Six Nations Band Council would be sought.&lt;ref name=lavell-1377&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'' (1971) at 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Bédard argued that the Band Council's resolution, authorizing that a request be made to the District Supervisor to expel her from the Reserve, and any action taken in accordance with such a request by the District Supervisor, as well as the removal of her name from the Band Registry because of her marriage to a non-Indian constituted discrimination on the basis of sex and race viz-à-viz her right to the "enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law", guaranteed by Section 1(a) of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'' (1971) at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, she asserted, it follows that the Band Council's actions are without force or effect.

The Band Council, the defendants in the case, argued, by contrary, that not every distinction is necessarily discriminatory. Only those distinctions which are adverse to the group with which they are being made can be categorized as discrimination as used in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''. To that end, the defendant is given "some advantages elsewhere in the Act" with which do not apply to male Indians, and thus compensates for certain disadvantages she may experience.&lt;ref name=bedard-556&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'', (1971) at 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgement of the Ontario Supreme Court===
Judge Osler, in his reasons for judgement, held that Section 12(1)(b) is inoperative by virtue of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''. 
The judge rejected the reasoning of the defendant that such "disadvantages" produced by the ''Indian Act'' can be "compensated" for by other provisions which favour Indian women. The distinction made by the ''Indian Act'', he asserts, whether the said distinction must be adverse or not to constitute discrimination, is clearly adverse toward the plaintiff to constitute discrimination:

:: it is perfectly apparent that the loss of status as an Indian and the loss of the right to be registered and to occupy property upon a reserve is discrimination which is adverse to the interest of Indian women&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=bedard-557/&gt;

With respect to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in ''Re Lavell and Attorney General of Canada'',&lt;ref name=lavell-1971/&gt; he holds that it is not binding as a matter of ''stare decisis''. Judge Osler, however, held it of persuasive value which, in light of the reasons given by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Drybones'',&lt;ref name=drybones/&gt; he found correct as a matter of law. In particular, he agreed that since Indian women obtain a different result for marrying a non-Indian spouse, it is "plainly discrimination by reason of sex with respect to the rights of an individual to the enjoyment of property".&lt;ref name=bedard-556/&gt;

Therefore, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in ''Drybones'', Osler held that it is "the duty of the Court&amp;nbsp;... to declare s. 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'' inoperative", which he did, declaring all actions of the Band Council and the District Supervisor in accordance with the impugned provision to be of no effect.&lt;ref name=bedard-557&gt;''Bédard v. Isaac'', (1971) at 557.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement of the Supreme Court of Canada==
Mrs. Lavell and Mrs. Bédard's cases were both appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which were both heard together.

In a 4–1–4 vote, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeals, setting aside the respective judgements of the Ontario Supreme Court and Federal Court of Appeal.

===Plurality opinion===
[[Judge|Justice]] [[Roland Ritchie|Ritchie]], writing for the plurality (Fauteux C.J., Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.), held that the enfranchisement of Indian women for marrying a non-Indian, as devised under Section 12(1)(b) of the [[Indian Act]], did not constitute a denial of the respondent's right to equality before the law. Hence, Ritchie did not find that the impugned Section  of the ''Indian Act'' is inoperative. In the course of making this decision, Justice Ritchie addressed numerous questions of law as follows.

Firstly, Ritchie held that the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] did not have the effect of rendering the entirety of ''The Indian Act'' inoperative because it deals solely with Indians (i.e. allegedly discrimination). Such a proposition, he argued, stands in contrast to the Court's jurisprudence and the very tenets of the [[common law]], and dismissed it as a thinly veiled assault on the powers given exclusively to the [[Parliament of Canada|Federal Parliament]] by the [[Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

To suggest that the provisions of the ''Bill of Rights'' have the effect of making the whole ''Indian Act'' inoperative as discriminatory is to assert that the ''Bill'' [of Rights] has rendered Parliament powerless to exercise the authority entrusted to it under the constitution of enacting legislation which treats Indians living on Reserves differently from other Canadians in relation to their property and civil rights.&lt;ref name=lavell-1359&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ritchie argued that Parliament cannot properly exercise the powers vested in it, if it cannot define the qualifications required to be an Indian and to "use and benefit of Crown lands reserved for Indians". Also, citing the preamble to the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' (which describes Parliament's intention to enact a ''Bill of Rights'' "which shall reflect the respect of Parliament for its constitutional authority"), it would appear, Ritchie asserted, that the ''Bill'' does not purport to "amend or alter the terms of the ''British North America Act''".&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1358.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Ritchie also noted that the majority in [[R. v. Drybones|Drybones]] clearly disavowed of an approach that would render an entire Act inoperative because of a violation, which held instead that only the offending provision should be construed as inoperative.&lt;ref name=lavell-1359/&gt;

Secondly, [[Roland Ritchie|Ritchie]] also held that [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] did not intend the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] to fundamentally change or alter any constitutional scheme such as those contained in the [[Indian Act]] and, in particular, those provisions which constitute a "necessary structure  . . . for the internal administration of the life of Indians on Reserves and their entitlement to the use and benefit of Crown lands"?&lt;ref name=lavell-1360&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1360.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a widely accepted convention, he argues, that an Act, in which Parliament exercises its constitutional functions, can only be changed or amended "by plain statutory language expressly enacted for the [that] purpose."&lt;ref name=lavell-1360/&gt; With respect to this case, he contended that Parliament did not intend to amend the ''Indian Act'' with the "use of broad general language directed at the statutory proclamation of the fundamental rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians . . .&lt;ref name=lavell-1360/&gt; Citing the case of ''Barker'' v. ''Edger''&lt;ref&gt;[1898] A.C. 748.&lt;/ref&gt; with approval and applying the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council's]] reasoning in that case, Ritchie concluded that the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'', likewise, did not and cannot amend the ''Indian Act''. For good measure, Ritchie also noted that Justice Pigeon came to similar conclusion in ''Drybones''.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1361–1362, referring to ''The Queen v. Drybones'' (1970) at 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, Justice Ritchie also disagreed with the respondent's interpretation of Justice [[Bora Laskin|Laskin's]] opinion in ''[[Curr v. The Queen|Curr]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Curr'' v. ''The Queen'', [1972] S.C.R. 889.&lt;/ref&gt; that a provision of a statute is inoperative purely on the basis of discrimination and that a violation of one of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Section 1 of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' need not be established. Ritchie contends that Justice Laskin merely stated in his majority opinion that the rights guaranteed in paragraphs (a) to (f) (of Section 1) are guaranteed "irrespective of race, national origin, colour or sex." In other words, Section 1 rights are universal, which he argues is supported by the locution of the French version of the ''Bill of Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1363.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Ritchie held that the notion that the ''Bill of Rights'' prohibits [[discrimination]] alone does not comport with the purposes of the ''Bill of Rights'', which are to guarantee that the rights and freedoms that are 'recognized and declared.' The right to be free of discrimination, he remarks, is not one of them per se.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1363–1364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Justice Ritchie held that the question of law that is applicable in the present case should be

&lt;blockquote&gt;

... confined to deciding whether the Parliament of Canada in defining the prerequisites of Indian Status so as not to include women of Indian birth who have chosen to marry non-Indians, enacted a law which cannot be sensibly construed and applied without abrogating, abriding or infringing the rights of such women to equality before the law.&lt;ref name=lavell-1365&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1365.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To that end, Ritchie held that the meaning of rights and freedoms in the [[Canadian Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] is exactly the same meaning "which it bore in Canada at the time when the ''Bill'' was enacted, and it follows that the phrase 'equality before the law' is to be construed in light of the law existing in Canada at that time."&lt;ref name=lavell-1365/&gt; In Ritchie's opinion, 'equality before the law' cannot be construed as "the egalitarian concept exemplified by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref name=lavell-1365/&gt; Instead, citing the preamble of the ''Bill of Rights'', Ritchie contended that 'equality before the law' should be construed in the context of the [[rule of law]]. Drawing from the writings of [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]], Ritchie remarked that 'equality before the law' is described as an aspect of the rule of law that "carries the meaning of equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land as administered by the ordinary courts." Ritchie also extended this interpretation of 'equality before the law' to the "application of the law by law enforcement authorities."&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying, this interpretation of 'equality before the law', Ritchie noted that the impugned scheme has been in force and effect since 1869, that is for at least a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1368–1369.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Ritchie argued that a "careful reading" of the ''Indian Act'' reveals that the section held inoperative in [[R v Drybones|Drybones]] was criminal legislation "exclusively concerned with behaviour of Indians ''off'' a Reserve", whereas Section 12(1)(b) is legislation "enacted as a part of the plan devised by Parliament, under s. 91(24) [of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] for the regulation of the internal domestic life of Indians on Reserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1370.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drybones'', therefore, can be distinguished from this case, Ritchie argued, because the majority of the Court in ''Drybones'' held that the impugned section "could not be enforced without bring about inequality between one group of citizens and another and that this inequality was occasioned by reason of the race of the accused."&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1371.&lt;/ref&gt; This case, Ritchie noted, does not involve the criminal law; therefore, Drybones "can&amp;nbsp;... have no application to the present appeals".

As such, Ritchie concluded that there is no denial of "equality before the law", since "no such inequality is necessarily entailed in the construction and application of s. 12(1)(b)".&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1371–173. Ritchie expounded upon this stating on p. 1371 that &lt;blockquote&gt;

The fundamental distinction between the present case and that of Drybones, however, appears to me to be that the impugned section in the latter case could not be enforce without denying equality of treatment in the administration and enforcement of the law before the ordinary courts of the land to a racial group, whereas no such inequality of treatment between Indian men and women flows as a necessary result of the application of s. 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act''.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinion===
[[Judge|Justice]] [[Louis-Philippe Pigeon|Pigeon]], in a [[concurring opinion]], agreed with the result of the [[Plurality opinion|plurality]]. However, citing his [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]] in [[R v Drybones|Drybones]], Pigeon chided the majority on the Court who would persist in giving the ''Bill of Rights'' "an invalidating effect over prior legislation". Pigeon asserted that the majority of the court which once disagreed with his dissent, "now adopt it for the main body of this important statute". It, therefore, he stated, "cannot be improper for me to adhere to what was my dissenting view".&lt;ref name=lavell-1390&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1390.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigeon argued that the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] need not have an invalidating effect, at all. He pointed out that there have been many cases in which a simple reinterpretation of the impugned legislation are "important illustration of the effectiveness of the ''Bill'' without any invalidating effect".&lt;ref name=lavell-1390/&gt;

===Dissenting opinions===
The remaining four Justices dissented, rejecting the holding of the plurality that ''R v Drybones'' must be distinguished from the case at bar and Pigeon's opinion that the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' cannot render a law inoperative by virtue of a violation of one of its enumerated rights.

====Laskin====

Writing also for Justices Hall and Spence, Justice Laskin wrote a strong dissent.

"It is", Justice Laskin wrote, "impossible to distinguish ''Drybones'', which he has "no disposition to reject."{{clarify|reason=There are three quotemarks here, breaking the quotation.|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Laskin argued that ''Drybones'' decided two things. First, ''Drybones'' decided that the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' was "more than a mere interpretation statute whose terms would yield to a contrary intention." Rather, he stated, it is the provisions of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' that take precedence over the provisions of a conflicting federal statute.&lt;ref name=lavell-1382&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1382.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Laskin stated that ''Drybones'' decided that the accused had been denied equality before the law on the basis that it was a criminal offence for him to do something, purely on the basis of his race.&lt;ref name=lavell-1382/&gt;

Laskin contended that Justice Ritchie's own opinion in ''Drybones'', the majority opinion, made it explicitly clear that a denial of a respondent's equality before the law was apparent because a distinction had been made solely on account of the respondent's race.  In light of these reasons, Laskin asserted that it would be unprincipled for the Court to now construe ''Drybones'' as contingent solely on the basis that the impugned section of the ''Indian Act'' created a punishable criminal offence.&lt;ref name=lavell-1383&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1383.&lt;/ref&gt; "The gist of the judgement", Laskin wrote, "lay in the legal disability imposed upon a person by reason of his race when other persons were under no similar restraint." Since the impugned Section of the ''Indian Act'' imposes disabilities and prescribes disqualifications for members of the female sex that are not imposed upon members of the male sex in the same circumstances,  Laskin argued that if the reasoning in ''Drybones'' was actually applied to the appeals the Court would have no choice but to find a denial of the respondents' equality before the law.&lt;ref name=lavell-1383/&gt;

Furthermore, Laskin rejected the notion that a distinction on the basis of sex does not violate the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' where that distinction is applicable only among Indians. On the contrary, he wrote, it is a notion "that compounds racial inequality even beyond the point that the ''Drybones'' case found unacceptable".&lt;ref name=lavell-1383/&gt; Justice Laskin noted that "there is no absolute disqualification of an Indian woman from registrability on the Indian Register&amp;nbsp;... by marrying outside a Band unless the marriage is to a non-Indian".&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskin also rejected the argument that "discrimination embodied in the ''Indian Act'' under s. 12(1)(b)" must be subject to a "reasonable classification test" (as adopted by the United States Supreme Court when dealing with similar violations under the Fifth Amendment) and that it is justified, as a reasonable classification, because the "paramount purpose of the [Indian] Act to preserve and protect the members of the race is promoted by the statutory preference for Indian men".&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1386.&lt;/ref&gt; Laskin declareed that U.S. case law on the subject is "at best a marginal relevance" because of the limitations imposed on the judiciary by the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''. Even if such a test had been applied, Laskin contended that it is dubious that discrimination on the basis of sex could be justified as a 'reasonable classification' when "it has no biological or physiological rationale".&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1386–1387.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Laskin did not accept the argument that a reasonable classification test can be incorporated into the right of equality before the law, since that would be precluded by "the telling words of s. 1, 'without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex."&lt;ref name=lavell-1387&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1387.&lt;/ref&gt; "In short," Laskin writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;

the proscribed s. 1 have a force either independent of the subsequently enumerated clauses (a) to (f) or, if they are found in any federal legislation, they offend those clauses because each must be read as if the prohibited forms of discrimination were recited therein as a part thereof.&lt;ref name=lavell-1387/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laskin argued that this view is largely manifested by and contained in ''Drybones'' and ''Curr''.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1387–1388.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Laskin asserted that the position taken by the appellants has no historical basis and even if it did, "history cannot avail against the clear words of ss. 1 and 2 of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''". Those sections, Laskin contended, makes it abundantly clear that the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' does not contain purely declaratory provisions. Rather, Laskin held the ''Bill'' does not permit a violation of its provisions regardless of whether the impugned statute was enacted prior to or after the enactment of the ''Bill of Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v Lavell'' (1974) at 1388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Laskin discarded the argument that the discrimination in question is not offensive to the ''Bill of Rights'' simply because Parliament enacted the impugned section of the law under its constitutional authority as provided by the ''British North America Act''. "The majority opinion in the ''Drybones'' case", Laskin noted, "dispels any attempt to rely on the grant of legislative power as a ground for escaping from the force of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''."&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1389.&lt;/ref&gt; Laskin remarked that Section 3 of the ''Bill of Rights'' indeed affirms that its constitutional jurisdiction is not at issues when the ''Bill of Rights'' commands the Minister of Justice to evaluate every government bill to ensure consistency with the ''Bill of Rights''.

====Abbott====
Writing for himself in a dissenting opinion, Abbott indicated his agreement with Justice Laskin that ''Drybones'' cannot be distinguished from the two cases under appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1373.&lt;/ref&gt; "In that case," Abbott wrote, "this Court rejected the contention that s. 1 of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' provided merely a canon of construction for the interpretation of legislation existing when the ''Bill'' was passed."&lt;ref name=lavell-1374&gt;''Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell'' (1974) at 1374.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott declared that the plurality's interpretation of 'equality before the law' with respect to Dicey's writings, is therefore inappropriate. Abbott, furthermore, asserted that without giving effect to the words "without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour religion or sex" as used in section 1, the plurality has effectively deprived them of any significance as though they are "mere rhetorical window dressing."&lt;ref name=lavell-1374/&gt;

Also, Justice Abbott took the opportunity to comment on the effect of the ''Bill of Rights'', stating famously:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In my view the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' has substantially affected the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament. Like any other statute it can of course be repealed or amended, or a particular law declared to be applicable notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill. In form the supremacy of Parliament in maintained but in practice I think that it has been substantially curtailed. In my opinion that result is undesirable, but that is a matter for consideration by Parliament not the courts.&lt;ref name=lavell-1374/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, Justice Abbott held that he would have dismissed the appeal in favour of the respondents.

==Significance of Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell as a precedent==

===Lavell's influence over the wording of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms===
The plurality's decision in this case was very controversial and would prove influential in the drafting of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the successor of the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]]. Indeed, the Supreme Court's narrow and  restrained interpretations of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'' in cases like ''Lavell'' certainly reinforced the push for an entrenched bill of rights, like the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''.

[[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the October 1980 draft version of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' guaranteed that

&lt;blockquote&gt;

15. (1) Everyone has the right to equality before the law and to the equal protection of the law without discrimination because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex.

(2) This Section does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged persons or groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2004 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), at 1083, footnote 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In light of the plurality's decision of ''Lavell'', in which Justice Ritchie held that "equality before the law" required only the equal administration of the law and did not concern the actual substance of the law, nor did it require equal laws per se; Section 15(1) was latter revised to include the concept of 'equality under the law,' indicating that the ''Charter's'' equality guarantees are sufficiently broad to include a requirement of substantive equality.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2004 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), at 1087. Peter Hogg states that "The words 'and under' were intended to abrogate a suggestion by Ritchie J. in the ''Lavell'' case, that judicial review on equality grounds did not extend to the substance of the law but only to the way in which it was administered."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act===
The impact of Section 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'', upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Lavell'', continued to have devastating consequences for women. Indian women who would later marry a non-Indian would lose their status as well as the children of the marriage. Furthermore, disenfranchised Indian women were prohibited from

*residing on their reserve
*inheriting family property
*receiving treaty benefits
*participating in band councils and other affairs of the Indian community
*being buried in cemeteries with their ancestors&lt;ref name=star&gt;"Jeannette Vivian Corbiere Lavell", ''Toronto Star Syndicate'' in the Library and Archives Canada website: {{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/women/002026-302-e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720030000/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/women/002026-302-e.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was in stark contrast to Indian men who could marry whomever they desired; a non-Indian woman that married an Indian man would gain Indian status.

According to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, about 4,605 Indian women lost their Indian status by marrying white men between 1958 and 1968.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Section 12(1)(b) of the ''Indian Act'' was finally repealed in 1985 by the Parliament of Canada, after the United Nations International Human Rights Commission ruled that the removal of Indian status on account of sex was contrary to international law.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

The '''Carbon Mineral Challenge''' is a citizen science project dedicated to accelerating the discovery of carbon-bearing [[mineral]]s. The program launched in 2015 with sponsorship from the [[Deep Carbon Observatory]]. The project will end after 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The carbon mineral challenge: A worldwide hunt for new carbon minerals|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-12-carbon-mineral-worldwide-minerals.html|website=Phys.org|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mineralogist  [[Robert Hazen]] and his colleagues pioneered the concept of mineral evolution to explain how life and geology have intertwined throughout Earth’s multi-billion year past. As part of that research, the group developed a model that combines the locations and distributions of known minerals to predict the number of unknown carbon minerals on Earth. The method is similar to statistical methods used in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Worldwide Hunt Begins for Missing Carbon Minerals|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worldwide-hunt-begins-for-missing-carbon-minerals/|accessdate=21 September 2016|publisher=Scientific American|date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazen and his group predicted that 145 carbon minerals remain undiscovered on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepcarbon.net/feature/announcing-carbon-mineral-challenge-worldwide-hunt-new-carbon-minerals#.V9w5yGMomXi Deep Carbon Observatory: Announcing the Carbon Mineral Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper supporting the research, "[http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/AM_Preprints/5546HazenPreprintApr.pdf Carbon Mineral Ecology]," was published by [http://www.minsocam.org American Mineralogist] in 2015, and the Carbon Mineral Challenge was announced in 2015 at the [[American Geophysical Union]] Fall Meeting meeting in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2015/press-item/the-carbon-mineral-challenge-a-worldwide-hunt-for-new-carbon-minerals-workshop-video/ AGU Fall Meeting: The Carbon Mineral Challenge: A worldwide hunt for new carbon minerals (Workshop)]&lt;/ref&gt; Geochemist Daniel Hummer ([[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]]) is the project lead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepcarbon.net/feature/carbon-mineral-challenge-2016-tucson-gem-and-mineral-show#.V9w9DmMomXg deepcarbon.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the focus of the project due to the element's importance to life on Earth and how little is known about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ivy Shih|title=Discovery of carbon on Mercury reveals the planet’s dark past|url=http://theconversation.com/discovery-of-carbon-on-mercury-reveals-the-planets-dark-past-55940|website=The Conversation|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carbon in Earth|editor1-last=Hazen|editor1-first=Robert M.|editor2-last=Jones|editor2-first=Adrian P.|editor3-last=Baross|editor3-first=John A.|publisher=Reviews in Mineralogy &amp; Geochemistry|isbn=978-0-939950-90-4|url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/rim/RiMG075/RiMG075_Ch01.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2016|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Method==
The research behind the Carbon Mineral Challenge is based on a type of analysis called Large Number of Rare Events (LNRE) modeling. To arrive at their total of 145 previously undescribed carbon minerals, Hazen and his colleagues, including mathematician Grethe Hystad of [[Purdue University Northwest|Purdue University-Calumet]], focused on diversity-distribution relationships of the 403 known carbon-bearing minerals. Using 82,922 mineral species and locality data tabulated in [[mindat.org]] (as of 1 January 2015), the researchers found that all carbon-bearing minerals, as well as subsets containing carbon with hydrogen, calcium, sodium, or oxygen, conform to LNRE distributions. This method of analysis is often used in microbiology to estimate new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carbon mineral ecology: Predicting the undiscovered minerals of carbon|journal=American Mineralogist|date=2016|volume=101 |pages=889-906|doi=10.2138/am-2016-5546|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/xtal/group/pdf/AM101_889.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hazen likens this method of modeling to reading a book. “Some words you read over and over throughout, such as ‘and’ and ‘the.’ These common words are everywhere and easy to spot," says Hazen. "On the other hand, there are words that may appear only one or two times in an entire book. Earth’s missing minerals are like these rare words; we haven’t found them yet because they formed only in very few places and in very small quantities.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepcarbon.net/feature/announcing-carbon-mineral-challenge-worldwide-hunt-new-carbon-minerals#.V9w5yGMomXi Deep Carbon Observatory: Announcing the Carbon Mineral Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers note that 145 is a minimum estimate of undiscovered carbon-bearing minerals or two reasons. First, the calculation is based on the assumption that minerals will continue to be discovered using exactly the same procedures. However, new techniques and emerging technology are expected to boost the rate of discovery. Second, the data from mindat.org underreports the numbers of rarest minerals found at exactly one or two localities; a bias that results in lower estimates of undiscovered minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carbon mineral ecology: Predicting the undiscovered minerals of carbon|journal=American Mineralogist|date=2016|volume=101 |pages=889-906|doi=10.2138/am-2016-5546|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/xtal/group/pdf/AM101_889.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hazen and his colleagues continue to explore big-data mineralogy in a project called "The Co-Evolution of the Geo- and Biospheres:
An Integrated Program for Data-Driven, Abductive Discovery in the Earth Sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Co-Evolution of the Geo- and Biospheres: An Integrated Program for Data-Driven, Abductive Discovery in the Earth Sciences|url=http://dtdi.carnegiescience.edu/about|website=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the Project Works==
To register a new carbon mineral with the project, mineralogists are asked to adhere to the protocol outlined by the [[International Mineralogical Association|International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification]]. Once a carbon mineral is approved by that body, the team responsible for the mineral's discovery submits their finding via a form on the project's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mineralchallenge.net/guidelinesrules/ Carbon Mineral Challenge: How It Works]&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015 there were 405 known and catalogued carbon minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/we-are-missing-145-carbon-bearing-mineral-you-can-help-find-them-180957575/ Smithsonian Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project focuses both on new discoveries in the field and analyses of samples in already in storage in museums and other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worldwide-hunt-begins-for-missing-carbon-minerals/ Scientific American]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten new carbon minerals have been described since the project's launch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matchar|first1=Emily|title=Big Data (and You) Could Help Find 1,500 Undiscovered Minerals|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/using-big-data-find-new-minerals-180964264/#sG716hvmKXMGIAGQ.99|website=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While two minerals, [[abellaite]] and [[parasite-(la)]], have chemistry that was predicted by the research team, there have been some unexpected finds, including the mineral [[leószilárdite]], a uranyl carbonate, and [[tinnunculite]] which is an [[organic mineral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mineralchallenge.net The Carbon Mineral Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170208131820.htm |website=Science Daily |title=Three new uranium minerals from Utah |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Changzhou comb''' ({{zh|常州梳篦}}) is a type of hand-painted [[comb]] produced in [[Changzhou]], [[Jiangsu]], [[China]].  The combs were originally made for use by royalty and have been in production for over 2000 years.

==History==
[[File:包金、镶珠半月形木梳，常州.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Halfmoon Wooden Comb. Southern Song Dynasty.]]Production of hand-painted combs in Changzhou dates from the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770-221 [[BCE]]) ({{zh|东周}}, also called The Transitional Period, {{zh|春秋战国}}), the first master was Chen Qizi ({{zh|陈七子}}). The hand-painted combs of Changzhou have been popular since the time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], local officials would send the finest combs to the palace. An ivory comb made in Changzhou is still displayed in the [[Forbidden City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=28 September 2011|work=The intangible cultural heritage internet China|url=http://culture.cz001.com.cn/front/2009/0401/168842.shtml|script-title=zh:梳篦世家延陵地|date=1 April 2009|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing processes==
Production of Changzhou combs requires special skills and use of dedicated materials. The materials for combs can be bamboo, wood or animal bones. The bamboo is mainly from the south from [[Jiangsu]] and the west of [[Zhejiang]]. The wood mainly stems from valuable types, such as mahogany wood, jujube wood, heather and boxwood. The production process of a wooden comb ({{zh|梳}}) contains 28 steps and a Bi ({{zh|篦}}, a different type of comb, which has more teeth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:鬓师眉匠画中篦|accessdate=29 September 2011|work=CNKI.co.cn|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-BYXD201008082.htm|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires 72 processes. The production of combs is very specific about the carving, painting, heating, engraving, grinding and other processes that are used, and which require traditional crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|accessdate=26 September 2011|work=[[CNTV]]|title=常州梳篦的制作工艺 (Production process of the Changzhou comb)|url=http://sannong.cntv.cn/program/nongguangtd/20110916/113287.shtml|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Changzhou comb is made with natural materials, they are often used for decorative purposes, while the use is also said to be good for the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2005/10/20/11221679|url=http://county.aweb.com.cn/2005/10/20/11221679.htm|work=aweb.com.cn|date=20 October 2005|accessdate=28 September 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Changzhou combs have also won many awards. They were first exhibited outside China at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] in 1915, where a Silver Award was received. In the following decades, several prizes were won inside and outside China. Changzhou combs were also presented as  gifts of [[Shanghai World Expo]] to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=22 April 2010|script-title=zh:常州梳篦 世博奇芭|work=[[Shanghai World Expo]]|url=http://www.expo2010.cn/expo/chinese/sbdt/news/sbsd/userobject1ai4518.html|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907082857/http://www.expo2010.cn/expo/chinese/sbdt/news/sbsd/userobject1ai4518.html|archivedate=7 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But as recently as 2017, organizations such as InSight Crime’s show figures of 42 per 100,000 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2017-homicide-round-up/|title=InSight Crime's 2017 Homicide Round-Up|date=2018-01-19|work=InSight Crime|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; a 26% drop from 2016 figures. 
 
Violence in Honduras increased after [[Plan Colombia]] was implemented and after [[President of Mexico|Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]] declared the war against drug trafficking in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-is-honduras-so-violent|title=Why is Honduras so violent|last=|first=|date=October 2015|website=Insight Crime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with neighboring [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]], Honduras forms part of the [[Northern Triangle of Central America]], which has been characterized as one of the most violent regions in the world.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/prisma/docview/1758892592/D02126EE331D42DFPQ/3?accountid=12768|title="Buscando una vida vivible": la migración forzada de niños de Centroamérica como práctica de fuga de la "muerte en vida"|last=Varela|first=Amarela|date=November 2015|website=El Cotidiano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of crime and increasing murder rates, the flow of migrants from Honduras to the U.S. also went up. The rise in violence in the region has received international attention.

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
In 2012 Honduras had the highest murder rate in its history.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNAH - IUDPAS|first=|date=January 2013|title=Mortalidad y otros|url=http://www.iudpas.org/pdf/Boletines/Nacional/NEd28EneDic2012.pdf|journal=Observatorio de la violencia|volume=28|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had the highest murder rate in a non-war country.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In 2012, 7172 homicides were recorded.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On average, there were 20 homicides a day. There was a 6.2% increase in homicides compared to the previous year.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 83.4% of these homicides were committed with firearms.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The main perpetrators of these crimes are young men between 15 and 34 years and who are typically members of gangs like the [[MS-13|Mara Salvatrucha]] or [[18th Street gang|Barrio 18]]. The main victims of these crimes have been young people as well. This targeted violence is the reason behind the rise in youth migration in the past years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 2011 and 2015 the murder rate in Honduras decreased by 30% (rate claimed by government, not independently confirmed). Homicides went down from 88.5 per 100,000 residents to 60.0 per 100,000. Homicide rate decrease stopped in 2016 when the murder rate did not present any significant differences from 2015. In the first semester of 2016 a rate of 14 deaths per day equalled the murder rate in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNAH - IUDPAS|first=|date=September 2016|title=Mortalidad y otros|url=http://www.iudpas.org/pdf/Boletines/Nacional/NEd42EneJun2016.pdf|journal=Observatorio de la violencia|volume=42|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder rate decrease has been attributed to different reasons such as negotiations and agreements between criminal groups and government action,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/what-behind-honduras-30-percent-drop-murder-rates|title=What's Behind Honduras’ 30% Drop in Murder Rates?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic aid given by [[United States Agency for International Development]]  to fund crime prevention programs&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/how-the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth-got-a-little-bit-safer.html|title=How the Most Dangerous Place on Earth Got Safer|last=Nazario|first=Sonia|date=2016-08-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the Mano Dura Laws. It is not clear which of these has caused the decrease in homicides.

Due to the high levels of impunity in the country, the  majority of murders in Honduras are never punished. In recent years only 4% of homicides have ended in a conviction.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The lack of justice has produced a lack of trust in the police and other authority figures, which is not good for creating civic participation. The fear and insecurity, created by violence, that exists among the Honduran population has also been an obstacle for organizations focused on crime prevention because there is barely any active or social participation to support these organizations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Illegal drug trade ===
Honduras is considered a major drug route to the US.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Smuggling is said to have increased after the US suspended anti-drug support following the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]]. Weak domestic law enforcement institutions make Honduras a popular point of entry for drug routes through Central America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/latin-america-caribbean/guatemala/052-corridor-of-violence-the-guatemala-honduras-border.aspx Corridor of Violence: The Guatemala-Honduras Border] International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 the head of Honduras' anti-drug smuggling operations,  Gen Julian Aristides Gonzalez, was assassinated in [[Tegucigalpa]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''BBC'', 8 December 2009, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8402521.stm Honduras anti-drug chief shot dead by gunmen]&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[David Meza (journalist)|David Meza]] was assassinated in March 2010; he investigated [[drug trafficking]] within Honduras and, according to the ''[[El Tiempo (Honduras)|El Tiempo]]'' newspaper, received death threats in 2010.&lt;ref name=ipi&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Second Honduran journalist killed in two weeks |url=http://www.freemedia.at/singleview/4826/|work=[[International Press Institute]]|publisher= |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reporter, [[Nahúm Elí Palacios Arteaga]], was also assassinated in March 2010.

====Historical====
In 1978 [[Policarpo Paz García]] overthrew [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro]] in a "cocaine coup" financed by the [[Medellín Cartel]]-linked drug lord [[Juan Matta-Ballesteros]].&lt;ref name=white281/&gt; The CIA took "a close and friendly interest" in the coup as Paz, unlike Melgar, was a keen supporter of Nicaragua's [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]].&lt;ref name=white281/&gt; Under Paz, the Honduran army and intelligence service received a cut of Matta-Ballesteros' profits in return for protection, as Honduras became a major shipment route for cocaine and marijuana from Colombia.&lt;ref name=white281/&gt; When the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] set up its first office in Tegucigalpa in 1981, its resident agent "rapidly came to the accurate conclusion that the entire Honduran government was deeply involved in the drug trade."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] (1998), ''Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press''. {{ISBN|1-85984-258-5}}. p283&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of Honduran military intelligence, Leonides Torres Arias, formed a link between Matta-Ballesteros and the CIA, and in 1983 Matta-Ballesteros' airline SETCO (''Services Ejectutivos Turistas Commander'') received its first contract to ship arms from the United States to the [[Nicaraguan Contras]], even as it was known that SETCO was smuggling cocaine into the US.&lt;ref name=white281&gt;[[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s5qIj_h_PtkC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press]''. {{ISBN|1-85984-258-5}}. p281&lt;/ref&gt; This would later develop into the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].

In 1988 Matta-Ballesteros was taken from his home in [[Tegucigalpa]] by [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshals]], sent to the [[United States]] for trial, and convicted of the kidnap and assassination of [[Enrique Camarena Salazar|Enrique Camarena]], as well as other charges. According to the [[Kerry Committee report|"Selections from the Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F. Kerry"]],  “the Honduran airline SETCO "was the principal company used by the [[Contras]] in Honduras to transport supplies and personnel for the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]] carrying at least a million rounds of ammunition, food, uniforms and other military supplies for the Contras from 1983 through 1985.  SETCO received funds for Contra supply operations from the Contra accounts established by [[Oliver North]].”

== Gangs ==
Gang presence, in Honduras is common where territory is controlled by members of rival gangs, the most powerful being the [[MS-13|Mara Salvatrucha]] and the [[18th Street gang|Barrio 18]].&lt;ref name="insightcrime.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/snapshot-of-honduras-most-powerful-street-gangs|title=A Snapshot of Honduras' Most Powerful Street Gangs|website=www.insightcrime.org|accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These gangs use violence and threats to enforce their power. Members of the community who do not pay their "war taxes" to the gangs for protection are threatened and often killed simply for their disobedience.  It is partly due to the gang culture in Honduras that many people have risked [[illegal immigration to the United States]].

== Assets of Banco Continental frozen ==
[[Jaime Rosenthal]]'s family owned [[Banco Continental (Honduras)|Banco Continental]], then the eighth largest bank in Honduras, which on October 7, 2015, had its assets frozen by the United States under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] on charges that they laundered money for drug traffickers.  Rosenthal has rebutted these charges, claiming, "we are sure that we will prevail in the trial because the accusations are false."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = He's a Banker, Crocodile Farmer and Wanted in the U.S.|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-12/he-s-a-banker-crocodile-farmer-and-wanted-in-the-united-states|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12|first = Blake Schmidt BlakeSchmidt Michael D.|last = McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rosenthals have an extensive fortune worth $690 million which they have amassed through their management of [[Grupo Continental (Honduras)|Grupo Continental]], a massive conglomerate of businesses which includes the Banco Continental, a meat packing plant, and an alligator skin export company, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Elites Do Business with Criminals in Honduras|url = http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-elites-do-business-with-criminals-in-honduras|website = www.insightcrime.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the Rosenthal family has been accused by the United States for dealing with [[Cachiros]], one of the largest drug transport clans in [[Central America]].  The Cachiros group was run by the Rivera Maradiaga family who went on the run after being specifically targeted by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Treasury Targets "Los Cachiros" Drug Trafficking Organization in Honduras|url = https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2168.aspx|website = www.treasury.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2015, turned their top members in to US authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alleged Head of Honduras Drug Cartel in US Custody|url = http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/alleged-head-of-honduras-drug-cartel-in-us-custody|website = www.insightcrime.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jaime Rosenthal, at 79 years old is currently under house arrest in [[San Pedro Sula]], Honduras awaiting trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Honduras court orders house arrest for US-targeted tycoon Jaime Rosenthal -|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/11/26/honduras-court-orders-house-arrest-for-us-targeted-tycoon-jaime-rosenthal|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
Although Honduras is among the most violent countries in the world, crime and murders are not spread around all the country. In 2015, Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and [[La Ceiba]] suffered more than 40% of the homicides in the country. The main reason for the concentrated violence is that these are the cities where the majority of Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 members live. Violence rises from fights between the gangs to see who gains control over these regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Outside of these three main cities rate of homicides is much lower. Usually what happens in these regions is that a single armed group achieves a certain level of control over the population, so gangs do not fight against each other. The Residents of these areas have reported to feel safer in these neighborhoods rather than in homicide hot spots, regardless of crimes like assaults, extortions or robbery still taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carranza|first=Marlon|date=June 2015|title=Crime, Violence, and Community-Based Prevention in Honduras|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/930411467996981525/pdf/97642-REPLACEMENT-FILE-Honduras-Research-Report-Online.pdf|journal=The World Bank|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of crime on migration==
The rise of violence has had a considerable impact on Honduran migration. In the past, the reason behind Central Americans traveling to the U.S. was merely economic. Young men traveled in search of the [[American Dream]] and sent revenues to their families back in Honduras. Today the main causes of migration are violence and crime. Another aspect of Central American migration that has changed is that migrants are no longer primarily men, but also women, teenagers and even children. Whole families travel from Honduras to the U.S. in search for a more peaceful life. By 2015 174,000 people, 4% of the country's households, had left Honduras.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

For several years, Honduras sent more unaccompanied minors to the United States than any other Central American country. But since the murder rate began decreasing in 2011, the number of children traveling alone has also been reduced by half.  Therefore, Honduras is now third  on the list of countries from whence unaccompanied Central American minors  fled, totaling around 18,000 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Sixty percent of unaccompanied minors report  that they are fleeing violence,  including physical violence, threats or extortion &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Crime prevention==
The [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] have joined efforts to reduce the crime rate in Honduras. The U.S. has sent $200 million dollars&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/should-the-u-s-still-be-sending-military-aid-to-honduras|title=SHOULD THE U.S. STILL BE SENDING MILITARY AID TO HONDURAS?|last=Blitzer|first=|date=August 2017|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid sent to Honduras since 2009. These organizations started sending economic aid when the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|Honduran coup d'état]] took place. In 2015 around $18 million dollars went to the Honduran police and military.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, even though the aid has been constant since 2009, in the summer of 2016 there was a bill introduced in Congress to cut the funding given to Honduras. The reason behind the suspension of the aid is the corruption and human rights violations that the money causes when given to the military or the police.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Other ways in which the aid has been distributed is through programs that identify children who present risk factors of joining gangs (such as a violent family environment, drug or alcohol abuse or being a victim of crime) and giving them counseling. This program, run by Creative Associates International, has proven to be successful;  77% of the children that attend this program do not get involved in crime or substance abuse after going through it. Another tactic has been creating centers that promote vocational training, these institutions provide mentors to Hondurans, teaches them skills to become barbers, electricians or bakers and then helps them to find jobs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Another contribution from the US government is funding the nonprofit [[Association for a More Just Society]] which focuses on creating the conditions for crimes to be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

In Honduras, only 6% of collected taxes are spent in programs that reduce or prevent violence.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; $125 is the amount of money invested by each economically active member of the population (EAP) in terms of the national security budget. In contrast with Nicaragua where each EAP contributes with $497.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americasquarterly.org/content/behind-numbers-insecurity-and-marginalization-central-america|title=Behind the Numbers: Insecurity and Marginalization in Central America {{!}} Americas Quarterly|website=americasquarterly.org|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mano Dura Laws ===
In 2003, the Honduran government introduced the Mano Dura (literally tough hand) laws, which were zero-tolerance in nature and aimed to reduce social violence and restore public security. These laws allowed gang members to be incarcerated simply for their association with the gang.

[[Honduran police]] officers can arrest and subsequently place in prison anyone at all related to gangs through indicators such as [[tattoo]]s, baggy clothing, or even typical gang positions on street corners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Discipline and Punish? Youth Gangs’ Response to ‘Zero-tolerance’ Policies in Honduras|last = Gutierrez Rivera|first = Lirio|date = 2010|journal = Journal of the Society for Latin American Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid being detected by police officers, members of gangs have been forced to change their territorial strategies.  Since tattoos are such an easy way to identify a gang member, gangs have been forced to wear clothes covering their tattoos and to adopt a more casual appearance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Tattoos are significant to gangs because they mark each member as property, just as [[graffiti]] marks a group's territory in the context of cities.  Each tattoo tells a gang member's story and each has its own meaning, but the appearance given off serves to indicate dominance, which explains partly why these men can be so influential.

Although these laws were introduced with the intention of reducing gang violence, there is little evidence to suggest that they have been effective.  Aside from an initial reduction in crime, the laws have not managed to significantly address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA457336|title = Gangs in Central America|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Ribando|first = Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the Mano Dura laws have had some [[unintended consequences]].  First, the zero-tolerance policies have forced many gang members to seek protection with members of their gang in other countries such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Transnational gang relations have grown tremendously since the implementation of these laws, as evidenced by Mara Salvatrucha's extensive reach, spanning through the United States and even reaching cities in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Violent Hispanic gang spreading in Canada|url = http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=eaf02ddd-9c7d-466a-87dc-35e43d4dd594|newspaper = Canada.com|access-date = 2015-12-12|first = Global|last = National}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mara Salvatrucha have taken to public violence to express their opposition to the laws.  On December 24, 2004, a year after the introduction of the Mano Dura, members of MS-13 shot up a bus, killing 28 people and wounding 14.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gunmen Kill 28 On Honduran Bus|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gunmen-kill-28-on-honduran-bus/|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The perpetrators left a note not only claiming opposition to the death penalty, a major campaign issue in the upcoming presidential election and a large component of Mano Dura, but also promising more violence, warning that "people should take advantage of this Christmas, because the next one will be worse."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Outbursts such as these suggest that zero-tolerance policies have promoted further extremism in a country shrouded by gang violence.

Another reason the Mano Dura policies have struggled to accomplish their goals is that the prison system in Honduras is not built to accommodate the increased volume of incarcerated individuals.  Individual prisoner confinement is absent from the Honduran penal code, and this facilitates the grouping of prisoners and overcrowding of prisons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Prison overcrowding]] has in some ways made it easier for gangs to function because in many prisons there are not enough guards to safely monitor the prisoners.  According to the CPTRT (Center for Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture and their Relatives) in 2004, there were 1,272 prison guards to attend to 10,300 inmates, which gives each guard the impossible task of tending to 8 inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To maintain a basic level of security, the guards and inmates have agreed upon a prison order which allows prisoners a surprising amount of freedom but at the very least keeps them inside the confines of the prison.  With more freedom inside the prisons, gang leaders can control the sale of food, commodities, and even the reception of visitors.  In addition, given the relative security of their position in prison, they can safely organize and plan their criminal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How 'Mano Dura' is Strengthening Gangs|url = http://www.insightcrime.org/investigations/how-mano-dura-is-strengthening-gangs|website = www.insightcrime.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another concern raised about these laws is their potential to be arbitrarily manipulated by law enforcement officials.  Since people can be arrested for simple tattoos or [[Gang signal|hand gestures]], police have to be trusted to correctly and fairly prosecute gang members.  This process has clogged the judicial system to the point that the defendants are not always afforded fair trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Responding to Central American Youth Gang Violence|last = Reisman|first = Lainie|date = Summer–Fall 2006|journal = SAIS Review of International Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7757">The '''Cuno strikes''' were nationwide strikes in Germany against the government of [[Reich Chancellery|Chancellor]] [[Wilhelm Cuno]] in August 1923. The wave of strikes demanded, eventually with success, the resignation of the Cuno government, which occurred on 12 August 1923, after only nine months. The strikes also buoyed the hopes of the [[Communist International]] of an imminent revolution.

== Background ==
In January 1923, the Cuno government called for [[nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] of the Belgian and French [[occupation of the Ruhr]] region. At the same time, [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] was racing out of control, result of the [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]]&lt;ref&gt;Adam Ferguson, ''When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany'', p.&amp;nbsp;38. {{ISBN|1-58648-994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the costs of the passive resistance, which made local authorities and companies boycott occupation forces while the government paid the wages of those administrations and compensated the coal and steel companies for their losses.&lt;ref name="wsws-1"&gt;Peter Schwarz, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct2008/1923-o30.shtml "The German October: The missed revolution of 1923. Part 1"] World Socialist Web Site (October 30, 2008). Retrieved July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The expenses caused the collapse of the [[Reichsmark]], which had already been inflated. During 1923, the mark fell from 21,000 to the US dollar at the beginning of the year to 6 trillion at the end.

For German society, the result was complete disaster, as people rushed out to buy things before their money lost its value, and people who had had savings saw them evaporate overnight.&lt;ref name="wsws-1" /&gt; Considerable portions of the labour movement were as or even more opposed to the German government than to the French occupying forces. Their motto was "Beat Cuno and [[Raymond Poincaré|Poincaré]] at the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and at the [[Spree]]!"&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/CunoWilhelm/index.html Wilhelm Cuno biographical timeline] German Historical Museum.

The Reich printing plant was also affected, causing the [[banknote]] presses to be stopped and, before long, a noticeable lack of paper money. Workers from power stations, construction and the [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]] joined the strike. The wave of strikes demanded the resignation of the Cuno government.&lt;ref name="wsws-2"&gt;Peter Schwarz, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct2008/1923-o31.shtml "The German October: The missed revolution of 1923.

Against the will of KPD party chairwoman [[Ruth Fischer]], [[Otto Wels]], the head of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) was able to forestall a [[general strike]].&lt;ref name="haw-1998" /&gt;

Pressured by the SPD, a conference of trade unions on 10 August 1923 rejected the call for a [[general strike]],&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; supported the left-wing [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]]. The KPD, not accepting the defeat held a meeting of all the revolutionary [[works council]]s in [[Greater Berlin]]. It called a general strike to bring down the Cuno government&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; but was hindered from publicizing the call widely because its ''[[Die Rote Fahne]]'' had been banned.

Nevertheless, the strikes, supported by some in the SPD, spread from Berlin to other cities and regions, such as [[Hamburg]], [[Lusatia]], [[Saxony Province]] as well as the states of [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]].&lt;ref name="haw-1998" /&gt; Factories were occupied by communist workers and factory managements sent fleeing. In the [[Ruhr Region]], there was passive resistance rather than strikes. The response to the strike surpassed even the expectations of the leadership of the KPD.&lt;ref name="woll"&gt;Erich Wollenberg, [http://www.archivtiger.de/downloads/schwarzeprotokolle/sp6.pdf "Der Hamburger Aufstand und die Thälmann-Legende" (1964)] (PDF) Papiertiger–Kollektiv.

==Resignation of government==
In total, three-and-a-half million workers went on strike&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; indirectly forcing Cuno and his [[Cuno cabinet|cabinet]] to resign on 11 August.&lt;ref name="dhs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Broué; Ian H.

Retrieved August 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Cuno resignation on 11 August 1923, the strikes soon ended.&lt;ref name="haw-1998" /&gt; Workers began returning to work. In addition to pressure from the strikes, on 10 August, the KPD faction in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] had moved to [[censure]] the Cuno government. The SPD, pushed by its base and looking to avert worse [[social unrest]] or possibly revolution, saw no other political alternative than to form a [[grand coalition]].&lt;ref name="haw-1998" /&gt; [[Rudolf Hilferding]], in contrast to leftists aligned with [[Paul Levi]], advocated such a move and urged [[Gustav Stresemann]] to take over the government, resolving the crisis within the framework of the parliamentary system and leaving the KPD unable to turn it into a revolutionary upheaval.

==Near-revolution==
Nonetheless, the Cuno strikes nurtured, in [[Moscow]], the hope of a German revolution.&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="woll" /&gt; There had been clashes with police in several cities and dozens of workers had been killed.&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Influential members of the [[Soviet Politburo]] and the [[Comintern]] believed Germany was ready for revolution, but [[Heinrich Brandler]], the head of the KPD, felt the timing was premature.&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; Despite Brandler's misgivings, on 23 August 1923, the Soviet Politburo adopted a plan for a "German [[October Revolution|October]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tim Rees, Andrew Thorpe (Eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dttCVcOvmdcC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;ots=bgpBdWTXFc&amp;dq=%22German%20October%22%20communist%20-1918&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''International communism and the Communist International, 1919-43''] Manchester University Press (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;121 {{ISBN|0-7190-5116-9}} Retrieved July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but the attempted coup was cancelled at the last minute.&lt;ref name="wsws-2" /&gt; Word of the cancellation did not reach Hamburg in time (or was possibly ignored by the local KPD leadership) and the [[Hamburg Uprising|local insurrection]] took place, as planned.

The term '''Flemish Community''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschap}} {{IPA-nl|ˈvlaːmsə ɣəˈmeːnsxɑp||Nl-Vlaamse Gemeenschap.ogg}}; {{lang-fr|Communauté flamande}} {{IPA-fr|kɔmynote flamɑ̃d|}}; {{lang-de|Flämische Gemeinschaft}} {{IPA-de|ˈflɛːmɪʃə ɡəˈmaɪ̯nʃaft|}}) has two distinct, though related, meanings:

# Culturally and sociologically, it refers to Flemish organizations, media, social and cultural life; alternative expressions for this concept might be the "[[Flemings|Flemish people]]" or the "Flemish nation" (in a similar sense as the [[Scottish national identity|Scottish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], or [[Culture of Quebec|Québécois]] people are [[nation]]s, referring to an ethnic identity). The term "community" should then not be capitalized.
# Politically, it is the name of which both elements are normally capitalized, for one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|institutional communities]] of [[Belgium]], established by the [[Belgian constitution]] and having legal responsibilities only within the precise geographical boundaries of the Dutch-language area and of the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital. Unlike in the [[French Community of Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;The parliament of the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] is distinct from the [[Walloon Parliament]]; this is more obvious for the parliament of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] because its much smaller territory is within the latter region.&lt;/ref&gt; the competences of the Flemish Community have been unified with those of the [[Flemish Region]] and are exercised by one directly elected [[Flemish Parliament]] based in [[Brussels]].

== History ==
[[State reform in Belgium|State reforms in Belgium]] turned the country from a unitary state into a federal one. Cultural communities were the first type of decentralisation in 1970, forming the Dutch, French and German Cultural Community. Later on, in 1980, these became responsible for more cultural matters and were renamed to simply "Community", the Dutch (Cultural) Community also being renamed to the Flemish Community. In the same state reform of 1980, the Flemish and Walloon Region were set up (the Brussels-Capital Region would be formed later on). In Flanders it was decided that the institutions of the Flemish Community would take up the tasks of the Flemish Region, so there is only one [[Flemish Parliament]] and one [[Flemish Government]].

== Legal authority ==
{{Main article|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}
Under the Belgian constitution, the Flemish Community has legal responsibility for the following:
* education (except for degree requirements, the minimum and maximum age of compulsory education, and teachers' pensions);
* culture;
* language legislation in monolingual Dutch-speaking municipalities;
* certain aspects of welfare, health care and child allowances;
* international cooperation in all areas of the competency of the Community.

As the Flemish Community's institutions ([[Flemish Parliament|parliament]], [[Flemish Government|government and ministry]]) absorbed all competencies of the Flemish region, they became also competent for all regional policy areas, including:
* agriculture (although the bulk of this policy is determined by the [[European Union]]);
* public works and regional economic development;
* local authorities;
* environment;
* mobility;
* energy (although nuclear energy remains on the federal level).

Members of the Flemish Parliament elected in the Brussels-Capital Region have no right to vote on Flemish regional affairs, only on community affairs, since affairs concerning their region are governed by the [[Brussels Parliament]]. Legally speaking, in the region of Brussel-Capital, the Flemish Community is responsible not for individual people but for Flemish institutions such as schools, theatres, libraries and museums. The reason is that no distinct sub-national status exists in Belgium. Yet, individuals living in Brussels can opt by their own choice for certain policies of the Flemish Community.

== Language ==
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of the Flemish Community. Minorities speak [[French language|French]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. Though most of these groups are recent immigrants, since the Middle Ages, [[Jews in Belgium|Jew]]s have formed the oldest minority to retain its own identity.

Compared with most areas in the Netherlands, the historical dialects of Flemish people still tend to be strong and particular to locality. Since the [[Second World War]] however, the influences of radio and television, and of a generally prolonged education, as well as the higher mobility for short trips or for moving towards farther localities, have resulted in a deterioration of the traditional 'pure' dialects, in particular amongst younger people. Some of the differences between the dialects are eroding, and mainly in localities or suburbs with a considerable influx from other areas, new intermediate dialects have appeared, with various degrees of influence by standard Dutch. In Dutch, these are often called ''tussentaal'' ("in-between language", often used for near-standard Dutch interspersed with typical dialect aspects) or, rather derogatorily, ''verkavelingsvlaams'' (a mix of more or less "cleaned-up" dialects as heard in a newly built-up suburban area with people influenced by different dialects). More recently, a number of local initiatives have been set up to save the traditional dialects and their diversity.

In Brussels, the local dialect is heavily influenced by French, both in pronunciation and in vocabulary. Nowadays, most Flemings in Brussels do not speak the local dialect. This is due in part to the relatively large numbers of young Flemings coming to Brussels, after a long period of many more others moving out while French-speakers moved in (see [[Frenchification of Brussels]]).

In certain municipalities along the border with the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] and the Brussels-Capital regions, French-speakers enjoy "[[municipalities with language facilities|language facilities]]". These cover rights such as to receive official documentation in their own tongue. Similar facilities are enjoyed by Dutch-speakers in some Walloon municipalities bordering the Flemish Region, by German-speakers in two municipalities in the French language area of the Walloon Region, and by French-speakers in the territory of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking community]].
The geographical limitations of the communities require the French Community to ensure Dutch basic education in its municipalities with facilities for speakers of Dutch, and the Flemish Community to finance French schools in its municipalities with facilities.

== Flemish institutions in Brussels ==
Where responsibilities of the Flemish Region can be devolved to the provincial level, no such equivalent exists in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]], which itself exercises many competencies for ''territorial tasks'' elsewhere assigned to the provinces. The community competencies (education, culture and social welfare) there, are exercised by the two affected institutional communities. The Flemish Community therefore established a local elected council and executive (the [[Flemish Community Commission]] or 'VGC') to cater for ''intermediate-level decision making &amp; public services''. The VGC then recognised local, municipal institutions to take care of the purely local public service in these community areas (called ''gemeenschapscentra'' or community centres).

== Media ==
Flanders has an official radio and television broadcasting company, the ''Vlaamse Radio en Televisieomroep'' or [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] in Dutch. Since 1989, several private companies for region-wide radio and television broadcasting have become established. There are also so-called "regional" broadcast companies of which the range is limited to only smaller parts of the Flemish Region. The written press is dominated by a number of 'quality' dailies (such as ''[[De Tijd]]'', ''[[De Morgen]]'' and ''[[De Standaard]]''), several 'popular' dailies (such as ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'' and ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'') and a large number of general and specialized magazines.

[[File:Fleur de lys (or).svg|thumb|130px|A fleur-de-lis]]

The '''''fleur-de-lis''''' or '''''fleur-de-lys'''''  (plural: ''fleurs-de-lis'', or ''fleurs-de-lys''){{refn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ɜr|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|l|iː|(|s|)}}; {{IPA-fr|flœʁ də lis|lang}}. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives both pronunciations for English. In French, Larousse&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire de la Langue Française'', Lexis, Paris, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Robert'' 1, Paris, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; have the former: {{IPA-fr|lis|}}. The CNRTL&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/lis&lt;/ref&gt; has that pronunciation for the plant itself, but, following Barbeau-Rodhe 1930, {{IPA-fr|li|}} for the compound ''fleur-de-lis''.|group="pron"}}, is a stylized [[Lilium|lily]] (in French, ''fleur'' means "flower", and ''lis'' means "lily") that is used as a decorative design or [[Motif (textile arts)|motif]], and many of the Catholic saints of France, particularly [[St. Joseph]], are depicted with a lily.  Since France is a historically [[Catholic]] nation, the fleur-de-lis became "at one and the same time, religious, political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic, and symbolic", especially in [[French heraldry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Pastoureau|title=Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning| publisher=Thames and Hudson|date=1997|ISBN=0-500-30074-7|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleur-de-lis is represented in [[Unicode]] at U+269C (⚜) in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block.

While the fleur-de-lis has appeared on countless European [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the [[French monarchy]] in a historical context, and continues to appear in the arms of the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] (from the French [[House of Bourbon]]) and the [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] and members of the House of Bourbon. It remains an enduring symbol of France which appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French republics]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;. According to French historian [[Georges Duby]], the three petals represent the [[Estates of the realm|three medieval social estates]]: the commoners, the nobility, and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Duby, ''France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc''&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains unclear where the fleur-de-lis originated, though it has retained an association with French nobility. It is widely used in French city emblems as in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the French Crown were awarded{{by whom|date=March 2018}} a heraldic augmentation of two or three fleurs-de-lis on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orléans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres and Laon among others. The fleur-de-lis was the symbol of [[Île-de-France]], the core of the French kingdom. It has appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France including Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orléanais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphiné, Saintonge and the County of La Marche. Many of the current French ''[[Departments of France|departments]]'' use the symbol on their coats-of-arms to express this heritage.

{{anchor|Florentine lily|Florentine fleurs-de-lis}}
In [[Italy]], the fleur de lis, called ''giglio'', is mainly known from the crest of the city of [[Florence]]. In the Florentine fleurs-de-lis,{{Ref label|f|f|f}} the [[stamen]]s are always posed between the [[petal]]s. Originally ''[[argent]]'' (silver or white) on ''[[gules]]'' (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (''parte [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|ghibellina]]''), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch ''[[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]]'' stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final ''gules'' lily on ''argent'' background.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Artusi, Firenze araldica, pp. 280, Polistampa, Firenze, 2006, {{ISBN|88-596-0149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This heraldic charge is often known as the '''Florentine lily''' to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of [[Zenobius of Florence|Zenobius]], its first bishop,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James (1974). ''Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art''. Harper &amp; Row. {{ISBN|0-06-433316-7}}. p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with Florence's patron Saint [[John the Baptist]] in the Florentine [[Florin (Italian coin)|fiorino]]. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The heraldic fleur-de-lis is still widespread: among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word 'lily', for example, [[Liljendal]], Finland, and [[Lelystad]], Netherlands. This is called [[canting arms]] in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the fleur-de-lis include [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] in England, [[Morcín]] in Spain, [[Wiesbaden]] in Germany, [[Skierniewice]] in Poland and [[Jurbarkas]] in Lithuania. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] municipality of [[Schlieren, Zurich|Schlieren]] and the [[Estonia]]n municipality of [[Jõelähtme Parish|Jõelähtme]] also have a fleur-de-lis on their coats.

In Malta, the town of [[Santa Venera]] has three red fleurs-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms. These are derived from [[Wignacourt Arch|an arch]] which was part of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] that had three sculpted fleurs-de-lis on top, as they were the heraldic symbols of [[Alof de Wignacourt]], the Grand Master who financed its building. Another suburb which developed around the area became known as [[Fleur-de-Lys, Malta|Fleur-de-Lys]], and it also features a red fleur-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fleurdelys.org.mt/?page_id=851|title=Fleur-de-Lys|website=Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee|date=18 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075504/http://fleurdelys.org.mt/?page_id=851|archivedate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wales|Welsh]] poet [[Hedd Wyn]] used ''Fleur de Lys'' as his pen name when he won his chair at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru), the national poetry contest.

Fleurs-de-lis appear on military insignia and the logos of many organizations. During the 20th century the symbol was adopted by various [[Scouting]] organizations worldwide for their [[badge]]s. Architects and designers use it alone and as a repeated [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in a wide range of contexts, from [[ironwork]] to bookbinding, especially where a French context is implied.

The symbol is also often used on a [[compass rose]] to mark the north direction, a tradition started by [[Pedro Reinel]].
The dark code was an arrangement of controls received in Louisiana in 1724 from other French settlements around the globe, intended to represent the state's slave populace. Those guidelines included marking slaves with the fleur-de-lis as discipline for fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uark.edu/ua/nc/ClarinetCollections/Heinrich%20Gehring/Fleur-de-Lis/Fleur-de-Lis.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022919/http://www.uark.edu/ua/nc/ClarinetCollections/Heinrich%20Gehring/Fleur-de-Lis/Fleur-de-Lis.htm |archive-date=13 May 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Clovis recevant la fleur de lys - XVe siècle.jpg|thumb|upright|15th-century manuscript illumination of an [[angel]] sending the fleurs-de-lis to [[Clovis I|Clovis]]. From the [[Bedford Hours]] in the [[British Library]], London.]]

The ''fleur de lis'' is widely thought to be a stylized version of the species ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'', or ''[[Iris florentina]].&lt;ref name=stefan&gt;Stefan Buczacki {{Google books|uROWBAAAQBAJ|The Herb Bible: The definitive guide to choosing and growing herbs|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jekka&gt;{{cite book |last=McVicar |first=Jekka  | date=2006 |edition=Revised |origyear=1997  | title= Jekka's Complete Herb Book  |location= | publisher=Bookmark Ltd | isbn=1845093704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the lily (genus lilium, family Liliaceae) and the iris (family Iridaceae) are two different plants, phylogenetically and taxonomically unrelated. Lily (in Italian: ''giglio'') is the name usually associated with the stylized flower in the Florentine heraldic devices.
Decorative [[Ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] that resemble the fleur-de-lis have appeared in artwork from the earliest human civilizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} According to Pierre-Augustin Boissier de Sauvages, an 18th-century French [[naturalist]] and [[lexicography|lexicographer]]:&lt;ref name="Sauvages1756"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Augustin Boissier de Sauvages|title=Languedocien Dictionnaire François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8RDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1756|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The old fleurs-de-lis, especially the ones found in our first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called ''flambas'' [in [[Occitan]]], or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named [[Lys river|Leie]] in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of ''lis''. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Fleur.iris.2.png|thumb|''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' compared with fleur-de-lis [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] in French ''&lt;ref name="architecture_dictionnaire_flore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle_-_Tome_5,_Flore |title=Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle – Tome 5, Flore – Wikisource |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The heraldist François Velde is of the same opinion.&lt;ref name="François Velde"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called "fleur-de-lis." This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sauvages' hypothesis seems to be supported by the archaic English spelling ''fleur-de-luce''&lt;ref&gt;[[:wiktionary:Fleur-de-lis|Fleur-de-lis]]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[:nl:Luts|Luts]]'s variant name ''Lits''.

It has consistently been used as a royal emblem, though different cultures have interpreted its meaning in varying ways. [[Roman Gallia (Gaul)|Gaulish]] coins show the first Western designs which look similar to modern fleurs-de-lis.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau p.99"&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Heraldry: its origins and meaning'' p.99&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern world|East]] it was found on the gold helmet of a [[Scythians|Scythian]] king uncovered at the Ak-Burun [[kurgan]] and conserved in [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Hermitage Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaharsis.ru/histori/Skif/R19.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328035055/http://www.anaharsis.ru/histori/Skif/R19.htm|date=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a statue of [[Kanishka the Great]], the emperor of the [[Kushan dynasty]] in 127–151 AD, in the Mathura Museum in India, with four modern Fleurs-de-lis symbols in a square emblem repeated twice on the bottom end of his smaller sword.

Another (debated) hypothesis is that the symbol derives from the Frankish Angon.
The angon, or ''sting'', was a typical Frankish throwing spear.

A possibly derived symbol of Frankish royalty was the bee, of similar shape, as found in the burial of [[Childric I]], whose royal see of power over the Salian [[Franks]] was based over the valley of the [[Lys river|Lys]].
Another heraldic tradition, going back to at least the 17th century, identifies the emblem of the Childric as a frog or toad (''crapaud'') rather than a bee. [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]] writing in 1781 identified the toad as the emblem of the [[Ripuarian Franks]], representing their origin from the marshlands.&lt;ref&gt;John Thomas, ''Elpis Israel'' (1851), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=sc5NAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 339&amp;ndash;342].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal symbol==

===Frankish to the French monarchy===
The graphic evolution of ''crita'' to fleur-de-lis was accompanied by textual [[allegory]]. By the late 13th century, an allegorical poem by [[Guillaume de Nangis]] (d. 1300), written at the [[Chambourcy|abbey of Joyenval at Chambourcy]], relates how the golden lilies on an azure ground were miraculously substituted for the [[crescent]]s on Clovis' shield, a projection into the past of contemporary images of heraldry. Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian [[Franks|Frankish]] kings, most notably [[Charlemagne]].

The fleur-de-lis' symbolic origins with French monarchs may stem from the baptismal lily used in the crowning of King [[Clovis I]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen J. Millington, ''Heraldry in History, Poetry, and Romance'', London, 1858, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=LlQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA332 332]-[https://books.google.be/books?id=LlQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA343 343].&lt;/ref&gt; The French monarchy possibly adopted the Fleur-de-lis for its royal coat of arms as a symbol of purity to commemorate the conversion of Clovis I,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Philippa &amp; Darley, Gillian (1986) Dictionary of Ornament&lt;/ref&gt; and a reminder of the Fleur-de-lis [[ampulla]] that held the oil used to [[Anointing#Hebrew Bible#|anoint the king]]. So, the fleur-de-lis stood as a symbol of the king's divinely approved right to rule. The thus "anointed" Kings of France later maintained that their authority was directly from God. A legend enhances the mystique of royalty by informing us that a vial of oil—the Holy Ampulla—descended from Heaven to anoint and sanctify Clovis as King,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph E. Giesey, ''Models of Rulership in French Royal Ceremonial in Rites of Power: Symbolism, Ritual, and Politics Since the Middle Ages'', ed. Wilentz (Princeton 1985), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; descending directly on Clovis or perhaps brought by a dove to Saint Remigius. One version explains that an angel descended with the Fleur-de-lis ampulla to anoint the king.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau: ''Traité d'Héraldique'', Paris, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Another story tells of Clovis putting a flower in his helmet just before his victory at the [[Battle of Vouillé]].&lt;ref name="François Velde"/&gt; Through this connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most famously Charlemagne.

In the 14th-century French writers asserted that the monarchy of France, which developed from the Kingdom of the West Franks, could trace its heritage back to the divine gift of royal arms received by Clovis. This story has remained popular, even though modern scholarship has established that the fleur-de-lis was a religious symbol before it was a true heraldic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]] (1997), ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{pp.|99|100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with true lilies, it was associated with the Virgin Mary, and in the 12th century [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] started to use the emblem, on [[sceptre]]s for example, so connecting their rulership with this symbol of [[saint]]liness and divine right. Louis VII ordered the use of fleur-de-lis clothing in his son [[Philip II of France|Philip's]] coronation in 1179,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', London, 1909, p. [https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoh00foxdrich#page/274/mode/2up 274].&lt;/ref&gt; while the first visual evidence of clearly heraldic use dates from 1211: a [[Seal (device)|seal]] showing the future Louis VIII and his shield strewn with the "flowers".&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau p.100"&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]] (1997), ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{p.|100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 14th century the [[National emblem of France|French royal coat of arms]] was ''[[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] semé-de-lis [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'' (a blue shield "sown" (''semé'') with a scattering of small golden fleurs-de-lis), but [[Charles V of France]] changed the design from an all-over scattering to a group of three in about 1376.{{Ref label|a|a|a}}{{Ref label|b|b|b}} These two coats are known in heraldic terminology as ''France Ancient'' and ''France Modern'' respectively.
[[File:Fleur de Lis wall.jpg|thumb|upright|Fleur-de-lis on an old concrete wall]]
In the reign of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]] (St. Louis) the three petals of the flower were said to represent faith, wisdom and chivalry, and to be a sign of divine favour bestowed on France.&lt;ref name="MichaudPoujoulat1836"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Fr.

In 1328, King [[Edward III of England]] inherited a claim to the crown of France, and in about 1340 he  [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] ''France Ancient'' with the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|arms of Plantagenet]], as "arms of [[Pretender|pretence]]".  {{Ref label|c|c|c}} After the kings of France adopted ''France Modern'', the kings of England adopted the new design as quarterings from about 1411.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs of England (and later of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) continued to quarter the French arms until 1801, when [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] abandoned his formal [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the French throne]].

[[Charles VII of France|King Charles VII]] ennobled [[Joan of Arc]]'s family on 29 December 1429 with an inheritable symbolic denomination. The Chamber of Accounts in France registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.

===''France Modern''===
''France Modern'' remained the French royal standard, and with a white background was the French national flag until the [[French Revolution]], when it was replaced by the [[Flag of France|tricolor]] of modern-day France. The fleur-de-lis was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against [[Charles X of France]] in 1830.{{Ref label|d|d|d}} In a very strange turn of events after the end of the [[Second French Empire]], where a flag apparently influenced the course of history, [[Henri, comte de Chambord]], was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with fleurs-de-lis.&lt;ref name="Goubert2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Goubert|title=The Course of French History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VbZMbFw89YC|accessdate=27 July 2013|date=12 April 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-41468-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His condition was rejected and France became a [[French Third Republic|republic]].

Fleurs-de-lis feature prominently in the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] of England and [[Honours of Scotland|Scotland]]. In English heraldry, they are used in many different ways, and can be the [[cadency]] mark of the sixth son. Additionally, it features in a large amount of royal arms of the [[House of Plantagenet]], from the 13th century onwards to the early Tudors (Elizabeth of York and the de la Pole family.)

The [[wiktionary:tressure|tressure]] [[wiktionary:flory|flory]]–[[wiktionary:counterflory|counterflory]] (flowered border) has been a prominent part of the design of the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] and [[Royal Standard of Scotland|Royal Standard]] since [[James I of Scotland]].{{Ref label|e|e|e}}

In Italy, fleurs-de-lis have been used for some [[Papal Tiara|papal crowns]]{{Ref label|g|g|g}} and coats of arms, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] [[Duchy of Parma|Dukes of Parma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Italy_states2.htm#Parma|title=Italian States to 1860 P - V|last=Cahoon|first=Ben|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and by some [[Doge of Venice|doges of Venice]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The fleur-de-lis was also the symbol of the [[House of Kotromanić]], a ruling house in [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)|medieval Bosnia]] allegedly in recognition of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], where the flower is thought of as a [[Lilium bosniacum]].{{Ref label|h|h|h}} Today, fleur-de-lis is a national symbol of [[Bosniaks]].{{Ref label|i|i|i}}

Other countries using the emblem heraldically include [[Serbia]] and [[Spain]] in recognition of rulers from the [[House of Bourbon]]. Coins minted in 14th-century Romania, from the region that was the Principality of Moldova at the time, ruled by [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I Mușat]], carry the fleur-de-lis symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Fișier:Petru Musat Coins.png|Petru Musat Coins image]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a dynastic emblem it has also been very widely used: not only by noble families but also, for example, by the [[Fugger]]s, a medieval banking family.

Three fleurs-de-lis appeared in the personal coat of arms of Grandmaster [[Alof de Wignacourt]] who ruled the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Malta]] between 1601 and 1622. His nephew [[Adrien de Wignacourt]], who was Grandmaster himself from 1690 to 1697, also had a similar coat of arms with three fleurs-de-lis.

==Elsewhere==
[[File:Fleur de lys du québec.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[French Canadian]] version of the fleur-de-lys]]

Fleurs-de-lis crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] along with Europeans going to the [[New World]], especially with French settlers. Their presence on North American flags and coats of arms usually recalls the involvement of French settlers in the history of the town or region concerned, and in some cases the persisting presence there of a population descended from such settlers.

The fleur-de-lis appears on the [[Arms of Canada|Canadian coat of arms]], the [[flag of Quebec]] as well as the flags of the cities of [[Montreal]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Trois-Rivières]]. It is also featured on the personal flag used by the [[Queen of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gg.ca/images/royal/queen.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[Francophone|French-speaking people]] in other Canadian provinces for whom the fleur-de-lis remains a symbol of their [[cultural identity]]. [[Franco-Ontarians]], for example, feature the fleur-de-lis prominently on their [[Franco-Ontarian flag|flag]].

In [[Saskatchewan]] the [[Western Red Lily]] appears on the provincial flag and is sometimes used as a symbol of the province. Some representations resemble a fleur de lis but the traditional version itself is rarely used.

In the US, the fleur-de-lis symbols tend to be along or near the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers. These are areas of strong [[French colonial empire]] settlement. Some of the places that have it in their flag or seal are the cities of [[St. Louis]],{{Ref label|m|m|m}} [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Detroit]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[New Orleans]], [[Baton Rouge]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. On 9 July 2008, Louisiana governor [[Bobby Jindal]] signed a bill into law making the fleur-de-lis an official symbol of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arklatexhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=22251] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327200346/http://arklatexhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=22251|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Hurricane Katrina]], the fleur-de-lis has been widely used in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana, as a symbol of grassroots support for [[Reconstruction of New Orleans|New Orleans' recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20091126/NEWS01/911260307/1002/Frenzy-on-for-fleur-de-lis] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has also become the symbol for the identity of the [[Cajuns]] and [[Louisiana Creole people]], and their French heritage.

The fleur-de-lis appears on the coat of [[Guadeloupe]], an overseas département of France in the Caribbean, [[Saint Barthélemy]], an overseas collectivity of France, and [[French Guiana]]. The overseas department of [[Réunion]] in the Indian Ocean uses the same feature. It appears on the coat of [[Port Louis]], the capital of [[Mauritius]] which was named in honour of King Louis XV. On the [[coat of arms of Saint Lucia]] it represents the French heritage of the country.

==Symbolism in religion and art==
[[File:Albarello fleur-de-lys Louvre UCAD4288.jpg|thumb|upright|Fleur-de-lis on 14th century [[Syria]]n
[[wiktionary:albarello|albarello]].]]

In the [[Middle Ages]], the symbols of lily and fleur-de-lis overlapped considerably in Christian religious art. [[Michel Pastoureau]], a historian, says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]'s "lily among thorns" (''lilium inter spinas''), understood as a reference to Mary. Other [[Religious text|scripture]] and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref name="heraldica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/fdl.htm |title=The Fleur-de-Lys |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=W. Ellwood|title=Saints, Signs, and Symbols|year=1986|publisher=Morehouse-Barlow|location=Wilton, Connecticut|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|medieval England]], from the mid-12th century, a noblewoman's seal often showed the lady with a fleur-de-lis, drawing on the Marian connotations of "female virtue and spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Johns, ''Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power in the Twelfth-Century Anglo-Norman Realm'' (Manchester 2003) p130&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]], starting with [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's [[Virgin of Paris]] statue (with lily), and in the centre of the [[stained glass]] rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be "simple [[wiktionary:fleuron|fleurons]], sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis".&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau p.100"/&gt; As attributes of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of [[Sandro Botticelli]] and [[Filippo Lippi]]. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his ''Madonna in the Forest''.

The three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary you can not understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0766140091&amp;id |title=Church Symbolism – F. R. Webber, Ralph Adams Cram – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tradition going back to 14th century France&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau p.99"/&gt; added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance ([[Godhead in Christianity|godhood]]) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.

"Flower of light" symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant ''fleur-de-luce'' (see Latin ''lux, luc-'' = "light"), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the [[etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;A "fanciful derivation", ''Oxford English Dictionary '' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Fence, Buckingham Palace London April 2006 077.jpg|thumb|Fleurs-de-lis on railings at [[Buckingham Palace]]]]
In building and architecture, the fleur-de-lis is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on [[finial]]s, the arms of a cross, or the point of a [[gable]]. The fleur-de-lis can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between fleur-de-lis, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear,&lt;ref name="architecture_dictionnaire_flore" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:fr:Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle – Tome 5, Flore|Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle – Tome 5, Flore]]&lt;/ref&gt; or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor.
It may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the [[crenellation]]s on the 14th-century [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan]].
It can also be seen on the doors of 16th-century [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]].

==Modern usage==
Some modern usage of the fleur-de-lis reflects "the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life", often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are "prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Heraldry: its origins and meaning'' p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H12824.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier of the [[Manchester Regiment]] with their fleur-de-lis badge on his helmet, in 1941.]]
===Military===
Fleurs-de-lis are featured on military badges like those of the United States the New Jersey Army National Guard unit 112th Field Artillery (Self Propelled) (part of the much larger 42nd Infantry Division Mechanized)has it in the upper left side of their Distinctive Unit Insignia. Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 62nd Medical Brigade, [[256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]] and the Corps of Cadets at [[Louisiana State University]].  It is also featured by the [[Intelligence Corps (Israel)|Israeli Intelligence Corps]], and the First World War [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. In the [[British Army]], the fleur-de-lis was the [[cap badge]] of the [[Manchester Regiment]] from 1922 until 1958, and also its successor, the [[King's Regiment]] up to its amalgamation in 2006. It commemorates the capture of French [[regimental colour]]s by their predecessors, the [[63rd Regiment of Foot]], during the [[Invasion of Martinique (1759)|Invasion of Martinique]] in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperd, Alan (1973), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGnTJ49weLwC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=manchester+regiment+cap+badge+guadeloupe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9wCmUs68FOGO0AWqoYDICA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The King's Regiment''], Osprey Publishing Ltd, {{ISBN|0-85045-120-5}} (p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the formation sign of the 2nd (Independent) Armored Brigade of the Indian Army which was known as 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in First World War, received the emblem for its actions in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/OrBat/Combat/250-Armoured.html |title=Bharat Rakshak :: Land Forces Site – Armoured Formations |publisher= |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929214916/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/OrBat/Combat/250-Armoured.html |archivedate=29 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:New Orleans Saints alternate (c. 2000).png|thumb|right|90px|[[New Orleans Saints]]]]
The fleur-de-lis is used by a number of sports teams, especially when it echoes a local flag. This is true with the teams from  Quebec ([[Quebec Nordiques|Nordiques]] (ex-[[National Hockey League|NHL]]), [[Montreal Expos]] (ex-[[Major League Baseball|MLB]]) and [[Montreal Impact]] ([[Major League Soccer|MLS]])), the teams of {{nowrap|[[New Orleans]],}} [[Louisiana]] {{nowrap|([[New Orleans Saints|Saints]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]),}} {{nowrap|[[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]]),}} and {{nowrap|[[New Orleans Zephyrs|Zephyrs]] ([[Pacific Coast League|PCL]])),}} the [[Serie A]] team [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], the [[Bundesliga]] side [[SV Darmstadt 98]] (also known as ''Die Lilien'' – The Lilies),  the [[Rugby League]] team [[Wakefield Trinity|Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]], the [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]] team [[Detroit City FC]] and the Louisiana Soccer Association.

[[Marc-André Fleury]], a Canadian [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]], has a fleur-de-lis logo on his mask. The [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] Welterweight Champion from 2006 to 2013, [[Georges St-Pierre]], has a tattoo of the fleur-de-lis on his right calf. The IT University of Copenhagen's [[soccer]] team ITU F.C. has it in their logo.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/itufc&lt;/ref&gt; France uses the symbol in the official emblem on the {{nowrap|[[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-09-19/Getty/AFP_SK356.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Education===
The emblem appears in coats of arms and logos for universities (like the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and [[Saint Louis University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in Missouri) and schools such as in [[Hilton College (South Africa)]], [[St. Peter, Minnesota]], [[Adamson University]] and [[St. Paul’s University]] in the [[Philippines]]. The Lady Knights of the University of Arkansas at Monticello have also adopted the fleur de lis as one of the symbols associated with their coat of arms. The [[flag of Lincolnshire]], adopted in 2005, has a fleur-de-lis for the city of Lincoln. It is one of the symbols of the American [[Fraternities and sororities|sororities]] [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] and [[Theta Phi Alpha]], the American [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] and [[Sigma Alpha Mu]], as well as the international co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]]. It is also used by the high school and college fraternity [[Scouts Royale Brotherhood]] of the [[Philippines]].

===Scouting===
[[File:Boy Scout Association 1920-1967.png|thumb|An early version of the [[Scouting|Scout]] emblem, used in the [[United Kingdom]] before 1967]]
{{Main|Fleur-de-lis in Scouting}}
The fleur-de-lis is the main element in the logo of most [[Scouting]] organizations. The symbol was first used by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Sir Robert Baden-Powell]] as an arm-badge for soldiers who qualified as [[Scout (military)|scouts]] (reconnaissance specialists) in the [[5th Dragoon Guards]], which he commanded at the end of the 19th century; it was later used in [[cavalry]] regiments throughout the [[British Army]] until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental "Boy Scout" camp at [[Brownsea Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmilestones.co.uk/badges |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207011337/http://www.scoutingmilestones.co.uk/badges |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-07 |title=The Evolution of The World Badge |last1=Walker |first1=Colin |last2= |first2= |date=March 2007 |website=Scouting Milestones |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', Baden-Powell referred to the motif as "the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass" and continued; "It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points remind you of the three points of the [[Scout Promise]]",&lt;ref&gt;Baden-Powell, Robert [http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/yarn03.pdf ''Scouting for Boys''], Arthur Pearson, (''Campfire Yarn No. 3 – Becoming a Scout'')&lt;/ref&gt; being duty to God and country, helping others and keeping the [[Scout Law]]. The [[World Scout Emblem]] of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its [[reef knot]] or square knot, service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://troop25longbeach.com/Fleur-de-Lis.aspx |title=Origin of the World Scouting Symbol "Fleur-de-lis" |author=Troop 25 |work=Web |publisher=Troop 25, Scouting of America |location=USA |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717104241/http://troop25longbeach.com/Fleur-de-Lis.aspx |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Games===
The video game series [[Saints row]] features a Fleur De Lis as the symbol of the protagonist's gang the 3rd Street Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://saintsrow.fandom.com/wiki/3rd_Street_Saints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another video game series that uses the  symbol, be it a stylized version, is [[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]. Although the its orgins are unknown, it’s primary used in association with [[Agent 47]], the protagonist of the series.

===Other uses===
The symbol may be used in less traditional ways. After [[Hurricane Katrina]] many New Orleanians of varying ages and backgrounds were [[tattoo]]ed with "one of its cultural emblems" as a "memorial" of the storm, according to a researcher at [[Tulane University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/living/t-p/index.ssf?/base/living-6/1153039975164970.xml&amp;coll=1 |title=New Orleans LA Living &amp; Lifestyle |publisher=NOLA.com |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625193300/http://www.nola.com/living/t-p/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fliving-6%2F1153039975164970.xml&amp;coll=1 |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Blue Angels]] have named a looping flight demonstration manoeuvre after the flower as well, and there are even two surgical procedures called "after the fleur."

American automobile manufacturer Chevrolet takes its name from the racing driver Louis Chevrolet, who was born in Switzerland.  But, because the Chevrolet name is French, the manufacturer has used the fleur-de-lis emblems on their cars, most notably the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]], but also as a small detail in the badges and emblems on the front of a variety of full-size Chevys from the 1950s, and 1960s.  The fleur-de-lis has also been featured more prominently in the emblems of the [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice sedan]].

A fleur-de-lis also appears in some of the logos of local [[Louisiana]] media. Such as in the logo of [[WGNO-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated television station in New Orleans, and [[WVUE-TV]], the local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-affiliated television station in New Orleans.

The fleur-de-lis is one of the objects to drop during the [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations in New Orleans.

New Orleans sludge metal band [[Crowbar (American band)|Crowbar]] use it as a logo. It's appeared on every album cover since [[Lifesblood for the Downtrodden]] and is sometimes incorporated into the artwork (on [[The Serpent Only Lies]] as a snake and on [[Sever the Wicked Hand]] as a sword's hilt).

==In literature==
The symbol has featured in modern fiction on historical and mystical themes, as in the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and other books discussing the [[Priory of Sion]]. It recurs in [[French literature]], where examples well known in English translation include Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, a character in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], and the mention in [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]]'s ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' of the old custom of [[Human branding|branding]] a criminal with the sign (''fleurdeliser''). During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]], known as the [[Elizabethan era]], it was a standard name for an iris, a usage which lasted for centuries,&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally refers to lilies or other flowers. It also appeared in the novel [[A Confederacy of Dunces]] by [[John Kennedy Toole]] on a sign composed by the main character.

The OvaHimba are a semi-[[nomad]]ic, [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] people, culturally distinguishable from the [[Herero people]] in northern Namibia and southern Angola, and speak OtjiHimba, a variety of [[Herero language|Herero]], which belongs to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu family]] within [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt;

The OvaHimba are considered the last (semi-) nomadic people of Namibia.

==Culture==
[[File:Himba-Hirten.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Himba [[herder]]s in Kaokoland]]

===Subsistence economy===
{{Details|Subsistence economy}}
The OvaHimba are predominantly [[livestock]] farmers who breed [[fat-tailed sheep]] and [[goat]]s, but count their [[wealth]] in the number of their [[cattle]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; They also grow and farm rain-fed [[crops]] such as [[maize]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; Livestock are the major source of [[milk]] and [[meat]] for the OvaHimba. Their diet is also supplemented by [[cornmeal]], [[chicken]] eggs, wild [[herb]]s and [[honey]]. Only occasionally, and opportunistically, are the livestock sold for [[cash]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; Non-farming businesses, wages and salaries, pensions, and other cash remittances make up a very small portion of the OvaHimba livelihood, which is gained chiefly from their work in [[conservation area|conservancies]], old-age [[pension]]s, and [[drought]] relief aid from the [[government of Namibia]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt;

===Daily life===
Women and girls tend to perform more labor-intensive work than men and boys do, such as carrying water to the village, [[earthen plaster]]ing the [[Mopane#Uses|mopane]] wood homes with a traditional mixture of [[ultisol|red clay soil]] and cow [[manure]] [[Binder (material)|binding agent]], collecting firewood, attending to the [[calabash]] vines used for producing and ensuring a secure supply of [[soured milk]], cooking and serving meals, as well as [[artisan]]s making [[handicraft]]s, [[clothing]] and [[jewelry]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; The responsibility for milking the cows and goats also lies with the women and girls.&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; Women and girls take care of the children, and one woman or girl will take care of another woman's children. The men's main tasks are tending to the [[livestock]] farming, [[herding]] where the men will often be away from the family home for extended periods, [[animal slaughter]]ing, [[construction]], and holding [[council]] with village [[tribal chief]]s.&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt;

Members of a single extended family typically dwell in a [[Homestead (small African settlement)|homestead]] (''onganda''), a small family-village, consisting of a circular hamlet of huts and work shelters that surround an ''okuruwo'' ([[fire worship|sacred ancestral fire]]) and a [[kraal]] for the [[sacred]] livestock. Both the fire and the livestock are closely tied to their [[veneration of the dead]], the sacred fire representing ancestral protection and the sacred livestock allowing "proper relations between human and ancestor".{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=18}}

Both the Himba men and women are accustomed to wearing traditional clothing that befits their living environment in the [[Kaokoland]] and the hot [[semi-arid climate]] of their area, in most occurrences this consists simply of [[skirt]]-like [[clothing]] made from [[calfskin]]s or increasingly from more modern textiles, and occasionally [[sandal]]s for footwear, with foot soles often found made from old car tires.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Himba women especially, as well as Himba men, are remarkably famous for covering themselves with ''[[otjize]]'' paste, a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] mixture of [[butterfat]] and [[ochre]] pigment, to cleanse the skin over long periods due to [[water scarcity]] and protect themselves from the extremely hot and dry climate of the [[Kaokoland]] as well as against [[mosquito]] insect bites. The cosmetic mixture, often perfumed with the aromatic resin of the ''omuzumba'' [[shrub]], gives their skin and hair [[Braid|plait]]s a distinctive orange or red-tinge characteristic, as well as texture and style.&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; Otjize is considered foremost a highly desirable [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] beauty cosmetic, symbolizing earth's rich red color and blood the essence of life, and is consistent with the OvaHimba ideal of [[beauty]].&lt;ref name="DMHT" /&gt;

Hairstyle and jewelry play a significant role among the OvaHimba, it indicates age and social status within their community.&lt;ref name="DMHT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2607647/Incredible-photos-reveal-elaborate-hairdos-Himba-tribe-created-using-goat-hair-MUD.html|title=That's an unusual look!

From pubescence, boys continue to have one braided hair plait, girls will have many ''otjize'' textured hair plaits, some arranged to [[veil]] the girl's face, in daily practice the hair plaits are often tied together and held parted back from the face.&lt;ref name="DMHT" /&gt; Women who have been married for about a year, or have had a child, wear an ornate headpiece called the ''Erembe'', sculptured from [[sheepskin]], with many streams of braided hair, coloured and put in shape with otjize paste.&lt;ref name="DMHT" /&gt; Unmarried young men continue to wear one braided hair plait extended to the rear of the head, while married men wear a [[cap]] or head-wrap and un-braided hair beneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newlynatural.com/blog/2011/01/himba-hair-styling/|title=Himba Hair Styling|last=Kcurly|date=4 January 2011|website=Newly Natural|accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goafrica.about.com/library/bl.himba.htm|title=Tribes of Africa. The Himba|website=Africa Travel|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Widow]]ed men will remove their cap or head-wrap and expose un-braided hair. The OvaHimba are also accustomed to use [[wood ash]] for hair cleansing due to [[water scarcity]].&lt;ref name="DMHT" /&gt;

===Customary practices===
The OvaHimba are [[Polygamy|polygamous]], with the average Himba man being husband to two wives at the same time. They also practice early [[arranged marriage]]s. Young Himba girls are married to male partners chosen by their fathers. This happens from the onset of puberty&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt; which may mean that girls aged 10 or below are married off. This practice is illegal in Namibia, and even some OvaHimba contest it but it is nevertheless widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Opuwo's lonely voice against child marriages | last=Kangootui | first=Nomhle |newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=26 May 2016 | page=1 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/Opuwo’s-lonely-voice-against-child-marriages/40932/read}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the Himba people, it is customary as a [[rite of passage]] to [[circumcision|circumcise]] boys before puberty. Upon marriage, a Himba boy is considered a man, unlike a Himba girl who is not considered a fully-fledged woman until she bears a child.

===Societal participation===
[[File:Himba village, Namibia (2014).jpg|thumb|left|Typical Himba village near [[Uis]] in [[Namibia]] (2014)]]
Despite the fact a majority of OvaHimba live a distinct cultural [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in their remote rural environment and homesteads, they are however [[Social dynamics|socially dynamic]], and not all are isolated from the trends of local [[urban culture]]s. The OvaHimba coexist and interact with members of their country's other ethnic groups and the social trends of urban townsfolk. Especially those in proximity to the Kunene Region capital of [[Opuwo]], travelling frequently to shop at the local town [[supermarket]]s for the convenience of commercial consumer products, market food produce and to acquire [[health care]].&lt;ref name="METNG" /&gt;

==Tribal structure==

Because of the harsh desert climate in the region where they live and their seclusion from outside influences, the OvaHimba have managed to maintain and preserve much of their traditional lifestyle. Members live under a tribal structure based on [[bilateral descent]] that helps them live in one of the most extreme environments on earth.

[[File:Himba-Arbeit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Himba girl at work]]
Under bilateral descent, every tribe member belongs to two clans: one through the father (a patriclan, called ''oruzo'') and another through the mother (a matriclan, called ''eanda'').{{sfn|Crandall|2000}} Himba clans are led by the eldest male in the clan.  Sons live with their father's clan, and when daughters marry, they go to live with the clan of their husband.  However, inheritance of wealth does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan, that is, a son does not inherit his father's cattle but his maternal uncle's instead.

Bilateral descent is found among only a few groups in West Africa, India, Australia, Melanesia and Polynesia, and anthropologists consider the system advantageous for groups that live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of families dispersed over a wide area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=0005596A-DE68-1C6F-84A9809EC588EF21|title=The Himba and the Dam|first=Carol|last=Ezzell|date=17 June 2001|magazine=[[Scientific American]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The OvaHimba history is fraught with disasters, including severe droughts and guerrilla warfare, especially during Namibia's war of independence and as a result of the civil war in neighboring [[Angola]]. Between 1904–1908, they suffered from the same attempt at genocide during the [[Herero Wars]] conducted by the [[German Empire]] colonist government in [[German South-West Africa]] under [[Lothar von Trotha]] that decimated notably the [[Herero people]] and the [[Nama people]] during the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the 1980s it appeared the OvaHimba way of life was coming to a close due to a climax in adverse climatic conditions and political conflicts.&lt;ref name="RMHE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk Management in a Hazardous Environment: A Comparative Study of two Pastoral Societies|volume=|first=Michael|last=Bollig|authorlink=|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SsPO7wYv1VkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.|location=New York|year=2006|language=|chapter=|pages=167–168|isbn=9780387275819}}&lt;/ref&gt; A severe drought killed 90% of their livestock, and many gave up their herds and became refugees in the town of [[Opuwo]] living in [[slum]]s on international [[humanitarian aid]] or joined [[Koevoet]] paramilitary units to cope with the [[livestock]] losses and widespread [[famine]].&lt;ref name="RMHE" /&gt; OvaHimba living over the border in Angola, were occasionally victims of [[kidnapping]] during the South African Border war, either taken as hostages or abducted to join the Angolan branch of the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN, army of [[SWAPO]]).&lt;ref name="RMHE" /&gt;

===Religion===
The OvaHimba are a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] people who worship the God [[Mukuru]], as well as their clan's ancestors ([[Veneration of the dead|ancestor reverence]]). Mukuru only blesses, while the ancestors can bless and curse.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=188}} Each family has its own [[Fire worship|sacred ancestral fire]], which is kept by the fire-keeper. The fire-keeper approaches the [[sacred]] ancestral fire every seven to eight days in order to communicate with Mukuru and the ancestors on behalf of his family.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=47}} Often, because Mukuru is busy in a distant realm, the ancestors act as Mukuru's representatives.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=47}}

The OvaHimba traditionally believe in ''omiti'', which some translate to mean [[witchcraft]] but which others call "[[black magic]]" or "bad medicine".{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=33}} Some OvaHimba believe that death is caused by ''omiti'', or rather, by someone using ''omiti'' for malicious purposes.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|pp=38–39}} Additionally, some believe that evil people who use ''omiti'' have the power to place bad thoughts into another's mind{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=102}} or cause extraordinary events to happen (such as when a common illness becomes life-threatening).{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=66}} But users of ''omiti'' do not always attack their victim directly; sometimes they target a relative or loved one.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=67}} Some OvaHimba will consult a [[traditional healers of South Africa|traditional African diviner-healer]] to reveal the reason behind an extraordinary event, or the source of the ''omiti''.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=66}}

===Since Namibian independence===
[[File:Himba Mobile School.JPG|thumb|Himba mobile school]]
The OvaHimba have been successful in maintaining their culture and traditional way of life.

As such, the OvaHimba have worked with international activists to block a proposed hydroelectric dam along the [[Kunene River#The Epupa dam|Kunene River]] that would have flooded their ancestral lands,&lt;ref name="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/76311/NAMIBIA-Dam-will-mean-our-destruction-warn-Himba=eng |title=Namibia: Dam will mean our destruction, warn Himba |work=[[IRIN]] |publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] |date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011, Namibia announced its new plan to build a dam in Orokawe, in the Baynes Mountains. The OvaHimba submitted in February 2012 their protest Declaration against the hydroelectric dam to the United Nations, the African Union and to the Government of Namibia.&lt;ref name="ep1061" /&gt;

The government of Norway and Iceland funded mobile schools for Himba children, but since Namibia took them over in 2010, they have been converted to permanent schools and are no longer mobile. The Himba leaders complain in their declaration about the culturally inappropriate school system, that they say would threaten their culture, identity and way of life as a people.

===Human rights===
Groups of the last remaining hunters and gatherers Ovatwa are held in secured camps in the northern part of Namibia's Kunene region, despite complaints by the traditional Himba chiefs that the Ovatwa are held there without their consent and against their wishes.&lt;ref name="osi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous coalition opposed to new dam |url=http://www.osisa.org/indigenous-peoples/namibia/indigenous-coalition-opposed-new-dam |website=[[OSISA]] |first=Delme |last=Cupido |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, [[traditional]] Himba chiefs&lt;ref name="Galdu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=5638&amp;giella1=eng |title=Indigenous Himba Appeal to UN to Fight Namibian Dam |website=Galdu |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017232022/http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=5638&amp;giella1=eng |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; issued two separate Declarations&lt;ref name="ep1070" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsodrome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsodrome.com/native_american_news/namibian-minority-groups-demand-their-rights-29917361 |title=Namibian Minority Groups Demand Their Rights |website=Newsodrome |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017135555/http://newsodrome.com/native_american_news/namibian-minority-groups-demand-their-rights-29917361 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[African Union]] and to the [[OHCHR]] of the [[United Nations]].

The first, titled "Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains"&lt;ref name="ep1061"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=1061 |title=Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains |website=Earth Peoples |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the objections from regional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River.

The second, titled "Declaration by the traditional Himba leaders of [[Kaokoland]] in [[Namibia]]"&lt;ref name="ep1070"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=1070 |title=Declaration by the traditional Himba leaders of Kaokoland in Namibia |website=Earth Peoples |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists violations of civil, cultural, economic, environmental, social and political rights perpetrated by the government of [[Namibia]] (GoN).

September 2012, the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the Rights of [[Indigenous Peoples]] visited the OvaHimba and heard their concerns that they do not have recognized traditional authorities and that they are placed under the jurisdictions of chiefs of neighboring dominant tribes, who make decisions on behalf of the minority communities. In his view, the lack of recognition of traditional chiefs, in accordance with Namibian law, relates to a lack of recognition of the minority indigenous tribes' communal lands.&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12603&amp;LangID=E=eng |title=Statement of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, upon concluding his visit to Namibia from 20-28 September 2012 |date=28 September 2012 |website=[[OHCHR]] |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

November 23, 2012, hundreds of OvaHimba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia's plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on  their traditional land and human rights violations against them.&lt;ref name="Earth Peoples1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2910=eng |title=Namibia: Indigenous semi-nomadic Himba and Zemba march in protest against dam, mining and human rights violations |first=Rebecca |last=Sommer |authorlink=Rebecca Sommer|date=23 November 2012 |website=Earth Peoples |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 25, 2013, over 1,000 Himba people marched in protest again, this time in Opuwo, against the ongoing human rights violations that they endure in Namibia. They expressed their frustration over the lack of recognition of their traditional chiefs as "Traditional Authorities" by the government;&lt;ref name="Earth Peoples2"&gt;{{cite web |title=German GIZ directly engaged with dispossessing indigenous peoples of their lands and territories in Namibia|publisher=earthpeoples.org|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=4151 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namibia's plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains at the Kunene River without consulting with the OvaHimba, who do not consent to the construction plans; culturally inappropriate education; the illegal fencing of parts of their traditional land; and their lack of property rights to the territory that they have lived upon for centuries. They also protested against the implementation of the Communal Land Reform Act of 2002.&lt;ref name="Allafrica"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201303260714.html |title=Himba, Zemba reiterate 'no' to Baynes dam |first=Catherine |last=Sasman |newspaper=[[Allafrica]] |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2013, Himba chief Kaipka, on behalf of his region Epupa and the community which was featured in German RTL reality TV show ''Wild Girls'' condemned the misuse of Himba people, individuals and villagers in the show, and demanded the halt of broadcasting any further episodes as they would mock the culture and way of being of the Himba people.&lt;ref name="Earth Peoples3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=5395=eng |title=Indigenous peoples Himba community condemn RTL TV series Wild Girls, asking Earth Peoples co-founder Rebecca Sommer for help to intervene on their behalf and stop it |website=Earth Peoples |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 29, 2014, OvaHimba from both countries, Angola and Namibia, march again in protest against the dam's construction plans as well as against the government attempt to bribe their regional Himba chief. In the signed letter of the Himba community from Epupa, the region that would be directly affected by the dam, the traditional leaders explain that any consent form signed by a former chief as a result of bribery wasn't valid as they remain opposed to the dam.&lt;ref name="Earth People4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=5669 |title=NAMIBIA Semi-nomadic HIMBA march again in protest against dam construction and government attempt to bribe Himba chief’s consent |first=Rebecca |last=Sommer |website=earthpeoples.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological investigations==

===Color perception===
{{see also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Several researchers have studied the OvaHimba perception of colours.&lt;ref name="himba colour"&gt;
{{cite web|last=Roberson|first=Debi|last2=Davidoff|first2=Jules|last3=Davies|first3=Ian R.L.|last4=Shapiro|first4=Laura R.|title=Colour Categories and Category Acquisition in Himba and English|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43627151_Colour_categories_and_category_acquisition_in_Himba_and_English|format=pdf|website=The Department of Psychology|publisher=[[University of Essex]]|accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OvaHimba use four colour names: ''zuzu'' stands for dark shades of blue, red, green and purple; ''vapa'' is white and some shades of yellow; ''buru'' is some shades of green and blue; and ''dambu'' is some other shades of green, red and brown. It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the OvaHimba to distinguish between two colours that fall under the same Herero colour category, compared to people whose language separates the colours into two different colour categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reiger |first=Terry |first2=Paul |last2=Kay |title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] |date=28 August 2009 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/tics2.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2012-08-29 |volume=13 |pages=439–446 |pmid=19716754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classification of gay, lesbian, and bisexual [[sexual orientation|sexual orientations]] underwent major changes in different editions of ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). DSM I classified these orientations under "[[paraphilia]]", and DSM II under "sexual orientation disturbance". DSM III further modified this to "[[ego-dystonic]] homosexuality", before finally dropping the subject from DSM-III-R (and subsequent editions).

==DSM-II==
The DSM-II considered homosexuality as one form of paraphilia, but in the '''[[Homosexuality#Seventh printing of the DSM-II, 1974|seventh printing of DSM-II]]''' homosexuality had shifted to another classification, which is sexual orientation disturbance.  This major change had been preceded by increasing [[1960s in LGBT rights|activities of the LGBT community in the 1960s]], specifically [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969. These activities continued in [[1970s in LGBT rights|1970]] with the following predominant events:
*As described by [[Ronald Bayer]],&lt;ref&gt;copied content from [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Seventh printing of the DSM-II, 1974|DSM]]; see that page's history for attribution&lt;/ref&gt; a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by [[gay rights]] activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in San Francisco. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist [[Frank Kameny]] worked with the [[Gay Liberation Front]] collective to demonstrate against the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: "Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bayer ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis'' (1981) Princeton University Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; This activism occurred in the context of a broader [[anti-psychiatry]] movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon, B.

After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of "sexual orientation disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = R.L. | year = 1981 | title = The diagnostic status of homosexuality in DSM-III: a reformulation of the issues | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/2/210 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 138 | issue = 2| pages = 210–215 | pmid = 7457641 | doi=10.1176/ajp.138.2.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM-III==
In DSM-III, homosexuality had been shifted to a new "Ego-dystonic homosexuality" classification.

==DSM-III-R==
In DSM-III-R, the new "Ego-dystonic homosexuality" classification was also removed and was largely subsumed under "sexual disorder not otherwise specified", which can include "persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name = "Revolution"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/jhbs.20103|author1=Mayes, R.  |author2=Horwitz, AV.|year=2005|title=DSM-III and the revolution in the classification of mental illness|journal=J Hist Behav Sci|pmid= 15981242|volume=41|issue=3|pages=249–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiegel |first1=Alix |date=18 January 2002 |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words |title=81 Words |first2=Ira |last2=Glass |website=This American Life |location=Chicago |publisher=WBEZ Chicago Public Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet universality''' is the concept that "the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable [[human rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], rights and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about|title=Internet Universality|date=10 July 2017|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights four separate but interdependent fields of Internet policy and practice that are considered a "key" to assess a better Internet environment; access to information and knowledge, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[privacy]], and [[Ethics|ethical norms]] and behavior online.

A framework named ROAM was developed by UNESCO in order to investigate and evaluate the universality of Internet in different countries. The framework is based on four normative principles agreed by [[UNESCO]] [[Member states of UNESCO|Member States]]; human rights, openness, accessibility and multistakeholder participation, summarised in the acronym R-O-A-M.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principles represent a solid ground for UNESCO in order to create a tool to comprehend Internet governance: the Internet Universality indicators.

== History ==
The term was agreed on by UNESCO’s General Conference in 2015 as a means to integrate UNESCO’s work, in the framework of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS). It is part of UNESCO's project to fulfill the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. During the 37th session of the [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]], UNESCO Member States affirmed the principle of applicability of human rights in [[cyberspace]]. The concept of Internet Universality was then built upon the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference outcome document on 3–4 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/outcome_document.pdf|title=Connecting the Dots: Options for Future Action|date=5 March 2015|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO’s Deputy Director General, Mr. Getachew Engida, in closing the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference, stated: "''The Internet and all new information and communication must be at the heart of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda - as a transformational force and a foundation for building the knowledge societies we need''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ROAM Principles.png|thumb|The principles of Internet Universality]]

== Wider context ==
The social, civic and economic potential of a [[Transnationalism|global Internet]] — one that bridges the world — is widely recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001920/192096e.pdf|title=Reflections and Analysis by UNESCO on the Internet|date=18 April 2011|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting an individual, locality, nation or continent to the wealth of information, expertise and communities distributed across the globe is among the greatest promises of the Internet; for example, educational materials can now readily be put in the hands of students worldwide. However, the Internet can also empower users to create, disseminate, and consume [[information]] and knowledge resources. This potential for using the Internet to reconfigure access to information and knowledge, and also reshape freedom of expression, privacy, and ethical norms and behavior, has been a theme in academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Society on the Line|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconceptualizing Development in the Global Information Age|editor-last=Castells|editor-first=M.|editor-last2=Himanen|editor-first2=P.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Network Society|last=Castells|first=M.|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=2000|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Include the interconnected [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]], such as the Web, [[social media]], developing [[Mobile Web|mobile Internet]], and the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT), including such developments as [[cloud computing]], [[big data]], and [[robotics]], for example, that are increasingly central to networked technologies. [[Biometrics]] and other technologies central to developing network [[Application software|applications]], such as for personal identification and security, are also incorporated in this definition.

By 2014, over three billion people had gained access to the Internet from around the world.{{efn|Internet World Stats estimates that there were 3,035,749,340 Internet users by 30 June 2014, constituting 42.3% of the global population of 7.2B people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet User Statistics and 2014 World Population Stats|date=30 June 2014|website=www.internetworldstats.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217215945/https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|archive-date=17 December 2014|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This is a major advance in worldwide access to information and knowledge, but translates to only 42 per cent of the world, leaving most of the world without access. Even those with access are often constrained by technical barriers, [[language barrier]]s, skills deficits and many other social and policy factors, from accessing information and knowledge in essential ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working-Class Network Society: Communication Technology and the Information Have-Less in Urban China.|last=Qui|first=J.L.|publisher=Cambridge, MA: MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The global diffusion of the Internet is progressing, but at the same time what we know as the Internet is continually changing. Innovation continues apace in many areas, from mobile applications and payment systems to social media and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The Internet has reached more people in more powerful ways than ever thought possible. It has also become a major resource for [[economic development]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Internet Universality Principles: R-O-A-M ==
The R-O-A-M principles are a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for assessing the state of play of each key fields of Internet policy. The framework underscores a set of principles that, when applied to the Internet, aim to achieve an open, [[Global Internet usage|global]] and [[Internet security|secure]] [[Internet]], by highlighting the relevance of human rights as a whole, as well as openness, [[Internet access|accessibility]] and multistakeholder participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rights-based ===
The Internet is becoming so significant in everyday life, work and identity in much of the world, that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish human rights on and off the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO and the [[United Nations]] more broadly have affirmed the principle of human rights should apply to all aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference-37th/|title=General Conference 37th {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include, for example, freedom of expression, and privacy. UNESCO considers that as these two rights should also apply to the Internet, so should other rights, such as [[cultural diversity]], [[gender equality]], and [[education]]. As human rights are indivisible, for UNESCO all these rights mentioned above also need to be balanced with rights that apply to both [[Virtual life|digital]] and [[Life|extra-digital life]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Openness ===
This general principle, applied to the Internet, encompasses open [[Globalization|global]] standards, [[interoperability]], [[Interface (computing)|open application interfaces]], and open science, documents, text, data, and [[Flow network|flows]]. Social and political support for open systems, not only technical [[expertise]], is part of this principle. Transparency is part of openness, as well as a dimension of the rights to seek and receive information. Making rights and openness are [[Interdependence|interdependent]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Accessibility ===
There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, digital inequalities, and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Multistakeholders participation ===
{{Main|Multi-stakeholder governance}}

The general principle of participation in [[decision-making]] that impacts on the lives of individuals has been part of the Internet from its outset, accounting for much of its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What if we all governed the Internet? Advancing multistakeholder participation in Internet governance|last=van der Spuy|first=Anri|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2017|isbn=|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002598/259867e.pdf|access-date=10 November 2017|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognizes the value of multistakeholder participation, incorporating [[user (computing)|user]]s and a user-centric perspective as well as all other actors critical to developing, using and [[Governance|governing]] the Internet across a range of levels. The other principles are enriched by the multistakeholder participation principle, because it states that everyone should have a stake in the future of the Internet.

It is possible to define a number of broad categories of stakeholders in the Internet, with subgroups as well: State, businesses and industries, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental actors]], [[civil society]], [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]], research actors, individuals, and others. Each of these categories has more or less unique stakes in the future of the Internet, but there are also areas of great overlap and interdependence. For instance, some NGOs, are likely to prioritize the promotion of human rights; meanwhile parliaments are primary actors in defining laws to protect these rights. Still other stakeholders are key to shaping [[Human rights and encryption|rights online]], such as [[Search engine|search engine providers]], and [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries|last=MacKinnon|first=R.|last2=Hickok|first2=E.|last3=Bar|first3=A.|last4=Lim|first4=Hae-in|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|access-date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals also have particular roles to play in respecting, promoting and protecting rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cross-cutting factors ===
Aside from the four main factors (R-O-A-M), UNESCO has also identified five different cross-cutting factors that will suit all of the R-O-A-M factors, and should be taken into consideration. Of the five, two of them are concerned with gender and age equality, one is concerned with sustainable development (i.e. what part does the internet play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the UN), the fourth is concerned with internet trust and security, and the last is concerned with legal and ethical properties of the internet.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Internet Universality Indicators ==
UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators - based on the ROAM principles - to help governments and other stakeholders to assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research process was envisioned to include [[wikt:consultation|consultation]]s at a range of global forums and a written [[questionnaire]] sent to key actors, but also a series of [[publication]]s on important [[Internet censorship|Internet Freedom]] related issues as encryption, [[Online hate speech|hate speech online]], privacy,  [[Internet safety|digital safety]] and [[Journalism and freedom|journalism]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/unesco-series-on-internet-freedom|title=UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom|date=1 November 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this multidimensional research will be publicized in June 2018. The final indicators will be submitted to the UNESCO Member States in the International Program for Development of Communication (IPDC) for endorsement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The indicators are divided into three different groups: quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators and institutional indicators (which concerns constitutional and legal arrangements). This has raised questions about the credibility of the indicators, as well as the difficulty of actually carrying out the research. Due to differences in data availability, it could be difficult to give a fair assessment to all indicators for all countries involved. However, in their draft UNESCO believes that the range and diversity of indicators included in the framework should enable the indicators to provide sufficient evidence of the Internet environment as a whole. Other challenges that it faces include different definitions of terms like 'broadband', as well as the fact that most of the data is held by private companies and is not publicly available as a result.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== The Four Major Fields of Focus ==

=== Access to Information and Knowledge ===
[[Access to information]] and knowledge encompasses the vision of universal access, not only to the Internet, but also to the ability to seek and receive open scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge [[Online and offline|online]], and also produce content in all forms. This requires initiatives for [[freedom of information]] and the building of [[Open access|open]] and preserved knowledge resources, as well as a respect for cultural and linguistic diversity that fosters local content in multiple languages, quality educational opportunities for all, including [[Media literacy|new media literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on income, skills, education, gender, age, race, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or accessibility by those with [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frontiers in New Media Research|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=F.

=== Freedom of Expression ===
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}

Freedom of expression entails the ability to safely express one’s views over the Internet, ranging from the rights of Internet users to freedom of expression online, through to press freedom and the safety of journalists, [[blog]]gers and human rights advocates, along with [[Policy|policies]] that enhance an open exchange of views and a respect for the rights of free online expression. Privacy refers broadly to Internet practices and policies that respect the rights of individuals to have a reasonable expectation of having a personal space, and to control access to their personal information. Privacy, therefore, allows individuals to freely express their ideas without fear of reprisals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Privacy ===
{{Main|Privacy}}

Privacy protection is however a tricky concept that goes together with the promotion of openness and transparency and a recognition that privacy and its protection underpins freedom of expression and trust in the Internet, and therefore its greater use for social and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Ethics}}

Ethics considers whether the norms, rules and procedures that govern online behavior and the design of the Internet and related [[digital media]] are based on ethical principles anchored in human rights based principles and geared to protecting the dignity and safety of individuals in cyberspace and advance accessibility, openness, and inclusiveness on the Internet. For example, Internet use should be sensitive to ethical considerations, such as non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age or disabilities; and shaped by ethics rather than used to retrospectively justify practices and policies, placing a focus on the intentionality of actions, as well as on the outcomes of Internet policies and practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges to Internet Universality ==

As the [[World Wide Web]] and related digital media have evolved, they have come to serve many diverse purposes for many different actors, e.g. household entertainment, [[Surveillance|government surveillance]]. Technical innovations are altering traditional business models, such as in the provision of news, and the structure of organizations, where traditional hierarchical reporting relationships have been challenged by many-to-one and many-to-many networks of communication that span organizational boundaries.

=== Policy ===
{{See also|Human rights and encryption}}

As digital media have been a force behind the convergence of formerly more distinct technologies of the post, telephone, and [[mass media]], so policy and regulation have often failed to keep up, as we can see with the lack of a clear and unified regulation policy used by social media. This has left potentially inappropriate regulations in place and failed to integrate new solutions such as Media and information literacy. A worldwide ecology of policies and regulations is shaping the interrelated local and global outcomes of the Internet on access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics.

And such policy choices are being considered by a multiplicity of actors at all levels for all are concerned that the policies and practices governing the Internet could undermine principles and purposes they view as fundamental, whether those values are centered on freedom of expression, the privacy of personal information, or ethical conduct, and whether the implications are perceived to be immediate or long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Blocking, Filtering and Content Regulation ===
[[Block (Internet)|Blocking]] and [[Internet Filtering|filtering]] of content regulation are common areas of concern for NGO's and International Organizations, such as UNESCO. These measures restrict in a direct way citizens’ rights to impart information and opinion, as well as impacting adversely on their rights to access online content. In many cases, users might not realize that content has been filtered or blocked. There was some recognition that alongside [[censorship]] as a violation of free expression, there is also legitimate reason in some contexts to block certain content, such as material that incites [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]. This raises the question of how to draw the line in specific cases about what to block, for how long, in what proportion, and with what transparency and redress mechanism.{{efn|This common example originated in 1919 with US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.’s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Schenck v. United States|vol=249|reporter=U.S.|opinion=47|court=U.S.|date=3 March 1919|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/249/47.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another issue is the danger of holding intermediaries liable as if they were publishers — for example, making social media [[Computing platform|platform]]s responsible for an alleged case of hate speech. International standards of [[International human rights law|human rights law]] mean that removal, blockage or [[Filtering software|filtering]] of Internet content should be the exception to the norm of free flow of information, and that such actions fulfill the conditions of due purpose, necessity, proportionality, and transparency, and are authorized under relevant law and policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, multiple actors, including individual users can identify instances of censorship and expose these cases to the court of [[public opinion]]. In such ways, the Internet has the potential for enabling individual Internet users to hold institutions and other users more accountable for their actions online, creating what has been called a ‘[[Fifth Estate]]’, analogous to the [[Fourth Estate]] of the press, but potentially even more powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|date=2009|title=The Fifth Estate Emerging through the Network of Networks|journal=Prometheus|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fifth Estate does require a relatively free and open Internet to be sustainable and influential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== User Targeting and Profiling ===
[[Government]]s or commercial enterprises have the ability to target individual users, putting their privacy in danger, given that they will know much about their interests through their search or other online activities. Individual users of social media platforms can advertise to others who are interested in particular topics. This can appear more as a violation of privacy then the exercise of free speech. A related issue is the ‘[[filter bubble]]’:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=E.|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2011|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that different Internet users will see different versions of the Internet, based on how algorithms use their previous search or social media preferences. User [[wikt:targeting|targeting]] can happen at the level of the government, [[private companies]], or even at the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Expression and Identification ===
The dependence of freedom of expression on related issues of privacy, anonymity, and encryption that face an apparent resistance to change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Anonymity ===
Anonymity can be a cornerstone of privacy; it is considered as a prerequisite for the expression of [[Popularity|unpopular]] or critical speech. A[[anonymity|nonymity]] is sometimes viewed as contributing to harmful speech, such as hate speech, which goes beyond international standards of human rights law for protected speech. Despite this perception, academic research has not established that removing anonymity and requiring the identification of speakers would be a cure to insensitive or hurtful remarks. These incivilities are often fostered by a larger set of circumstances, such as a failure of users sitting at a computer to fully realize that they are communicating with a real person. Anonymity may also impact on [[public debate]] online. In some countries, participants would refrain from participating (for instance on the issue of gay rights or domestic abuse) for fear of identification and [[persecution]]. Anonymity in [[Cyberattack|cyber-attacks]], including fake [[Domain (Internet)|domain]] attacks impersonating civil society, is a serious violation of free expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Data protection and surveillance ===
[[Information privacy|Data protection]] can be critical to free expression. Increasing government surveillance of citizens, including through the collection and analysis of ‘big data’, is leading to an erosion of the citizens' rights to privacy and freedom of expression. A report of the former UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression states that, bulk access to all [[Data transmission|digital communications]] traffic eradicates the possibility of individualized proportionality analysis, because it pre-empts prior authorization based on specific targeted suspicion.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights|at=paras. 12, 13, 14|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[mass surveillance]] potentials and the use of big data analytics could change the balance between the state and individuals. [[Whistleblower]], such as [[Edward Snowden]], helped identifying the mass surveillance of [[Metadata|communications metadata]], as a disproportionate response in relation to the security problem. Concern were also expressed during the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference about [[surveillance tools]], originally built to address severe crimes, being used to collect personal information about dissidents, or sometimes from all citizens. Further concerns were over weak transparency on how data is collected or used for security investigations. Manipulation of security practices such as the introduction of [[Software cracking|‘back doors]]’ into [[software]], to allow legitimate government access can leave Internet users vulnerable to other, illegitimate threats. Attackers can potentially get in through the same back doors, rendering systems less secure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jurisdictional Issues ===
There are a certain number of obstacles in maintaining and promoting the rights to freedom of expression via regulation and regulatory frameworks. Due to its globalized and borderless nature, the Internet can be seen as inherently unregulated. There is, for example, a difficulty in establishing effective state-based regulation in a world where content can be hosted and accessed from entirely different countries, leading to regulation becoming obsolete. Striking the correct regulatory balance is difficult, as over- or inappropriate regulation can have negative consequences not only for freedom of expression but for the value of the Internet in general. UNESCO considers that governments role is not to restrict [[Political freedom|freedoms]], but rather to ensure that fundamental human rights — including communication-related rights — are protected. Paradoxically, a lack of regulation could be a detriment to the [[public interest]]. Internet-specific laws to protect freedom of expression could then be justified, since the Internet is so very different from any of the traditional media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Languages of Kalimantan.svg|thumb|'''Kelabit''' among the languages of Kalimantan (orange #27, top)]]

'''Kelabit''' is one of the most remote languages of [[Borneo]], on the [[Sarawak]]–[[Kalimantan]] border. It is spoken by one of the smallest ethnicities in Borneo, the [[Kelabit people]].

==Phonology==
Vowels are {{IPA|/ə, a, e, i, o, u/}}. All consonants but the aspirated voiced stops are lengthened after stressed {{IPA|/ə/}}. Stress generally occurs on the penultimate syllable. 

Kelabit is notable for having "a typologically rare series of [[Aspirated_consonant#Voiced_stop|true voiced aspirate]]s" (that is, not [[breathy voice]]/murmured consonants; for some speakers they are [[prevoiced consonant|prevoiced]]) along with [[voiced consonant|modally voiced]] and [[tenuis consonant]]s but without an accompanying series of [[aspirated consonant|voiceless aspirates]]. It is the only language known to have voiced aspirates or murmured consonants without also having voiceless aspirated consonants, a situation that has been reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Blust]], 1974. A double counter-universal in Kelabit. ''Papers in Linguistics'' :309-24.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[glottalic theory]].)

|}

At the end of a word, {{IPA|/t/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[θ]}}. For some speakers, {{IPA|/d͇͡t͇ʰ/}} is affricated; in neighboring [[Lun Dayeh language|Lun Dayeh]], the reflex of this consonant is an unaspirated affricate {{IPA|[d͡tʃ]}}. {{IPA|/dʒ/}} is rare, and is not attested from all dialects.

The flap is alveolar. It's not clear if {{IPA|/n/}} and the other coronal sonorants are alveolar like {{IPA|/d/}} or dental like {{IPA|/t/}}.

The aspirated voiced series only occurs intervocalicly, and may have arisen from geminate consonants. They are at least impressionistically twice as long as other stops. They vary with {{IPA|/b d͇ ɡ/}} under suffixation, with {{IPA|/b͡pʰ d͇͡t͇ʰ ɡ͡kʰ/}} occurring where other consonants would be allophonically geminated:
*{{IPA|/təb͡pʰəŋ/ [ˈtəb͡pʰəŋ]}} 'to fell' &gt; {{IPA|/təbəŋ-ən/ [təˈbəŋːən]}} 'fell it!'
*{{IPA|/kətəd/ [ˈkətːəd]}} 'back (n)' &gt; {{IPA|/kətəd͇͡t͇ʰ-ən/ [kəˈtəd͇͡t͇ʰən]}} 'to be left behind'

There are several arguments for analyzing the aspirated voiced consonants as segments rather than as consonant clusters:
*There are no (other) clusters allowed in the language. Some languages allow only geminate consonants as clusters, but there are no (other) phonemic geminates in Kelabit. In some related languages, such as [[Ida'an language|Ida'an]], the reflexes of these sounds clearly do behave as clusters. 
*The syllable break occurs before the consonants (that is, {{IPA|[a.bpa]}}, and not in the middle ({{IPA|[ab.pa]}}), which is the behaviour of consonant clusters (including geminates) in related languages that allow them. {{IPA|/i, u/}} lower to {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}} before any non-glottal coda consonant. They do not lower before the aspirated voiced consonants, again suggesting they are not consonant clusters.

The aspirated voiced series does not appear in all dialects of Kelabit or Lun Dayeh:

The '''Khakha Rajputs''' of [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Pakistan]] are clan of [[Muslim Rajputs]]&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Political History of Kashmir'' by [[Prithivi Nath Kaul Bamzai]], MD Publ. Ltd., 1994, p669&lt;/ref&gt; who have inhabited the Kashmiri region since the 13th century after the conquer of [[Janjua|Janjua warlord]] Raja Khakha of the region of Upper Jhelum Valley of Kashmir.

==History==
The Khakhas, a warrior tribe that ruled western Punjab since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Mediaeval Hindu India'' by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have queried whether the Khakha name is a derivative distortion of the word Khatri rather than an actual name of the tribe:

{{quote|Historian Pt Har Gopal Kaur feels that the word Brahman got corrupted to make Bamba and the word Khatri to yield Khakha (author - I have no opinion on what these clan names are a corruption of. However, knowing the languages of the area, I have no doubt that these are corruptions of words beginning with B and with K respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Parvéz Dewân's Jammû, Kashmîr, and Ladâkh: Travel, Trekking, Culture, History, Wildlife, Almost Everything  By Parvez Dewan   Edition: illustrated Published by Manas Publications, 2004 Item notes: v. 1 Original from the University of Michigan Page 423&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Mughal period==
The Khakha Rajputs played an important part in the history of Kashmir by creating alliances with other Kashmiri tribes against many powerful rulers, such as the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]]. The Khakha warlords allied with Kashmiri Emperor Yakub Shah against Akbar's amry at the battle of Bulyasa and were victorious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060321074329/http://www.kashmir-information.com/Baharistan/chapter8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2015}}

==Sikh Empire==
During the Sikh conquest of Kashmir, the Khakha Rajputs, and also the [[Bomba Dynasty|Bhamba]] tribe, occasionally ventured into the valley on looting expeditions and thus annoyed the Sikh invaders.&lt;ref name="Kashmir' 1994, p637"/&gt;

It is recorded, that upon a British Officer's visit to Kashmir in 1822, he had to return from Uri as the Khakha chief would not allow him to pass.&lt;ref name="Kashmir' 1994, p637"&gt;''Culture and Political History of Kashmir'' by Prithivi Nath Kaul Bamzai, MD Publ. Ltd., 1994, p637&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khakhas began to intensify their raids in consequence to the weakening Sikh power. Eventually, when Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] assumed rulership of Kashmir, he managed to drive back the Khakhas with great difficulty. But knowing the unrelenting fierce reputation of the rebellious Khakhas, he immediately installed strong [[garrisons]] in the forts guarding the passes.&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Political History of Kashmir'' by Prithivi Nath Kaul Bamzai, MD Publ. Ltd., 1994, p637, p669, p670&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite facing the best of the Sikh power to subdue them, they still enjoyed a highly privileged position, paying little if any taxes, openly wearing arms and defying orders where possible.&lt;ref name="Jammu 1987, p4"&gt;''History of Operations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, 1947-48'' by Sri Nandan Prasad, Dharm Pal, Govt. of India 1987, p4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestral title and reputation==
The Khakhas continue their tradition of recording their genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;''Kashmiris Fight for Freedom'' by Muhammad Yusuf Saraf, Ferozson 1977, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

Their fierce, often predatorial raids during the Sikh age earned them a localised legend, that mothers would tell their children "..the Khakhas are coming..." to frighten them.&lt;ref&gt;''Kashmiris Fight for Freedom'' by Muhammad Yusuf Saraf, Ferozson 1977, p78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kyz kuu''' ({{lang-az|qız-qov}}, {{lang-kz|қыз қуу}}, {{IPA-kz|qəz qʊwəw|pron}}) or '''kyz kuumai''', ({{lang-ky|кыз куумай|pron}} {{IPA-ky|qɯz quːmɑj|}}), literally "girl chasing",{{sfn|King|2006|p=111}} is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] traditional [[sport]] among [[Turkic people]]s such as [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]. It exhibits elements of [[horse racing]] but is often referred to as a "kissing game". It is mocked in the movie [[Borat]].

A game is usually conducted as follows. A young man on horseback waits at a starting line. A young woman, also mounted, starts her horse [[horse gait|galloping]] from a given distance behind the young man. When the young woman passes the young man, he may start his horse galloping. The two race towards a finish line some distance ahead. If the young man is able to catch up to the young woman before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a [[kiss]], which constitutes victory. However, if the young man has not caught up to the young woman by the time they reach the finish line, the young woman turns around and chases the young man back to the starting line. If she is in range of the young man, she may use her [[whip]] to beat him, which signifies a victory for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagenhauser|first1=Betsy|title=Embassy of Kazakhstan - Culture|url=http://search.globescope.com/kazakhstan/index.php?page=culture|website=search.globescope.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10717">A '''marriage of state''' is a diplomatic marriage or union between two members of different [[nation-state]]s or internally, between two power blocs, usually in authoritarian societies and is a practice which dates back into pre-history, as far back as early [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]] cultures in [[Western world|western society]], and of similar antiquity in other civilizations.  The fable of [[Helen of Troy]] may be the best known pre-historic tale reporting an incidence of surrendering a female member of a ruling line to gain peace or shore up alliances of state between nation-states headed by small oligarchies or acknowledged royalty.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Lodewijk XIV-Marriage.jpg|thumb|''The marriage of the [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] to [[Marie Adélaïde of Savoy]] on December 7, 1697 by [[Antoine Dieu]]]]

While the contemporary Western ideal sees marriage as a unique bond between two people who are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) often see marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served, and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses are considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons was the pattern for centuries among European rulers.&lt;ref name="fleming" &gt;{{ cite journal | last =Fleming | first =Patricia H. |date=June 1973 | title =The Politics of Marriage Among Non-Catholic European Royalty | journal =[[Current Anthropology]] | volume =14 | issue =3 | pages =231–249 | doi =10.1086/201323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful selection of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending on the law of the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; 

Traditionally, many factors were important in the arranging of royal marriages. One such factor was the size of the tracts of land that the other royal family governed or controlled.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; Another, related factor was the stability of the control exerted over that territory: when there is territorial instability in a royal family, other royals will be less inclined to marry into that family.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; Another factor was [[political alliance]]: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and "their countries during peace and war" and could justify many important political decisions.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

== Importance of religion ==
Religion has always been closely tied to political affairs and continues to be today in many countries. Religious considerations were often important in marriages among royal families, particularly in lands where there was an established or [[official religion]]. When a royal family was prepared to negotiate or arrange the marriage of one of its children, it was extremely important to have a prospective spouse who followed the same religion or, at the very least, that the spouse be willing to convert before the wedding. In non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] royal families, there were few things worse than marrying a person who was a Catholic.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; Some countries barred from accession to the throne any person who married a Catholic, as in the British [[Act of Settlement 1701]]. When a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] prince converted to Catholicism, he risked being disowned by his family,&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; and often being barred from the throne himself. Some of these laws are still in force, centuries after the conclusion of Europe's [[Catholicism and the wars of religion|Wars of Religion]].

Roman Catholic countries had similar laws and strictures. [[History of France#Early Modern France (1453–1789)|France]], for example, effectively barred non-Catholics from the throne. Even if the law did not strictly prohibit marrying non-Catholic royalty, [[French Wars of Religion|political situations]] and [[French Wars of Religion#Henry IV|popular sentiment]] were frequently sufficient to dissuade princes from so doing.

== Rulers' marriages ==

===Elizabeth I===

Contrary to what some historians have said about her elusiveness when in marriage negotiations with suitors or their representatives, [[Queen Elizabeth I]] was known to be straightforward in her various courtships.&lt;ref name="doran mm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doran|first1=Susan|title=Monarchy &amp; Matrimony: The courtships of Elizabeth I|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-11969-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1565, when in the midst of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] matrimonial project, Elizabeth promptly dismissed the rival French suit of their fourteen-year-old king, stating she would have to be ten years younger to consider it.&lt;ref name="doran mm" /&gt; Furthermore, in addition to concerns about religion, financial arrangements, and security, Elizabeth also maintained that she could not marry anyone whom she had not seen in person, perhaps as a result of her father's own displeasure and divorce of [[Anne of Cleves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warnicke|first1=Retha|title=Why Elizabeth I Never Married|journal=History Review|date=2010|issue=67|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on religion, national security, and securing the line of succession in all of Elizabeth's marriage negotiations demonstrate the emphasis placed on the political importance of marriages of state during this period. Although some of her contemporaries hoped she would find solace in marriage, procreation was still considered the primary purpose of royal marriage.

In March 1565, Elizabeth told her Spanish ambassador, [[Diego Guzmán de Silva]]:
:If I could appoint such a successor to the Crown as would please me and the country, I would not marry, as it is a thing for which I have never had any inclination. My subjects, however press me so that I cannot help myself or take the other course, which is a very difficult one. There is a strong idea in the world that a woman cannot live unless she is married, or at all events that is she refrains from marriage she does so for some bad reason....But what can we do?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Carole|title=The Heart and Stomach of a King|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-2240-1|page=49|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Elizabeth appeared to personally believe that a woman should reasonably be able to remain single. However, she continued to engage in marriage negotiations for decades because of the expectations of her role as monarch. Although she herself had little inclination to marry, she understood the limitations of her power and therefore seriously considered marriage on numerous occasion at the behest of councillors.

The Habsburg marriage negotiations revolving around the marriage of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Charles]] show the way marriage was often negotiated in royal families. The first phase began in 1559, with the initiative for a matrimonial alliance between England and Austria.&lt;ref name="doran" &gt;{{ cite journal | last =Doran | first =Susan |date=October 1989| title =Religion and Politics at the Court of Elizabeth I: The Habsburg Marriage Negotiations of 1559-1567 | journal =[[The English Historical Review]] | volume =104 | issue =413 | pages =908–926 | doi =10.1093/ehr/CIV.413.908 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first phase was a failure and, the people of England were relieved to the extent that they feared a foreign ruler coming into their country.&lt;ref name="doran" /&gt;  Negotiations were re-opened with some difficulty in 1563 by the English.&lt;ref name="doran mm" /&gt; This was in part due to Charles' search for a wife elsewhere, the lack of permanent diplomatic links between Austria and England, and because of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]]'s distrust of Elizabeth for her refusal of his son's suit in 1559. However, [[Sir William Cecil]] was interested in the match and began work on a marriage negotiation.&lt;ref name="doran" /&gt; While the first set of negotiations were uncertain, the second round of negotiations gathered stronger support in England for the suit and went on for several years. 

Both sides hoped to gain from a marital alliance. In England, the negotiations were a key element to Elizabeth's foreign policy and intended to protect the country's commercial interests and political security against the French-Scottish alliance.&lt;ref name="doran mm" /&gt; Austria also hoped to gain in similar ways from a political alliance and possibly bring Catholicism back to England. However, English support was partly due to the fact that the English had been deliberately misled to believe that Charles would be willing to convert to Protestantism and in the end, the archduke's Catholicism and refusal to come to England before finalizing a betrothal proved too difficult to overcome and the suit dissolved. These negotiations, nevertheless, illustrate how support and opposition ebbed and flowed over the course of time, and how issues like religion, which seemed to be resolvable at the outset, could ultimately doom an otherwise promising proposal.

===Napoleon===

[[Napoleon]], as emperor, gave out kingdoms and female relatives with equal largesse to favored Marshals and general officers. 

===United Kingdom===
Through most of recorded history state marriages were also common at lesser levels of nobility, and many a lesser marriage of state was consummated and bargained over during all of the Middle Ages and through the middle of the twentieth-century in western society, and the old forms still hold sway in many other cultural contexts today. One famous example of a marriage of state for lesser reasons was that of [[George II of Great Britain]]'s parents. The Princess Sophia's dowry included properties assuring an income of 100,000 thalers annually, which led to George Louis, [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (the future [[George I of Great Britain]]), marrying his first cousin [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]]&amp;mdash;when both were pressed into the arrangement by his mother&amp;mdash; and that German ducal dynastic move accidentally gave the couple the inside track on the Protestant thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland (and later, those of the United Kingdom and Ireland).

'''''North of 60''''' is a 1990s [[Television in Canada|Canadian television]] drama depicting life in the sub-[[Arctic]] northern boreal forest (north of [[60th parallel north|60° north]] [[latitude]], hence the title). It first aired on [[CBC Television]] in 1992 and was [[television syndication|syndicated]] around the world. It is set in the fictional community of [[Lynx River]], a primarily Native-run town depicted as being in the [[Dehcho Region]], [[Northwest Territories]].

Most of the characters were [[Dene]]. Some non-native characters had important roles: the restaurant/motel owner, the band manager, the nurse and (during the show's first season) the town's main [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officer. The show explored themes of Native poverty, alcoholism, cultural preservation, conflict over land settlements, and natural resource exploitation.

Originally somewhat light-hearted (a CBC response to the very successful ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' on CBS), it quickly became a more ponderous dramatic series.

==Casting==
Starring in the series were [[Tina Keeper]] as RCMP Constable, later Corporal, Michelle Kenidi, Tracey Cook as Sarah Birkett (nurse during first year), [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]] as Peter Kenidi (band chief in first year, Michelle's brother), [[Gordon Tootoosis]] as Albert Golo (bootlegger, then band chief), Dakota House as Trevor 'Teevee' Tenia (teen trouble-maker, then band chief), Lubomir Mykytiuk as Gerry Kisilenko (restaurant/motel owner/justice of the peace), [[Jimmy Herman]] as Joe Gomba (elder) and [[Simon R. Baker]] as Charlie Muskrat. [[Adam Beach]] and [[Tantoo Cardinal]] also starred. Elsie Tsa Che ([[Wilma Pelly]]) was a fan favorite, playing Teevee's grandmother, a community elder. [[John Oliver (actor)|John Oliver]] led the cast as Corporal Eric Olsen during the show's first two seasons and entered into an off-screen relationship with co-star Keeper; he left the show when his relationship with Keeper soured. Keeper subsequently became the show's lead actor for the remainder of its run. Oliver was replaced by [[Robert Bockstael (actor)|Robert Bockstael]] as Corporal Brian Fletcher, who was replaced later by Peter Kelly Gaudreault as Constable James Harper.

One of the stars was [[Michael Horse]], as Andrew One Sky, previously best known for his portrayal of Tonto in the 1981 film ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]''.

==History==
The linguistic traits that flourish throughout the Pacific Northwest attest to a [[culture]] that transcends boundaries. Historically, this hearkens back to the early years of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the British and Americans, when the entire region was considered a single area and people of all different mother tongues and nationalities used Chinook Jargon (along with English and French) to communicate with each other. Until the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, it was identified as being either [[Oregon Country]] (by the Americans) or [[Columbia District|Columbia]] (by the British).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |last=Meinig |first=Donald W. |author-link=Donald W. Meinig |title=The Great Columbia Plain |orig-year=1st&amp;nbsp;pub.&amp;nbsp;1968 |edition=Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classic |year=1995 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-97485-9 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the 1897 [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the culture of the Pacific Northwest expanded northward into [[Yukon]] and [[Alaska]], carried along by the thousands of people who were attracted to the gold fields in the north. Today, the English variety common to this shared culture can be heard by people from [[Eugene, Oregon]] to [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |last=Lang |first=George |title=Making Wawa: The Genesis of Chinook Jargon |publisher=UBC Press |year=2008 |location=Vancouver |pages=especially 127–128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTYXs35aTFkC&amp;pg=PA127 |isbn=978-0-7748-1526-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Issues|date=July 2011}}

Linguists immediately after World War{{nbsp}}II tended to find few patterns unique to the Western region, as among other things, Chinook Jargon and other "slang words" (despite Chinook Jargon being an actual separate language in and of itself, individual words from it like "salt chuck", "muckamuck", "siwash" and "tyee" were and still are used in Pacific Northwest English) were pushed away in favour of having a "proper, clean" dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWolframWard2005|Wolfram and Ward 2006, pg. 140]]&lt;/ref&gt; Several decades later, linguists began noticing emerging characteristics of Pacific Northwest English, although it remains close to the [[General American|standard American accent]].

==Phonology==
[[File:Pacific Northwest English vowel space.PNG|right|600px|thumb|The Pacific Northwest English vowel space. Based on TELSUR data from Labov et al. The {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are indistinguishable in the F1/F2 means for three speakers from Vancouver, British Columbia, two speakers from Seattle, and three from Portland, Oregon]]

===Commonalities with both Canada and California===
* Pacific Northwest English has all the [[merger (phonology)|phonological merger]]s typical of North American English and, more specifically, all the mergers typical of [[Western American English]], including the [[cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]].
* Younger speakers of Pacific Northwest English also show features of the [[Canadian Shift|Canadian/California Vowel Shift]], which move front vowels through a lowering of the tongue:
** {{IPA|/æ/}} is lowered toward almost {{IPA|[a]}}; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} toward almost {{IPA|[æ]}}; and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} toward almost {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. Therefore, among younger speakers, ''hick'' can sound like ''heck'', ''heck'' like ''hack'', and ''hack'' like ''hock''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
** {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is backed and sometimes rounded to become {{IPA|[ɒ]}}. Most Pacific Northwest speakers have undergone the [[Cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]]. A notable exception occurs with some speakers born before roughly the end of World War{{nbsp}}II.

These commonalities are shared with Canada and the North Central United States which includes the Minnesota accent.
* Traditional and older speakers may show certain [[vowel]]s, such as {{IPA|[oʊ]}} as in ''boat'' and {{IPA|[eɪ]}} as in ''bait'', with qualities much closer to [[monophthong]]s than [[diphthong]]s as in the rest of the country. 
* There are also conditional raising processes of open front vowels. These processes are often more extreme than in Canada and the North Central United States.
** Before the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, {{IPA|/æ/}} becomes {{IPA|[e]}}. This change makes for [[minimal pair]]s such as ''rang'' and ''rain'', both having the same vowel {{IPA|[e]}}, differing from ''rang'' {{IPA|[ræŋ]}} in other varieties of English.
** Among some speakers in Portland and southern Oregon, {{IPA|/æ/}} is sometimes raised and diphthongized to {{IPA|[eə]}} or {{IPA|[ɪə]}} before the nasal consonants {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. This is typical throughout the country.
** {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and, in the northern Pacific Northwest, {{IPA|/æ/}}, become {{IPA|[eɪ]}} before the [[voiced velar plosive]] {{IPA|/ɡ/}}: ''egg'' and ''leg'' are pronounced to rhyme with ''plague'' and ''vague'', a feature shared by many northern Midwestern dialects and with the [[Utah]] accent. In addition, sometimes bag will be pronounced ''bayg''.

===Commonalities with California===
* Back vowels of the California Shift: The Canadian/California Shift developing in Pacific Northwest English also includes these additional features only reminiscent of California English, but not Canadian English (especially among working-class young-adult females):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ward|2003|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The close central rounded vowel {{IPA|[ʉ]}} or close back unrounded vowel {{IPA|[ɯ]}} for {{IPA|/u/}}, is found in Portland and some areas of Southern Oregon, but is generally not found further north, where the vowel remains the close back rounded {{IPA|[u]}}.{{Dubious|date=August 2008}}&lt;!-- the chart suggests otherwise --&gt;
** In speakers born around the 1960s, there is a tendency to move the tongue forward in the first element of the diphthong {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}. This is reminiscent also of Midland, Mid-Atlantic, and Southern U.S. English.&lt;ref name="Conn"&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |last=Conn |first=Jeff |date=2002 |title=An investigation into the western dialect of Portland Oregon |others=Paper presented at [[New Ways of Analyzing Variation|NWAV]]&amp;nbsp;31, Stanford, California |url=http://www.pds.pdx.edu/Publications/NWAV31.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121011733/http://www.pds.pdx.edu/Publications/NWAV31.htm |archive-date=2015-11-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fronting does not appear before {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, for example, in the word ''home''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ward|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Absence of [[Canadian raising]]: For most speakers, both {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} remain lax before voiceless [[obstruent]]s, although some variation has been reported. This likens the Pacific Northwest accent with Californian accents, and contrasts it with Canadian and some other American dialects (such as [[Philadelphia English]]).

===Miscellaneous characteristics===
* Some speakers perceive or produce the pairs {{IPA|/ɛn/}} and {{IPA|/ɪn/}} close to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLabovAshBoberg2006|Labov, Ash, Boberg 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, resulting in a [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Pin–pen merger|merger between ''pen'' and ''pin'']], most notably in [[Eugene, Oregon]] and [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al. 2006. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consonant phonology is more conservative, as with other varieties of English.

==Words and phrases==
Pacific Northwest English adopted some words from [[Chinook Jargon]], as before the beginning of the 1900s essentially the entire population was at least slightly bilingual in the language.{{cn|date=August 2018}} There are also several terms of English origin that originated in or are distinct to the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Precarious work''' is a term that critics of [[globalization]] use to describe non-standard [[employment]] that is poorly paid, insecure, unprotected, and cannot support a household.&lt;ref name=FudgeOwens2006p3-28&gt;{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Fudge |first2=Rosemary |last2=Owens |chapter=Precarious work, women and the new economy: the challenge to legal norms |pages=3–28 |editor-first1=Judy |editor-last1=Fudge |editor-first2=Rosemary |editor-last2=Owens |year=2006 |title=Precarious work, women and the new economy: the challenge to legal norms |series=Onati International Series in Law and Society |publisher=Hart Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841136165}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, [[globalization]], the shift from the [[manufacturing sector]] to the [[service sector]], and the spread of [[information technology]] have created a new [[economy]] which demands flexibility in the workplace, resulting in the decline of the standard employment relationship, particularly for women.&lt;ref name=volsko2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing the Margins: Gender, Citizenship and the International Regulation of Precarious Employment|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2011|last=Volsko|first=Leah F.|isbn=9780191614521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kalleberg2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Arne L.

==Contrast with regular and temporary employment==

The term "precarious work" is frequently associated with the following types of employment: "[[part-time]] employment, [[self-employment]], fixed-term work, [[temporary work]], [[wikt:Special:Search/on call|on-call]] work, [[Homeworker|home-based workers]], and [[telecommuting]]."&lt;ref name=FudgeOwens2006p3-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaapw&gt;{{Cite journal | last = International Metalworkers' Federation | first = Central Committee 2007 | title = Global action against precarious work | journal = Metal World | issue = 1 | pages = 18–21 | publisher = Global Union Research Network - GURN | date = 2007 | url = http://www.industriall-union.org/sites/default/files/migration/imf/RelatedFiles/07032015092779/WEB_spotlight_0107-2.pdf | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140610010449/http://www.gurn.info/en/topics/precarious-work/trade-unions-and-precarious-work/imf-global-action-against-precarious-work/view | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2014-06-10 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} &lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and critics who use the term "precarious work" contrast it with the "standard employment relationship," which is the term they use to describe full-time, continuous employment where the employee works on their employer’s premises or under the employer's supervision, under an employment contract of indefinite duration, with standardized working hours/weeks and social benefits such as [[pensions]], [[unemployment]] benefits, and medical coverage.&lt;ref name=kalleberg2000&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bad jobs in America: Standard and nonstandard employment relations and job quality in the United States|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2000|volume=65|number=2|pages=256-278|last1=Kalleberg|first1=Arne L.|last2=Reskin|first2=Barbara F.|last3=Hudson|first3=Ken|doi=10.2307/2657440}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "standard employment relationship" emerged after [[World War II]], as men who completed their education would go on to work full-time for one employer their entire lives until their [[retirement]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref name=FudgeOwens2006p3-28/&gt; It did not typically describe women in the same time period, who would only work temporarily until they got married and had children, at which time they would withdraw from the workforce.&lt;ref name=volsko2011 /&gt;

[[Image:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|"[[We Can Do It!]]" US wartime poster (often mistaken for [[Rosie the Riveter]])]]

While many different kinds of [[part-time]] or limited-term jobs can be [[temporary work|temporary]], critics of [[globalization]] use the term "precarious" strictly to describe work that is uncertain, unpredictable, or offers little to no control over working hours or conditions.&lt;ref name=kalleberg2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=Precarious Work, Insecure Workers: Employment Relations in Transition|journal=American Sociological Review|last=Kalleberg|first=Arne L.|date=February 1, 2009|volume=74|number=1|pages=1-22|doi=10.1177/000312240907400101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conversation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/precarious-employment-is-rising-rapidly-among-men-new-research-94821|title=Precarious employment is rising rapidly among men: new research|date=April 12, 2018|author1-last=Cassells|author1-first=Rebecca|author2-last=Duncan|author2-first=Alan|author3-last=Mavisakalyan|author3-first=Astghik|author4-last=Phillimore|author4-first=John|author5-last=Tarverdi|author5-first=Yashar|work=The Conversation|access-date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization has been challenged by scholars focused on the [[autonomy|agency]] that [[temporary work]] affords individual workers.&lt;ref name=arthur2001 /&gt; However, many studies promoting individual [[autonomy|agency]] focus on highly-educated and skilled [[Knowledge worker|knowledge workers]], rather than all kinds of [[temporary work|temporary workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gurus, Hired Guns, and Warm Bodies: Itinerant Experts in a Knowledge Economy|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2011|last1=Barley|first1=Stephen R.|last2=Kunda|first2=Gideon|isbn=9781400841271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vallas2012 /&gt;

==Regulation==

While increased flexibility in the [[marketplace]] and in employment relationships has created new opportunities for regulation, regulation intended explicitly to remediate precarious work often produces mixed results.&lt;ref name=campbell2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Precarious work and precarious workers: Towards an improved conceptualisation|journal=The Economic and Labour Relations Review|last1=Campbell|first1=Iain|last2=Price|first2=Robin|date=September 1, 2016|volume=27|issue=3|pages=314-322|doi=10.1177/1035304616652074}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) has developed standards for atypical and precarious employment, including the 1994 Convention Concerning Part-time Work, the 1996 Convention Concerning Home Work, and the 1999 "Decent Work" initiative.&lt;ref name=vosko2006&gt;{{cite book |first1=Leah F. |last1=Vosko |chapter=Gender, precarious work, and the international labour code: the ghost in the ILO closet |pages=53–76 |editor-first1=Judy |editor-last1=Fudge |editor-first2=Rosemary |editor-last2=Owens |year=2006 |title=Precarious work, women and the new economy: the challenge to legal norms |series=Onati International Series in Law and Society |publisher=Hart Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841136165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in [[Kansas]] in 2009, members were present at several [[protests against Donald Trump]] and against the [[far-right politics in the United States|far right]] in 2017.

==Background==
Redneck Revolt was founded in 2009,&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=bridges/&gt;{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=119}} in part in response to the perceived contradictions of the [[Tea Party movement]],&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; as an offshoot of the '''John Brown Gun Club''', a firearms training and community defense project that was itself founded in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=bridges/&gt;{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=119}}{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=1}} Founding member Dave Strano was previously part of the Kansas Mutual Aid Network, which was involved in organizing [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity|protests against the Republican National Convention]] in 2004, in relation to which he and others began to train with firearms and engage in [[Second Amendment]] advocacy.{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=1}}&lt;ref name=green2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/they-hate-racists-they-love-assault-rifles-meet-redneck-revolt/Content?oid=13262567|title=They Hate Racists.

Following a hiatus the group was re-formed as a national organization in summer 2016,{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=119}}{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=1}} using both the Redneck Revolt and John Brown Gun Club names,&lt;ref name=bridges/&gt; with the intention of responding to the growth of [[right-wing populism]], particularly among rural, working-class white people.{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=1}}

The group attributes their use of the word "[[redneck]]" to the time of the [[Coal Wars]], a series of labor disputes in the United States occurring from around 1890 to around 1930, when the word became popular among coalminers.&lt;ref name=brinegar/&gt; The use of the term is also intended as a form of subversion or [[reappropriation]].&lt;ref name=green2/&gt; The group's name also refers to the 1921 [[Battle of Blair Mountain]],&lt;ref name=wyllie/&gt; and the red bandanas worn by members emulate those worn by striking coalminers during that conflict.&lt;ref name=lemons&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Lemons|title=Lemons: Lefties with Guns Ready to Rumble with Right-Wing Militias, Says Arizona Anarchist|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=April 5, 2017|accessdate=July 19, 2017|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/lefties-with-guns-ready-to-ruimble-with-right-wing-militias-says-arizona-anarchist-beth-payne-9221311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member has said that the group tries "to acknowledge the ways we've made mistakes and bought into [[white supremacy]] and [[capitalism]], but also give ourselves an environment in which it's OK to celebrate redneck culture".&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;

The group's website includes statements in opposition to capitalism, the [[nation state]], white supremacy and "the wars of the rich", and advocates a "right of militant resistance".&lt;ref name=lemons/&gt;&lt;ref name=ware/&gt; They advance a critique of white supremacy, which they describe as "a system of violence and power that ensures that political, economic, and social power is withheld from people who aren't white."{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=2}} They describe their purpose as to &lt;blockquote&gt;incite a movement amongst working people that works toward the total liberation of all working people, regardless of skin color, religious background, sexual orientation, gender, country of birth, or any other division that bosses and politicians have used to fragment movements for social, political, and economic freedom.{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=2}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The website also argues for the necessity of [[revolution]].&lt;ref name=ware/&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] John Brown Gun Club said in April 2017 that the group includes [[anarchist]]s, [[communist]]s, [[libertarian]]s and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref name=lemons/&gt;

The group does not identify itself as part of the [[political left]],&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; nor as politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; The geographer Levi van Sant has argued that the group's ideology is a form of [[libertarian socialism]].{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=2}} The group also do not consider themselves part of [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]]:&lt;ref name=shugerman/&gt; though their goals are similar, Redneck Revolt members do not cover their faces and seek to be "as upfront about who [they] are and what [they]'re doing as possible."{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=120}} Redneck Revolt does [[Leaderless resistance|not have leaders]],&lt;ref name=lemons/&gt; and does not offer a detailed blueprint for political action: a spokesperson said in June 2017 that "We don't have some grand plan for how we want to remake the world. We're tackling a specific problem, which is white supremacy, which we find to be built into capitalism".&lt;ref name=ware/&gt;

The group supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]]&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=maza/&gt; and runs firearms training events.&lt;ref name=pauly/&gt;&lt;ref name=ware/&gt; Members often view the practice of [[open carry|openly carrying]] guns as a political statement that intimidates opponents and affirms gun rights.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; In a May 2017 interview a member said the group uses guns only in self-defense and in "response to a rise in politically motivated violence and intimidation against vulnerable communities".&lt;ref name=hersh&gt;{{cite web|first=Joshua|last=Hersh|title=Extremism experts are starting to worry about the left|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=June 15, 2017|accessdate=July 18, 2017|url=https://news.vice.com/story/extremism-experts-are-starting-to-worry-about-the-left}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017 a member said "It's not about seizing the [[gun culture in the United States|gun culture]] or becoming obsessed about guns.

A member said in May 2017 that Redneck Revolt had reached out to groups such as the [[3 Percenters]], a predominantly right-wing group, with whom they have some common ground.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; The practice of openly carrying firearms, and a shared interest in guns, has led to dialogs with right-wing [[militia organizations in the United States|militias]].&lt;ref name=green2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wyllie/&gt; Van Sant wrote in March 2018 that "Through patient dialogue and popular education, several Redneck Revolt chapters have been able to challenge the [[white nationalist]] ideologies of these [[right-wing libertarian]] militias and flip them away from anti-immigrant and pro-capitalist positions."{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=2}}

The group argues that the white working-class have more in common with working-class [[people of color]] than with the wealthy.&lt;ref name=bridges/&gt; Dave Strano, a founding member, has argued that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of the white [[Working class in the United States|working class]] has been a history of being an exploited people. However, we've been an exploited people that further exploits other exploited people. While we've been living in tenements and slums for centuries, we've also been used by the rich to attack our neighbors, coworkers, and friends of different colors, religions and nationalities.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Redneck Revolt is a national network.&lt;ref name=lemons/&gt; Local groups use both the Redneck Revolt and John Brown Gun Club names.&lt;ref name=green2/&gt; There is no official count of the number of chapters,&lt;ref name=stein&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/the-lefts-answer-to-emboldened-white-supremacists-a-militia-of-their-own/Content?oid=7441640|title=The left's answer to emboldened white supremacists?

The group focuses on anti-racist organizing among white poor and working-class people,&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=pauly/&gt;&lt;ref name=ware/&gt; though members are not exclusively white:&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; around 30 percent are people of color.{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=120}} In May 2018, a member said that at least one third of the group's membership were women, people of color or [[non-binary]] people.&lt;ref name=wyllie/&gt; Speaking to Mark Bray, author of ''[[Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook]]'', one of Redneck Revolt's co-founders said the group's membership includes veterans, former Republicans, and former members of the 3 Percenters.{{sfn|Bray|2017|p=120}}

===2016–17===
During the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]] in 2016 Redneck Revolt published a pamphlet addressed to members of right-wing militias that argued there was no reason why "the white working-class … [should] find solidarity with rich white ranch owners against the government, but not working-class people of color defending their own land and community."&lt;ref name=vansant/&gt;

The [[Phoenix, Arizona]] chapter of Redneck Revolt openly carried firearms outside of the [[Arizona State Legislature]] on the day of the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]] in January 2017. They declared support for those opposing Trump, including immigrants, [[LGBTQ]] people and Muslims.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

At the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on August 11 and 12, 2017, several Redneck Revolt chapters provided armed security and medical assistance for counterprotesters.&lt;ref name=bridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=green2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wyllie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/right-to-carry-laws-are-making-violent-protests-like-charlottesville-even-harder-to-defuse/|title=Right-to-Carry Laws Are Making Violent Protests like Charlottesville Even Harder to Defuse|date=August 16, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|first=Becca|last=Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-dispatch.com/news/20170815/local-resident-recounts-charlottesville|title=Local resident recounts Charlottesville|date=August 15, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017|work=[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]]|first=Ben|last=Coley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/who-were-the-counterprotesters-in-charlottesville.html |title=Who Were the Counterprotesters in Charlottesville? |author=Farah Stockman |date=August 14, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theroot.com/the-caucasian-panthers-meet-the-rednecks-armed-ready-1821943540|title=The Caucasian Panthers: Meet the Rednecks Armed, Ready and 'Bout That Anti-Racist Life|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=August 17, 2018|work=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|first=Michael|last=Harriot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dwyer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/06/12/charlottesville-protest-alt-right-anti-fascist/|title='Alt-right' and anti-fascists unite against lawsuit designed to prevent another Charlottesville|date=June 12, 2018|accessdate=August 21, 2018|work=[[The Intercept]]|first=Johnny|last=Dwyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, members provided security at a "Hate Is Not Welcome in Lane County" march in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in response to the events in Charlottesville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/35862712-75/hundreds-in-eugene-march-against-hate-amid-national-outcry-over-neo-nazi-rally-in-virginia.html.csp|title=Hundreds in Eugene march against hate amid national outcry over neo-Nazi rally in Virginia|date=August 15, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017|work=[[The Register-Guard]]|first=Rachel|last=Rippetoe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/20170817/news-features/setting-terms-after-charlottesville|title=Setting the Terms after Charlottesville|date=August 17, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017|work=[[Eugene Weekly]]|first=Carl|last=Segerstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Redneck Revolt was one of a number of groups named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on behalf of the city of Charlottesville and several Charlottesville-based businesses and [[neighborhood association]]s, which sought to prevent prohibit militia and [[paramilitary]] activity in Virginia.&lt;ref name=green2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-ville.com/militia/|title=Militia madness: City files suit against August 12 participants|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017|work=C-VILLE Weekly|first=Samantha|last=Baars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/new-suits-filed-against-aug-rally-organizers/article_3053319a-af09-11e7-8f08-cf9467939c45.html|title=New suits filed against Aug. 12 rally organizers|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017|work=[[The Daily Progress]]|first=Chris|last=Suarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/league-south-banned-charlottesville-fallout-180327110755551.html|title=League of the South: No more armed rallies in Charlottesville|date=March 27, 2018|accessdate=August 17, 2018|work=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arria&gt;{{cite web|url=https://truthout.org/articles/why-is-charlottesville-suing-two-anti-racist-groups-over-last-years-violent-unite-the-right-rally/|title=Why Is Charlottesville Suing Two Anti-Racist Groups Over Last Year's Violent 'Unite the Right' Rally?|date=April 29, 2018|accessdate=August 18, 2018|work=[[Truthout]]|first=Michael|last=Arria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups and individuals named as defendants, which also included the white supremacist activist [[Jason Kessler]], were accused of unlawful paramilitary activity, falsely assuming the role of law enforcement officers, and being a [[public nuisance]].&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt; The lawsuit identified Redneck Revolt and the Socialist Rifle Association, an anti-fascist group that defends working-class people's right to bear arms, as "private militia groups ... [that] helped create and secure a staging area for counter-protestors."&lt;ref name=arria/&gt; Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor who played a leading role in the lawsuit, described the decision to include Redneck Revolt among the defendants as "painful" and said "This case was not conceived of because of Redneck Revolt, that's for sure. They fit the description, so it was pretty hard not to include them".&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt; In June 2018, a group of members of clergy asked the city and the other plaintiffs to remove Redneck Revolt from the complaint.&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=suarez&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/city/kessler-planning-anniversary-rallies-in-city-d-c/article_5039da00-6b7d-11e8-8545-3ff6606d0fa0.html|title=Kessler planning anniversary rallies in city, D.C.|date=June 8, 2018|accessdate=August 19, 2018|work=[[The Daily Progress]]|first=Chris|last=Suarez}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that "There is a marked difference between the armed white supremacist groups who invaded Charlottesville with the intent to do harm and the armed anti-racist groups who came to Charlottesville to assist in supporting and protecting our most marginalized communities."&lt;ref name=suarez/&gt; A lead attorney for the plaintiffs responded that "The basis for this lawsuit is not about motives – it's about engaging in paramilitary activity. That's why Redneck Revolt was named as a defendant, and why they remain in the suit."&lt;ref name=suarez/&gt; Redneck Revolt and Kessler signed [[consent decree]]s to end paramilitary activity in Charlottesville to resolve the lawsuit when they were left as the only defendants in early July 2018.&lt;ref name="DailyProgress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://triad-city-beat.com/jason-kessler-redneck-revolt-settle-lawsuit-with-charlottesville/|title=Jason Kessler, Redneck Revolt settle lawsuit with Charlottesville|date=July 12, 2018|accessdate=August 21, 2018|work=Triad City Beat|first=Jordan|last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consent decree prohibits members from returning to Charlottesville "as part of a unit of two or more persons acting in concert while armed with a firearm, weapon, shield or any item whose purpose is to inflict bodily harm, at any demonstration, rally, protest or march."&lt;ref name=DailyProgress/&gt; Redneck Revolt issued a statement saying that it had chosen to end the lawsuit and to "focus our energies on the many important fights ahead."&lt;ref name=DailyProgress/&gt;

==Significance==
The historian [[Noel Ignatiev]], in September 2017, expressed concern regarding Redneck Revolt's commitment to "defense of our communities". Ignatiev argued that "in this society those who share our material conditions, our neighbors, our family members, our friends, the people working alongside us, usually reflect which race they (and we) are assigned to", and contended that "The goal is not to defend the white community but to abolish it, and along with it all communities defined by racial preference or oppression." He also criticised the group for failing to challenge "institutions that reproduce white supremacy—neither the criminal justice system, nor the schools, nor employment discrimination, nor real estate lending and renting policies", and concluded that "white people organized as whites are dangerous to the working class and to humanity, and white people with guns organized as whites are doubly so—and this is true regardless of the intentions of the organizers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hardcrackers.com/rainbow-coalition-class-war/|title=Rainbow Coalition or Class War?|date=September 15, 2017|accessdate=August 21, 2018|work=Hard Crackers: Chronicles of Everyday Life|first=Noel|last=Ignatiev|authorlink=Noel Ignatiev}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Kuhn]] responded to Ignatiev in a 2018 article. Kuhn argued that "organizations with the aim to primarily mobilize and organize among the white working class ... are mandatory if we don't want to simply abandon this part of the population and hand it to the right on a silver platter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2036210213|first=Gabriel|last=Kuhn|authorlink=Gabriel Kuhn|title=New Classes for a New Class Politics: An Appreciation of David Gilbert's Looking at the U.S. White Working Class Historically|journal=Turning the Tide|volume=30|issue=2|year=2018|page=6|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer Levi van Sant argued in March 2018 that &lt;blockquote&gt;the Redneck Revolt model of [[Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Socialism]] reveals important things, and should be an important part of the [[American Left|U.S. Left]]. Of particular importance is their [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] effort to read for the 'good sense in the common sense' of [[right-wing populism]] through radical and [[grassroots]] engagement.{{sfn|Van Sant|2018|p=3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Van Sant has also identified three lessons that Redneck Revolt offers to the American left: that working-class white people "are not inherently conservative"; that the group's success is drawn from their critique of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], including on firearms issues; and that they do not employ the rhetoric of [[white privilege]], diversity or inclusion, but instead "position themselves as part of working class and white rural communities" and "act in solidarity with oppressed peoples."&lt;ref name=vansant/&gt; Van Sant concluded that "The case of Redneck Revolt suggests there are promising alternatives to Trumpism emanating from the U.S. countryside too often ignored by the U.S. left."&lt;ref name=vansant/&gt;

'''Robert William Fisher''' (born April 13, 1961) is an American [[fugitive]] wanted for the murder of his wife and two children, and blowing up the house in which they lived in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] on April 10, 2001. He was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|475th fugitive to be placed]] on the list of [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] on June 29, 2002.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel02/fisher.htm |title=FBI Press Release |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=June 29, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411084825/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel02/fisher.htm|archivedate=April 11, 2010|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Robert William Fisher was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York&lt;ref name="pressrelease"/&gt; in 1961 to William Fisher, a banker, and Jan Howell. He has two sisters and attended [[Sahuaro High School]] in [[Tucson]], Arizona. His parents [[divorce]]d in 1976, when he was 15. According to friends and relatives, the divorce was extremely difficult, leaving long-lasting effects on Fisher. He spoke of it with coworkers at [[Mayo Clinic]] Hospital, and confided to one associate that his life could have been different if his mother had not left the family.&lt;ref name="motive"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nena |last=Baker |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0618fisher18.html |title=Slayings likely rooted in marital strife, divorce fears |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=June 18, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==

Fisher, a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] veteran, married Mary Cooper in 1987.&lt;ref name="mounties"&gt;{{cite web |first=Emily |last=Bittner |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0206fisher06.html |title=Mounties got their man, but he isn't Fisher |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=February 6, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has worked as a surgical [[catheter]] technician, [[respiratory therapist]], and [[firefighter]], and is an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and fisherman.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"/&gt; Fisher was described as a cruel and distant [[control freak]] of a father who was awkward with his children,&lt;ref name="suspect"&gt;{{cite web |first=Zoellner |last=Tom |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0807FISHER07.html |title=Report portrays suspect in family killing as cruel, controlling |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=August 7, 2002 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but tried to hold on to an image as a devoted family man.&lt;ref name="motive"/&gt; His mother-in-law, Ginny Cooper, told investigators that, "Fisher didn't socialize often with family because of a fear of getting too close to people and losing them."&lt;ref name="homicide"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Zoellner |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0414firefolo14.html |title=Family in blaze slashed, shot |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=April 14, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher's mother told investigators that she had been a "yes-sir" wife who didn't stand up to her husband. She added that she saw similar dynamics early in her son's marriage to Mary, and had talked to her about her concerns. One close friend of Fisher stated that his family resembled his childhood family.&lt;ref name="motive"/&gt;

=== Marital troubles ===
Fisher had been an active member of the Scottsdale Baptist Church's men's ministry, but unlike Mary, he had begun to withdraw from its activities a few months prior to the murders.&lt;ref name="homicide"/&gt; In 1998, the Fishers went to their church's senior pastor for [[Relationship counseling|marital counseling]]. Fisher told coworkers about a [[Infidelity|one-night affair]] with a prostitute he met in a [[massage parlor]]. He fretted that Mary would find out that it was the cause of a [[urinary tract infection]] that left him ill for several days in December 2000.&lt;ref name="motive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt;

Fisher told a hunting mate that he was renewing his commitment to his faith and marriage because he "could not live without his family", possibly hinting that he would consider [[suicide]] over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is not unusual for an individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent.&lt;ref name="motive"/&gt; In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends that she was going to divorce Fisher.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt; A neighbor reported hearing a loud argument on April 9, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before their house blew up in an explosion.&lt;ref name="homicide"/&gt;

== Triple murder and arson ==
On the morning of April 10, 2001, Mary was [[Ballistic trauma|shot]] in the back of the head and her children's throats were slashed from ear to ear in the hours before their house exploded at 8:42am.&lt;ref name="homicide"/&gt; Firefighters were immediately alerted to the explosion, which was strong enough to collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for a half-mile (800 m) in all directions.&lt;ref name="arson"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Zoellner |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0410fire-ON.html |title=3 dead as explosion, fire destroy Scottsdale home |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=April 10, 2001 |accessdate=2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefighters kept the {{convert|20|ft|m|0|adj=on}}-high blaze from spreading to other homes. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.&lt;ref name="arson"/&gt;

The gas line from the back of the house's [[furnace]] had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal evidence of the homicide. The accumulating gas was [[gas explosion|later ignited]] by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate ten hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. The burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed&lt;ref name="homicide"/&gt; in the remains of the burnt out house.&lt;ref name="arson"/&gt; They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10).&lt;ref name="homicide"/&gt; Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he did as a child.&lt;ref name="suspect"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
Fisher, who disappeared at the time of the murders, was named as an official (and to date, only) suspect in the case on April 14, 2001, when [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]] officers were instructed in a statewide [[wikt:bulletin|bulletin]] to arrest him. On April 20, the last physical evidence of Fisher's whereabouts surfaced, when police found Mary's [[Toyota 4Runner]] and their dog, Blue, in [[Tonto National Forest]], near the town of [[Young, Arizona]], a hundred miles north of Scottsdale.&lt;ref name="mostwanted"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsey |last=Collom |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0630Fisher30.html |title=Fisher added to FBI list of most wanted |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=June 30, 2002 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ktar.com/story/1006656/fbi-to-show-new-images-of-arizona-most-wanted-fugitive-robert-william-fisher/?&lt;/ref&gt; Although police searched the area around where the car was found, it has been alleged that they did not search the nearby network of caves sufficiently. Several professional cavers have suggested that Fisher used these as a hiding place, before either escaping, killing himself or dying from low oxygen levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azfamily.com/story/16004301/5-investigates-team-goes-underground-in-search-for-robert-fisher&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, a state arrest warrant was issued in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], charging Fisher with three counts of [[first-degree murder]] and one count of [[arson]]. Subsequently, he was declared a [[fugitive]], and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona]], charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"/&gt; On June 29, 2002, Fisher was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|475th fugitive to be placed]] on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]]. He was also on the ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' "Dirty Dozen" list of the show's most notorious fugitives, and was profiled on ''[[The Hunt with John Walsh]]''. The FBI offers a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his capture.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"/&gt; {{as of|2003|April}}, FBI had received "hundreds and hundreds of leads."&lt;ref name="fugitive"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dennis |last=Wagner |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special22/articles/0411fisher11z8-CP.html |title=FBI still hunting for Fisher |publisher=''The Arizona Republic'' |date=April 11, 2003 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all reported sightings of Fisher have been inconclusive or false.&lt;ref name="mounties"/&gt;

In February 2004, an individual with a striking physical resemblance to Fisher was arrested in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. [[Fingerprints]] eventually confirmed that he was not Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him.&lt;ref name="mounties"/&gt; The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in [[Gila County, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20130409hunt-for-robert-fisher-continues-scottsdale.html|title=12 years later, hunt for Scottsdale murder suspect Robert Fisher continues|work=azcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, police raided a house in [[Colorado]] after receiving a tip that Fisher was hiding there. Despite arresting two occupants, they did not find any sign of Fisher.&lt;ref&gt;http://kdvr.com/2014/10/11/two-arrested-as-police-raid-home-in-search-of-murder-suspect/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Laos]], society is characterized by semiindependent rural villages engaged in [[subsistence]] agricultural production. Ethnic, geographic, and ecological differences create variations in the pattern of village life from one part of the country to another, but the common threads of village selfreliance, limited regional trade and communication, and identification with one's village and ethnic group persist regardless of the setting. Rural trade networks, however, have been a part of life since the 1950s. Except near the larger towns and in the rich agricultural plains of [[Vientiane]] and [[Savannakhét]], villages are spaced at least several kilometers apart and the intervening land variously developed as [[rice]] paddy and [[swidden]] fields or maintained as buffer forest for gathering wild plants and animals, fuelwood, and occasional timber harvest.

Ethnicity differentiates the villages but is usually not a source of conflict or antagonism. Nearly all villages are ethnically homogeneous, although a few include two or more distinct groups. Ethnic mixing often has resulted from different groups migrating to a new settlement site at about the same time, or a larger village at a crossroads or river transit point developing into a minor trading center. Ethnic identity is never absolutely immutable. Some minority Laotian individuals have adopted lowland Lao behavior and dress patterns, or intermarried with lowland Lao, and have effectively acculturated to lowland society. In some units, military service has also brought together Laotians of different ethnic groups, both before and after 1975.

Only since 1975 has there been any sense of national unity among most rural villagers. Precolonial governments depended more on a system of control at the district level with the chao muang (district chief) maintaining his own allegiance and tribute to the state. Administrative practices under the French and during the post-[[World War II]] period was confined primarily to provincial and a few district centers. The government was able to extract taxes with some facility but had little impact on the daily lives or thoughts of most villagers. However, since 1975, the government has expended considerable energy and resources on national unification, so that even isolated villages recognize the role of local government and consider themselves at some level to be part of a Laotian state.

The population of '''Russians in Estonia''' is estimated at 320,000, most of whom live in the urban areas of [[Harju County|Harju]] and [[Ida-Viru County|Ida-Viru counties]]. [[Estonia]] has a 300-year old history of small-scale settlement by Russian [[Old Believers]] along [[Lake Peipus]].

== Early contacts ==
The Estonian name for Russians ''vene'', ''venelane'' derives from an old Germanic loan ''veneð'' referring to the [[Wends]], speakers of a Slavic language who lived on the southern coast of the [[Baltic sea]].{{r|Campbell2004}}{{r|Bojtar1999}}

Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]] of [[Kievan Rus']] defeated [[Chud]]s in 1030 and established fort of Yuryev (in modern day [[Tartu]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tvauri|first1=Andres|title=The Migration Period, Pre-Viking Age, and Viking Age in Estonia|date=2012|pages=33, 59, 60|url=https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Publications/Display/b80b6f11-43ed-4b8c-b616-48ac53b70ec5?language=ENG|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which survived until 1061 when the Kievans were driven out by the tribe of Sosols.{{r|Miljan}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mäesalu|first1=Ain|title=Could Kedipiv in East-Slavonic Chronicles be Keava hill fort?|journal=Estonian Journal of Archaeology|date=2012|volume=1|page=199|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/Archaeology/2012/sup_vol_1/arhe-keava-2012-195-200.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval proto-Russian settlement was in Kuremäe, [[Vironia]]. The Orthodox community in the area built a church in the 16th century and in 1891 the [[Pühtitsa Convent]] was created on its site.{{r|PDC}} Proto-Russian cultural influence had its mark on Estonian language, with a number of words such as "turg" (trade)&lt;!--, "raamat" - highly unlikely -- compare Finnish "raamattu"(record)--&gt; and "rist" (cross) adopted from [[East Slavic language|East Slavic]].{{r|ReferenceA}}

In 1217, an allied Ugaunian-Novgorodian army defended the Ugaunian stronghold of [[Otepää]] from the German knights. Novgorodian prince [[Vyachko]] died in 1224 with all his [[druzhina]] [[Siege of Tartu (1224)|defending the fortress]] of [[Tarbatu]] together with his Ugaunian and [[Sakala County|Sackalian]] allies against the [[Livonian Order]] led by [[Albert of Riga]]. 
    
Orthodox churches and small communities of proto-Russian merchants and craftsmen remained in Livonian towns as did close trade links with the Novgorod Republic and the [[Pskov]] and [[Polotsk]] principalities. In 1481, [[Ivan III of Russia]] laid siege to the castle of [[Fellin]] (Viljandi) and briefly captured several towns in eastern Livonia in response to a previous attack on Pskov. Between 1558 and 1582, [[Ivan IV of Russia]] captured much of mainland Livonia in the midst of the [[Livonian War]] but eventually the Russians were driven out by [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Lithuanian-Polish]] and Swedish armies. Tsar [[Alexis I of Russia]] once again captured towns in eastern Livonia, including [[Dorpat]] (Tartu) and Nyslott (Vasknarva) between 1656 and 1661, but had to yield his conquests to [[Sweden]].

== 17th century to 1940 ==
[[File:Saare küla Piirissaar.JPG|thumb|A Russian Old Believer village with a church on [[Piirissaar]]]]
The beginning of continuous Russian settlement in what is now Estonia dates back to the late 17th century when several thousand Russian Old Believers, escaping religious persecution in Russia, settled in areas then a part of the [[Swedish empire]] near the western coast of [[Lake Peipus]].{{r|Frucht2005}}

In the 18th century after the [[Great Northern War]] the territories of Estonia divided between the [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] became part of the [[Russian Empire]] but maintained local autonomy and were administered independently by the local [[Baltic German]] nobility through a feudal Regional Council ({{lang-de|Landtag}}).{{r|Smith2005}} The second period of influx of Russians followed the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] conquest of the northern Baltic region, including Estonia, from Sweden in 1700–1721. Under Russian rule, power in the region remained primarily in the hands of the [[Baltic German]] nobility, but a limited number of administrative jobs was gradually taken over by Russians, who settled in Reval (Tallinn) and other major towns.

A relatively larger number of ethnic Russian workers settled in Tallinn and Narva during the period of rapid industrial development at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. After the [[First World War]], the share of ethnic Russians in the population of independent Estonia was 7.3%.{{r|Miksike}} About half of these were indigenous Russians living in [[Narva]], [[Ivangorod]], the [[Ingria#Estonian Ingria|Estonian Ingria]] and the [[Petseri County]], which were added to Estonia territory according to the 1920 Peace [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], but were transferred (without Narva) to the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1944.

In the aftermath of World War I Estonia became an independent republic where the Russians, comprising 8% of the total population among other ethnic minorities, established Cultural Self-Governments according to the 1925 [[Estonian Law on Cultural Autonomy]].{{r|Suksi1998}} The state was tolerant of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and became a home to many Russian émigrés after the Russian [[October Revolution]] in 1917.{{r|NYT081206}}

== World War II and the Estonian SSR ==
[[File:Baltic states borders.jpg|thumb|The majority of the pre-war Russian population in Estonia lived in border areas that were annexed by the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1944.]]
After the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union]] in 1940,{{r|Malksoo}}{{r|Chern2004}} repression of ethnic Estonians followed. According to Sergei Isakov, almost all societies, newspapers, organizations of ethnic Estonians were closed in 1940 and their activists persecuted.{{r|Isakov2005-21}} The country remained [[Estonian SSR|annexed]] to the Soviet Union until 1991, except for the period of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] occupation between 1941 and 1944. During the era of Soviet occupation, the Soviet government maintained a program of replacing the indigenous Estonians with immigrants from the Soviet Union. In the course of violent [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfers]], thousands of [[Soviet deportations from Estonia|Estonian citizens were deported]] to the interior parts of Russia (mostly [[Siberia]]), and huge numbers of Russian-speaking Soviet citizens were encouraged to settle in Estonia. In the [[Ida-Viru County|Ida-Viru]] and [[Harju County|Harju Counties]], cities such as [[Paldiski]], [[Sillamäe]], and [[Narva]] were ethnically cleansed and the indigenous Estonian population was totally replaced by Russian colonists. As a result of Soviet occupation, the Russian population in Estonia grew from about 23,000 people in 1945 to 475,000 in 1991, and the total Slavic population to 551,000, constituting 35% of the total population at its peak.{{r|Chinn1996}}

In 1939 ethnic Russians had comprised 8% of the population; however, following the annexation of about {{convert|2000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of land by the [[Russian SFSR]] in January 1945, including [[Ivangorod]] (then the eastern suburb of Narva) and the Petseri County, Estonia lost most of its inter-war ethnic Russian population. Of the estimated 20,000 Russians remaining in Estonia, the majority belonged to the historical community of [[Old Believers]].{{r|Smith2001}}

Most of the present-day Russians in Estonia are recent migrants and their descendants who settled in during the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia|Soviet occupation]] between 1945 and 1991. Following the terms of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union occupied and annexed the Baltic States in 1940. The authorities carried out repressions against many prominent ethnic Russians activists and [[White emigres]] in Estonia.{{r|Isakov2005-394}} Many Russians were arrested and executed by different Soviet war tribunals in 1940–1941.{{r|EICICAH}} After [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Baltics quickly fell under German control. Many Russians, especially Communist party members who had arrived in the area with the initial occupation and annexation, retreated; those who fell into the German hands were treated harshly, many were executed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

After the war, Narva's inhabitants previously evacuated by the Germans were for the most part not permitted to return and were replaced by refugees and workers administratively mobilized from western Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.{{r|Batt2002}} By 1989, ethnic Russians made up 30.3% of the population in Estonia.{{r|EstEu}}

During the [[Singing Revolution]], the [[Intermovement]], International Movement of the Workers of the ESSR, organised the indigenous Russian resistance to the independence movement and purported to represent the ethnic Russians and other Russophones in Estonia.{{r|Bunce2005}}

==In independent Estonia (1990–present)==
Today most Russians live in Tallinn and the major northeastern cities of Narva, Kohtla-Järve, [[Jõhvi]], and [[Sillamäe]]. The rural areas are populated almost entirely by ethnic Estonians, except for [[Lake Peipus]] coast, which has a long history of [[Old Believers]] communities. In 2011, [[University of Tartu]] sociology professor [[Marju Lauristin]] found that 21% were successfully integrated, 28% showed partial integration, and 51% were unintegrated or little integrated.{{r|WAJ1407}}

There are efforts by the Estonian government to improve its tie with the Russian community with Prime Minister Ratas learning Russian to better communicate with them.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baltics-russia/wary-of-divided-loyalties-a-baltic-state-reaches-out-to-its-russians-idUSKBN1630W2&lt;/ref&gt; The younger generation is better integrated with the rest of the country such as joining the military via conscription and improve their Estonian language skills.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Citizenship===
The restored republic recognised citizenship only for the pre-occupation citizens or descendants from such (including the long-term Russian settlers from earlier influxes, such as Lake Peipus coast and the 10,000 residents of the Petseri County){{r|BT080521}}, rather than to grant Estonian nationality to all Estonian-resident Soviet citizens. The Citizenship Act provides the following requirements for naturalisation of those people who had arrived in the country after 1940,{{r|Luwdik1996}} the majority of whom were ethnic Russians: knowledge of the Estonian language, Constitution and a pledge of loyalty to Estonia.{{r|LO-CAE}} The government offers free preparation courses for the examination on the Constitution and the Citizenship Act, and reimburses up to 380 euros for language studies.{{r|20083010EE}}

Under the law, residents without citizenship may not elect the [[Riigikogu]] (the national parliament) nor the [[European Parliament]], but are eligible to vote in the municipal elections.{{r|FIWR}} As of 2 July 2010, 84.1% of Estonian residents are Estonian citizens, 8.6% are citizens of other countries (mainly [[Russia]]) and 7.3% are "citizens with undetermined citizenship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/society/citizenship.html|title=Citizenship|publisher=Estonia.eu|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827195243/http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/society/citizenship.html|archivedate=27 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 2007 about 147,000 people acquired Estonian or Russian citizenship, or left the country, bringing the proportion of stateless residents from 32% down to about 8 percent.{{r|FIWR}} According to [[Amnesty International]]'s 2015 report, approximately 6.8% of Estonia's population are not citizens of the country.{{r|ERR150226}}

In late 2014 an amendment to the law was proposed that would give Estonian citizenship to children of non-citizen parents who have resided in Estonia for at least five years.{{r|Uudised141112}}

===Language requirements===
The perceived difficulty of the language tests became a point of international contention, as the government of the [[Russian Federation]] and a number of human rights organizations{{specify|date=September 2018}} objected on the grounds that they made it hard for many Russians who had not learned the language to gain the citizenship in the short term.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} As a result, the tests were altered somewhat, due to which the number of stateless persons steadily decreased. According to Estonian officials, in 1992, 32% of residents lacked any form of citizenship. In May 2009, the Population register reported that 7.6% of residents have [[undefined citizenship]] and 8.4% have foreign citizenship, mostly Russian.{{r|VM-citiz}} As the Russian Federation was recognized as the [[successor state]] to the Soviet Union, all former USSR citizens qualified for natural-born citizenship of Russia, available upon mere request, as provided by the law "On the RSFSR Citizenship" in force up to the end of 2000.{{r|EAH-Gradir}}

The '''Scottish people''' ([[Scots language|Scots]]: ''Scots Fowk''; [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Albannaich'') or '''Scots''', are a [[nation]] and [[ethnic group]] native to [[Scotland]]. Historically, they emerged from an amalgamation of two [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-speaking peoples, the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (or ''[[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]]'') in the 9th century. Later, the neighbouring Celtic-speaking [[Britons (historical)|Cumbrians]], as well as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], were incorporated into the Scottish nation.

In modern usage, "Scottish people" or "Scots" is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland. The [[Latin]] word ''[[Scoti]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bede used a Latin form of the word Scots as the name of the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]].{{Cite book

People of Scottish descent live in many countries other than Scotland. Emigration, influenced by factors such as the [[Highland Clearances|Highland]] and [[Lowland Clearances]], Scottish participation in the [[British Empire]], and latterly [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and unemployment, have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world. Scottish emigrants took with them their [[Scottish languages]] and [[Scottish culture|culture]]. Large populations of Scottish people settled the new-world lands of [[North America|North]] and South America, Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Canada has the highest level of Scottish descendants per capita in the world and the second-largest population of Scottish descendants, after the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

Scotland has seen migration and settlement of many peoples at different periods in [[History of Scotland|its history]]. The Gaels, the Picts and the Britons have their respective origin myths, like most medieval European peoples. [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxons, arrived beginning in the 7th century, while the Norse settled parts of Scotland from the 8th century onwards. In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], from the reign of [[David I of Scotland]], there was some emigration from France, England and the [[Low Countries]] to Scotland. Some famous Scottish family names, including those bearing the names which became [[Bruce]], [[House of Balliol|Balliol]], [[Murray (surname)|Murray]] and [[Stewart (name)|Stewart]] came to Scotland at this time. Today Scotland is [[Countries of the United Kingdom|one of the countries]] of the United Kingdom, and the majority of people living there are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

==Ethnic groups of Scotland==
{{Further|Genetic history of the British Isles|Prehistoric Scotland|Scandinavian Scotland}}
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Scotland saw several ethnic or cultural groups mentioned in contemporary sources, namely the [[Picts]], the [[Gaels]], the [[Brythons|Britons]], and the [[Angles]], with the latter settling in the southeast of the country. Culturally, these peoples are grouped according to language. Most of Scotland until the 13th century spoke [[Celtic languages]] and these included, at least initially, the [[Brythons|Britons]], as well as the [[Gaels]] and the [[Picts]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, "The Language of the Picts", discussed by Forsyth, ''Language in Pictland''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanic peoples]] included the Angles of [[Northumbria]], who settled in south-eastern Scotland in the region between the [[Firth of Forth]] to the north and the [[River Tweed]] to the south. They also occupied the south-west of Scotland up to and including the Plain of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] and their language, [[Old English]], was the earliest form of the language which eventually became known as [[Scots language|Scots]].

Use of the Gaelic language spread throughout nearly the whole of Scotland by the 9th century,&lt;ref name="bord-na-gaidhlig1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Thomas Owen|author-link=Thomas Owen Clancy|url=http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|title=Gaelic Scotland: a brief history|publisher=bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=21 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232223/http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|archivedate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a peak in the 11th to 13th centuries, but was never the language of the south-east of the country.&lt;ref name="bord-na-gaidhlig1"/&gt; [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] 
divided the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] between Scotland and England; at least, most medieval historians now accept the 'gift' by Edgar, in any case, after the later [[Battle of Carham]] the Scottish kingdom encompassed many English people, with even more quite possibly arriving after the [[Norman invasion of England]] in 1066. South-east of the [[Firth of Forth]], then in [[Lothian]] and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] ([[Old English language|OE:]] ''Loðene''), a northern variety of [[Old English language|Old English]], also known as [[Early Scots]], was spoken.

[[File:St-Kildans.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kildans]] sitting on the village street, 1886]]
As a result of [[David I of Scotland|David I, King of Scots']] return from exile in England in 1113, ultimately to assume the throne in 1124 with the help of [[Normans|Norman]] military force, David invited Norman families from France and England to settle in lands he granted them to spread a ruling class loyal to him.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, "The Balance of New and Old", p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Davidian Revolution]], as many historians call it, brought a European style of [[feudalism]] to Scotland along with an influx of people of Norman descent - by invitation, unlike [[Norman conquest of England|England]] where it was by conquest. To this day, many of the [[Scottish surnames|common family names of Scotland]] can trace ancestry to Normans from this period, such as the [[Stewart (name)|Stewarts]], the [[Bruce]]s, the [[Hamilton (surname and title)|Hamiltons]], the [[Clan Wallace#Origins of the clan|Wallaces]], the [[Melville (name)|Melvilles]], some [[Clan Broun|Browns]] and many others.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Northern Isles]] and some parts of [[Caithness]] were [[Norn language|Norn]]-speaking (the west of Caithness was Gaelic-speaking into the 20th century, as were some small communities in parts of the Central Highlands). From 1200 to 1500 the [[Early Scots]] language spread across the lowland parts of Scotland between [[Galloway]] and the Highland line, being used by [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] in his historical epic ''[[The Brus]]'' in the late 14th century in Aberdeen.

From 1500 on, Scotland was commonly divided by language into two groups of people, [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic-speaking]] "[[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]]s" (the language formerly called Scottis by English speakers and known by many Lowlanders in the 18th century as "Irish") and the [[Early Scots|Inglis]]-speaking "[[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlander]]s" (a language later to be called [[Scots language|Scots]]). Today, immigrants have brought other languages, but almost every adult throughout Scotland is fluent in the English language.

===Canada===
{{main|Scottish Canadians}}
As the third-largest [[ethnic group]] in Canada and amongst the first Europeans to settle in the country, Scottish people have made a large impact on [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] since colonial times. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Canada]], the number of Canadians claiming full or partial Scottish descent is 4,714,970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000#archived|title=Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories - 20% sample data|work=Statistics Canada|date=6 October 2010|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 15.10% of the nation's total population.

Many respondents may have misunderstood the question and the numerous responses for "Canadian" does not give an accurate figure for numerous groups, particularly those of British Isles origins. Scottish-Canadians are the 3rd biggest ethnic group in Canada. Scottish culture has particularly thrived in the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]] ([[Latin]] for "New Scotland"). There, in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], where both lowland and highland Scots settled in large numbers, [[Canadian Gaelic]] is still spoken by a small number of residents. Cape Breton is the home of the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]]. [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] in present-day [[Eastern Ontario]] is a historic county that was set up as a settlement for [[Scottish Highlands|Highland Scots]], where many from the Highlands settled to preserve their culture in result of the Highland Clearances. Gaelic was the native language of the community since its settlement in the 18th century although the number of speakers decreased since as a result of English migration{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. As of the modern 21st century, there are still a few Gaelic speakers in the community.

===Australia===
{{main|Scottish Australians}}
[[File:Thomasbrisbane.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|The Australian city of [[Brisbane]] is named after Scotsman [[Thomas Brisbane]].]]
By 1830, 15.11% of the colonies' total population were Scots, which increased by the middle of the century to 25,000, or 20-25% of the total population. The [[Australian Gold Rush]] of the 1850s provided a further impetus for Scottish migration: in the 1850s 90,000 Scots immigrated to Australia, far more than other British or Irish populations at the time.&lt;ref name="The Australian People 2001 p650"&gt;The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins. (2001) James Jupp p650 Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy rates of the Scottish immigrants ran at 90-95%. By 1860, Scots made up 50% of the ethnic composition of [[Western Victoria]], [[Adelaide]], [[Penola, South Australia|Penola]] and [[Naracoorte, South Australia|Naracoorte]]. Other settlements in [[New South Wales]] included [[New England (Australia)|New England]], the [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valley]] and the [[Illawarra]].

Much settlement followed the [[Highland Potato Famine]], [[Highland Clearances]] and the [[Lowland Clearances]] of the mid-19th century.
In the 1840s, Scots-born immigrants constituted 12% of the Australian population. Out of the 1.3 million migrants from Britain to Australia in the period from 1861–1914, 13.5% were Scots. Just 5.3% of the convicts transported to Eastern Australia between 1789 and 1852 were Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Angus|last=Innes|author-link=Angus Innes|format=PDF|url=http://www.qldmigrationheritage.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Scots1.pdf|title=Scots|publisher=Multicultural Queensland 2001; Queensland Migration Heritage Hub|date=2001|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GMIBhzDD?url=http://www.qldmigrationheritage.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Scots1.pdf|archivedate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{main|Scottish New Zealanders}}

Significant numbers of Scottish people also settled in New Zealand. Approximately 20 percent of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland, and Scottish influence is still visible around the country.&lt;ref&gt;Linguistic Archaeology: The Scottish Input to New Zealand English Phonology
Trudgill et al. Journal of English Linguistics.2003; 31: 103–124&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Island]] city of [[Dunedin]], in particular, is known for its Scottish heritage and was named as a tribute to [[Edinburgh]] by the city's Scottish founders.

Scottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of [[Pākehā]] New Zealanders being of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturemagics.com/world-guide/new-zealand.shtm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129131155/http://www.naturemagics.com/world-guide/new-zealand.shtm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-29|title=New Zealand|publisher=Naturemagics.com|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification as "British" or "European" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders also have [[Māori people|Māori]] or other non-European ancestry.

The majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many [[Caledonia]]n societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;Tanja Bueltmann, "'No Colonists are more Imbued with their National Sympathies than Scotchmen,'" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (2009) 43#2 pp 169–181 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1771&amp;action=null online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1961 [[New Zealand census|census]] there were 47,078 people living in New Zealand who were born in Scotland; in the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]] there were 25,953 in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/birthplace.aspx |title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity: Birthplace and people born overseas |website=Stats.govt.nz |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of Europe===
Other European countries have had their share of Scots immigrants.

==Scots in mainland Europe==

===Netherlands===
It is said{{by whom|date=September 2013}} that the first people from the [[Low Countries]] to settle in Scotland came in the wake of [[Maud, Countess of Huntingdon|Maud's]] marriage to the Scottish king, [[David I of Scotland|David I]], during the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. {{when|date=December 2016}} Craftsmen and tradesmen followed courtiers and in later centuries a brisk trade grew up between the two nations: Scotland's primary goods (wool, hides, salmon and then coal) in exchange for the luxuries obtainable in the Netherlands, one of the major hubs of European trade.

By 1600, trading colonies had grown up on either side of the well-travelled shipping routes: the Dutch settled along the eastern seaboard of Scotland; the Scots congregating first in [[Campvere]]—where they were allowed to land their goods duty-free and run their own affairs—and then in [[Rotterdam]], where Scottish and Dutch [[Calvinism]] coexisted comfortably. Besides the thousands (or, according to one estimate, over 1 million){{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of local descendants with Scots ancestry, both ports still show signs of these early alliances. Now a museum, 'The Scots House' in the town of [[Veere]] was the only place outwith Scotland where [[Scots Law]] was practised. In Rotterdam, meanwhile, the doors of the [[Scots International Church]] have remained open since 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/netherlands.html |title=Scotland and The Netherlands, Trade, Business &amp; Economy – Official Online Gateway to Scotland |publisher=Scotland.org |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{main|Scottish Russians}}[[File:FotoGordon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Patrick Gordon]] was a Russian General originally from Scotland and a friend of [[Peter the Great]].]]
The first Scots to be mentioned in Russia's history were the Scottish soldiers in [[Muscovy]] referred to as early as in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dukes (historian)|Paul Dukes]], Scottish soldiers in Moscovy in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 'soldiers of fortune' was the ancestor to famous Russian poet [[Mikhail Lermontov]], called George Learmonth. A number of Scots gained wealth and fame in the times of [[Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Cross, Scoto-Russian contacts in the reign of Catherine the great (1762–1796), in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Patrick Gordon]], [[Paul Menzies]], [[Samuel Greig]], [[Charles Baird (engineer)|Charles Baird]], [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], [[Adam Menelaws]] and [[William Heste|William Hastie]]. Several doctors to the Russian court were from Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;John H. Appleby, Through the looking-glass: Scottish doctors in Russia (1704–1854), in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; the best known being [[Sir James Wylie, 1st Baronet|James Wylie]].

The next wave of migration established commercial links with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Bowles, From the banks of the Neva to the shores of Lake Baikal: some enterprising Scots in Russia, in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century witnessed the immense literary cross-references between Scotland and Russia.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}

A Russian scholar, Maria Koroleva, distinguishes between 'the Russian Scots' (properly assimilated) and 'Scots in Russia', who remained thoroughly Scottish.&lt;ref&gt;M.V. Koroleva, A.L. Sinitsa. Gelskoe naselenie Shotlandii, ot istokov k sovremennosti, in Demographic studies, Moscow, 2010, pp. 163–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several societies in contemporary Russia to unite{{clarify|date=December 2012}} the Scots. The Russian census lists does not distinguish Scots from other British people, so it is hard to establish reliable figures for the number of Scots living and working in modern Russia.

===Poland===
From as far back as the mid-16th century there were Scots trading and settling in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/scotland-and-poland-a-500-year-relationship-1-4081795 |title=Scotland and Poland - a 500 year relationship |work=The Scotsman |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Scotch Pedlar's Pack in Poland" became a proverbial expression. It usually consisted of cloths, woollen goods and linen kerchiefs (head coverings). Itinerants also sold tin utensils and ironware such as scissors and knives. Along with the protection offered by [[Stephen Báthory|King Stephen]] in the Royal Grant of 1576, a district in [[Kraków]] was assigned to Scottish immigrants.

Records from 1592 mention Scots settlers granted citizenship of Kraków, and give their employment as trader or merchant. Fees for citizenship ranged from 12 Polish florins to a musket and gunpowder, or an undertaking to marry within a year and a day of acquiring a holding.

By the 17th century, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Scots lived in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=diaspora&gt;Eric Richards (2004). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JknDbX3ae1MC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Britannia's children: emigration from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland]''". Continuum International Publishing Group. p.53. {{ISBN|1-85285-441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many came from [[Dundee]] and [[Aberdeen]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Scots could be found in Polish towns on the banks of the [[Vistula]] as far south as [[Kraków]]. Settlers from [[Aberdeenshire]] were mainly Episcopalians or Catholics, but there were also large numbers of Calvinists. As well as Scottish traders, there were also many Scottish soldiers in Poland. In 1656, a number of Scottish highlanders who were disenchanted with [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s rule went to Poland to join the service of the [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King of Sweden]] in his [[Deluge_(history)#Swedish_invasion|war against it]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[James Murray (admiral)|James Murray]] created the Polish navy &lt;ref&gt;http://kompania-kaperska.pl/artyku322y/bitwa-na-redzie-gdanskiej-1627-r-niedocenione-zwyciestwo/&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|date=October 2018}} and participated in the [[Battle of Oliwa]]. A series of four Polish novels include him as ''Captain Mora'' or ''Flying Scotsman''. The writer Jerzy Bogdan Rychliński was supported by navy historian Jerzy Pertek. &lt;ref&gt;https://repozytorium.ukw.edu.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/item/4443/Pertek%20wobec%20powiesci%20historycznych%20Rychlinskiego%20w%20swietle%20korespondencji%20pisarzy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scots integrated well and many acquired great wealth. They contributed to many charitable institutions in the host country, but did not forget their homeland; for example, in 1701 when collections were made for the restoration fund of the [[Marischal College]], Aberdeen, Scottish settlers in Poland gave generously.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Many royal grants and privileges were granted to Scottish merchants until the 18th century, at which time the settlers began to merge more and more into the native population. [[Charles Edward Stuart|"Bonnie Prince Charlie"]] was half Polish, since he was the son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the "Old Pretender", and [[Maria Clementina Sobieska|Clementina Sobieska]], granddaughter of [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]], King of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;

By 1592, the Scottish community in [[Rome]] was big enough to merit the building of [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] (St Andrew of the Scots). It was constructed for the Scottish expatriate community in Rome, especially for those intended for priesthood. The adjoining hospice was a shelter for Catholic Scots who fled their country because of religious persecution. In 1615, [[Pope Paul V]] gave the hospice and the nearby Scottish Seminar to the [[Jesuits]]. It was rebuilt in 1645. The church and facilities became more important when [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Old Pretender, set up residence in Rome in 1717, but were abandoned during the French occupation of Rome in the late 18th century. In 1820, although religious activity was resumed, it was no longer led by the Jesuits. [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] was reconstructed in 1869 by [[Luigi Poletti (architect)|Luigi Poletti]]. The church was deconsecrated in 1962 and incorporated into a bank (Cassa di Risparmio delle Province Lombarde). The Scottish Seminar also moved away. The [[St. Andrew's Day|Feast of St Andrew]] is still celebrated there on 30 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/11/29/saint_andrew,_apostle_and_patron_of_scotland/1275597 |title=Saint Andrew, Apostle and Patron of Scotland |publisher=Vatican Radio |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{See also|Language in Scotland}}

Historically, Scottish people have spoken many different languages and dialects. The Pictish language, Norse, Norman-French and Brythonic languages have been spoken by forebears of Scottish people. However, none of these are in use today. The remaining three major languages of the Scottish people are English, [[Scots Language|Scots]] (various dialects) and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Of these three, English is the most common form as a first language. There are some other minority languages of the Scottish people, such as Spanish, used by the population of Scots in [[Argentina]].

The [[Norn language]] was spoken in the [[Northern Isles]] into the early modern period – the current dialects of [[Shetlandic]] and Orcadian are heavily influenced by it, to this day.

There is still debate whether Scots is a dialect or a language in its own right, as there is no clear line to define the two. Scots is usually regarded as a midway between the two, as it is highly mutually intelligible with English, particularly the dialects spoken in the North of England as well as those spoken in Scotland, but is treated as a language in some laws.

Lowland Scots, also known as [[Lallans]] or [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]], is a language of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin. It has its roots in Northern [[Middle English]]. After the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|wars of independence]], the English used by Lowland Scots speakers evolved in a different direction from that of Modern [[English language in England|English]].

However, due to the adoption of the southern standard by officialdom and the Education system the use of written Scots declined.

====Scottish Gaelic====
{{Main|Scottish Gaelic}}
{{See also|Canadian Gaelic}}
[[Scottish Gaelic]] is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] with similarities to Irish. [[Scottish Gaelic]] comes from [[Old Irish]]. It was originally spoken by the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]] and the [[Rhinns of Galloway]], later being adopted by the [[Pictish]] people of central and eastern Scotland. Gaelic (''lingua Scottica'', ''Scottis'') became the ''de facto'' language of the whole [[Kingdom of Alba]], giving its name to the country (''Scotia'', "Scotland"). Meanwhile, Gaelic independently spread from [[Galloway]] into [[Dumfriesshire]]. It is unclear if the Gaelic of 12th-century [[Clydesdale]] and [[Selkirkshire]] came from Galloway or Scotland-proper. The predominance of Gaelic began to decline in the 13th century, and by the end of the Middle Ages, Scotland was divided into two linguistic zones, the English/Scots-speaking Lowlands and the Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Galloway. Gaelic continued to be spoken widely throughout the Highlands until the 19th century. The [[Highland clearances]] actively discouraged the use of Gaelic, caused the numbers of Gaelic speakers to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Communities where the language is still spoken natively are restricted to the west coast of Scotland; and especially the [[Hebrides]]. However, large proportions of Gaelic speakers also live in the cities of [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] in Scotland. A report in 2005 by the Registrar General for Scotland based on the [[2001 UK Census]] showed about 92,400 people or 1.9% of the population can speak Gaelic while the number of people able to read and write rose by 7.5% and 10% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/4326424.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Mixed report on Gaelic language |publisher=BBC News |date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outwith Scotland, there are communities of Scottish Gaelic speakers such as the [[Canadian Gaelic]] community; though their numbers have also been declining rapidly. Gaelic language is recognised as a minority Language by the [[European Union]]. The [[Scottish parliament]] is also seeking to increase the use of Gaelic in Scotland through the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]]. Gaelic is now used as a first language in some schools and is prominently seen in use on [[Gaelic road signs in Scotland|dual language road signs]] throughout the Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland. It is recognised as an official language of Scotland with "equal respect" to English.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Religion===
{{See also|Religion in Scotland}}
The modern people of Scotland remain a mix of different religions and no religion. [[Christianity]] is the largest faith in Scotland. In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], 53.8% of the Scottish population identified as [[Christian]].&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35953639|title=BBC Report - Most People in Scotland 'Not Religious'|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant and Catholic divisions still remain in the society. In Scotland the main Protestant body is the [[Church of Scotland]] which is Presbyterian. The high kirk for Presbyterians is [[St Giles' Cathedral]]. In the United States, people of Scottish and Scots-Irish descent are chiefly Protestant{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, with many belonging to the [[Baptist]] or [[Methodist]] churches, or various [[Presbyterian]] denominations.

According to the Social Scottish Attitudes research, 52% of Scottish people identified as having no religion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35953639|title=Most People in Scotland 'Not Religious'|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC.co.uk|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Scotland has thus become a secular and majority non-religious country, unique to the other UK countries.

==Anglicisation==
{{Main|Anglicisation}}
{{Original research|section|date=June 2010}}
Many [[Scottish surnames]] have become [[anglicised]] over the centuries. This reflected the gradual spread of English, also known as [[Early Scots]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} from around the 13th century onwards, through Scotland beyond its traditional area in the Lothians. It also reflected some deliberate political attempts{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} to promote the English language in the outlying regions of Scotland, including following the Union of the Crowns under King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1603, and then the [[Acts of Union of 1707]] and the subsequent defeat of rebellions.{{who|date=December 2016}}

However, many Scottish surnames have remained predominantly [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] albeit written according to English [[orthography|orthographic]] practice (as with Irish surnames). Thus ''MacAoidh'' in Gaelic is ''Mackay'' in English, and ''MacGill-Eain'' in Gaelic is ''MacLean'' and so on. ''Mac'' (sometimes ''Mc'') is common as, effectively, it means "son of". ''MacDonald'', ''MacAulay'', ''Gilmore'', ''Gilmour'', ''MacKinley'', ''Macintosh'', ''MacKenzie'', ''MacNeill'', ''MacPherson'', ''MacLear'', ''MacAra'', ''Craig'', ''Lauder'', ''Menzies'', ''Galloway'' and ''Duncan'' are just a few of many examples of traditional Scottish surnames. There are, of course, also the many surnames, like ''Wallace'' and ''Morton'', stemming from parts of Scotland which were settled by peoples other than the [[Scoti|(Gaelic) Scots]]. The most common surnames in Scotland are ''Smith'' and ''Brown'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/births/popular-names/archive/100-most-common-surnames|title=100 Most Common Surnames|work=National Records of Scotland|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which come from several origins each – e.g. Smith can be a translation of Mac a' Ghobhainn (thence also e.g. MacGowan), and Brown can refer to the colour, or be akin to MacBrayne.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Anglicisation is not restricted to language. In his ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, future British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] wrote: "The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past, and, being
deprived of the inspiration of its nationality, is also deprived of its communal sense."&lt;ref name="MacDonald1921"&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|authorlink=Ramsay MacDonald|title=Socialism: Critical and Constructive|url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/download/SocialismCriticalandConstructive_10094299.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2016|year=1921|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|page=249|chapter=CHAPTER VI Political Construction: The Democratic State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the Romans used Scotia to refer to the Gaels living in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Lehane1994"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} [[Bede|The Venerable Bede]] (c. 672 or 673 – 27 May, 735) uses the word ''Scottorum'' for the nation from Ireland who settled part of the [[Pictish]] lands: "''Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit''."  This we can infer to mean the arrival of the people, also known as the [[Gaels]], in the Kingdom of Dál Riata, in the western edge of Scotland. It is of note that Bede used the word ''natio'' (nation) for the Scots, where he often refers to other peoples, such as the Picts, with the word ''gens'' (race).&lt;ref name="Harris 72"&gt;{{Cite book

In modern times the words ''Scot'' and ''Scottish'' are applied mainly to inhabitants of Scotland. The possible ancient Irish connotations are largely forgotten. The language known as ''[[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]'', spoken in parts of northeastern Ireland, is the result of 17th- and 18th-century immigration to Ireland from Scotland.

In the English language, the word ''[[Scotch (adjective)|Scotch]]'' is a term to describe a thing from Scotland, such as ''Scotch whisky''. However, when referring to people, the preferred term is ''Scots''. Many Scottish people find the term ''Scotch'' to be offensive when applied to people.&lt;ref name="Scotch_Off"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/S0160800.html The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language] Scotch usage note, [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/scotch.html Encarta Dictionary] usage note.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Dictionary describes ''Scotch'' as an old-fashioned term for "Scottish".&lt;ref name="OED_Scotch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/scotch?view=uk |title=Definition of scotch |publisher=Askoxford.com |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shughni''' or '''Khughni''' is one of the [[Pamir languages]] of the [[Southeastern Iranian languages|Southeastern Iranian language group]].&lt;ref name=dodc&gt;Karamšoev, Dodchudo K. (1988–99). ''Šugnansko-russkij slovar''. 3 vols. Moskva: Nauka. {{ISBN|5-02-016991-9}} (Vol. 2), {{ISBN|5-02-018101-3}} /{{ISBN|5-02-017858-6}} (Vol. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Its distribution is in the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Badakhshan Province]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=dodc/&gt;

Shughni tends towards SOV word order, distinguishes a masculine and a feminine gender in nouns and some adjectives as well as the 3rd person singular of verbs. Shughni distinguishes between an [[absolutive]] and an [[oblique case]] in its system of pronouns. The [[Rushani dialect]] is noted for a typologically unusual 'double-oblique' construction, also called a 'transitive case', in the past tense.

==Dialects==
[[Rushani dialect|Rushani]], [[Bartangi language|Bartangi]], Oroshor (Roshorvi), [[Khufi language|Khufi]], and Shughni proper are considered to be dialects. However, Bartangi and Khufi are quite distinct, and may be separate languages.

'''Social psychology''' is the [[Science|scientific]] study of how people's [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[behavior]]s are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allport|first=G. W|year=1985|title=The historical background of social psychology|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Lindzey|editor2-first=E|editor2-last=Aronson|encyclopedia=The Handbook of Social Psychology|location=New York|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]}}p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, ''scientific'' refers to the [[empirical]] investigation using the [[scientific method]]. The terms ''thoughts'', ''feelings'', and ''behavior'' refer to [[psychology|psychological]] variables that can be measured in humans. The statement that others' presence may be ''imagined'' or ''implied'' suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television or following internalized [[norm (sociology)|cultural norms]]. Social psychologists typically explain [[human behavior]] as a result of the interaction of [[mind|mental states]] and social [[situationism (psychology)|situations]].

Social psychologists examine factors that cause behaviors to unfold in a given way in the presence of others. They study conditions under which certain behavior, actions, and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and goals are cognitively constructed and how these mental representations, in turn, influence our interactions with others.

Social psychology traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following [[World War II]] there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=W. H|year=1989|title=Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=15|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.15.080189.000245|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on "macro variables" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent than psychologists.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nevertheless, [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological approaches]] to psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area.

In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and [[Europe]]an social psychologists. As a generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see [[group dynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moscovici|first1=S|last2=Markova|first2=I|year=2006|title=The Making of Modern Social Psychology|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Although there were some older writings about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius),&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amber Haque|year=2004|title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=43|issue=4|pages=357–377|jstor=27512819|doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discipline of social psychology, as its modern-day definition, began in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. By that time, though, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation. Following the 18th century, those in the emerging field of social psychology were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} They attempted to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them. In order to do so, they believed that the [[scientific method]], an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gergen| first1= K. J. |year=1973| title= Social Psychology as History |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=26| issue= 2 | pages= 309–320| doi=10.1037/h0034436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study in this area was an experiment in 1898 by [[Norman Triplett]], on the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplett|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Triplett|year=1898|title=The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition|journal=[[American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=507–533|doi=10.2307/1412188|issue=4|jstor=1412188}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, many [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists, most notably [[Kurt Lewin]], fled to the United States from Nazi Germany. They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] schools that were dominant during that time, and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in [[perception]] and [[cognition]]. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] and [[communication in small groups|small group]] phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War II, social psychologists studied [[persuasion]] and [[propaganda]] for the U.S. military&lt;!-- Should a link to [[psychological warfare]] be in here? --&gt;. After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including [[gender]] issues and [[racial prejudice]].  Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments]] on [[obedience to authority]]. In the sixties, there was growing interest in new topics, such as [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Bystander effect|bystander intervention]], and [[aggression]]. By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis. There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gergen|first=Kenneth J|authorlink=Kenneth Gergen|year=1973|title=Social psychology as history|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=26|pages=309–320|doi=10.1037/h0034436|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the time when a radical [[situationism (psychology)|situationist]] approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/|title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s social psychology reached a more mature level. Two of the areas social psychology matured in were theories and methods.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"/&gt; Careful [[Research ethics|ethical standards]] now regulate research. [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralistic]] and [[multicultural]] perspectives have emerged. Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena, but [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[social cognition]], and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health, education, law, and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H.R. (2017). ''Social psychology'' (10th edition). Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrapersonal phenomena==

===Attitudes===
{{Main|Attitude (psychology)}}
In social psychology, attitudes are defined as learned, global evaluations of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.&lt;ref name=Sison&gt;{{cite book|last=Sison|first=Erick Louie. A|year=2008|title=The dynamics of persuasion|location=New York|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2012}} Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bem|first=D|year=1970|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and human affairs|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.

Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.

In recent times, research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitude measures and "implicit" or unconscious attitudes. For example, experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Allen|date=September 2001|title=Relations among the Implicit Association Test, Discriminatory Behavior, and Explicit Measures of Racial Attitudes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103100914707|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=435–442|via=|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Implicit Association Test]] have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses reveal equal mindedness. One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions, whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=J. D|last2=Skowronski|first2=J. J|year=2007|title=Improving the Predictive Validity of the Implicit Association Test|journal=[[North American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=53–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first advanced by [[Abraham Tesser]] in 1983, is that strong likes and dislikes are ingrained in our [[genetic make-up]]. Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn physical, sensory, and [[cognitive skill]]s, temperament, and [[personality traits]]. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; the attitude that our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;ref name=Kassin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, NY|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|edition=7|first2=Steven|last2=Fein|first3=Hazel Rose|last3=Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[interpersonal attraction]], social perception, and [[prejudice]].

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on "appeals" rather than strong pressure or [[coercion]]. Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process; these are normally presented in five major categories: ''who'' said ''what'' to ''whom'' and ''how''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology, Tenth Edition|last=Myers|first=David|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8|location=New York|pages=234–253|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[Orator|Communicator]], including [[credibility]], [[expert]]ise, [[trustworthiness]], and [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].
# The [[Message]], including varying degrees of [[reason]], [[emotion]] (such as fear), one-sided or two sided arguments, and other types of informational content.
# The [[Audience]], including a variety of [[demographics]], [[personality trait]]s, and [[preference]]s.
# The Channel or [[Media (communication)|Medium]], including the printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactions.
# The Context, including the environment, group dynamics, and preamble to the message.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Are you saying that these act as a preamble to the message, or that anything said prior to the message is a part of the context?}}

[[dual process theory|Dual-process theories]] of persuasion (such as the [[elaboration likelihood model]]) maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not last as long as persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.

===Social cognition===
{{Main|Social cognition}}
Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Much research rests on the assertion that people think about (other) people differently from non-social targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B|title=Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others|year=2005|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2|series=Texts in Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;dq=%22Social+Cognition%22+Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobbs|first1=Davis|title=The Gregarious Brain| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 July 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/magazine/08sociability-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Person perception]] is the study of how people form impressions of others. The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as [[interpersonal perception]].

A major research topic in social cognition is attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisenzein|first1=Rainer|last2=Rudolph|first2=Udo|title=50 Years of Attribution Research|journal= [[Social Psychology (journal)|Social Psychology]] |volume=39|issue=3|year=2008|pages=123–124|issn=1864-9335|doi=10.1027/1864-9335.39.3.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of others. One element of attribution ascribes the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors. An ''internal'', or dispositional, attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality, disposition, character or ability. An ''external'', or situational, attribution involves situational elements, such as the weather.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1&gt;
{{cite book

|last3=Akert
|year=2010
|edition=7
|publisher= [[Prentice Hall]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}  A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors (whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Finally, we also attribute causes of behavior to either controllable or uncontrollable factors: how much control one has over the situation at hand.

Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the [[fundamental attribution error]] is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;
{{cite book
|author=David G. Myers
|title=Psychology
|edition=8
|publisher=Worth
|year=2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|724}} The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|107}} The [[self-serving bias]] is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|109}} Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by [[just-world phenomenon|believing in a just world]], blaming victims for their suffering, and making [[defensive attribution hypothesis|defensive attributions]], which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|111}} Researchers have found that mildly [[Clinical depression|depressed]] individuals often lack this bias and actually have [[depressive realism|more realistic perceptions of reality]] (as measured by the opinions of others).&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Andrews2001.pdf |pmid=11182572|year=2001|last1=Andrews|first1=P. W.|title=The psychology of social chess and the evolution of attribution mechanisms: Explaining the fundamental attribution error|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=22|issue=1|pages=11–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heuristics in judgment and decision making|Heuristic]]s are cognitive short cuts. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The [[availability heuristic]] occurs when people estimate the [[probability]] of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias.{{Contradict-inline|article=Availability heuristic|date=March 2012}} The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|63}} Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The [[hindsight bias]] is a [[Confabulation|false memory]] of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The [[confirmation bias]] is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. [[schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate [[automaticity|automatically]] and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Correll|first1=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|title=The police officer's dilemma: Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=83|issue=6|year=2002|pages=1,314–1,329|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.7243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of schema is actually a [[stereotype]], a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an [[ultimate attribution error]]). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior ([[discrimination]]). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as ''scripts''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Self-concept===
{{Main|Self-concept}}
Self-concept is a term referring to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called [[self-schema]]s&amp;nbsp;– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one "self," who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the "self" who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These "selves" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper "self" to process and react on it. If a "self" is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a "self" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered ''schematics'' with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events&amp;nbsp;– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach&amp;nbsp;– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are ''a-schematic'' on that attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Hazel|title=Self-Schemata and Processing Information|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1977|volume=35|issue=2|pages=63–78|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.2.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our [[attention]]. Whether one is mentally focused on a [[memory]], a [[conversation]], a foul smell, the song that is stuck in one's head, or this sentence, [[consciousness]] is like a spotlight. This [[:wikt:spotlight|spotlight]] can shine on only one object at a time, but it can switch rapidly from one object to another and process the information out of [[awareness]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Process which information? And consciousness implies awareness...}} In this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The self's ABCs are affect, behavior, and cognition. An affective (or emotional) question: How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity? A behavioral question: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? A [[cognitive]] question: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Affective forecasting]] is the process of [[prediction|predicting]] how one would feel in response to future [[emotional]] events. Studies done by [[Timothy Wilson]] and [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] in 2003 have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D|authorlink1=Timothy Wilson|first2=Daniel T|last2=Gilbert|title=Affective Forecasting|journal= Advances in Experimental Psychology |year=2003|issue=35|pages=345–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bem|first=Daryl J|title=Self Perception Theory|year=1972|volume=6|pages=1–62|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60024-6|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=978-0-12-015206-3|chapter=Self-Perception Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]]'s 1954 [[social comparison theory]] is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|authorlink=Leon Festinger|title=A theory of social comparison process|journal= [[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]] |year=1954|volume=7|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[facial feedback hypothesis]]: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The fields of social psychology and [[Personality psychology|personality]] have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the [[self-concept]], which is a person's understanding of their self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the ''self-schema'', and an evaluative component, the ''self-esteem''. The need to maintain a healthy [[self-esteem]] is recognized as a central human [[motivation]] in the field of social psychology.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Self-efficacy]] beliefs are associated with the self-schema. These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful. Social psychologists also study such self-related processes as [[self-control]] and [[impression management|self-presentation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

People develop their self-concepts by varied means, including [[introspection]], feedback from others, [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]], and social comparison. By comparing themselves to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem. Social comparisons can be either "upward" or "downward," that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology|last=Baron|first=Robert A.|last2=Branscombe|first2=Nyla R.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-20558-5|location=United States of America|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as [[overjustification]]. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L|last2=Koestner|first2=R|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M|year=2001|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=71|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important exception to [[reinforcement]] theory.

==Interpersonal phenomena==

===Social influence===
{{Main|Social influence}}
Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: [[conformity]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.

The first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.&lt;ref name="Aaronson2"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2&gt;

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|left|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was (objectively) wrong.]]

The second major area of social influence research is compliance. [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. The [[foot-in-the-door technique]] is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the [[bait and switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B|year=2000|title=Influence: Science and Practice|publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third major form of social influence is [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the [[Milgram study]], wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

An unusual kind of social influence is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the [[stock market]], if it is widely believed that a [[stock market crash|crash]] is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Group dynamics===
{{Main|Group dynamics}}
A [[Social group|group]] can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by [[interpersonal relationship|social relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.R|year=2006|title=Group dynamics|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Thomson-Wadworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from [[wikt:aggregate|aggregates]]:
* [[Norm (sociology)|Norms]]: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g. saying thank you, shaking hands.
* [[Role]]s: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g. the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
* [[Interpersonal relationship|Relations]]: Patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status, e.g., leaders, popular people.
Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups. People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their [[social identity]]. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tajfel|first1=H|last2=Turner|first2=J.C|year=1986|title=The social identity theory of intergroup behavior|editor1-first=S|editor1-last=Worchel|editor2-first=W.G|editor2-last=Austin|encyclopedia=Psychology of Intergroup Relations|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=Nelson-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society.&lt;ref name=Haidt2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haidt | first = Jonathan  | last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Evan | last3 = Hom | first3 = Holly | year = 2003 | title = Differentiating Diversities: Moral Diversity Is Not Like Other Kinds | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue =1 | pages = 1–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb02071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and [[group polarization]] encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.

Groups often moderate and improve [[decision making]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. A number of group biases, however, can interfere with effective decision making. For example, group polarization, formerly known as the "risky shift," occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussion. More problematic is the phenomenon of [[groupthink]]. This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members. Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader. Janis offered the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] as a historical case of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janis|first=I.L|year=1972|title=Victims of Groupthink|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups also affect performance and [[productivity]]. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the ''[[dominant response]]''{{'}}s likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In contrast, [[social loafing]] is the tendency of individuals to [[slacker|slack off]] when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/05/social-loafing-when-groups-are-bad-for-productivity.php PsyBlog], "Social Loafing: when groups are bad for productivity," 19 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}

Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of [[crowd]]s. An important concept in this area is [[deindividuation]], a reduced state of [[self-awareness]] that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron, R.S., &amp; Kerr, N. L.|title=Group Process, Group Decision, Group Action|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In the online domain, e.g., see Rosen, L. D., Cheever, N. A., &amp; Carrier, L. M. (2015) The Wiley Handbook of Psychology, Technology and Society. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soc-psy diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Social psychologists study interactions within [[social group|groups]], and between both groups and individuals.]]

===Interpersonal attraction===
{{Main|Interpersonal attraction}}
A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction. This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in [[love]]. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists, but many still continue to experiment and do research to find out more.  One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are.  The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more probable an attraction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, D. (1961). ''[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''. ''62''. pp. 713–715. "Thus Interpersonal attraction and attitude similarity have a direct correlation.  More so than those with dissimilar attitudes and views, who tend to not be as successful in the attraction department."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of [[limerence|passion]]. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from ''passionate'' to ''companionate''. [[Robert Sternberg]] has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|year=1986|title=A Triangular Theory of Love|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.

According to [[social exchange theory]], relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. If one partner's costs begin to outweigh their benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the [[minimax principle]] proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not [[zero-sum game]]s). With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Research==

===Methods===
Social psychology is an [[empirical]] science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field. Careful attention to sampling, research design, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''. Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

[[Experiment|Experimental methods]] involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variable. An example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent videogames, and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during free-play period. A valid experiment is controlled and uses [[random assignment]].

[[Correlation|Correlational methods]] examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variables. For example, one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school. Note that this study would ''not'' prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.

[[Observation|Observational methods]] are purely descriptive and include [[naturalistic observation]], "contrived" observation, participant observation, and archival analysis. These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon. An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed.

Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation. Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] in order to examine the effect on a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in [[internal validity]], meaning that they are free from the influence of [[confounding]] or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in [[external validity]], or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control ([[internal validity]]) and being able to generalize to the population ([[external validity]]).

Because it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of persons from the wider [[population]]. Social psychologists frequently use [[Statistical survey|survey]] research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]] to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like [[structural equation modeling]] are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some psychologists, including Dr. [[David O. Sears]], have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sears|first=David|year=1986|title=College Sophomores in the Laboratory: Influences of a Narrow Data Base on Social Psychology's View of Human Nature|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–530|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which method has been chosen to be used, the results are of high importance. Results need to be used to evaluate the hypothesis of the research that is done. These results should either confirm or reject the original hypothesis that was predicted.There are two different types of testing social psychologists use in order to test their results. Statistics and probability testing define a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding that can be as low as 5% or less, likely to be due to chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/ | title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproducibility|Replications]] are important, to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance, or some feature of a particular sample. [[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are a hazard in the field.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Simmons| first1 = Joseph|first2 = Leif|last2=Nelson|first3=Uri|last3=Simonsohn| title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = [[Psychological Science]]| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate =29 January 2012| pmid=22006061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize [[deception]] to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What about concealment of the existence or purpose of observation?}}

The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., [[role-playing]]) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the [[Milgram experiment]] and [[Stanford prison experiment]]), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an [[ethics|ethical]] review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or [[Institutional Review Board]]. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.

Furthermore, a process of [[informed consent]] is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=How, if there will be portions of the experiment that involve deception?}} and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A [[debriefing]] is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=And what would the response be if they weren't? I would assume offering of psychological counseling...}} Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/undergrad/ptacc/irb-college-guide.pdf|title=THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB): A COLLEGE PLANNING GUIDE|last=COMMITTEE ON ASSOCIATE AND BACCALAUREATE EDUCATION|date=2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication crisis===
{{main|replication crisis}}
Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a "[[replication crisis]]" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate.  Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of science.  However, several factors have combined to put social psychology at the center of the current controversy.

Firstly, [[questionable research practices]] (QRP) have been identified as common in the field.  Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"/&gt;  Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|title=Questionable Research Practices Surprisingly Common|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the [[Daryl Bem#.22Feeling the Future.22 controversy|feeling the future controversy]] has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.

Secondly, social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research.  Most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology: Even legitimate researchers cut corners, some admit|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Christopher|last=Shea|date=13 November 2011|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allegations against others.  However, most scholars acknowledge that fraud is, perhaps, the lesser contribution to replication crises.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Third, several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example, the scientific journal ''[[Society for Judgment and Decision Making#Publications and journal|Judgment and Decision Making]]'' has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the [[unconscious thought theory]]. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.

These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by [[Daniel Kahneman]]. Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate. A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.is/20140530230728/http://www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=3f8268e0307f4036906c158b1667c57a&amp;pi=0 | title=Social Psychology - Volume 45, Number 3 / 2014 - Hogrefe Publishing| date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 special edition of the journal ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6.toc|title=Table of Contents: Volume 7, Issue 6, November 2012|work=Perspectives on Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientific.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/28/psychology-replication-drive-methods-bullying|title=Psychology's replication drive: it's not about you|journal=The Guardian|first=Pete|last=Etchells|date=28 May 2014|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/|title=Power of Suggestion|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Tom|last=Bartlett|date=30 January 2013|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous experiments===
[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Milgram experiment]]: The experimenter (E) persuades the participant (T) to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant (L), who is actually an actor. Many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor.]]

The [[Asch conformity experiments]] demonstrated the power of conformity in small groups with a line length estimation task that was designed to be extremely easy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.E|year=1955|title=Opinions and social pressure|journal=[[Scientific American]]|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, who had been instructed to provide incorrect answers, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong. Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.  Additional manipulations to the experiment showed participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform, but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of incorrect individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grew.  Participants with three incorrect opponents made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect opponents made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Muzafer Sherif]]'s  [[Robbers' Cave Experiment]] divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emerge. Sherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory, because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition over resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherif|first=Muzafer|authorlink=Muzafer Sherif|year=1954|title=Experiments in group conflict|journal=Scientific American|volume=195|issue=5|pages=54–58|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1156-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inducing cooperation and [[superordinate goals]] later reversed this effect.

In [[Leon Festinger]]'s cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|title=Cognitive Dissonance Theory - Simply Psychology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=J.M|year=1959|title= Cognitive consequences of forced compliance|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|volume=58|pages=203–211|doi=10.1037/h0041593|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.497.2779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the [[Milgram experiment]], which studied how far people would go to obey an [[authority]] figure. Following the events of [[The Holocaust]] in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley|last=Milgram|year=1975|title=Obedience to authority|publisher=Harper and Bros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]]'s [[Bobo doll experiment]] demonstrated how aggression is learned by [[imitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Ross|first2=D|last3=Ross|first3=S.A|year=1961|title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of studies fueled debates regarding [[media violence]] which continue to be waged among scholars.

In the [[Stanford prison study]], by [[Philip Zimbardo]], a simulated exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In just a few days, the "guards" became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney|first1=C|last2=Banks|first2=W.C|last3=Zimbardo|first3=Philip G|year=1973|title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour,&lt;ref name=revisitingSFE&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Somalis in Kenya''' are [[Citizenship|citizens]] and residents of [[Kenya]] who are of [[Somalis|Somali]] ethnic descent. They have historically inhabited the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], previously called the Northern Frontier District, which was carved out of the [[Jubaland]] region of present-day southern [[Somalia]] during the [[British Kenya|colonial period.]] Following the [[Somali Civil War|civil war in Somalia]] that broke out in 1991, many Somalis sought asylum in the Somali-inhabited enclaves of Kenya. An entrepreneurial community, they established themselves in the business sector, particularly in the [[Nairobi]] suburb of [[Eastleigh, Nairobi|Eastleigh]].

==Population==
According to the 2009 Kenya [[census]], approximately 2,385,572 ethnic [[Somalis]] live in Kenya.&lt;ref name="Kengov"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 POPULATION &amp; HOUSING CENSUS RESULTS |url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf |publisher=Ministry of State for Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115103229/http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these individuals are a number of ethnically Somali international migrants, around 300,000 of whom inhabit the wider [[East Africa|East]] and [[South Africa]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shire|first1=Saad A.|title=92 Transactions with Homeland: Remittance|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=bildhaan|publisher=Bildhaan|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ethnic Somalis are distinct from the [[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantus]] and other minorities of Somalia, who according to [[USAID]] constitute most of the estimated 413,170 refugees from Somalia in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia Humanitarian Situation Update|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06NAIROBI4868_a.html|website=Wikileaks|publisher=USAID|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Brycs dates from 2002, and even then it was unreliable - see UN page 14 [http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4090ffda0.pdf] and IDMC page 95 [http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/library/Africa/Somalia/pdf/Somalia-April-2007.pdf] --&gt;&lt;ref name="Unhcrreg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered Somali Refugee Population|url=http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/regional.php|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Greater Somalia|Shifta War|Somali and Kenyan conflict}}
[[File:Eastlmall1.png|thumb|right|Somali-owned businesses in [[Eastleigh, Nairobi|Eastleigh]], [[Nairobi]]]]
Somalis in Kenya have historically inhabited the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], previously called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). The NFD came into being in 1925, when it was carved out of the [[Jubaland]] region in present-day southern [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Ospftf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osman|first=Mohamed Amin AH|title=Somalia, proposals for the future|year=1993|publisher=SPM|pages=1–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsOAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time under British colonial administration, the northern half of Jubaland was ceded to [[Italy]] as a reward for the Italians' support of the Allies during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oliver |first=Roland Anthony |title=History of East Africa, Volume 2 |year=1976 |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=7 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=pGkMAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain retained control of the southern half of the territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District.&lt;ref name="Ospftf"/&gt;

On 26 June 1960, four days before granting [[British Somaliland]] independence, the British government declared that all Somali-inhabited areas of East Africa should be unified in one administrative region. However, after the dissolution of the former British colonies in the region, Britain granted administration of the Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists. This was despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed [[Somalia|Somali Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.75&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that the NFD was almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Somalis.&lt;ref name="AWC"&gt;Africa Watch Committee, ''Kenya: Taking Liberties'', (Yale University Press: 1991), p.269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRP"&gt;Women's Rights Project, ''The Human Rights Watch Global Report on Women's Human Rights'', (Yale University Press: 1995), p.121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallat"&gt;Francis Vallat, ''First report on succession of states in respect of treaties: International Law Commission twenty-sixth session 6 May-26 July 1974'', (United Nations: 1974), p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Somali residents had by then successfully lobbied for a separate classification from the adjacent [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations. In the 1962 [[British Kenya]] census, the Somali expatriates were accorded their own "Somali" entry separate from the "African", "Arab", "Asian" and "European" designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya Population Census, 1962 – Appendix 1|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/117476/Kenya-1962-en.pdf|publisher=Government of Kenya|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eastlstkp2.png|thumb|left|A [[Somali people|Somali]] store owner]]
On the eve of Kenya's independence in August 1963, British officials belatedly realized that the new Kenyan regime was not willing to give up the Somali-inhabited areas it had just been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Baker, ''Escape from Domination in Africa: Political Disengagement &amp; Its Consequences'', (Africa World Press: 2003), p.83&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what came to be known as the [[Shifta War]].&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Rhoda E. Howard, ''Human Rights in Commonwealth Africa'', (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1986), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their brethren in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Kenya: identity of a nation'', (Godfrey Mwakikagile: 2007), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; They have traditionally married within their own community and formed a cohesive ethnic network.&lt;ref name="Jkuatstaic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.

Following the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in Somalia that broke out in 1991, many Somalis sought asylum in the Somali-inhabited enclaves in Kenya.

Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their bank accounts, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia. The collective departures most affected Eastleigh's real estate sector, as landlords struggled to find Kenyans able to afford the high rates of the apartments and shops vacated by the Somalis.&lt;ref name="Ktcohsot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Guled|title=Kenya: The Cost of Harassing Somalis Over Terror|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201301100532.html|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=The Star|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spontaneous order''', also named [[self-organization]] in the [[Hard and soft science|hard sciences]], is the spontaneous [[emergence]] of order out of seeming chaos. It is a process in [[social network]]s including [[economics]], though the term "self-organization" is more often used for [[physical change]]s and [[biological process]]es, while "spontaneous order" is typically used to describe the emergence of various kinds of social orders from a combination of self-interested individuals who are not intentionally trying to create order through [[planning]]. The [[Evolutionary history of life|evolution of life on Earth]], [[language]], [[crystal structure]], the [[Internet]] and a [[free market]] [[economy]] have all been proposed as examples of systems which evolved through spontaneous order.&lt;ref name=Barry1982&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman P. Barry |title=The Tradition of Spontaneous Order |journal=Literature of Liberty |year=1982 |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalists]] often point to the inherent "watch-like" precision of uncultivated [[ecosystem]]s and to the [[universe]] itself as ultimate examples of this phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Spontaneous orders are to be distinguished from organizations. Spontaneous orders are distinguished by being [[scale-free networks]], while organizations are hierarchical networks. Further, organizations can be and often are a part of spontaneous social orders, but the reverse is not true. Further, while organizations are created and controlled by humans, spontaneous orders are created, controlled, ''and controllable'' by no one.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In economics and the social sciences, spontaneous order is defined as "the result of human actions, not of human design".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich A.|publisher=Touchstone|year=1969|isbn=0671202464|location=|page=97|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Spontaneous order is also used as a synonym for any emergent behavior of which self-interested spontaneous order is just an instance.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Spontaneous order is an equilibrium behavior between self-interested individuals, which is most likely to evolve and survive, obeying the natural selection process "survival of the likeliest".&lt;ref name="springer1"&gt; Yong Tao, Spontaneous economic order, Journal of Evolutionary Economics (2016) 26 (3): 467-500 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-015-0432-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] (369–286 BCE) was the first to work out the idea of spontaneous order. The philosopher rejected the authoritarianism of [[Confucianism]], writing that there "has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success]." He articulated an early form of spontaneous order,  asserting that "good order results spontaneously when things are let alone", a concept later "developed particularly by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] in the nineteenth [century]".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf ''Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire''], The Journal of Libertarian Studies, Vol. IX No. 2 (Fall 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The thinkers of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] were the first to seriously develop and inquire into the idea of the market as a spontaneous order. In 1767, the sociologist and historian [[Adam Ferguson]] described the phenomenon of spontaneous order in society as the "result of human action, but not the execution of any human design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/ferguson.htm Adam Ferguson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509054323/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/ferguson.htm |date=2007-05-09 }} on The History of Economic Thought Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson1767"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austrian School of Economics]], led by [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], would later refine the concept and make it a centerpiece in its social and economic thought.

==Examples==

===Markets===
Many economic classical liberals, such as Hayek, have argued that [[Market economy|market economies]] are a spontaneous order, "a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve."&lt;ref&gt;Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christian. Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment. Routledge. 2001. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; They claim this spontaneous order (referred to as the [[extended order]] in Hayek's ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'') is superior to any order a human mind can design due to the specifics of the information required.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism''. The University of Chicago Press. 1991. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Centralized statistical data cannot convey this information because the statistics are created by abstracting away from the particulars of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek cited. Boaz, David. ''The Libertarian Reader''. The Free Press. 1997. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

In a market economy, price is the aggregation of information acquired when the people who own resources are free to use their [[dispersed knowledge|individual knowledge]]. Price then allows everyone dealing in a commodity or its substitutes to make decisions based on more information than he or she could personally acquire, information not statistically conveyable to a centralized authority.  Interference from a central authority which affects price will have consequences they could not foresee because they do not know all of the particulars involved.

According to Barry this is illustrated in the concept of the [[invisible hand]] proposed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref name=Barry1982 /&gt; Thus in this view by acting on information with greater detail and accuracy than possible for any centralized authority, a more efficient economy is created to the benefit of a whole society.

[[Lawrence Reed]], president of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], describes spontaneous order as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Spontaneous order is what happens when you leave people alone—when entrepreneurs... see the desires of people... and then provide for them.

They respond to market signals, to prices. Prices tell them what's needed and how urgently and where. And it's infinitely better and more productive than relying on a handful of elites in some distant bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stossel|Stossel, John]] (2011-02-10) [http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/10/spontaneous-order/singlepage Spontaneous Order], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Game studies===
The concept of spontaneous order is closely related with modern [[game studies]]. As early as the 1940s, historian [[Johan Huizinga]] wrote that "in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of civilized life have their origin: law and order, commerce and profit, craft and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primeval soil of play." Following on this in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'', Hayek notably wrote that "a game is indeed a clear instance of a process wherein obedience to common rules by elements pursuing different and even conflicting purposes results in overall order."

===Anarchism===
{{also|Self-organization#Principles|Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A}}
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] argue that the [[state (polity)|state]] is in fact an artificial creation of the ruling elite, and that true spontaneous order would arise if it was eliminated. Construed by some but not all as the ushering in of organization by [[anarchist law]]. In the anarchist view, such spontaneous order would involve the voluntary cooperation of individuals. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of Sociology'', "the work of many [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionists]] is largely compatible with the anarchist vision, since it harbours a view of society as spontaneous order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Gordon|title=Oxford Dictionary of Sociology |origyear=1994 |url= |edition=2 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-280081-7 |pages=19–20|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sobornost===
The concept of spontaneous order can also be seen in the works of the Russian [[Slavophile]] movements and specifically in the works of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The concept of an organic social manifestation as a concept in Russia expressed under the idea of [[sobornost]]. Sobornost was also used by [[Leo Tolstoy]] as an underpinning to the ideology of [[Christian anarchism]]. The concept was used to describe the uniting force behind the peasant or serf [[Obshchina]] in pre-Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion'' By Harold Joseph p. 388 Berman Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Religion and law {{ISBN|0-8028-4852-4}} https://books.google.com/books?id=j1208xA7F_0C&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;ots=p0N6U4zWbf&amp;pg=PA388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
Perhaps the most famous theorist of social spontaneous orders is [[Friedrich Hayek]]. In addition to arguing the economy is a spontaneous order, which he termed a [[catallaxy]], he argued that common law&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Liberty; Law, Legislation and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt; and the brain&lt;ref&gt;The Sensory Order&lt;/ref&gt; are also types of spontaneous orders. In "The Republic of Science,"&lt;ref&gt;http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/41.%20Polanyi_Republic_of_Science.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Polanyi]] also argued that science is a spontaneous order, a theory further developed by Bill Butos and Thomas McQuade in a variety of papers. Gus DiZerega has argued that [[democracy]] is the spontaneous order form of government,&lt;ref&gt;Persuasion, Power, and Polity&lt;/ref&gt; David Emmanuel Andersson has argued that religion in places like the United States is a spontaneous order,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Persuasion-Power-Polity-Democratic-Self-Organization/dp/1572732571/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302773406&amp;sr=1-4 |title=Persuasion, Power and Polity: A Theory of Democratic Self-Organization (Advances in Systems Theory, Complexity, and the Human Sciences) (9781572732575): Gus Dizerega, Alfonso Montuori: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2001-02-10 |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Troy Camplin argues that artistic and literary production are spontaneous orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studiesinemergentorder.org/current-issue/sieo3-195/ |title=pp.195-211: Troy Earl Camplin |publisher=Studies in Emergent Order |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]] too has contributed to spontaneous order theory in his book ''The Self-Organizing Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;The Self-Organizing Economy&lt;/ref&gt; in which he claims that cities are self-organizing systems. [[Credibility thesis]] suggests that the credibility of social institutions is the driving factor behind the endogenous self-organization of institutions and their persistence.&lt;ref name=Grabel&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grabel |first= Ilene |last2= |first2= |date= |title= The political economy of 'policy credibility': the new-classical macroeconomics and the remaking of emerging economies |url= http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/1.abstract |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1093/cje/24.1.1|access-date= 20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competitions between huge numbers of self-interested individuals will lead to many possible income distributions. Among all possible income distributions, exponential income distribution will occur with the highest probability.

The '''Tony Blair Faith Foundation''' was an [[Interfaith dialog|interfaith]] [[charitable foundation]] established in May 2008 by former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]]. Since December 2016 its work has been continued by the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]].&lt;ref name=G30/&gt;

==Launch==
The Foundation was launched in May 2008 in New York at the headquarters of the media group [[Time Warner]]. In his speech, Blair outlined the Foundation's aim that "idealism becomes the new realism", and that one of its goals was to "counter extremism in all six leading religions" (i.e., according to the Foundation, [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]]). Blair said that while in office, he feared being exposed as a "nutter" if he had talked about his religious views. Former US president [[Bill Clinton]] attended the launch, describing Blair as "a good man as well as a great leader". In an interview with [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]], Blair said the Foundation was "how I want to spend the rest of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm  "BBC News Blair launches faith foundation"], bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation listed several goals: "The foundation provides the practical support required to help prevent religious prejudice, conflict and extremism. At school, university and professional level the foundation provides various education programmes. The foundation encouraged interfaith initiatives to tackle global poverty and conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1123243&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation's basic premises, as listed in its initial mission statement, were that 1) faith is important to many, underpinning their systems of thought, their behaviour and the behaviour of many of the world's progressive movements, and that 2) the great religions share values of respect, justice and compassion. But the statement also recognised that faith can be divisive, too; this is viewed by the Foundation as being based on distortions of faith rather than being intrinsic to it.

The aim of the Foundation was to use the tools of modern communication to "educate, inform and develop understanding" about various faiths, and the relationships between them. It aimed to do this in such a way as to address [[Poverty|global poverty]] and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html "Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Mission statement"], Tonyblairfaithfoundation.org. Retrieved July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation had several projects: Faith and Globalisation Initiative, Face to Faith (later Generation Global), Faiths Act (an activist group), and Faith Shorts (for short religious films).

===Faith and Globalisation Initiative===
{{main|Faith and Globalisation Initiative}}

Faith and Globalisation Initiative launched in Yale University in September 2008 was an attempt to build a "global conversation" between an "elite group" of universities. As part of this attempt, Blair was to be the [[Howland Memorial Prize|Howland Distinguished Fellow]] at Yale and was one of the professors for the course.&lt;ref name=yale-20080321&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |title=Tony Blair to teach Yale course on faith and globalization |publisher=Yale Bulletin and Calendar |date=21 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418094320/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v36.n22/story1.html |archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face to Faith===
Face to Faith was a programme for schoolchildren (12–17 years) which allowed via videoconferencing international interaction where cross-faith discussions may take place. The proclaimed aim was to break down religious and cultural differences and thereby reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/page/about-face-to-faith The Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Face to Faith (Accessed March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faiths Act initiative===
Faiths Act was a project of the Foundation described as an attempt to build a global movement to both "inspire and mobilise" those who believe, in a faith, to address the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The project focused on deaths from [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faithsact.org/about/faiths-act  "Faiths Act"], FaithsAct.org. Retrieved 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith Shorts film project===
The project known as Faith Shorts was announced in March 2010 for short-length movies which increase "understanding between religions".&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb3/&gt;
Awards were presented for the films rated highest.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;

==Directors, executives and advisors==
Angela Salt was the Executive Director of the Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/foundation/leadership|title=Leadership|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was registered as charity in the UK with Tony Blair as its Patron. The trustees were [[Robert Clinton]], [[Robert Coke (investor)|Robert Coke]] and [[Jeremy Sinclair]]. The Foundation was also registered as a charity in the US with the following directors: [[Alfred E. Smith IV]], [[Philip Lader|Linda LeSourd Lader]], Ruth Turner, [[Timothy C. Collins]] and [[Tony Blair]]. [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]], formerly Director of Government Relations within Tony Blair's Prime Ministerial office, was the first Chief Executive.&lt;ref name=TBFwho/&gt;

=== International Religious Advisory Council ===
The Foundation had an International Religious Advisory Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/who-we-are/advisory-council.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222748/http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/who-we-are/advisory-council.html |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of members of what the Foundation considered to be the six major religions.

== Funding ==
A major contributor was [[Ukrainian oligarch]] [[Victor Pinchuk]] through his [[Victor Pinchuk Foundation]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-20130210&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9859780/Revealed-Tony-Blair-and-the-oligarch-bankrolling-his-charity.html |title=Revealed: Tony Blair and the oligarch bankrolling his charity |author=Robert Mendick, Edward Malnick |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2013 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20160122&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/ukrainian-oligarchs-settle-mine-dispute-worth-billions-out-of-court |title=Ukrainian oligarchs settle mine dispute worth billions out of court |author=Owen Bowcott, Shaun Walker |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 January 2016 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[Hugh O'Shaughnessy]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the Foundation "inspires ridicule". He noted that Professor [[Michel Schooyans]] of the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] "accused Blair and [[Cherie Blair|his wife]] of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/13/tony-blair-faith-foundation |title=Tony Blair's Faith Foundation inspires ridicule |author=Hugh O'Shaughnessy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant "stripping them of their identity". Schooyans arguing that "(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it. In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession, which a universal, global political power would impose on the entire world."&lt;ref name=guardian-20090513/&gt;

The director of the Muslim charity [[Forward Thinking (Charity)|Forward Thinking]], Huda Jawad was reported by the BBC as raising doubts about levels of support from many Muslims for the Foundation, given Blair's foreign-policy record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7994618.stm  "Tony Blair's faith in new mission"], by Christopher Landau, BBC, 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2009, sceptic and secularist [[Richard Dawkins]] mocked the Foundation in a spoof letter, published in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.  In it, Dawkins ridiculed the idea that faith is not a divisive force, and attacked religion's record on promoting dialogue and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2009/04/tony-blair-faith-children|title=The Tony Blair Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2008 and April 2009, the foundation raised more than 3.5 million pounds, and paid, according to the ''Daily Telegraph'', six-figure salaries to its top officials. An implied criticism was that these pay scales were in line with much larger charitable organisations. However, the wages were also reported to be the result of external recommendations and a strategy of hiring a small number of capable senior staff to co-ordinate a variety of efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/7229874/Tony-Blairs-faith-charity-pays-six-figure-salaries-to-top-officials.html "Tony Blair's faith charity pays six figure salaries to top officials"], Robert Mendick, ''The Telegraph'', 13 February 2010. Retrieved 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-20120201&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9052002/Tony-Blair-shows-how-faith-can-bring-millions-to-charity.html |title=Tony Blair shows how faith can bring millions to charity |author=Tim Walker |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former editor of a Foundation website, [[Martin Bright]], was critical of the organisation and its style. He mentioned the problems associated with the need to tiptoe around some of Tony Blair's business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf, his advising of the new government of Egypt being "a nightmare", the organisation's use of "ritzy offices in a West End tower block", the employment of a five-people in a communications department "whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible" and the use of unpaid interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714316/Inside-Blair-s-lair-Five-spin-doctors-ministerial-red-box-town-hall-meetings-doughnuts-deals-dictators-After-THAT-party-Cherie-former-ex-PM-employee-reveals-really-happens.html |title=Inside Blair's lair |newspaper=Mail on Sunday |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20140803&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/03/tony-blair-faith-foundation-charity-martin-bright-role |title=Tony Blair lambasted by former employee over role in own charity |author=Rowena Mason |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turks in Sweden''' or '''Swedish Turks''' ({{lang-sv|Turkar i Sverige}}; {{lang-tr|{{italics correction|İsveç Türkleri}}}}) are people of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ethnicity living in [[Sweden]], mostly of [[Macedonian Turks|Macedonian Turkish]] and [[Bulgarian Turks|Bulgarian Turkish]] descent and ancestry from the Balkan states of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] while another large remainder of the ([[Turkish people|Turkish]]) ethnic minority has immigrant ancestral roots in [[Turkey]] proper. 
According to the [[Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs]], there are 100,000 people in Sweden with a Turkish background, and a further 10,000 Swedish-Turks live in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=SwedishAffairs/&gt;

'''Wendy Lowenstein''' (Katherin Wendy Robertson Lowenstein) 1927—2006 was "a pioneer in oral history", an Australian historian, author and teacher notable for her recording of people's everyday experiences and her advocacy of social activism.

She pioneered oral history in Australia, with ''Weevils in the Flour'' in 1978 but she began collecting folklore and oral histories of early Australian working life in the 1960s.

Lowenstein experienced working life in different industries, as a proofreader, print and radio journalist, full-time mother, folklore collector, a teacher-librarian, a writer, an oral historian and a public speaker on working life and self-publishing.

==Oral history recordings==
The Lowenstein Oral History Collection consists of at least 741 hours of interviews recorded between 1969 and 1999. The interviews in the collection cover a diverse range of topics from the social effects of the 1930s Depression and working life in Australia to Children's Rhymes and Australian folklore, from [[Pearling in Western Australia|pearl luggers]] and the [[Gurindji strike]] and walk-off in Wave Hill to the [[1998 Australian waterfront dispute|Patrick's Waterside dispute]] at Melbourne Docklands in 1998.

==Topics recorded==

=== Australian outback interviews — 1969===
109 work(s); 126 hours

These works were recorded during a year-long collecting trip in 1969, when the Lowenstein family, (Werner and Wendy Lowenstein with their children, Peter, Martie and Richard) travelled around Australia. This was Wendy Lowenstein's first major collecting trip and many of the interviews were used as material for "Weevils in the Flour". However the collection, which consists of 126 hours of sound recordings also gives a vivid picture of Outback life in Northern Australia in 1969.

Copies are held in the Lowenstein Family Collection (LFC), the [[National Library of Australia|National Library]], the [[State Library of Victoria]] and some recordings are also available in libraries in Western Australia and Queensland.

==Published works based on oral history recordings==
Wendy Lowenstein is chiefly known for her written oral histories, which include ''The Immigrants'' 1977, ''Weevils in the Flour'' 1978 and ''Under The Hook'' 1992. Lowenstein is less well known for her recordings of  Australian folklore and her passionate commitment to interviewing everyday people about Australian working life. Her work concentrates on early manual labouring industries such as coal mining, cane cutting, northern cattle station work, waterside workers and the pearling industry. Lowenstein sought to record the worker's perspective in a range of industrial disputes over wages, and working conditions and "closed shop" worksites, where union membership was required to be employed. She has recorded interviews from strikes and

===  The Immigrants  ===
''by Wendy Lowenstein and Morag Loh, Hyland House, Melbourne, 1977.''

This book tells the experiences of 17 immigrants who came to Australia in living memory, who tell their story in their own words. Foreword by Professor Henry Mayer, University of Sydney states  " It is the authors' achievement to have translated these immigrant and human voices into vivid print."

=== Weevils in the flour===
''by Wendy Lowenstein, Hyland House/Scribe 1978''

'''''Weevils in the Flour: An oral record of the 1930s depression in Australia''''' is Lowenstein's best-known book. Published in 1978, it was an immediate best seller and was awarded the Royal Blind Society's first Talking Book of the  Year in 1980. The foreword of ''Weevils in the Flour'' was written by [[Manning Clark|Professor Manning Clark]] [http://manningclark.org.au/html/About_Manning-Dymphna_Clark.html]

[[Russel Ward|Professor Russel Ward]], reviewing Lowenstein's book in "The Age" said,&lt;br /&gt;
:''"This great book on the depression is so good, it is impossible to praise it sufficiently without sounding absurd."''

=== Under the hook===
''by Wendy Lowenstein &amp; Tom Hills'' Bookworkers Press

'''''Under the Hook – Melbourne Waterside Workers'Remember 1900–1998''''' is an oral history written in the words of the rank and file wharfies. Whilst interviewing for Weevils in the Flour, Lowenstein met veteran  Melbourne wharfie  Tom  Hills. With Hills collaboration "Under the Hook: Melbourne waterside workers remember 1900–1998", was self-published under her Bookworkers' Press imprint. Whilst the mechanised waterfront in Melbourne employed far fewer wharfies, ''Under the Hook'' was almost sold out. The first edition covered the period from 1900 – 1980.

The making of this history of working on the Melbourne waterfront was featured in an episode of '''ABC Big Country'''[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigcountry/] called '''''Lowenstein and Hills'''''. To view this {{YouTube|z4iUWT9YZTU|episode}}

During the lock-out of the "Patrick's dispute", the Maritime Union workers picketing East Swanston dock asked Lowenstein to record them "making history". This revised and updated 2nd edition of "Under the Hook" which included interviews during the "Patricks" dispute of 1998.

:''"On the night of 7 April 1998, Patrick Stevedores boss Chris Corrigan sacked his entire workforce, locked them out and set up new companies to employ a non-unionised workforce, trained in Dubai. After a protracted and bitter 14-day lock-out .... Justice Tony North ordered the reinstatement of rights for the 1,400 sacked Maritime Union of Australia waterside workers."'' [http://www.abc.net.au/archives/80days/stories/2012/01/19/3412096.htm]

=== Weevils at work===
description and information to be added

The recordings associated with ''Weevils at Work'' include the 80 interviews Lowenstein recorded in Pannawonica and Robe River in 1986 – 1988 during the Pekoe Wallsend industrial dispute. These recordings give a vivid picture of working life, changes in working conditions, family life, and the community which were all divided and affected by the prolonged dispute in Robe River W.A. These recordings are held in the Lowenstein Family Collection.

=== Miscellaneous publications===

'''1. Shocking Shocking Shocking'''
:''by Wendy Lowenstein 19??''

:''Shocking, Shocking, Shocking'' is a self-published collection of improper Australian children's play-rhymes. She was co-author of '''Cinderella Dressed in Yella''' (with Ian  Turner and June  Factor,  Heinneman).  The rhymes Lowenstein collected, when included in  ''Cinderella Dressed in Yella'', led to the first edition being banned from the post!

'''2. Self Publishing Without Pain'''
:''by Wendy Lowenstein 19??''

:In 1990, Lowenstein wrote and self-published ''Self-Publishing Without Pain'' (with M.Saint-Ferjeux),1990.  She says "Other books in the field concentrate on what should happen. Mine concentrates on what it's really like, and what can, and only too often does happen to the novice, in the tricky world of  printers and deadlines the day before yesterday."

'''3. Ron Edwards'''

:In 1991, she spent some time interviewing Ron Edwards of  North Queensland for the National Library, and has written a short life of Edwards, published in AARL, March 1992.

==Social activism==
Wendy  Lowenstein was a social activist most of her life. In 1955, Lowenstein co-founded the Folk Lore Society of Victoria with Ian Turner and she contributed to and edited the Folk Lore Society of Victoria's magazine Gumsucker's Gazette, later Australian Tradition, for fifteen years. Shirley Andrews (Chairperson) and Wendy Lowenstein worked together on the committee which organised the first Festival was held in Melbourne in 1967.

She worked voluntarily for organisations such as People for Nuclear Disarmament and Arts Action for Peace, and protested vigorously whenever she felt funding cutbacks affected culture and the Arts.

'''White Kenyans''' are those born in or resident in [[Kenya]] who descend from [[Europeans]] and/or identify themselves as [[White people|White]]. There is currently a minor but relatively prominent white community in Kenya, mainly descended from [[British people|British]], but also to a lesser extent Italian and Greek, migrants dating from the [[Kenya Colony|colonial period]].

==History==
The [[Age of Discovery]] first led to European interaction with the region of present-day Kenya. The coastal regions were seen as a valuable foothold in eastern trade routes, and [[Mombasa]] became a key port for ivory. The Portuguese established a presence in the region for two hundred years between 1498–1698, before losing control of the coast to the Sultans of Oman.

European exploration of the interior commenced in 1844 when two German missionaries, [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] and [[Johannes Rebmann]], ventured inland with the aim of spreading Christianity. The region soon sparked the imagination of other adventurers, and gradually their stories began to awaken their governments to the potential of the area.

The rise of [[New Imperialism]] in the late 19th century, intensified European interest in the region. The initial driving force lay with pioneering businessmen, such as [[Carl Peters]] and [[Sir William Mackinnon, 1st Baronet|William Mackinnon]] seeking to establish lucrative trade routes in the region. These businessmen would compel their respective governments to protect their trading interests, and in 1885 eastern Africa was carved-up between Britain, Germany and France. The British assumed control of the regions of Kenya and Uganda, and governed it through the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]]. In 1895, administration was transferred to the [[Foreign Office]], and the [[East Africa Protectorate]] was established.

===East Africa Protectorate===
Having acquired Kenya and Uganda, the British sought to develop infrastructure and link the coast to [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Uganda Railway]] serves as a lasting legacy of this ambition. The railway opened up much of the Kenyan interior to European settlement, and in 1899 British pioneers established [[Nairobi]] as a settler outpost. The period saw an influx of European settlers and farmers seeking to make a fortune, most notably the British peer [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]]. Many{{Who?|date=July 2018}} of these settlers imagined an "empty" Africa where they hoped to recreate a society that mirrored their fantasy of manorial Europe, where they would rule as lords and Africans would serve as retainers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1903 there were just fewer than 400 European settlers in British East Africa; by 1912 about 1000. The British government offered 99- and 999-year leases to encourage settlement, as well as land tax exemption into the 1930s. The state also subsidized white farmers' produce so that black smallholders could not compete in open markets. Although large stretches of Kenya at the time were sparsely populated, European colonists ended up settling in one of the most heavily occupied regions, alienating local farmers with the aid of the colonial state. From the beginning, European settlement dispossessed Africans, both through legal and extra-legal means, with a discourse arguing that WaKamba, Gikuyu, and Embu had no title to the land, as they had not improved it or were "nomadic tribes." Many were crowded onto "Native Reserves"; some populations came back to their original homes to be classified as "squatters" and often then served as labor on colonists' plantations. Europeans typically acquired plantation estates covering five hundred acres, most of which then fell fallow. The inexpensiveness of the land (as little as 1d./acre) led to many land purchases by speculators.

===Kenya Colony===
Life for Europeans in Kenya during this time would later be immortalised in [[Karen Blixen]]'s memoir ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The presence of herds of elephants and zebra, and other wild animals on these estates drew wealthy aristocracy from Europe and America, who came attracted by big game hunting. Nairobi was sharply segregated. More than 30,000 South Asian settlers came to Kenya from British India, but they were legally barred from purchasing real estate in the White Highlands.
[[File:Flag of British East Africa.png|thumb|Flag of British East Africa]]
Land alienation, forced labor, and African participation in higher education, bureaucratic institutions, and the First World War helped spark a substantive Kenyan nationalist movement in the 1920s. Leaders such as [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and Harry Thuku highlighted a view of an unjust political and social situation for the vast majority of Kenyans. Following [[World War II]], some Kenyans began a violent anti-colonial campaign centered largely on the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] known as the [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. The deaths of dozens of European settlers and their African servants, triggered a war with the British government that resulted in twenty thousand Kenyan dead. British counter-insurgency tactics included forcibly relocating civilians into "villagisation" schemes, and detaining and torturing Mau Mau suspects in prison camps.

===Independence===
By the early 1960s, Britain's political willingness to maintain Kenya as a colony was in decline and in 1962 [[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|the Lancaster House agreement]] set a date for Kenya's independence. Realising that a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] course like [[Rhodesia]]'s was not possible after the [[Mau-Mau]] uprising, the majority of the 60,000 white settlers considered emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/26/kenya.chrismcgreal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Chris | last=McGreal | title=A lost world | date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Indians in Kenya|Kenyan Asians]], Europeans and their descendants were given the choice of retaining their British passports and suffering a diminution in rights, or acquiring new Kenyan passports. Few chose to acquire citizenship, and many white Kenyans departed the country. The [[World Bank]] led a willing-buyer-willing-seller scheme, known as the 'million acre' scheme that was largely financed by secret British subsidies. The scheme saw the redistribution of swathes of white-owned farmland to the newly prosperous Kikuyu elite.

There were an estimated 41,500 white people in Kenya as of 2009, of which 7,600 were Kenya citizens &lt;ref&gt;https://www.knbs.or.ke/ethnic-affiliation/&lt;/ref&gt; . The proportion that are Kenya citizens has likely increased due to the implementation of dual nationality in 2010. There are also British citizens  residing in Kenya who may be of any race; according to the [[BBC]], they numbered at about 32,000 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|title=Brits Abroad: Country-by-country|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomics==
Economically, virtually all Europeans in Kenya belong to the middle- and upper-middle-class. They formerly clustered in the country's highland region, the so-called '[[White Highlands]]', where the Cholmondeley ([[Baron Delamere|Delamere]]) family, as one of the few remaining white landowners, still owns over 100,000 acres (400&amp;nbsp;km²) of farmland (mainly the vast Soysambu Estate) in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]]. Nowadays, only a small minority of them still are landowners (livestock and game ranchers, horticulturists and farmers), whereas the majority work in the tertiary sector: in finance, import, air transport, and hospitality.

==Societal integration==
Apart from isolated individuals such as anthropologist and conservationist [[Richard Leakey]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], who has retired, Kenyan white people have virtually completely retreated from Kenyan politics, and are no longer represented in public service and parastatals, from which the last remaining staff from colonial times retired in the 1970s.

The recent homicide case of the white Kenyan dairy and livestock farmer and game rancher, Hon. [[Thomas P. G. Cholmondeley|Thomas Cholmondeley]], a descendant of British [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]], has brought into question the class bias of the [[judicial system]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country and the resentment of many [[Kenyans]] toward what is perceived as [[white privilege]]. The book and movie ''[[White Mischief (film)|White Mischief]]'' told the tale slightly involving an earlier member of the Cholmondeley family, [[Thomas Cholmondeley, 4th Baron Delamere|The 4th Baron Delamere]] (popularly known as Tom Delamere), who was married to Diana Broughton, whose lover was murdered in Nairobi in the 1940s. Her first husband was tried and acquitted.

== Controversy associated with "the Happy Valley set" ==
The "[[Happy Valley set]]" was largely a group of hedonistic British and [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and adventurers who settled in the [[Happy Valley, Kenya|Happy Valley]] region of the [[Wanjohi Valley]] near the [[Aberdare Range|Aberdare mountain range]], in the colonies of Kenya and Uganda between the 1920s and the 1940s. From the 1930s the group became infamous for its decadent lifestyles and exploits following reports of drug use and sexual promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/text/articles/2009/05/15/1242335880376.html Storm clouds over Happy Valley] The Telegraph. 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around [[Naivasha]] was one of the first to be settled in Kenya by white people and was one of the main hunting grounds of the 'set'.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The colonial town of [[Nyeri|Nyeri, Kenya]], to the east of the Aberdare Range, was the centre of Happy Valley settlers.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The white community in Kenya in the years before the [[Second World War]] was divided into two distinct factions: settlers, on the one side, and colonial officials and tradesmen, on the other. Both were dominated by upper-middle-class and upper-class British and Irish (chiefly [[Anglo-Irish]]) people, but the two groups often disagreed on important matters ranging from land allocation to how to deal with the natives. Typically, the officials and tradesmen looked on the Happy Valley set with embarrassment.

The height of the Happy Valley set's influence was in the late 1920s. The recession sparked by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Wall Street stock market crash]] greatly decreased the number of new arrivals to the [[Colony of Kenya]] and the influx of capital. Nevertheless, by 1939 Kenya had a white community of 21,000 people.

Some of the members (some described below) of the Happy Valley set were: 
[[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|The 3rd Baron Delamere]] and his son and heir [[Thomas Cholmondeley, 4th Baron Delamere|The 4th Baron Delamere]]; The Hon. [[Denys Finch Hatton]]; The Hon. [[Berkeley Cole]] (an [[Anglo-Irish]] nobleman from [[Ulster]]); [[Sir (Henry) John Delves Broughton, 11th Bt|Sir Jock Delves Broughton]], 11th [[Baronet|Bt.]]; [[Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll|The 22nd Earl of Erroll]]; Lady [[Idina Sackville]]; [[Alice de Janzé]] (cousin of [[J. Ogden Armour]]); [[Happy Valley set#Count Frédéric de Janzé|Frédéric de Janzé]]; [[Happy Valley set#Diana, Lady Delamere|Lady Diana Delves Broughton]]; [[Gilbert Colville]]; Hugh Dickenson; [[Jack Soames]]; [[Nina Soames]]; [[Lady June Carberry]] (stepmother of [[Juanita Carberry]]); [[Dickie Pembroke]]; and [[Julian Lezzard]]. Author [[Baroness]] [[Karen Blixen]] ([[Isak Dinesen]]) had also been a friend of Lord Erroll.

In recent years, descendants of the Happy Valley set have been appearing in the news, particularly the legal troubles of The Hon. [[Thomas P.G. Cholmondeley|Tom Cholmondeley]], the great-grandson of the famous [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Whitey Krakow''' or '''Krakower''' (died July 30, 1941) was a New York mobster who served as a hitman for [[Murder, Inc.]] during the 1930s. Because he had the same surname as Edith Krakower, the wife of fellow Murder, Inc. member [[Bugsy Siegel|Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/bugsy-siegel.html Bugsy Siegel] at http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Whitey was sometimes misidentified as her brother and Bugsy's brother-in-law when, in fact, he was not related to either of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://brustman.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bhns08.pdf] at https://brustman.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bhns08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Siegel and [[Frankie Carbo]], Whitey was suspected of the 1939 gangland slaying of [[Harry Greenberg|Harry "Big Greenie" Greenberg]]. Later implicated by fellow Murder, Inc. members [[Abe Reles|Abe "Kid Twist" Reles]] and [[Albert Tannenbaum|Allie "Tick Tock" Tannenbaum]], he was found shot to death on Manhattan's [[Delancey Street]] on July 30, 1941, one of the first members of Murder, Inc. to himself be murdered, although he was not the only one. In the months around his death, [[Benjamin Tannenbaum]], Sidney "Shimmy" Salles, Tony Romanello, and possibly James "Dizzy" Ferraco, were also murdered.  After this spate of killings, members of Murder, Inc. began surrendering to authorities.

==== Women's History Week ====
In the United States, Women's History Month traces its beginnings back to the first [[International Women's Day]] in 1911.  In 1978, the [[school district]] of [[Sonoma, California]] participated in [[Women's History Week]], an event designed around the week of March 8 (International Women's Day). In 1979 a fifteen-day conference about women's history was held at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] from July 13 until July 29, chaired by historian [[Gerda Lerner]].&lt;ref name="JWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/jul/18/1979/gerda-lerner |title=This Week in History – Pioneering women's history summer institute, July 18, 1979 |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWHP"&gt;{{cite web|first=Molly Murphy |last=MacGregor |url=http://www.nwhp.org/whm/history.php |title=History of National Women's History Month |publisher=National Women's History Project |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-sponsored by Sarah Lawrence College, the [[Women's Action Alliance]], and the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name="JWA"/&gt; When its participants learned about the success of the Sonoma County's Women's History Week celebration, they decided to initiate similar celebrations within their own organizations, communities, and school districts.&lt;ref name="NWHP"/&gt; They also agreed to support an effort to secure a National Women's History Week.&lt;ref name="NWHP"/&gt;  

In February 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued a presidential proclamation declaring the week of March 8, 1980, as National Women's History Week.&lt;ref name="NWHP"/&gt; The proclamation stated, "From the first settlers who came to our shores, from the first American Indian families who befriended them, men and women have worked together to build this nation. Too often the women were unsung and sometimes their contributions went unnoticed. But the achievements, leadership, courage, strength and love of the women who built America was as vital as that of the men whose names we know so well. As Dr. [[Gerda Lerner]] has noted, 'Women’s History is Women’s Right.' It is an essential and indispensable heritage from which we can draw pride, comfort, courage, and long-range vision. I ask my fellow Americans to recognize this heritage with appropriate activities during National Women’s History Week, March 2–8, 1980. I urge libraries, schools, and community organizations to focus their observances on the leaders who struggled for equality –[[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Lucy Stone]], [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Alice Paul]]. Understanding the true history of our country will help us to comprehend the need for full equality under the law for all our people. This goal can be achieved by ratifying the 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that 'Equality of Rights under the Law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.'"&lt;ref name="NWHP"/&gt; Carter was referring to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which was never ratified, not to the amendment which did become the 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution after his presidency.

In 1981, responding to the growing popularity of Women's History Week, Sen. [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-[[Utah]]) and Rep [[Barbara Mikulski]] (D-[[Maryland]]) co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution proclaiming a Women's History Week. Congress passed their resolution as [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-95/pdf/STATUTE-95-Pg148.pdf Pub. L. 97-28], which authorized and requested the President to proclaim the week beginning March 7, 1982 as “Women’s History Week."&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistorymonth.gov/about.html |title=About: Women's History Month |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the next several years, Congress continued to pass joint resolutions designating a week in March as Women’s History Week.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Schools across the country also began to have their own local celebrations of Women's History Week and even Women's History Month. By 1986, fourteen states had declared March as Women's History Month.&lt;ref name="NWHP"/&gt;

==== Women's History Month ====
In 1987, after being petitioned by the [[National Women's History Project]], Congress passed [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-101/pdf/STATUTE-101-Pg99.pdf Pub. L. 100-9] which designated the month of March 1987 as Women’s History Month.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Between 1988 and 1994, Congress passed additional resolutions requesting and authorizing the President to proclaim March of each year as Women’s History Month.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Since 1988, U.S. presidents have issued annual proclamations designating the month of March as Women’s History Month.

State departments of education also began to encourage celebrations of Women's History Month as a way to promote equality among the sexes in the classroom.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Alaska]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], and other states developed and distributed curriculum materials in all of their public schools, which prompted educational events such as essay contests. Within a few years, thousands of schools and communities began to celebrate of Women's History Month.  They planned engaging and stimulating programs about women's roles in history and society, with support and encouragement from governors, city councils, school boards, and the U.S. Congress.

In March 2011, the Obama administration released a report, ''Women in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being'',&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170119025352/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/Women_in_America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; showing women's status in the U.S. in 2011 and how it had changed over time.&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/01/white-house-releases-first-comprehensive-federal-report-status-american- |title=White House Releases First Comprehensive Federal Report on the Status of American Women in Almost 50 Years |publisher=The White House |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was the first comprehensive federal report on women since the report produced by the [[Commission on the Status of Women]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"/&gt;

Some organizations have issued statements marking Women's History Month, for example the [[Republican National Committee]] and the [[Democratic National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gop.com/general/rnc-statement-on-womens-history-month/|title=RNC Statement on Women’s History Month|work=GOP|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democrats.org/news/press/dnc_chair_debbie_wasserman_schultz_celebrates_womens_history_month_we_cant DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz Celebrates Women’s History Month: “We Can’t Stop Now” | Democrats.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in History in America recently sponsored hearings in many parts of the country. The Women's Progress Commission will soon conduct hearings to promote interest in preserving areas that are relevant in American women's history. Some of the groups promoting this interest are state historical societies, women's organizations, and groups such as the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

===In Canada===
Women's History Month was proclaimed in Canada in 1992, where its purpose is to give Canadians "an opportunity to learn about the important contributions of women and girls to our society – and to the quality of our lives today".&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt; October was chosen to coincide with the celebration of the anniversary on October 18 of the decision of the court case [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)|Edwards v. Canada]], more commonly known as the Persons Case, in which it was established that Canadian women were eligible to be appointed [[Senate of Canada|senators]] and in general had the same rights as Canadian men with respect to positions of political power.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1929/1929_86.html Henrietta Muir Edwards and others (Appeal No. 121 of 1928) v The Attorney General of Canada (Canada)]'' [1929] UKPC 86, [1930] AC 124. Accessed March 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Australia===
Women's History Month was first celebrated in Australia in 2000, initiated by Helen Leonard, convenor of the National Women's Media Centre, working with the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]]. The organisation of annual Women's History Month celebrations is incorporated as part of the work of the [[Australian Women's History Forum]].

====Annual themes====
Since 2005, the annual celebration of Women's History Month in Australia has centred on a different area of women's achievement. Promotional materials and events are focused around the theme and organisations, institutions and community groups are encouraged to use this theme for their own events.

===In the UK===
Women's History Month was celebrated in the UK in 2011 and 2012. A [http://www.womenshistorymonth.org.uk/ website] was set up but has since apparently been abandoned.

==Recent impact==
The popularity of women's history celebrations continues to spread as more people are becoming aware of the contributions of women and girls. A President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in History in America recently sponsored hearings in many parts of the country. The Women's Progress Commission will soon conduct hearings to promote interest in preserving areas that are relevant in American women's history. Some of the groups promoting this interest are state historical societies, women's organizations, and groups such as the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3830">Women began finding work when [[World War I]] began in 1914; they had to take the jobs of men who had gone to war. A wide range of jobs needed filling. Automotive machines were in large production around this time to supply the United States and other countries with vehicles for war. This was the start of women playing important roles in the automotive industry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.striking-women.org/module/women-and-work/world-war-i-1914-1918&lt;/ref&gt;

As at 2016, only 11% of the global workforce in the automotive industry were women, with large national industries such as Japan facing shortages in female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/inside-seat/2016/oct/21/engineering-change-for-women-in-the-car-industry|title=Engineering change for women in the car industry|date=2016-10-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-10/japan-s-carmakers-have-got-a-problem-with-women|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable women linked to the automotive industry==

* [[Florence Lawrence]] - Actress and car enthusiast born in 1886. Lawrence was the first person to develop for herself what we now call "[[turn signal]]s".&lt;ref name="NYTG"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/who-made-that-turn-signal.html |title=Who Made That Turn Signal? |date=12 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using flags on either side of the car, she could remotely lift them to signal that she was turning a certain direction. This had never been seen before, and is now such a crucial mechanic that using turn signals is part of the United States' driving laws. Lawrence was also the first to come up with a system to alert drivers behind her that she was slowing down, by holding a sign out of the driver's side window that read "Stop".&lt;ref name="NYTG" /&gt; Although Lawrence never patented this, she is still given credit for playing an important role which has lasted into modern-day automotive design. 

*[[Charlotte Bridgwood]] - Mother of Florence Lawrence and automotive enthusiast. Bridgwood was responsible for developing the [[windshield wiper]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="NYTG" /&gt;

{{Yoruba people}}
The '''Yorùbá people''' (name spelled also: '''Ioruba''' or '''Joruba'''; {{Lang-yo| Ìran Yorùbá|lit=}}) are a [[Niger-Congo]] ethnic group of southwestern and north-central [[Nigeria]], as well as southern and central [[Benin]]. Together, these regions are known as [[Yorubaland]]. The Yoruba constitute about 44 million people in total. Majority of this population is from Nigeria, where the Yorùbá make up 21% of the country's population, according to the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'',&lt;ref name="Nigeria CIA"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html Nigeria] at CIA World Factbook: "Yoruba 21%" out of a population of 197.8 million&lt;/ref&gt; making them one of the largest [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|ethnic groups in Africa]]. Most Yoruba people speak the [[Yoruba language]], which is [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], and is the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] language with the largest number of native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Benue-Congo-languages|title=Benue-Congo languages|author= John T. Bendor-Samuel|website=Encyclopaedeia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yorùbá share borders with the very closely related [[Itsekiri]] to the south-east in the North West Niger delta, [[Bariba people|Bariba]] to the northwest in Benin, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]] to the north and the [[Ebira]] to the northeast in central Nigeria. To the east are the [[Edo people|Edo]], [[Ẹsan]] and the [[Afemai]] groups in mid-western Nigeria. Adjacent to the Ebira and Edo groups are the related [[Igala people|Igala]] people found in the northeast, on the left bank of the [[Niger River]]. To the southwest are the [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] speaking [[Mahi people|Mahi]], [[Egun]], [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]] who border Yoruba communities in Benin and Togo. To the southeast are [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] who live in the north-west end of the [[Niger delta]]. They are ancestrally related to the Yoruba but chose to maintain a distinct cultural identity. Significant Yoruba populations in other West African countries can be found in [[Ghana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eiQHFrA7GUwC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Yoruba+people+Ghana| page=72|isbn=978-1-4670-2480-8|title=Contributions of Yoruba people in the Economic &amp; Political Developments of Nigeria|date=12 October 2011|publisher=Authorhouse|author=Jacob Oluwatayo Adeuyan|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IjlzSYnAKdQC&amp;dq=Yoruba+in+Ghana|title=Strangers and Traders: Yoruba Migrants, Markets, and the State in Northern Ghana Volume 11 of International African library|issn=0951-1377|author=Jeremy Seymour Eades|publisher=Africa World Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-86543-419-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=African Research Review|author=Adeshina Yusuf Raji|author2=P.F.

The [[Yoruba people#The Yoruba diaspora|Yoruba diaspora]] consists of two main groupings; one of them includes relatively recent migrants, the majority of which moved to the United Kingdom and the United States after major economic and political changes in the 1960s to 1980s.

==Etymology==
As an ethnic description, the word "Yoruba" (or more correctly, “Ya raba”) was originally in reference to the [[Oyo Empire]] and is the usual Hausa name for Oyo people as noted by [https://archive.org/stream/journalofseconde00inclap#page/n7/mode/2up Clapperton, Hugh; Lander, Richard (1829)]. It was therefore popularized by Hausa usage&lt;ref name="trinidad"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2q5o25NNfcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=|title=Trinidad Yoruba: From Mother Tongue to Memory|author=Maureen Warner-Lewis|page=20|isbn=978-976-640-054-5|publisher=University of the West Indies|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethnography written in [[Ajami script|Ajami]] during the 19th century by sultan [[Muhammad Bello]]. The extension of the term to all speakers of dialects related to the language of the Oyo (in modern terminology North-West Yoruba) dates to the second half of the 19th century. It is due to the influence of Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], the first Anglican bishop in Nigeria. Crowther was himself an Oyo Yoruba and compiled the first Yoruba dictionary as well as introducing a standard for Yoruba orthography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx0F6zZUfwC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=|title=The Black Urban Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade (The Early Modern Americas)|author1=Jorge Canizares-Esguerra|author2=Matt D.

"good morning", ''Ẹ kú alẹ?'' "good evening") has survived in certain parts of their diaspora as a self-descriptive, especially in Sierra Leone&lt;ref name="trinidad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintleo.edu/media/131009/aihiokhai-ancestors-saint.pdf|title=Ancestorhood in Yoruba Religion and Sainthood in Christianity:Envisioning an Ecological Awareness and Responsibility|author=SimonMary A.

==Language==
{{main|Yoruba language}}
The Yoruba culture was originally an oral tradition, and the majority of Yoruba people are native speakers of the Yoruba language. The number of speakers is roughly estimated at about 30 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;The number of speakers of Yoruba was estimated at around 20 million people in the 1990s.  No reliable estimate of more recent date is known. ''Metzler Lexikon Sprache'' (4th ed. 2010) estimates roughly 30 million based on population growth figures during the 1990s and 2000s. The [[demographics of Nigeria|population of Nigeria]] (where the majority of Yoruba live) has grown by 44% between 1995 and 2010, so that the Metzler estimate for 2010 appears plausible.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoruba is classified within the [[Edekiri languages]], which together with the isolate [[Igala language|Igala]], form the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] group of languages within the [[Volta–Niger languages|Volta-Niger]] branch of the [[Niger-Congo]] family. Igala and Yoruba have important historical and cultural relationships. The languages of the two ethnic groups bear such a close resemblance that researchers such as Forde (1951) and Westermann and Bryan (1952) regarded Igala as a dialect of Yoruba.

The Yoruboid languages are assumed to have developed out of an undifferentiated Volta-Niger group by the 1st millennium BCE.
There are three major dialect areas: Northwest, Central, and Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;This widely followed classification is based on Adetugbọ's (1982) dialectological study — the classification originated in his 1967 PhD thesis ''The Yoruba Language in Western Nigeria: Its Major Dialect Areas''. See also Adetugbọ 1973:183–193.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the North-West Yoruba dialects show more linguistic innovation, combined with the fact that Southeast and Central Yoruba areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date of immigration for Northwest Yoruba.&lt;ref&gt;Adetugbọ 1973:192-3. (See also the section [[#Dialects|Dialects]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The area where North-West Yoruba (NWY) is spoken corresponds to the historical [[Oyo Empire]].
South-East Yoruba (SEY) was probably associated with the expansion of the [[Benin Empire]] after c. 1450.&lt;ref&gt;Adetugbọ 1973:185.&lt;/ref&gt;
Central Yoruba forms a transitional area in that the lexicon has much in common with NWY, whereas it shares many ethnographical features with SEY.

Literary Yoruba, the standard variety taught in schools and spoken by newsreaders on the radio, has its origin in the Yoruba grammar compiled in the 1850s by Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], who himself was a creole from Sierra Leone. Though for a large part based on the Oyo and Ibadan dialects, it incorporates several features from other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugbọ (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): "While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Abẹokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the Ọyọ-Ibadan dialects".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Yoruba people}}
{{further|Ife}}

[[File:HistoYoruba.jpeg|left|thumb|Some Yoruba cities of the [[Middle Ages]]]]

As of the 7th century [[BCE]] the African peoples who lived in [[Yorubaland]] were not initially known as the Yoruba, although they shared a common ethnicity and language group. By the 8th century, a powerful Yoruba kingdom already existed in [[Ile-Ife]], one of the earliest in Africa.

The historical Yoruba develop ''in situ'', out of earlier Mesolithic [[Volta-Niger]] populations, by the 1st millennium BCE. Oral history recorded under the [[Oyo Empire]] derives the Yoruba as an ethnic group from the population of the older kingdom of Ile-Ife. The Yoruba were the dominant cultural force in southern Nigeria as far back as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=466fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Yoruba+civilisation&amp;dq=Yoruba+civilisation|page=323|title=When We Ruled: The Ancient and Mediœval History of Black Civilisations|author=Robin Walker|publisher=Every Generation Media (Indiana University)|year=2006|isbn=978-0-9551068-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoruba are among the most urbanized people in Africa. For centuries before the arrival of the British colonial administration most Yoruba already lived in well structured urban centres organized around powerful city-states (''Ìlú'') centred around the residence of the ''Oba''.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKIaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=African Voices on Slavery and the Slave Trade: Volume 1, The Sources|author1=Alice Bellagamba|author2=Sandra E. Greene|author3=Martin A. Klein|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-521-19470-9|pages=150, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, most of these cities were fortresses, with high walls and gates. Yoruba cities have always been among the most populous in Africa. Archaeological findings indicate that Òyó-Ilé or Katunga, capital of the Yoruba empire of Oyo (fl. between the 11th and 19th centuries CE), had a population of over 100,000 people (the largest single population of any African settlement at that time in history). For a long time also, [[Ibadan]], one of the major Yoruba cities, was the largest city in the whole of Sub Saharan Africa. Today, [[Lagos]] ({{Lang-yo|Èkó}}), another major Yoruba city, with a population of over twenty million, remains the largest on the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=https://archive.org/stream/aspectinyorubani00jnti/aspectinyorubani00jnti_djvu.txt|degree=PH.D|title=ASPECT IN YORUBA AND NIGERIAN ENGLISH|first=Timothy Temilola|last=Ajayi|publisher=University of Florida|year=2001|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologically, the settlement of Ile-Ife showed features of urbanism in the 12th–14th century era. In the period around 1300 CE the artists at Ile-Ife developed a refined and naturalistic [[sculptural]] tradition in [[terracotta]], [[stone]] and copper alloy - [[copper]], [[brass]], and [[bronze]] many of which appear to have been created under the patronage of King Obalufon II, the man who today is identified as the Yoruba patron deity of brass casting, weaving and regalia.&lt;ref name="Blier Art and Risk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blier|first=Suzanne Preston|title=Art and Risk in Ancient Yoruba: Ife History, Politics, and Identity c. 1300|date=2015| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02166-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty of kings at Ile-Ife, which is regarded by the Yoruba as the place of origin of human civilization, remains intact to this day.

===Oyo and Ile-Ife===
[[File:Cabeza de rey (ciudad yoruba).jpg|thumb|left|Brass head from [[Ife]], 12th century]]

Ife continues to be seen as the "[[Holy city|Spiritual Homeland]]" of the Yoruba. The city was surpassed by the [[Oyo Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Peoples of Africa, Volume 1|first1=Fiona|last1=MacDonald|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Paren|first3=Kevin|last3=Shillington|first4=Gillian|last4=Stacey|first5=Philip|last5= Steele|page=385|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2000|isbn=0-7614-7158-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=joh5yHfcF-8C&amp;pg=PA385}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the dominant Yoruba military and political power in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437048/Oyo-empire Oyo Empire] at Britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oyo Empire under its oba, known as the Alaafin of Oyo, was active in the [[African slave trade]] during the 18th century. The Yoruba often demanded slaves as a form of tribute of subject populations, who in turn sometimes made war on other peoples to capture the required slaves. Part of the slaves sold by the Oyo Empire entered the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thornton |first=John |year=1998 |title=Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400–1800 |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=122, 304–311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alpern |first=Stanley B. |year=1998 |title=Amazons of Black Sparta: The Women Warriors of Dahomey |publisher=New York University Press |page=34 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the city states were controlled by [[Oba (ruler)|Obas]] (or royal sovereigns with various individual titles) and councils made up of [[Oba (ruler)#Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba|Oloyes]], recognised leaders of royal, noble and, often, even common descent, who joined them in ruling over the kingdoms through a series of guilds and cults. Different states saw differing ratios of power between the kingships and the chiefs' councils. Some, such as Oyo, had powerful, autocratic monarchs with almost total control, while in others such as the Ijebu city-states, the senatorial councils held more influence and the power of the ruler or ''Ọba'', referred to as the Awujale of Ijebuland, was more limited.&lt;ref name=civilisation/&gt;

Yoruba settlements are often described as primarily one or more of the main social groupings called "generations":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAoOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=|title=Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria (Volume 9, Issues 2-4)|author=Historical Society of Nigeria|publisher=The Society (Indiana University)|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "first generation" includes towns and cities known as original capitals of founding Yoruba kingdoms or states.
* The "second generation" consists of settlements created by conquest.
* The "third generation" consists of villages and municipalities that emerged following the internecine wars of the 19th century.

==Pre-colonial government of Yoruba society==
[[File:Yorubaland Cultural Area of West Africa.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Yorubaland Cultural Area of West Africa]]{{Main|Yorubaland}}{{See also|Oyo Empire#Political Structure}}

===Government===
[[File:Oyoxviii.jpeg|thumb|[[Oyo Empire]] and surrounding states]]

Monarchies were a common form of government in Yorubaland, but they were not the only approach to government and social organization. The numerous [[Ijebu]] city-states to the west of Oyo and the [[Egba people|Ẹgba]] communities, found in the forests below Ọyọ's savanna region, were notable exceptions. These independent polities often elected an ''Ọba'', though real political, legislative, and judicial powers resided with the ''[[Ogboni]]'', a council of notable elders. The notion of the [[divine king]] was so important to the Yoruba, however, that it has been part of their organization in its various forms from their antiquity to the contemporary era.

During the internecine wars of the 19th century, the Ijebu forced citizens of more than 150 Ẹgba and Owu communities to migrate to the fortified city of [[Abeokuta]]. Each quarter retained its own ''Ogboni'' council of civilian leaders, along with an ''Olorogun'', or council of military leaders, and in some cases its own elected ''Obas'' or ''Baales''. These independent councils elected their most capable members to join a federal civilian and military council that represented the city as a whole. Commander Frederick Forbes, a representative of the British Crown writing an account of his visit to the city in the ''Church Military Intelligencer'' (1853),&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite journal|pages=117–131|volume=10|number=1|work=Journal of African History|title= The Egba at Abeokuta: Acculturation and Political change, 1830–1870| year= 1969|author=Earl Phillips|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/s0021853700009312|jstor=180299}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Abẹokuta as having "four presidents", and the system of government as having "840 principal rulers or 'House of Lords,' 2800 secondary chiefs or 'House of Commons,' 140 principal military ones and 280 secondary ones."&lt;ref name=contributions&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eiQHFrA7GUwC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=Frederick+Forbes+on+Abeokuta#v=onepage&amp;q=Frederick%20Forbes%20on%20Abeokuta&amp;f=false|title=Contributions of Yoruba People in the Economic &amp; Political Developments of Nigeria|author=Jacob Oluwatayo Adeuyan|publisher=AuthorHouse, 2011|isbn=978-1-4670-2480-8|page=18|date=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Abẹokuta and its system of government as "the most extraordinary [[republic]] in the world."&lt;ref name=contributions/&gt;

===Leadership===
[[Gerontocratic]] leadership councils that guarded against the monopolization of power by a monarch were a trait of the Ẹgba, according to the eminent Ọyọ historian Reverend [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]]. Such councils were also well-developed among the northern [[Okun people|Okun]] groups, the eastern [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]], and other groups falling under the Yoruba ethnic umbrella. In Ọyọ, the most centralized of the precolonial kingdoms, the ''Alaafin'' consulted on all political decisions with the prime elector or president of the House of Lords (the ''Basọrun'') and the rest of the council of leading nobles known as the ''Ọyọ Mesi''.

Traditionally kingship and chieftainship were not determined by simple [[primogeniture]], as in most monarchic systems of government. An electoral college of lineage heads was and still is usually charged with selecting a member of one of the royal families from any given realm, and the selection is then confirmed by an Ifá oracular request. The Ọbas live in palaces that are usually in the center of the town. Opposite the king's palace is the ''Ọja Ọba'', or the king's market. These markets form an inherent part of Yoruba life. Traditionally their traders are well organized, have various guilds, officers, and an elected speaker. They also often have at least one ''Iyaloja'', or Lady head of the Market,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vf8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=|page=112|title=Africa since 1914: a historical bibliography|volume=17|author=ABC-Clio Information Services|publisher=ABC-Clio Information Services|year=1985|isbn=978-0-87436-395-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VGBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=|title=Where Women Work: A Study of Yoruba Women in the Marketplace and in the Home, Issues 53-56 of Anthropological papers|author=Niara Sudarkasa|publisher=University of Michigan|year=1973|pages=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is expected to represent their interests in the aristocratic council of oloyes at the palace.

===City-states===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 1997.2.4 Torque Currency.jpg|thumb|Traditional torque currency made from copper alloy was a form of collar money (''mondua'') used in the Yoruba country, 17th century, Brooklyn Museum 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/156596|title=Brooklyn Museum|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The monarchy of any [[city-state]] was usually limited to a number of royal lineages.&lt;ref&gt;A. Adelusi-Adeluyi and L. Bigon (2014) "City Planning: Yoruba City Planning" in Springer's Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures (third edition), ed. by Helaine Selin.&lt;/ref&gt; A family could be excluded from [[monarch|kingship]] and chieftaincy if any family member, servant, or [[slave]] belonging to the family committed a crime, such as theft, fraud, murder or rape. In other city-states, the monarchy was open to the election of any free-born male citizen. In [[Ilesa]], [[Ondo City|Ondo]], 
[[Akure]] and other Yoruba communities, there were several, but comparatively rare, traditions of female ''Ọbas''. The kings were traditionally almost always [[Polygamy|polygamous]] and often married royal family members from other domains, thereby creating useful alliances with other rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royaldiadem.co.uk/yoruba.php, Royaldiadem.co.uk]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Under "Culture"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibadan]], a city-state and proto-empire founded in the 18th century by a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] group of [[refugees]], soldiers, and itinerant [[Merchant|traders]] from Ọyọ and the other Yoruba sub-groups largely dispensed with the concept of monarchism, preferring to elect both military and civil councils from a pool of eminent citizens. The city became a military republic, with distinguished soldiers wielding political power through their election by popular acclaim and the respect of their peers. Similar practices were adopted by the ''Ijẹsa'' and other groups, which saw a corresponding rise in the social influence of military adventurers and successful entrepreneurs. The [[Igbomina tribe|Ìgbómìnà]] were renowned for their [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[hunting]] prowess, as well as their [[woodcarving]], leather art, and the famous Elewe masquerade.

===Groups, organizations and leagues in Yorubaland===
Occupational guilds, social clubs, secret or initiatory societies, and religious units, commonly known as Ẹgbẹ in Yoruba, included the ''Parakoyi'' (or league of traders) and ''Ẹgbẹ Ọdẹ'' (hunter's guild), and maintained an important role in commerce, social control, and vocational education in Yoruba polities. There are also examples of other peer organizations in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=|title=Diversity of Creativity in Nigeria: A Critical Selection from the Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on the Diversity of Creativity in Nigeria|author1=Bolaji Campbell|author2=R.

This group, originally a farmers' union, was converted to a network of secret militias throughout the Ẹgba forests, and each lodge plotted and successfully managed to overthrow Ọyọ's ''Ajeles'' (appointed administrators) in the late 18th century.

Similarly, covert military resistance leagues like the ''Ekiti Parapọ'' and the ''Ogidi'' alliance were organized during the 19th century wars by often-decentralized communities of the Ekiti, Ijẹsa, [[Igbomina tribe|Ìgbómìnà]] and [[Okun people|Okun]] Yoruba in order to resist various imperial expansionist plans of [[Ibadan]], [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]], and the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].

In the city-states and many of their neighbours, a reserved way of life remains, with the school of thought of their people serving as a major influence in [[West Africa]] and elsewhere.

Today, most contemporary Yoruba are [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s. Be that as it may, many of the principles of the traditional faith of their ancestors are either knowingly or unknowingly upheld by a significant proportion of the populations of Nigeria, [[Benin]] and [[Togo]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Some widely known Orisha are [[Ogun]], (God of metal, war and victory), [[Shango]] or Jakuta (God of thunder, lightning, fire and justice who manifests as a king always wielding a double-edged axe which conveys his Ashe or divine authority &amp; power), [[Eshu|Esu/Eshu elegbara]] (The trickster and sole messenger to the pantheon, who conveys the wish of men to the gods. He understands every language / tongue spoken by humankind, and is also the guardian of the crossroads, ''Oríta méta'' in Yoruba) and [[Orunmila]] (The God of the Oracle).

=====Mythology=====

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Yoruba Beaded Crown.jpg|thumb|left|Beaded crown (''Adé'') of a Yoruba [[Oba (ruler)|''Oba'']], the ''Ogoga'' of [[Ikere-Ekiti|Ikere]], [[Ekiti State]]. According to Yoruba customs, only kings who are direct descendants of [[Oduduwa]] can wear a beaded crown.]]

Oral history of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]]-Yoruba recounts Odùduwà to be the Progenitor of the Yoruba and the reigning ancestor of their crowned kings.

''He came from the east, sometimes understood from Ife traditions to be Oke-Ora and by other sources as the "vicinity" true East on the Cardinal points, but more likely signifying the region of [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]] and [[Okun people|Okun]] sub-communities in northeastern Yorubaland/central Nigeria. [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]] is near the confluence of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and Benue rivers, and is where the Yoruba language is presumed to have separated from related ethno-linguistic groups like [[Igala language|Igala]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastalnews.com/profile/120-nigeria-news/592-oduduwa-the-ancestor-of-the-crowned-yoruba-kings.html Article: Oduduwa, The Ancestor Of The Crowned Yoruba Kings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205083827/http://www.coastalnews.com/profile/120-nigeria-news/592-oduduwa-the-ancestor-of-the-crowned-yoruba-kings.html |date=5 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Oduduwa, there was a dispersal of his children from Ife to found other kingdoms. Each child made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the Yoruba confederacy of kingdoms, with each kingdom tracing its origin due to them to Ile-Ife.

After the dispersal, the aborigines became difficult, and constituted a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be survivors of the old occupants of the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people now turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. Then came [[Moremi Ajasoro|Moremi]] on the scene; she was said to have played a significant role in the quelling of the marauders advancements. But this was at a great price; having to give up her only son Oluorogbo. The reward for her patriotism and selflessness was not to be reaped in one lifetime as she later passed on and was thereafter [[Immortality|immortalized]]. The Edi festival celebrates this feat amongst her Yoruba descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorubaalliance.org/Newsletter/newsletter74.htm|title=Who are the Yoruba!|publisher=|access-date=6 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702194235/http://www.yorubaalliance.org/Newsletter/newsletter74.htm|archive-date=2 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ogunda Meji.jpg|thumb|''Ogunda Meji'', one of the sixteen principals of 256 ''Odus'' (the corpus of Ifa literature) represented on a virtual ''Opon Ifa'' board]]

Yoruba culture consists of folk/cultural philosophy, religion and folktales. They are embodied in Ifa Divination, and are known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora.

Yoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time Oduduwa was the king, the Bringer of Light, pioneer of Yoruba folk philosophy, and a prominent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. His time favored the artist-philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre-dynastic period in Yorubaland.The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse, and the birth of modern artist-philosophy. This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther (1807–1891). Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the philosophy - the thought of man - that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus, it is believed that thought (philosophy) is an antecedent to religion. Values such as respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture. Societies which are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values.
Today, the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture. More research is being carried out on Yoruba cultural thought as more books are being written on the subject.

====Islam and Christianity ====
The Yoruba are traditionally a very religious people, and are today pluralistic in their religious convictions.&lt;ref name = integration&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nkbYlltTi4sC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=|title=Religion and National Integration in Africa: Islam, Christianity, and Politics in the Sudan and Nigeria (Series in Islam and society in Africa)|author=John O. Hunwick|page = 103|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1992|isbn= 978-0-8101-1037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoruba are one of the more religiously diversified ethnic groups in Africa. Many Yorubas can be found in different types of [[Christian]] denominations. Many others are Muslims, as well as practitioners of the traditional Yoruba religion. Yoruba religious practices such as the [[Eyo festival|Eyo]] and [[Osun-Osogbo]] festivals are witnessing a resurgence in popularity in contemporary Yorubaland. They are largely seen by the adherents of the modern faiths, especially the [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Islam|Muslims]], as cultural rather than religious events. They participate in them as a means to celebrate their people's history, and boost tourist industries in their local economies.

=====Christianity=====
[[File:Anna hinderer church and mission house at ibadan pic2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anna Hinderer]] church and mission house at [[Ibadan]], 1850s]]

The Yorubas were one of the first groups in West Africa to be introduced to Christianity on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DdFvbW5tWpYC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=christianity+in+yorubaland#v=onepage&amp;q=christianity%20in%20yorubaland&amp;f=false|title=Pre-Colonial Africa in Colonial African Narratives: From Ethiopia Unbound to Things Fall Apart, 1911–1958|author=Dr Donald R Wehrs|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2013

Christianity (along with western civilization) came into Yorubaland in the mid-19th century through the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], whose original mission was commerce.&lt;ref name = integration/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdbBBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74&amp;dq=|title=Scientific Pilgrimage: 'The Life and times of Emeritus Professor V.A Oyenuga'.

As time progressed, other Europeans - such as the French, the British, and the Germans, followed suit. British and French people were the most successful in their quest for colonies (These Europeans actually split Yorubaland, with the larger part being in British Nigeria, and the minor parts in French Dahomey, now [[Benin]], and German [[Togoland]]). Home governments encouraged religious organizations to come, and to Christianize the so-called "animist" Africans. Roman Catholics (known to the Yorubas as Ijo Aguda, so named after returning former Yoruba slaves from Latin America, who were mostly Catholic, and were also known as the Agudas, [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] or Amaros) started the race, followed by Protestants, whose prominent member - [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) based in [[England]] made the most significant in-roads into the hinterland regions for evangelism and became the largest of the Christian missions. [[Methodism|Methodists]] (known as Ijo-Eleto, so named after the Yoruba word for "method or process") started missions in [[Badagry|Agbadarigi / Gbegle]] by [[Thomas Birch Freeman]] in 1842. [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Henry Townsend]], C.C.Gollmer, and [[Ajayi Crowther]] of the CMS worked in [[Abeokuta]], then under the Egba division of Southern Nigeria in 1846.

[[File:Church of the Pater Noster Mount of Olives, Jerusalem, Israel 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Lord's prayer in Yoruba language, [[Church of the Pater Noster]] Mount of Olives, Jerusalem]]
[[Anna Hinderer|Hinderer]] and Mann of CMS started missions in Ibadan / [[Ibarapa people|Ibarapa]] and Ijaye divisions of the present Oyo state in 1853. [[Baptists|Baptist]] missionaries - Bowen and Clarke -  concentrated on the northern Yoruba axis - (Ogbomoso and environs). With their success, other religious groups - the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Evangelical Church of West Africa|Evangelists Commission of West Africa]] - became popular among the [[Igbomina]], and other non-denominational Christian groups joined. The increased tempo of Christianity led to the appointment of [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] and indigenes as missionaries. This move was initiated by Venn, the CMS Secretary. Nevertheless, the impact of Christianity in Yorubaland was not felt until the fourth decade of the 19th century, when a Yoruba slave boy, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, became a Christian convert, linguist and minister whose knowledge in languages would become a major tool and instrument to propagate Christianity in Yorubaland and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Yorupedia|url=http://yorupedia.com/subjects/yoruba-religion/christianity-and-islam/|title=Christianity and Islam Introduction|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, there are a number of Yoruba Pastors and Church founders with large congregations, e.g. Pastor [[Enoch Adeboye]] of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor [[David Oyedepo]] of Living Faith Church World Wide also known as Winners Chapel, Pastor [[Tunde Bakare]] of Latter Rain Assembly, Prophet [[T. B. Joshua]] of Synagogue Church of All Nations, [[William Kumuyi|William Folorunso Kumuyi]] of [[Deeper Christian Life Ministry]] and Dr. Daniel Olukoya of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries. The Yoruba are known for their love of privacy and respect for other ethnic groups - particularly around bigger cities such as Lagos and in Diasporan communities.

=====Islam=====
Islam came into Yorubaland centuries before Christianity and before the first Europeans ever set foot in Yorubaland. Yorubas first came in contact with Islam around the 14th century, as a result of trade with [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]] (also Wankore) merchants, a mobile caste of the Soninkes from the then [[Mali Empire]] who entered Yorubaland (Oyo) from the northwestern flank through the Bariba or Borgu corridor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://nigerianfinder.com/islamic-education-in-nigeria-how-it-all-began/|title=Islamic Education in Nigeria: How It All Began|publisher=Nigerian Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Kankan Musa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=1ha_bmASvRIC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=|title= Mission Et Progrès Humain (Mission and Human Progress) Studia missionalia|page=168|language=French|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|year= 1998|isbn=978-8-876-5278-76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, Islam is traditionally known to the Yoruba as Esin Male or simply Imale i.e. religion of the Malians. The adherents of the Islamic faith are called Musulumi in Yoruba to correspond to Muslim, the Arabic word for an adherent of Islam having as the active participle of the same verb form, and means "submitter (to Allah)" or a nominal and active participle of Islam derivative of "Salaam" i.e. (Religion of) Peace. The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as a Religion of Peace and as an internal spiritual state according to Quran 6:125, Quran 61:7 and Quran 39:22: "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam." In fact, Islam was practiced in Yorubaland so early on in history, that a sizable proportion of Yoruba slaves taken to the Americas were already Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=NQwcAlYxP7sC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=|title =Unfree Labour in the Development of the Atlantic World|author1=Paul E. Lovejoy|author2=Nicholas Rogers|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|page = 157|isbn = 978-1-136-30059-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Yoruba Muslims would later stage the [[Malê Revolt]] (or The Great Revolt) which was the most significant slave rebellion in Brazil. On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], a small group of slaves and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called Malê in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba Imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim.

According to Al-Aluri, the first Mosque was built in Ọyọ-Ile / Katunga in 1550 A.D. Although there were no Yoruba Muslims at the time, the Mosque served the spiritual needs of foreign Muslims living in Ọyọ. Progressively, Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland, and Muslims started building Mosques: [[Iwo, Osun|Iwo]] led, its first Mosque built in 1655, followed by [[Iseyin|Iṣẹyin]], in 1760; [[Lagos|Eko/Lagos]] got its first mosque in 1774; [[Shaki, Nigeria|Shaki]], 1790; and [[Osogbo|Oṣogbo]], 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), [[Ibadan]], [[Abẹokuta]], [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Ikirun]], and [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]], all already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad. Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yorubaland by the middle of the 19th century. Before the decline of Ọyọ, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, however, when Ọyọ was destroyed, these Muslims (Yorubas and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daudaayanda.blogspot.ca/2015/02/legacy-of-islam-in-yorubaland.html|title=LEGACY OF ISLAM IN YORUBALAND|website=daudaayanda.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yorubaland, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their hosts. According to Eades, the religion "differed in attraction" and "better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy", which was already a feature of various African societies; more influential Yorubas (like Seriki Kuku of Ijebuland) soon became Muslims, with a positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time as other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from Ọba Kosọkọ, after he came back from exile in [[Epe, Nigeria|Ẹpẹ]]. Islam, like Christianity, also found common ground with the natives who already believed in a Supreme Being [[Olodumare]] / [[Olorun]]. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam.
Today, the Yorubas constitute the second largest Muslim group in Nigeria, after the Hausa people of the Northern provinces. They are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with small [[Ahmadiyya]] communities.

The Yorubas worked with a wide array of materials in their art including; bronze, leather, terracotta, ivory, textiles, copper, stone, carved wood, brass, ceramics and glass. A unique feature of Yoruba art, is their striking realism - which unlike most African art, chose to create human sculptures in vivid realistic and life sized forms. The art history of the nearby [[Benin empire]] shows that there was a cross - fertilization of ideas between the neighboring Yoruba and Edo. The Benin court's brass casters learned their art from an Ife master named Iguegha, who had been sent from Ife around 1400 at the request of Benin's oba Oguola. Indeed, the earliest dated cast-brass memorial heads from Benin replicate the refined naturalism of the earlier Yoruba sculptures from Ife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/beni_2/hd_beni_2.htm|title=Origins and Empire: The Benin, Owo, and Ijebu Kingdoms|website=The Metropolitan Museum Of Art (Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History)|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masquerades are an important feature of Yoruba traditional artistry. They are generally known as ''Egúngún'', singularly as ''Egún''. The term refers to the Yoruba masquerades connected with ancestor reverence, or to the ancestors themselves as a collective force. There are different types of which one of the most prominent is the [[Gelede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IIqc3pizziAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yoruba+gelede+masquerades#v=onepage&amp;q=Yoruba%20gelede%20masquerades&amp;f=false|title=Gẹlẹdẹ: Art and Female Power Among the Yoruba|series=Indiana University Turkish Studies, Midland books (Traditional arts of Africa)|volume =565|author1=Henry John Drewal|author2= Margaret Thompson Drewal|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1983|isbn= 978-0-253-32569-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o3o_-JwBwW4C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Yoruba+gelede+masquerades#v=onepage&amp;q=Yoruba%20gelede%20masquerades&amp;f=false|page=51|title=Playful Performers: African Children's Masquerades|author1=Simon Ottenberg|author2=David Aaron Binkley|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Ese Ifa (oral literature of Orunmila divination) explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with [[Yemoja]], the Mother of all the orisa and all living things. Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, and the priest advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed "Efe" (the humorist/joker); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed "Gelede" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.

After getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals - dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet - they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede. This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede. An old theory stated that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society among the Yoruba people.&lt;ref name=understand/&gt;

The [[Gelede|Gelede spectacle]] and the [[Ifá|Ifa divination system]] represent two of Nigeria's only three pieces on the United Nations [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Oral and Intangible Heritages of Humanity]] list, as well as the only such cultural heritage from [[Benin]] and [[Togo]].

===Festivals===
[[File:Arugba Osun.jpg|thumb|The ''Arugba'' leading the procession to the [[Osun-Osogbo|Osun grove]]]]
One of the first observations of first time visitors to Yorubaland is the rich, exuberant and ceremonial nature of their culture, which is made even more visible by the urbanized structures of Yoruba settlements. These occasions are avenues to experience the richness of the Yoruba culture. Traditional musicians are always on hand to grace the occasions with heavy rhythms and extremely advanced [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], which the Yorubas are well known for all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribes.tribe.net/africanspirituality/thread/92f4fde8-0ddf-491a-aa47-47f0c0af0d6e|accessdate=10 June 2015|title=Yoruba Culture|website=Tribes|date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise singers and [[Griot|griots]] are there to add their historical insight to the meaning and significance of the ceremony, and of course the varieties of colorful dresses and attires worn by the people, attest to the aesthetic sense of the average Yoruba.

The Yoruba are a very expressive people who celebrate major events with colorful festivals and celebrations (Ayeye). Some of these festivals (about thirteen principal ones)&lt;ref name=mapping&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cfftg4o77QIC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Yoruba+festivals+America#v=onepage&amp;q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&amp;f=false|title=Mapping Yorùbá Networks: Power and Agency in the Making of Transnational Communities|author=Kamari Maxine Clarke|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3342-5|pages=59, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; are secular and only mark achievements and milestones in the achievement of mankind.

The festival attracts thousands of Osun worshippers from all over Yorubaland and the Yoruba diaspora in the Americas, spectators and tourists from all walks of life. The Osun-Osogbo Festival is a two-week-long programme. It starts with the traditional cleansing of the town called 'Iwopopo', which is then followed in three days by the lighting of the 500-year-old sixteen-point lamp called ''Ina Olojumerindinlogun'', which literally means ''The sixteen eyed fire''. The lighting of this sacred lamp heralds the beginning of the Osun festival. Then comes the 'Ibroriade', an assemblage of the crowns of the past ruler, the Ataoja of Osogbo, for blessings. This event is led by the sitting ''Ataoja'' of Osogbo and the Arugba Yeye Osun (who is usually a young virgin from the royal family dressed in white), who carries a sacred white calabash that contains propitiation materials meant for the goddess Osun. She is also accompanied by a committee of priestesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mynewswatchtimesng.com/behold-new-arugba-osun-wants-doctor/|publisher=Newswatch Times|title=Behold, new Arugba Osun, who wants to be doctor|date= 31 August 2013|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201408221221.html|title=Nigeria: Osun Osogbo 2014 - Arugba's Berth Tastes Green With Goldberg Touch|author=Gregory Austin Nwakunor|date=22 August 2014|publisher=AllAfrica|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event holds in the New World as [[Odunde Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6p2aLo2kafMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Odunde+Festival+Yoruba+United+States+America#v=onepage&amp;q=Odunde%20Festival%20Yoruba%20United%20States%20America&amp;f=false|title=The United States and West Africa: Interactions and Relations Volume 34 of Rochester studies in African history and the diaspora|issn=1092-5228|author1=Alusine Jalloh|author2=Toyin Falola|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58046-308-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mK147fnLIrAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Odunde+Festival+Yoruba+United+States+America#v=onepage&amp;q=Odunde%20Festival%20Yoruba%20United%20States%20America&amp;f=false|title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States Rutgers Series: The Public Life of the Arts|author1=Paul DiMaggio|author2=Patricia Fernandez-Kelly|author3=Gilberto Cârdenas|author4=Yen Espiritu|author5=Amaney Jamal|author6=Sunaina Maira|author7=Douglas Massey|author8=Cecilia Menjivar|author9=Clifford Murphy|author10=Terry Rey|author11=Susan Seifert|author12=Alex Stepick|author13=Mark Stern|author14=Domenic Vitiello|author15=Deborah Wong|page=44|publisher=Rutgers University Press, 2010|isbn=978-0-8135-5041-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EyoFigure.jpg|thumb|Eyo figure in [[Lagos]]]]
Another very popular festival with spiritual connotations is the [[Eyo festival|Eyo Olokun festival]] or ''Adamu Orisha'' play, celebrated by the people of [[Lagos]]. The Eyo festival is a dedication to the God of the Sea [[Olokun]], who is an Orisha, and whose name literally mean ''Owner of the Seas''.&lt;ref name=mapping/&gt; Generally, there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival. This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon. Once a date for its performance is selected and announced, the festival preparations begin. It encompasses a week-long series of activities, and culminates in a striking procession of thousands of men clothed in white and wearing a variety of coloured hats, called ''Aga''. The procession moves through Lagos Island ''Isale Eko'', which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis. On the streets, they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city, including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos, the Oba, known as the [[Iga Idunganran]]. The festival starts from dusk to dawn, and has been held on Saturdays (Ojó Àbáméta) from time immemorial. A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the 'senior' Eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other 'important' groups — Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) — take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.

[[File:Eyo Olokun.jpg|thumb|left|Eyo Olokun]]
The Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people, which is why it is described as ''Agogoro Eyo'' (literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade). In the manner of a spirit (An Orisha) visiting the earth on a purpose, the Eyo masquerade speaks in a ventriloquial voice, suggestive of its otherworldliness; and when greeted, it replies: ''Mo yo fun e, mo yo fun ara mi'' which in Yoruba means: ''I rejoice for you, and I rejoice for myself''. This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day, and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing. During the festival, Sandals and foot wear, as well as ''Suku'', a hairstyle that is popular among the Yorubas - one that has the hair converge at the middle, then shoot upward, before tipping downward - are prohibited. The festival has also taken a more touristic dimension in recent times, which like the Osun Osogbo festival, attracts visitors from all across Nigeria, as well as Yoruba diaspora populations. In fact, it is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil and other parts of the [[New World]], which may have been started by the Yoruba slaves transplanted in that part of the world due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/celebrating-eyo-festival-in-the-modern-way/|title=Celebrating Eyo the Modern Way|website=SpyGhana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomsofnigeria.com/eyolagosagog.php|title=Royalty in the news: Lagos agog for Eyo Festival today.|website=Kingdoms of Nigeria|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlagos.com/?p=654|title=Eyo Festival|website=About Lagos|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=Yoruba+festivals+America&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMIl-ig7oqKxgIVB47bCh1J_wBM#v=onepage&amp;q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&amp;f=false|page=346|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 [M - Z]|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hourglass tension drum (Dùndún) for example, may have been introduced around the 15th century (1400's), the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin bronze plaques]] of the middle period depicts them.

[[File:Slit drum, Yoruba, Nigeria, 1900 - Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde München - DSC08553.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Yoruba hollow slit drum]]
Yoruba drums typically belong to four major families, which are used depending on the context or genre where they are played. The [[Talking drum|Dùndún / Gángan family]], is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums, which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech. This is possible because the Yoruba language is tonal in nature. It is the most common and is present in many Yoruba traditions, such as [[Apala]], [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]], [[Sekere]] and [[Afrobeat]]. The second is the [[Sakara drum|Sakara family]]. Typically, they played a ceremonial role in royal settings, weddings and [[Oriki|Oríkì]] recitation; it is predominantly found in traditions such as [[Sakara music]], Were and [[Fuji music]]. The [[Gbedu|Gbedu family]] (literally, "large drum") is used by secret fraternities such as the [[Ogboni]] and royal courts. Historically, only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum. If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority. The Gbèdu are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground. ''Akuba'' drums (a trio of smaller conga-like drums related to the gbèdu) are typically used in afrobeat. The ''Ogido'' is a cousin of the gbedu. It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body. It also has a much deeper sound than the conga. It is sometimes referred to as the "bass drum". Both hands play directly on the Ogido drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagbaja.com/drums/ogido.php|website=Lagbaja|title=Ogido|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word ''Gbedu'' has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music. The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the [[Batá drum|Bàtá family]] which are well decorated double faced drums, with various tones. They were historically played in sacred rituals. They are believed to have been introduced by [[Shango]], an Orisha, during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king. 

Traditional Yoruba drummers are known as ''Àyán''. The Yoruba believe that ''Àyángalú'' was the first drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix 'Ayan-' such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Yoruba+Music/|title=Yoruba music|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensembles using the [[Talking drum|dundun]] play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.&lt;ref name="Turino pg. 43"/&gt; The [[Ashiko]] (Cone shaped drums), ''Igbin'', [[Gudugudu]] (Kettledrums in the Dùndún family), [[Agidigbo]] and Bèmbé are other drums of importance. The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''oniyalu'' meaning; ' ''Owner of the mother drum'' ', who uses the drum to "talk" by imitating the [[tonality]] of Yoruba. Much of this music is spiritual in nature, and is often devoted to the [[Orisa]]s.

[[File:Benin, yoruba, campanaccio per invocare gli spiriti o le divinità,.JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional [[Agogô|Agogo]] metal gongs]]
Within each drum family there are different sizes and roles; the lead drum in each family is called ''Ìyá'' or ''Ìyá Ìlù'', which means "Mother drum", while the supporting drums are termed ''Omele''. Yoruba drumming exemplifies West-African cross-rhythms and is considered to be one of the most advanced drumming traditions in the world. Generally, improvisation is restricted to master drummers. Some other instruments found in Yoruba music include, but are not limited to; The [[Goje|Gòjé]] ([[violin]]), [[Shekere|Shèkèrè]] (gourd rattle), [[Agidigbo]] (thumb piano that takes the shape of a plucked [[Lamellophone]]), ''Saworo'' (metal rattles for the arm and ankles, also used on the rim of the bata drum), ''Fèrè'' ([[whistle]]s), ''Aro'' ([[Cymbal]])s, [[Agogô]] ([[Bell (instrument)|bell]]), different types of [[flute]]s include the ''Ekutu'', ''Okinkin'' &amp; ''Igba.''

[[Oriki]] (or praise singing), a genre of sung poetry which contains a series of proverbial phrases, praising or characterizing the respective person is of [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Yoruba music is typically [[Polyrhythm]]ic, which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline. The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming. Yorùbá music is regarded as the most important component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music, the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talent and creativity.

''Kehinde'' is the name of the last born twin. ''Kehinde'' is sometimes also referred to as ''Kehindegbegbon'' which is short for; ''Omo kehin de gba egbon'' and means, 'the child that came behind gets the rights of the elder'.

===Cuisine===
Solid food, mostly cooked, pounded or prepared with hot water are basic staple foods of the Yoruba. These foods are all by-products of crops like [[cassava]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cocoyam]] and forms a huge chunk of it all. Others like [[Cooking bananas|Plantain]], [[corn]], [[beans]], [[meat]], and [[fish]] are also chief choices.&lt;ref name="Yoruba Cuisine"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IIIOAQAAIAAJ|title=The Kudeti Book of Yoruba Cookery|last1=Mars|first1=J.A.|last2=Tooleyo|first2=E.M.|publisher=CSS|year=2003|isbn=978-978-2951-93-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common Yoruba foods are iyan (pounded yam), [[Amala (food)|Amala]], [[eba]], semo, [[fufu]], [[Moin moin]] (bean cake) and [[akara]].&lt;ref name=understand/&gt; [[Soup]]s include [[egusi]], ewedu, [[okra]], vegetables are also very common as part of diet. Items like [[rice]] and [[beans]] (locally called ewa) are part of the regular diet. Some dishes are also prepared for festivities and ceremonies such as [[Jollof rice]] and [[Fried rice]]. Other popular dishes are Ekuru, [[stew]]s, corn, cassava and flours – e.g. maize, yam, plantain and beans, [[Eggs (food)|eggs]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[beef]] and assorted forms of meat (pumo is made from cow skin). Some less well known meals and many miscellaneous staples are arrowroot gruel, sweetmeats, fritters and coconut concoctions; and some [[bread]]s – yeast bread, rock buns, and palm wine bread to name a few.&lt;ref name="Yoruba Cuisine"/&gt;

==Dressing and clothing==
[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers, wearing very basic traditional clothing]]

The Yoruba take immense pride in their attire, for which they are well known. Clothing materials traditionally come from processed cotton by traditional weavers. They believe that the type of clothes worn by a man depicts his personality and social status, and that different occasions require different clothing outfits.

Typically, the Yoruba have a very wide range of materials used to make clothing, the most basic being the [[Aso Oke fabric|''Aṣo-Oke'']], which is a hand loomed cloth of different patterns and colors sewn into various styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Makinde|first1=D. Olajide|last2=Ajiboye|first2=Olusegun Jide|last3=Ajayi|first3=Babatunde Joseph|title=Aso-Oke Production and Use Among the Yoruba of Southwestern Nigeria| publisher=The Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=3|number=3|date=September 6, 2009|url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol3no3/3.3AsoOke.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which comes in very many different colors and patterns.
Aso Oke comes in three major styles based on pattern and coloration;
* ''Alaari'' - a rich red Aṣọ-Oke,
* ''Sanyan'' - a brown and usual light brown Aṣọ-Oke, and
* ''Ẹtu'' - a dark blue Aṣọ-Oke.

Other clothing materials include but are not limited to:
* ''Ofi'' - pure white yarned cloths, used as cover cloth, it can be sewn and worn.
* ''Aran'' - a velvet clothing material of silky texture sewn into Danṣiki and Kẹmbẹ, worn by the rich.
* [[Adire (textile art)|''Adirẹ'']] - cloth with various patterns and designs, dye in indigo ink (Ẹlu or Aro).

Clothing in Yoruba culture is gender sensitive, despite a tradition of non-gender conforming families. For menswear, they have ''Bùbá, Esiki'' and ''Sapara'', which are regarded as ''Èwù Àwòtélè'' or underwear, while they also have ''Dandogo, Agbádá, Gbariye, Sulia'' and ''Oyala'', which are also known as ''Èwù Àwòlékè'' / ''Àwòsókè'' or overwear. Some fashionable men may add an accessory to the Agbádá outfit in the form of a wraparound (Ìbora).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/clothing-types-styles/agbada-clothing|title=Agbada Clothing|author=Babatunde Lawa|work=Beauty and Fashion|publisher=Lovetoknow|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqkYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Agbada+Yoruba+men%27s+fashion+clothing&amp;dq=Agbada+Yoruba+men%27s+fashion+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAWoVChMI7eCImo6KxgIVKyzbCh1QowAF|website=Scribner library of daily life (Gale Virtual Reference Library)|title=Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion (Vol. 1: Academic Dress to Eyeglasses)|author=Valerie Steele|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons (University of Michigan)|pages=31–32|date=29 December 2006|isbn=978-0-684-31395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aso Oniko.jpg|thumb|Finished ''Adire'' clothing material]]
They also have various types of ''Sòkòtò'' or native trousers that are sewn alongside the above-mentioned dresses. Some of these are ''Kèmbè'' (Three-Quarter baggy pants), ''Gbáanu'', ''Sóóró'' (Long slim / streamlined pants), ''Káamu'' &amp; ''Sòkòtò Elemu''. A man's dressing is considered incomplete without a cap (''Fìlà''). Some of these caps include, but are not limited to; ''Gobi'' (Cylindrical, which when worn may be compressed and shaped forward, sideways, or backward), ''Tinko'', ''Abetí-ajá'' (Crest-like shape which derives its name from its hanging flaps that resembles a dog's hanging ears. The flaps can be lowered to cover the ears in cold weather, otherwise, they are upwardly turned in normal weather), ''Alagbaa, Oribi, Bentigoo, Onide'', and ''Labankada'' (a bigger version of the Abetí-ajá, and is worn in such a way as to reveal the contrasting color of the cloth used as underlay for the flaps).

Women also have different types of dresses. The most commonly worn are ''Ìró'' (wrapper) and ''Bùbá'' (blouse-like loose top). Women also have matching ''Gèlè'' (head gear) that must be put on whenever the Ìró and Bùbá is on. Just as the cap (Fìlà) is important to men, women's dressing is considered incomplete without Gèlè. It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this, they also have ''ìborùn'' ([[Shawl]]) and ''Ìpèlé'' (which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind of the body to the fore). At times, it is tied round their waists over the original one piece wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears (Èwù Àwòtélè), called; ''Tòbi'' and ''Sinmí''. Tòbi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables. They tie the tòbi around the waists before putting on the Ìró (wrapper). Sinmí is like a sleeveless T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body.

[[File:Benin, yoruba, braccialetti, anelli e altri monili.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Yoruba metal bracelets and jewellery of old. Collection of The Afro-Brazilian museum of Salvador, Bahia]]
There are many types of beads (''Ìlèkè''), hand laces, necklaces (Egba orùn), anklets (Egba esè) and bangles (Egba owó) that are used in Yorubaland. These are used by both males and females, and are put on for bodily adornment. Chiefs, priests, kings or people of royal descent, especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank. Some of these beads include ''Iyun, Lagidigba, Àkún'' etc. An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled [[Babalawo|Babalawos / Babalorishas]] is the ''Ìrùkèrè'', which is an artistically processed animal tail, a type of [[Fly-whisk]]. The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness. It can be used in a shrine for decoration but most often is used by chief priests and priestesses as a symbol of their authority or Ashe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeoduduwa.org/the-orisha/orisha|title=Orisha|website=Oduduwa|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most men go about with their hair lowly cut or neatly shaven, the reverse is the case for women. Hair is considered the ' ''Glory of the woman'' '. They usually take care of their hair in two major ways; They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting styles, and women readily pick any type they want. Some of these include ''kòlésè, Ìpàkó-elédè, Sùkú, Kojúsóko, Alágogo, Konkoso'', Etc. Traditionally, The Yoruba consider tribal marks ways of adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from, since different areas are associated with different marks. Different types of [[Yoruba tribal marks|tribal marks]] are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. These are usually done at infancy, when children are not pain conscious.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some of these tribal marks include ''Pélé, Abàjà-Ègbá, Abàjà-Òwu, Abàjà-mérin, Kéké, Gòmbò, Ture, Pélé Ifè, Kéké Òwu, Pélé Ìjèbú'' etc. This practice is near extinct today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/unit_06/cultureunit.html|website=Africa UGA|title=Traditional Clothes: Clothing and Fashion|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman. Therefore, the personality of an individual has to be developed in order to fulfill his or her responsibilities. Clothing among the Yoruba people is a crucial factor upon which the personality of an individual is anchored. This belief is anchored in Yoruba [[proverb]]s. Different occasions also require different outfits among the Yoruba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akinbileje|first1=Yemisi Thessy|last2=Igbaro|first2=Joe|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/aern/TAS10.2/TAS10.2Yemisi.pdf|format=pdf|work=the African Symposium|publisher=African Educational Research Network|date=December 2010|volume=10|issue=2|title=Proverbial Illustration of Yoruba Traditional clothings: a cultural analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
