'''1 Hanover Square''', formerly known as the '''India House''', is on the southern edge of [[Hanover Square (Manhattan)|Hanover Square]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  Built in 1851, it was the site of the nation's first [[commodity futures]] [[futures exchange|exchange]], the '''New York Cotton Exchange'''.  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1977 in recognition of that function, and was designated a [[New York City Landmark]] in 1965.

== Description and history ==
1 Hanover Square is located on the west side of the eponymous square in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan.  It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brownstone in the Italian Renaissance style. The main facade is eight bays wide, with the main entrance occupying two bays at the center.  Windows on the ground floor are tall, and set in openings flanked by paneled pilasters and topped by pedimented segmental arches.  Second-floor windows are smaller, set beneath gabled pediments, and third floor windows are smaller still, with simpler surrounds.  The building is crowned by a modillioned cornice.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt;

The structure was constructed as a commercial investment by the builder, developer and merchant [[Richard F. Carman]] in 1851-53. It was the headquarters of the [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation|Hanover Bank]]. In 1870, the [[New York Cotton Exchange]] was founded here, the second such exchange in the world and the first exchange in the [[United States]] to deal in [[commodity futures]] (contracts specifying the delivery at a future date of a particular [[commodity]]).&lt;ref name = nrhpinv/&gt;

The building served as the headquarters of [[W.R. Grace and Company]] from 1885 until 1913, when it was purchased by the India House, a [[private club]] for gentlemen involved in foreign commerce.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt;  It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: New York Cotton Exchange|url={{NHLS url|id=72001586}} |format=pdf|author=George R.

'''220 Central Park South''' is a residential [[skyscraper]] currently under construction, being developed by [[Vornado Realty Trust]]. It is located in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and is being designed by [[Robert A.M. Stern Architects]].

The tower is located along Central Park South; when complete the building will have 70 floors, and will include 116 units. Completion is expected in 2018. Although a striking addition to the Midtown Manhattan skyline, it will nonetheless be dominated by the existing [[Central Park Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/03/220-central-park-south-begins-losing-prominence-as-exterior-work-nears-completion.html|title=220 Central Park South Begins Losing Prominence As Exterior Work Nears Completion - New York YIMBY|date=2018-03-08|work=New York YIMBY|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed, the tower will be the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|tenth-tallest building in New York City]], slightly shorter than [[4 World Trade Center|Four World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=220 Central Park South Goes Supertall |url=http://www.yimbynews.com/2014/03/220-central-park-south-goes-supertall.html |newspaper= Yimby |location= |date= 21 March 2014|accessdate= 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/220-central-park-south/11182|title=220 Central Park South - The Skyscraper Center|work=skyscrapercenter.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building that previously occupied the site was a 20-story building built in 1954. It contained 124 apartments, and was purchased in 2005 by Vornado for $131.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2006/03/07/220_central_park_south_another_condo_casualty.php|title=220 Central Park South: Another Condo Casualty?|last=Arak|first=Joey|date=7 March 2006|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=towerpower&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2009/04/07/tower-power-on-central-park/|title=Tower Power on Central Park|last=Cuozzo|first=Steve|date=7 April 2009|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase, Vornado entered a legal battle with its rent-stabilized tenants concerning their eviction.&lt;ref name=towerpower/&gt; A court sided with Vornado in 2009, and the developer ultimately settled with tenants in 2010, paying between $1.3 million and $1.56 million to those remaining in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/12/22/central_park_south_holdouts_get_milliondollar_buyouts.php|title=Central Park South Holdouts Get Million-Dollar Buyouts|last=Polsky|first=Sara|date=22 December 2010|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the existing structure began in 2012 after the settling of a dispute between Vornado and [[Extell Development Company|Extell]]. Extell, another developer, owned the parking garage under the previous building, and was unwilling to close it. Demolition was completed in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkyimby.com/2013/01/demolition-update-220-central-park-south-nearly-gone.html|title=Demolition Update: 220 Central Park South Nearly Gone|last=YIMBY|first=New York|date=7 January 2013|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. M. Stern's designs were released in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/01/15/robert_am_sterns_220_central_park_south_tower_revealed.php|title=Robert A.M. Stern's 220 Central Park South Tower, Revealed!|last=Dailey|first=Jessica|date=15 January 2014|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans were approved in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yimbynews.com/2014/03/approved-220-central-park-south.html|title=Approved: 220 Central Park South|date=1 March 2014|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is one of several major developments on or around [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[Central Park]], dubbed “Billionaires Row” by the media, and buildings include [[432 Park Avenue]], [[111 West 57th Street]], [[The Steinway Tower]], and the [[Central Park Tower]].

==Design==
Designs originally called for a "glass" tower.&lt;ref name=towerpower/&gt; Contrary to the early plans, Robert A. M. Stern's designs call for a limestone-clad building, similar to other buildings by Stern such as [[15 Central Park West]]. The building is one of three skyscrapers designed by Stern in Manhattan, joining [[30 Park Place]] in the Financial District, and [[520 Park Avenue]], east of Central Park.

Originally, only the parts produced in foreign factories were assembled, but very soon the production of domestic components began, so as the engineering. The forerunner of the domestic aircraft industry was the Airplane workshop (''Aeroplanska radionica''), which was established in 1920, at the airfield in [[Novi Sad]].

From 1923 to 1941, there were 7 aircraft factories in Serbia, 4 of which were located in the capital, [[Belgrade]], and 2 airplane engines factories. Also, some planes were produced in the aircraft workshops, [[aero club]]s and private workshops. There were also factories for the aircraft equipment and workshops for the repairs and overhauls of the aircraft, engines and components. A major boost to the industry was a decision by the state from 1926 to acquire over 800 fighters and several hundreds of trainers and school planes. Additional foreign licenses were obtained. The advance of the industry was halted in 1932 when the state stopped with the further acquirement of the aircraft due to the [[Great Depression]]. The production rebound from 1937 onwards.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

According to the State union of the aircraft industries of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the state's aircraft industry and the auxiliary industries employed 300 engineers and technicians, 500 employees and 6,000 workers. In total, 1,729 military and civilian aircraft were produced in Serbia between two [[World Wars]]. Of those, none were [[cargo aircraft|cargo]] or [[reconnaissance aircraft]].&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; One of the most important people in the technical development of the aircraft design was engineer Milenko Mitrović "Spirta", who developed numerous designs for the airplanes in the 1928-40 period.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

{{main|Ikarbus}}

First proper factory was established on 20 November 1923 in Novi Sad. The driving force behind it foundation was Dimitrije Konjović (1888-1982), former pilot in the [[Austro-Hungary]]'s air forces in [[World War I]]. He founded Ikarus together with brothers Dušan and Milivoj Kovačević and engineer {{ill|Josip Mikl|sr}}. Jointly with the Rogožarski factory, founded a bit later, they were given a task of producing the [[trainer aircraft]] "ŠB" (''školski Brandenburg'', literally "school(ing) Brandenburg"). In April 1924 first planes were delivered while in November 1924 the factory produced the first homemade aircraft as the company's designing bureau drafted the trainer [[flying boat]] "ŠM" (''školski mornarički'', "school naval (plane)").&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

In 1927-28 Ikarus built new facilities in [[Zemun]], equipped for the serial production of airplanes and its own airfield. By the end of 1932, the headquarters of the company also moved to Zemun.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;&lt;ref name=aero&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/yugo/yugo-aviation-industry.htm | author = John Hayles, Milan Jovanović | title = Yugoslavia - The Aviation Industry | year = 2013 | publisher = www.aeroflight.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production in Novi Sad was completely discontinued in 1932.&lt;ref name=ikar&gt;{{cite book | title = Икарус-Икарбус: 1923-1998 | date = 1999 | author = Nikola Žutić, Lazar Bošković | publisher = Ikarbus | url = https://www.slideshare.net/LazarBoskovic/19231998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the town of Zemun was officially merged into Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Prilog prošlosti gradskog parka u Zemunu od sedamdesetih godina XIX veka do 1914. godine (A contribution to the past history of the town park in Zemun from the 1870s to 1914) | author = Miodrag A. Dabižić | language= Serbian, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1923-41 period, Ikarus produced a total of 441 aircraft.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; Some of the best aircraft produced in the factory include observation plane [[Potez XV]], light bomber [[Bristol Blenheim]] and fighters [[Hawker Fury]] and [[Ikarus IK-2]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; It was the first company which began producing [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]], in 1928. They also constructed the first Serbian and Yugoslav fighter plane, completely domestically designed, IK-1, in 1935, designed by {{ill|Ljubomir Ilić|sr}}  and {{ill|Kosta Sivčev|sr}}.&lt;ref name=ikar/&gt;

Right after occupying Yugoslavia, Germans commandeered the factory on 17 April 1941. The complex was heavily bombed during the massive [[Allied bombing of Yugoslavia in World War II|Allied Easter bombing of Belgrade]] in April 1944.&lt;ref name=ikar/&gt; The facilities of Ikarus were almost completely destroyed during the war, but the factory was rebuilt. In 1946 Zmaj and Rogožarski were merged with the Ikarus, after previously being nationalized. In 1954 the company began producing buses and, starting from 1960, the production of aircraft was being shut down and relocated to the [[SOKO]] factory in [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Production of the aircraft was completely discontinued in 1962 and, until that date, Ikarus produced a total of 475 planes after the war. The facilities were completely demolished and the area is today occupied by the residential buildings, stretching between the [[Hotel Jugoslavija]] on the east, and ''Palmira Toljatija'' Street (roughly blocks 9-A and 11-C. divided between the municipalities of Zemun and New Belgrade).&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; The engineers and the design bureau were transferred to the [[Aeronautical Technical Institute]] in the Belgrade's suburb of [[Žarkovo]]. The company was ultimately renamed to Ikarbus.&lt;ref name=ikar/&gt;

Well known aircraft constructed in Ikarus after the war include fighter [[Ikarus S-49]], trainers [[Ikarus 213]] and [[Ikarus 522]], light reconnaissance-bomber [[Ikarus 214]] and baby twin-jet [[Ikarus 452M]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

The administrative building of the company, which was built in 1938 as part of the complex, as of 2018 is one of the oldest surviving buildings in [[New Belgrade]]. In June 2017 it was announced that the building will be demolished so that private investor can build a [[highrise]] instead. Locals organized in an effort to adapt the building into the museum instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Ana Vuković | title = Stanari sanjaju muzej, investitor planira šestospratnicu | trans-title = Tennants dream of a museum, investor is planning a six-floor building | newspaper = Politika | page = 17 | language = Serbian | date = 21 June 2017| url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/383360/Stanari-sanjaju-muzej-investitor-planira-sestospratnicu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Citizen protested, demolished the [[construction hoarding]] and physically prevented the investor to destroy the building, so police intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.danas.rs/politika/inicijativa-ne-davimo-beorgad-necemo-dozvoliti-da-zgradu-ikarusa-sruse/ | author = U.

Still, a heavy demolition machinery was brought so citizens protested again in March. Inheritors of the pre-World War II owners of the "Ikarus" company, which was nationalized after 1945, applied for the restitution. The administrative building of the former airplane factory was a symbol of the industrial development of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Apart from being one of the oldest preserved objects in New Belgrade, it was the only representative of the [[Art Deco]] in the municipality. Citizens proposed that the building might be adapted into the Museum of New Belgrade or a branch of the [[Museum of Aviation, Belgrade|Museum of Aviation]]. The building was not protected by the law.&lt;ref name=ikarus&gt;{{cite news | author = Ana Vuković, Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Komšije uplašene za sudbinu zgrade "Ikarusa" | trans-title = Neighbors afraid for the future of the "Ikarus" building | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date =  5 March 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/399455/Komsije-uplasene-za-sudbinu-zgrade-Ikarusa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the building was demolished in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nspm.rs/hronika/beograd-srusena-upravna-zgrada-ikarusa-nekadasnje-fabrike-aviona-i-jedne-od-najstarijih-zgrada-na-novom-beogradu.html | title = Београд: Срушена управна зграда Икаруса, некадашње фабрике авиона и једна од најстаријих зграда на Новом Београду | trans-title = Belgrade: the administrative building of Ikarus, former airplane factory and one of the oldest buildings in New Belgrade, was demolished | date = 3 July 2018 | publisher = [[Nova srpska politička misao]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rogožarski (1924-46) ===
[[File:Rogozarski IK-3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Rogožarski IK-3]]]]
{{main|Rogožarski}}

Predecessor of the company was the Rogožarski carpentry workshop. It worked on the repairs of the confiscated airplanes in the [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; In April 1924 the "First Serbian airplane factory Živojin Rogožarski" was founded in Belgrade by Živojin Rogožarski. At first, worked jointly with Ikarus on "ŠB". Due to the major financial losses, the company was took over by the new owners in 1934. The Resavac and the Blagojević brothers transformed the company into the [[joint-stock company]] "Rogožarski A.D. Beograd" and the company was revived. It produced a total of 284 airplanes in the 1924-41 period, mostly designed locally.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

Apart from the "ŠB", the best known aircraft manufactured in Rogožarski were trainers [[Fizir F1V]] and [[Rogožarski R-100]], [[floatplane]] [[Rogožarski SIM-XIV-H]] and fighter [[Hawker Hurricane]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

Rogožarski produced the [[IK-3]] airplane, considered the finest Serbian fighter. It was a low-wing one-seat monoplane, constructed in 1936 by Ilić, Sivčev and Slobodan Zrnić. The prototype was finished in 1938 and the production began in 1940. Till the beginning of the [[World War II]], in April 1941, only 12 airplanes were finished. Six were in service at 51st Independent Fighter Group of the 6th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which defended the capital Belgrade. They held their own against the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] (Bf 109E) planes, during the [[Operation Retribution (1941)|German invasion]]. Three IK-3s were shot down, while 7 Messerschmitts were also gunned down and one was damaged. The three remaining IK-3s were destroyed by their crews on the ground, in order not to get captured by the advancing Germans.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

The factory was located in the neighborhood of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]], bounded by the streets of ''Stanoja Glavaša'', ''Dalmatinska'', ''Starine Novaka'' and ''Kneza Danila''. The new Communist authorities nationalized the company, merged it into Ikarus in 1946, while the facilities were transformed into the IKL (ball bearing factory) in 1948.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = N.N. | title = Prva domaća fabrika aeroplana | trans-title = First domestic airplane factory | newspaper = Politika | page = 11 | language = Serbian | date = 23 April 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/402430/Prva-domaca-fabrika-aeroplana }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was demolished and in 2015 construction of the residential and commercial neighborhood of "Central Garden" began, which should include the 16-storey "Business Garden Tower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Kula od 16 spratova u "Central gardenu" | trans-title = 16-storey tower in "Central Garden" | newspaper = Politika | page = 16 | language = Serbian | date = 29 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zmaj (1927-46) ===
{{main|Zmaj aircraft}}

In 1927 the "Zmaj" factory was established in Zemun. Full name was ''Fabrika aeroplana i hidroplana - Zmaj, Petrović i Šterić'' ("Airplane and flying boats factory Zmaj - Petrović &amp; Šterić"). From the early 1930s the factory began producing the state's first training planes, training flying boats and the trainer [[fighter aircraft]], using French design. During the 1927-41 period, 126 licensed (foreign designed) planes were produced, with additional 220 locally designed ones.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

Production of the locally designed planes began in 1932. The factory produced, among others, fighters Hawker Hurricane, [[Hawker Fury]] and [[Dewoitine D.27]], trainer [[Zmaj Fizir FP-2]], and passenger transporter [[Spartan Cruiser]] for the [[Aeroput]] Air Traffic Society, the first air traffic company in Serbia and precursor of the modern [[Air Serbia]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

After 1946, the company was adapted for the production of the agricultural machines,&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; while the aircraft section was merged into Ikarus.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

=== Brege / FAK (1927-42) ===
[[File:Breguet 19 A2.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Breguet 19]]]]

In 1924 the Air Force decided to build an aircraft factory for its own needs, deep inside the state's territory. In September 1926, on the Divlje Polje locality near [[Kraljevo]], construction of the new plant for the construction and repair of the aircraft began, which was finished in 1927. According to the contract with the government, it was soon taken over by the French [[Breguet Aviation]] company, which used it for the production of the [[Breguet 19]] airplane type. The factory was officially called ''Breguet Aeroplanska radionica u Kraljevu'' ("Breguet airplane workshop in Kraljevo"), but was colloquially known as FAK (''Fabrika aviona Kraljevo'', "Kraljevo airplane factory"). Production of Breguet 19 began in 1928 and 470 units were made, more planes than any other factory in this period. The production was halted in 1933 when the contract expired and the French withdrew from the business. Air and Technics Institute in Kraljevo (VTZ, ''Vazduhoplovno-tehnički zavod''), took over the premises.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; In this period repairs were conducted and the spare parts were produced.

Production was revitalized in 1939 when the State airplane factory (DFA, ''Državna fabrika aviona'') was founded. The production included the modern and more complex two-engine bombers [[Dornier Do 17]]K, on the German license. During the [[Kraljevo massacre]] in October 1941, among over 2,000 victims executed by the occupational German forces, there were 473 employees of the factory.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

During the withdrawal in front of the invading German army, [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] destroyed the most vital parts of the plant and the Germans never managed to repair it, though they used it for occasional repairs of the Breguet and Dornier planes. Those little remaining machines and equipment which survived were dismantled in 1942 and transported to Germany. After the war, authorities didn't try to restore the plant, instead, what remained of it was attached to the "Kraljevo railway wagon factory" (FVK, ''Fabrika vagona Kraljevo'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Краљевски авиони-Фабрика авиона у Краљеву 1927-1942 | trans-title = Royal (Kraljevo's) airplanes-Airplanes factory in Kraljevo | date = 1995 | location = Kraljevo | author = Miroslav Filipović | publisher = Kronos International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Краљевачка фабрика авиона "Бреге" | trans-title = Kraljevo's airplane factory "Breguet" | date = 2003 | author = Mladen Grahovac | publisher = Aeromagazin, No. 51 | pages = 30–32 | issn = 1450-6068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utva (1937) ===
[[File:Utva-75.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[UTVA 75]]]]
{{main|Utva Aviation Industry}}

The Glider Union "Utva" (''Jedriličarska zadruga "Utva"'') was founded on 5 June 1937, also in Zemun. It produced only gliders until 1939 when it was transformed into the full aircraft factory "Utva" AD. In 1940 the factory was relocated to [[Pančevo]] where the German licensed [[Bücker Bü 131]] (Bücker Jungmann) training aircraft were assembled.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; In Pančevo factory had its own airfield.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;&lt;ref name=godisnjak&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planeta.org.rs/44/04%20avijacija.htm | author = Darko Mladenović | title = Godišnjak srpskog vazduhoplovstva - Čedomir Janjić | trans-title = Yearbook of Serbian airforce by Čedomir Janjić | date = 2010 | publisher = Planeta magazin | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-war gliders included [[Šoštarić Vrabac]] (designed by Ivo Šoštarić) and {{ill|Čavka|sr|Чавка (ваздухопловна једрилица)}}. A total of 39 gliders and 148 Bücker Jungmanns were constructed prior to 1941. As the factory was damaged during the war, it was rebuilt in the 1944-46 period and with Ikarus, to which Zmaj and Rogožanski were attached, became the main force in the aircraft industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Авиони домаће конструкције после Другог светског рата | trans-title = Domestically constructed airplanes after World War II | date = 1996 | author = {{ill|Zlatko Rendulić|sr}} | publisher = Lola Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utva was restarted as a repair workshop and an airplane equipment factory, before resuming the aircraft production in 1948, though it continued to make parts and equipment for other aircraft producing companies, even from the abroad. The company is primarily known for its trainers. The best known plane types include [[Utva Trojka]], Utva 212, [[Utva 213 Vihor]], [[Utva-65]], [[Utva 66]] and [[UTVA 75]], so as the components for [[Soko J-22 Orao]] and [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb]]. In total, the company constructed over 900 aircraft.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; One of the newer models is a trainer [[Lasta 95]].&lt;ref name=godisnjak/&gt;

In May 1996, the [[Ivo Lola Ribar Institute|Lola Institute]] from the Belgrade's suburb of [[Železnik]], merged with Utva into the Utva-Lola company. The factory was bombed on several occasions during the [[NATO bombing of Serbia]] in 1999 and was damaged a lot.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; The complex was partially reconstructed. In 2017 the state-owned company [[Yugoimport SDPR]], which deals with the arms and the defense-related equipment, took over 96% of the shares of Utva-Lola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.blic.rs/vesti/ekonomija/jugoimport-sdpr-preuzeo-pancevacku-utvu/brsylgn | author = TangoSix.rs and Dina Đorđević | title = Jugoimport SDPR preuzeo pančevačku "Utvu" | trans-title = Yugoimport SDPR took over "Utva" in Pančevo | date = 14 March 2017 | publisher = [[Blic]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company, now called "Utva avio-industrija" remained in a dire financial situation. The company's bank account remained blocked, there were no promised investments and 10% of the workforce was fired. As of August 2018, representatives of the company's trade union claimed that the factory "is not capable of producing aircraft anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = O.Janković | title = Otkazi u pančevačkoj "Utvi"| trans-title = Dismissals in Pančevo's "Utva" | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 2 August 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/408468/Otkazi-u-pancevackoj-Utvi }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company presented its new plane that same month, the training aircraft "Sova", actually a rehashed UTVA 75 with the ''Garmin'' [[avionics]], which prompted public questions how acceptable is it to keep Utva "alive" at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rs.n1info.com/a413985/Biznis/Novi-Utvin-skolski-avion-Sova.html | author = Beta | title = Poleteo novi Utvin školski avion "Sova" | trans-title = Flew of the new Utva's training airplane "Sova" | date = 23 August 2018 | publisher = N1 | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storch Aviation (2000) ===

The company was founded by Nestor Slepčev, who originally designed aircraft in Australia, but after 1999 moved the production to [[Čenej]], close to Novi Sad. It is producing [[Slepcev Storch]], a 3/4 scale ultra-light replica of the German [[Fieseler Fi 156 Storch]] from World War II. It is a two-seated plane, made of chromium and molybdenum, and produced in three versions, one of which is a four-seated and the other can land on the water.&lt;ref name=godisnjak/&gt; The planes are quite popular, being exported into 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bizlife.rs/biznis/poslovne-vesti/sve-je-stvar-entuzijazma-ko-u-srbiji-izvozi-avione-za-sad/ | author = Milenko Vasović | title = Sve je stvar entuzijazma: Ko u Srbiji izvozi avione za SAD? | trans-title = It all depends on enthusiasm: who in Serbia exports airplanes into the United States? | date = 21 March 2018 | publisher = BizLife | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company specialized in the production of the light and ultra-light aircraft. It was founded in 2006 in Kraljevo, close to the location of the pre-war aircraft factory. It produces licensed Colombian [[AeroAndina]] aircraft ([[AeroAndina MXP-150 Kimbaya|Kimbaya]], [[AeroAndina MXP-158 Embera|Embera]], Tumaco and [[AeroAndina MXP-1000 Tayrona|Tyrona]]).

The "IAM" and "Vlajković-[[Walter Aircraft Engines|Walter]]" factories produced airplane engines and both were located in the Belgrade's industrialized suburb of [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]].&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

"IAM" ("Airplane engines industry", ''Industrija aeroplanskih motora A.D.'') was founded in 1927. It was 50% owned by the foreign investors until 1936 when it was nationalized. It produced licensed plane engins: [[Gnome-Rhône Jupiter]], [[Gnome-Rhône 7K]], [[Gnome-Rhône 9K]], [[Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major]]. In 1940, assembling of the [[Praga (company)|Praga trucks]] began. After the war, IAM became IMR, ''[[Industrija Motora Rakovica]]'', one of the largest factory in general in Yugoslavia.

Aircraft engines factory "S.Vlajković and Sons" originated as the carpentry workshop in 1925, founded by Svetozar Vlajković. The shop, located in the neighborhood of [[Dorćol]], repaired Breguet XIV aircraft and its engines. The factory then moved to Rakovica and started the production of the Walter NZ engines.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; In 1948 it was transformed into the {{ill|"21. maj"|sr|21. maj (kompanija)}} factory which, among other products, made aircraft engines, starting with the piston engines, but sine the late 1950s including the licensed jet engine [[Astazou]] XIV M1 for the [[Aérospatiale Gazelle]] helicopters and parts for the jet engines [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Viper]] 632-41, 632-46 and 636-41. It also produced other special helicopter parts, like the [[helicopter rotor|rotor hubs]] and transmissions.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; IMR obtained a [[General Motors]] license to repair their engines while in the 1980s it produced engine parts for [[Boeing]] and [[Tupolev]]. With decline since the 1990s, it mostly performed repairs of helicopter parts.&lt;ref name=godisnjak/&gt; Bankruptcy proceedings started in 2016.&lt;ref name=rakovica/&gt;

"{{ill|Teleoptik (factory)|sr|Телеоптик (фабрика)}}", the first factory which dealt with the telephony, optics and [[precision mechanics]], was founded in 1922 in Dorćol. Production of the aircraft instruments, coolers and other equipment began in 1928. Originally, all products were foreign licenses, but from 1935 the company began designing the equipment. In 1940, the factory moved to Zemun where and continued to produce some of the aircraft products.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; It went bankrupt in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Фабрика "Телеоптик" у Земуну | date = 2016 | author = Saša J.

"Prospekt Nestor", another precise mechanics plant, was open in 1938 in the Belgrade's neighborhood of [[Lion, Belgrade|Lion]]. It produced military equipment, but also some aircraft equipment. After the war it was nationalized, transformed into the "Precizna mehanika" and moved to the neighborhood of [[Učiteljsko Naselje]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; Though not officially bankrupt, especially after the botched privatization in 2007, "Precizna mehanika" is out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cins.rs/srpski/news/article/precizna-mehanika-sporna-privatizacija | author = Ivana Jeremić | title = Precizna mehanika, sporna privatizacija | trans-title = Precizna mehanika, a dubious privatization | date = 21 July 2014 | publisher = CINS | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another producer of the aircraft instruments was the optics and precision mechanics company "Mikron", in the Belgrade's neighborhood of [[Krunski Venac]]. They also tested and adjusted optical instruments. In 1947 it was annexed to the "Nikola Tesla elektronska industrija" factory which switched to the production of the home appliances.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; It was privatized in 2006 and is effectively out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.priv.rs/Ministarstvo-privrede/90/NIKOLA-TESLA-EI.shtml/companyid=1789 | title = Профил предуѕећа Никола Тесла ЕИ | trans-title = Company profile Niola Tesla EI | publisher = Ministry of Economy | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Prospekt Jasenica" was the first factory to produce the licensed [[spark plugs]]. They also repaired the Breguet 19 Lorraine aircraft engines. The offices were in Zemun, but the factory was in the town of [[Smederevska Palanka]]. After the war, the factory became the core of the "[[Goša FOM|Goša]]" factory, which switched to the rail wagons production,&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; and went bankrupt in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rs.n1info.com/a392731/Biznis/Sud-ponovo-doneo-resenje-Gosa-otisla-u-stecaj.html | author = Beta, eKapija | title = Sud ponovo doneo rešenje o stečaju u fabrici "Goša" | trans-title = Court again ruled on "Goša" bankruptcy | date = 1 June 2018 | publisher = [[N1 (television)|N1]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BAM-30- Kluz PS-11.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Parachute [[Kluz PS-11]]]]

The "Knebl and Dietrich" factory was founded in the town of [[Inđija]] in 1923, as the "factory of flying equipment, parachutes and leather suits". Production of parachutes began in 1934, originally under the license from the US [[Irvin Airchute Company]]. Co-owner Miroslav Dietrich designed first Serbian parachute, "Spas", in 1930, but the production started after the US licensed ones. Until 1941, the company produced 2,500 parachutes. The company was nationalized in 1947, renamed "Franjo Kluz" and moved to Belgrade. The production diversified, including sports, military, landing, training, pilot, emergency, brake, cargo and other special parachutes, overalls, suits, armor vests, [[paragliders]] and other special equipment, overalls, suits, etc.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; By 2007, over 200.000 parachutes were produced and exported, while additional 55,000 were produced for domestic use, both military and civilian. The company was divided in several parts which mostly went bankrupt, but "Kluz padobrani", which handled the parachutes production was privatized in 2006. Since 2007/08 the production was restored in cooperation with the German company Brüggemann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kluzpadobrani.com/index.php?lang=1&amp;pg=0&amp;sub=0 | title = Kluz padobrani - info | trans-title = Kluz parachutes - Info | publisher = Kluz Padobrani | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance and design ===

The origins of the Aircraft Institute "Moma Stanojlović" (''Vazduhoplovni zavod Moma Stanojlović'') predate the World War II.&lt;ref name=godisnjak/&gt; Founded in 1949 as the workshop for the repairs of the aircraft engines, the Aircraft Institute "Moma Stanojlović" (''Vazduhoplovni zavod Moma Stanojlović'') was enlarged in 1952 into the major overhaul facility. It was seated in the Belgrade's suburb of [[Kneževac]]. In 1971 it merged with another repair facility "Jastreb" from Zemun. The current name of the company was adopted in 1976 and in 1977 it moved to the [[Batajnica Airport]]. The institute overhauled sub-sonic and supersonic aircraft, like [[MiG-21]], Soko J-22 Orao, [[Soko G-2 Galeb]], Soko G-4 Super Galeb, [[Soko J-21 Jastreb]], [[Antonov An-2]], [[Antonov An-26]], [[Canadair]]s, Utva, [[Zlin Aviation|Zlin]] and helicopters like Gazelle, [[Aérospatiale Alouette]], [[Mil Mi-2]], [[Mil Mi-8]] and [[Mil Mi-17]]. It also repaired pistons, propellers and free turbine engines. It also repaired and maintained radio-navigational equipment, flying and photo equipment. The institute also produced large number of parts and equipment. It was damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing. In cooperation with the Aeronautical Technical Institute, it developed the prototype of the [[Vrabac Mini UAV]] mini drone.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;&lt;ref name=godisnjak/&gt;

The [[Mihajlo Pupin Institute]], founded in 1946 in Belgrade for development of computer systems, automation, robotics and telecommunications, designed and constructed various aviation projects: flying simulators for the pilots training, simulators for training of the anti-aircraft artillerymen, visual systems for the simulators, systems for detection of radar emitters, etc. The institute is located in the [[Zvezdara Forest]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;

The [[Aeronautical Technical Institute]] was founded in 1946. It was a research and developing institute, connected with the flight department of the School of Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade, but administered by the Yugoslav army. It was focused on the research, development and design of the aerodynamics, flight mechanics, structures, stability, aircraft structures, propulsion, etc. The facilities of the institute, which include [[subsonic and transonic wind tunnel]]s, are located in [[Žarkovo]].&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; In 1992 the institute was administratively abolished and attached to the [[Military Technical Institute Belgrade]].

"Minel Inženjering Eving" is part of the Minel Concern, founded in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.minelkoncern.com/index_e.htm | title = MINEL CONCERN, joint stock company | date = 2010 | publisher = Minel Concern }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is focused on the electric energy and flight engineering.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; In 2013 it was given a task of reconstructing and upgrading aircraft platforms and parking spaces of the [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gradjevinarstvo.rs/vesti/6811/810/planum_i_minel_in%C5%BEenjering_eving_rekonstrui%C5%A1u_platformu_za_avione_na_aerodromu_nikola_tesla | author = Beta | title = "Planum" i "Minel inženjering Eving" rekonstruišu platformu za avione na Aerodromu "Nikola Tesla" | trans-title = "Planum" and "Minel inženjering Eving" are reconstructing the aircraft platform of the Nikola Tesla airport. | date = 14 January 2013 | publisher = Građevinarstvo.rs | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aeroinžinjering" company, founded by professor Aleksandar Patrnogić (1923-2012), since the early 1980s worked, through consulting and engineering, on the founding of the airports and air bases abroad, including the original ideas, maintenance, supply and servicing of the equipment. It went bankrupt in 2010.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/drustvo/2878122/vremeplov-22-septembar-2017.html | title = Vremeplov, 22 septembar 2017 | trans-title = Chronicle, 22 September 2017 | date = 22 September 2017 | publisher = [[Radio Television Serbia]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.besplatneakcije.rs/Ministarstvo-privrede/90/AEROINZENjERING.shtml/companyid=11523 | title = Профил предузећа - Аероинжењеринг у стечају | trans-title = Company profile - Aeroinženjering | publisher = Ministry of Economy| language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6198">[[File:SSE Sculpture.jpg|thumb|200px|Sculpture of a bull in front of Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China. Surrounded by small tumbling bears on the ground]]
A '''Bull''' is a [[stock market]] [[speculator]] who buys a holding in a stock in the expectation that in the very short-term it will rise in value whereupon he will sell the stock to make a quick [[profit (accounting)|profit]] on the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986, p.206: definition 5 of "bull": "Stock Exchange, a speculator who buys in anticipation of rising prices in order to make a profit on resale"&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking the term applies to speculators who borrow&lt;ref&gt;See Mortimer's definition below&lt;/ref&gt; money to fund such a purchase, and are thus under great pressure to complete the transaction before the loan is repayable or the seller of the stock demands payment on [[settlement (finance)|settlement]] day for delivery of the bargain. If the value of the stock falls contrary to his expectation, a bull suffers a loss, frequently very large if he is trading on [[Margin (finance)|margin]]. A bull has a great incentive to "talk-up" the value of his stock or to manipulate the market in his stock, for example by spreading false rumour,&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; to procure a buyer or to cause a temporary price increase which will provide him with the selling opportunity and profit he requires. A bull must therefore be contrasted with an [[investor]], who purchases a stock in expectation of a medium-term (say 5 years) or long-term increase in value due to the underlying performance of the company and its [[asset]]s. The speculator who takes a directly opposite view to the bull is the [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]], who speculates on a stock decreasing in value, having sold [[Short (finance)|short]]. A [[Market trend|bull market]] is a period during which stock market prices rise over a sustained period, therefore to the advantage of bulls.

==History of the term==
An early mention of the terms bull and bear appears in the 1769 edition of [[Thomas Mortimer]]'s ''Every Man his own Broker'', published in London, as follows, relating to speculators operating in [[Jonathan's Coffee-House]] in [[Exchange Alley]] (the original London proto-Stock Exchange):&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/everymanhisownbr00mort#page/n75/mode/2up Mortimer, pp.46-7, footnote]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"A Bull is the name by which the gentlemen of [[Exchange Alley|'Change Alley]] choose to call all persons who contract to buy any quantity of government securities, without an intention or ability to pay for it, and who consequently are obliged to sell it again, either at a profit or a loss, before the time comes when they have contracted to take it".

This refers to the former practice of stock-brokers, abolished circa 1980's in London, allowing their clients to trade on credit during a period of about two weeks, known as an account, on the completion of which all purchases and sales made during the account period had to be paid for on the [[settlement date]]. A net trading loss would result in the client having to make a cash payment to the broker.

==Quasi-fraudster==
In early usage the terms bull and bear were akin to naming a variety of [[fraud]]ster, as is made clear by Mortimer, writing about 40 years after the scandal of the [[South Sea Bubble]]:&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Preface, vii&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Notwithstanding all the wise precautions hitherto taken, only the more palpable and glaring frauds have been entirely suppressed. The Bubbles are indeed burst, and the Race Horses of Exchange-Alley long since dead, but Bulls and Bears still subsist in their original vigour and full strength. The late Sir [[John Barnard]], whose name ought to be ever dear to the citizens of London for his long and faithful services in parliament, did indeed make an attempt to crush those monsters and their keepers; but his scheme was rejected, on account of its leaving a clog and restraint on the buying and selling of stock".

==Early example==
Mortimer gives an example of a bull as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, p.47, footnote&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Thus a man who in March buys in the Alley £40,000 four per cent [[Annuity|annuities]] 1760, for the rescounters in May, and at the same time is not worth ten pounds in the world, or, which is the same thing, has his money employed in trade, and cannot really take the annuities so contracted for, is a Bull, till such time as he can discharge himself of his heavy burden by selling it to another person, and so adjusting his account, which, if the whole [[Jonathan's Coffee-House|house]] be Bulls, he will be obliged to do at a considerable loss; and in the interim (while he is betwixt hope and fear, and is watching every opportunity to ease himself of his load on advantageous terms, and when the fatal day is approaching that he must sell, let the price be what it will) he goes lowring up and down the house, and from office to office; and if he is asked a civil question, he answers with a surly look, and by his dejected, gloomy aspect and moroseness, he not badly represents the animal he is named after".

==Sculptures of stock-market bulls==
[[File:Shooting Charging Bull 2.jpg|thumb|200px|''Charging Bull'', by Arturo Di Modica, in the financial district of New York City]]
Several bronze statues of bulls representing positive investor sentiment exist near the locations of several stock markets or brokerage houses, for example:
*''[[Charging Bull]]'', a bronze statue by Arturo Di Modica at Bowling Green, Manhattan, New York City
*"Bulle und Bär'' sculptures by Norbert Marten in [[Viersen]], Germany
*Sofia stock exchange, Bulgaria
*Frankfurt stock exchange, Germany
*Islamabad stock exchange, Pakistan

[[File:Business hours, Baja Fresh, Germantown, Maryland, August 25, 2016.jpg|thumb]]
'''Business hours''' are the hours during the day in which [[business]] is commonly conducted. Typical business hours vary widely by country.  By observing common informal standards for business hours, workers may communicate with each other more easily and find a convenient divide between work life and home life.

In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the hours between 9 [[12-hour clock|am]] and 5 [[12-hour clock|pm]] (the traditional "[[9 to 5]]") are typically considered to be standard business hours, although in the United States this varies by region due to local tradition and the need to conduct business by telephone with people in other [[time zone]]s.  For instance, business in [[Chicago]] is often conducted between 8 am and 4:30 pm, while in [[New York City]], business hours tend to be later—for instance, from 10 am to 6 pm. On Saturdays, businesses are usually open from 8 or 9 am to noon or 1 pm.

In Mexico, the standard business hours are from 7 [[12-hour clock|am]] to 2 [[12-hour clock|pm]] and 4 [[12-hour clock|pm]] to 6 [[12-hour clock|pm]].

In Finland, government agencies and other institutions follow the hours 8:00am to 4:15pm. Banks are usually open to 4:30pm. Common business is done from Monday to Friday, but major shops are usually open on Saturdays 9:00am – 6:00pm and on Sundays 12:00pm – 9:00pm, with exceptions.

Other countries have different business hour patterns.  Many workers in warmer climates observe [[Siesta]] during the afternoon, between the hours of 2 pm and 5 pm, effecting a pause in business hours, and resuming business in the evenings. La Siesta is a [[Spanish language]] term, which literally translates as a short nap of 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Siesta|url=http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/society/customs/siesta|website=DonQuijote.Org|accessdate=17 November 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business hours usually occur on [[weekday]]s. However, the days of the week on which business is conducted also varies from region to region in the world.

==Non-traditional business hours==
Many businesses and organizations have extended or unlimited business hours if their business takes place continuously. For example, [[hotel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[hospital]]s are open 24 hours a day, and transactions can take place at any point in time, thus requiring staffing and management availability at all times.
Recent communications technology such as [[smartphone]]s has also extended the working day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/9646349/Smartphones-and-tablets-add-two-hours-to-the-working-day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions==
In some jurisdictions, legislation or regulations may require businesses to limit their trading hours. For example, some Western countries prohibit certain businesses from trading on Sundays, this being traditionally considered a day of rest. Businesses which serve hot food or alcoholic drinks are also frequently restricted in their trading hours.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the U.S. Department of Labor has mandated that companies must pay overtime to individuals who work over 40 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD)|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs22.htm|website=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=17 November 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Businesses often do not schedule their employees to work more than 40 hours per week because they want to avoid paying their employees overtime.

==Greece==
In [[Greece]], business hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are usually from 9 am to 3 pm, while on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are usually from 9 am to 2 pm and after the siesta from 5.30 pm to 9 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofathens.gr/episkeptes/praktikes-plirofories/ores-leitoyrgias/katastimata|website=Municipality of Athens|accessdate=8 November 2016|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large stores and supermarkets follow an extended business hours schedule and are open Monday to Friday from 9 am to 9 pm and on Saturdays from 9 am to 8 pm. All stores are normally closed on Sundays, but there are several exceptions throughout the year. Banking and civil services hours are usually Monday to Friday from 8 am to 2 pm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphabank.com.cy/useful9.shtm|website=Alpha Bank|accessdate=8 November 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minor variations but are always closed at weekends. All stores and offices are closed on public holidays.

The '''composition-based view (CBV)''' was recently developed by Luo and Child (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luo|first1=Yadong|last2=Child|first2=John|title=A Composition-Based View of Firm Growth|journal=Management and Organization Review|date=2015|volume=11|issue=03|pages=379–411|doi=10.1017/mor.2015.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new theory that explicates the growth of firms without the benefit of resource advantages, proprietary technology, or market power. The CBV complements some existing theories such as [[resource-based view]] (RBV), resource management view, and [[Dynamic capabilities|dynamic capability]] – to create novel insights into the survival of firms that do not possess such strategic assets as original technologies and brands. It emphasizes how ordinary firms with ordinary resources may generate extraordinary results through their creative use of open resources and unique integrating capabilities, resulting in an enhanced speed and a high price-value ratio that are well suited to large numbers of low- to mid-end mass market consumers. The CBV has been commented as “a new view with significant application” for emerging market firms and for small and medium sized enterprises in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Richard M.|title=Extraordinary Survival from Ordinary Resources – How So?|journal=Management and Organization Review|date=2015|volume=11|issue=03|pages=413–417|doi=10.1017/mor.2015.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view cautions though that composition-generated advantages are temporary in nature and that composition itself mandates special skills in distinctively identifying, leveraging, and combining open or existing resources inside and outside the firm.

==Definition==
According to Luo and Child (2015), the term “composition” refers to the identification, configuration, and integration of (a) different sources of resources (e.g., acquiring applied technology and key components through licensing or purchasing, which are then further integrated with in-house production) and (b) different means of competition (e.g., price, value, design, technology, features, and services) to create a competitive advantage manifested in extended offerings (e.g., new product functions, extended consumer experience, and total business solutions), rapid market responses, and superior price-value ratios that suit particularly well the mass market.

There are three important concepts or notions that constitute composition. First, ''Compositional Offering'' – the firm uses open or available resources to provide customers with amalgamated values, services, and convenience at a reduced cost. It occurs when the firm extends product features, functions and services for customers who not only look for high value-price ratio but also total solutions, one-shop-for-all convenience, and amalgamated functions or services in a single product. Fast-paced life style, along with the expansion of middle-class consumers and digitization-based new consumerism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boumphrey|first1=Sarah|title=The New Consumerism: Redefining Ownership, Values and Priorities|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/the-new-consumerism-redefining-ownership-values-and-priorities/report|website=www.euromonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompts the need for compositional offering.

Second, ''Compositional Competition'' – the firm combines and integrates different means of competition (e.g., quick responsiveness, low cost, new functions and features, customer-focused design, and extended warranty) to win competition. Compositional competition combines low cost, speed and quality means, providing customers with quick market responses and high price-value ratio. Compositional competitors deliver suitable technology at a low cost by leveraging mature technologies or R&amp;D resources and by using [[open architecture]] or platforms that can significantly reduce production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeng|first1=Ming|last2=Williamson|first2=Peter J.|title=Dragons at your door : how Chinese cost innovation is disrupting global competition|date=2007|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9781422102084}}&lt;/ref&gt; These firms are astute in business intelligence involving both markets and technologies. 
     
Third, ''Compositional Capability'' – the firm’s ability to bundle different resources and competitive attributes to create a certain competitive advantage. It shifts a focus from developing new resources to bundling existing resources, including those accessible from domestic or global open markets, as well as bundling competitive attributes such as quality, features, price, speed, innovation, design, and services. Entrepreneurial vision, market intelligence, [[absorptive capacity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=W. M.|last2=Levinthal|first2=D.A.|title=Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1990|volume=35|pages=128–152|doi=10.2307/2393553}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combinative capability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogut|first1=B.|last2=Zander|first2=U.|title=Knowledge of the firm, combinative capabilities, and the replication of technology|journal=Organization Science|date=1992|volume=3|issue=3|pages=383–397|doi=10.1287/orsc.3.3.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; are essential to accomplishing compositional capability.

==Main Points==
According to Luo and Child (2015), compositional capability serves as the foundation on which compositional competition and compositional offering can build and forge ahead. This foundation determines how far the firm can go in adopting composition-based strategy. While compositional competition manifests the firm’s business-level strategy, focusing on the logic of using compositional building blocks for achieving a competitive edge, compositional offering expresses the firm’s operational-level strategy, pinpointing the value offering propensity (e.g., total solutions, one-stop services, or integrated functions) in a cost-effective manner. The above three elements reinforce one another, reflecting the faces of composition at the product level (compositional offering), market level (compositional competition), and organizational level (compositional capability). Yet, they collectively demonstrate a pragmatic and viable solution for the growth of ordinary firms that possess ordinary resources.

The CBV argues that firms with ordinary resources can establish some competitive position, at least temporarily, by creatively assembling and integrating the open and generic resources they possess or purchase. The term ‘ordinary resources’ refers to resources that are neither idiosyncratic nor costly to copy, and that can be purchased in an open market or secured from partner firms. The CBV informs the ways in which ordinary firms can survive by creatively using and bundling ordinary resources. CBV changes the view from developing and leveraging distinctive resources to distinctively using generic and open resources that are available. It is essentially a compensational remedy and a catch-up strategy for these companies in their efforts to compete against resourceful and powerful rivals equipped with strategic assets. Composition is a deliberate, intelligent, and pragmatic approach, offsetting these firms’ competitive weaknesses, yet requiring savvy organizational skills to achieve compositional advantages.

==Facilitating Conditions==
While the CBV logic applies to any firm endeavoring to catch up with better endowed competitors, it aligns well with the case of emerging economies enterprises and small- and medium-sized enterprises in developed or developing countries. There are several external conditions that provoke the adoption of composition-based strategy, including:
* Sheer number of consumers who are sensitive to a product’s price, features functions, convenience and amalgamated values
* Availability of many specialized industrial design companies from home and abroad
* Industrial clusters and parks that support various value chain activities needed for domestic and foreign customers
* Presence of global and domestic open markets for technologies, key components, industrial tools, and specialized intermediaries 
* Technological modularization or standardization and the pervasiveness of information and communication technologies (ICT)
* Growing business networks and partnerships

==Compositional Process==
The composition-based strategy is achieved through the compositional process, which relies on the recognition and management of interdependencies, both inside the firm and with external network partners. Compositional process entails a set of key process capabilities, including:
* A strong entrepreneurial orientation aimed at exploiting external opportunities. Firms that follow the composition-based strategy are often led by executives who have sharp vision and who have adopted pragmatic measures in order to tap into new markets with a heightened entrepreneurial orientation.
* Network competence in the sense of an ability to pull together the resources required to enable the exploitation of external opportunities. Leveraging external resources requires drawing from a range of various sources and ties.  
* An adept management system within the firm that maintains a fine balance between central direction and decentralized adaptive initiative. The combination of top-down vision with decentralized horizontal flexibility enables firms with ordinary resources to secure a competitive advantage by reducing lead times, speeding up problem solving, and hence adapting rapidly to market opportunities.
* A form of organizational ambidexterity that requires simultaneous attention to different resource categories with a view to their creative combination. The ambidexterity entails the balancing and integration of a range of resources in the bundling of competitive attributes.

==Links with Other Theories== 
The [[resource-based view|RBV]] argues that resources that are rare, valuable, inimitable, and non-substitutable are considered to be the source of sustained competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barney|first1=J.B.|title=Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage|journal=Journal of Management|date=1991|volume=17|pages=99–120|doi=10.1177/014920639101700108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBV complements with the RBV in that it does not emphasize possession of superior strategic resources as a necessary condition for the firm’s competitive advantage. Instead, the CBV underscores the use of multiple sources of open or generic resources – resources which when used in a creative composition may yield a competitive edge to the firm, at least temporarily. Also, the CBV points out that composition process is a distinct competence and critical capability that is valuable, heterogeneous, and not always easy to imitate.

Resource management is the comprehensive process of structuring the firm’s resource portfolio, bundling the resources to build capabilities, and leveraging those capabilities with the purpose of creating and maintaining value for customers and owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrow|first1=J. L.|last2=Sirmon|first2=D. G.|last3=Hitt|first3=M. A.|last4=Holcomb|first4=T. R.|title=Creating value in the face of declining performance: firm strategies and organizational recovery|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=3|pages=271–283|doi=10.1002/smj.579}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the resource management literature, the bundling process deals with internal or existing resources, the CBV extends this view by considering the composition of external open resources.

Consistent with the [[Dynamic capabilities|dynamic capability]] perspective, the composition process itself is a distinctive, firm-specific, and dynamic capability, that is, “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competence to address rapidly changing environments”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teece|first1=D.|last2=Pisano|first2=G.|last3=Shuen|first3=A.|title=Dynamic capabilities and strategic management|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1997|volume=18|pages=509–534|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the dynamic capability perspective assumes that executives need to engage in resource adaptation or renewal because the value of existing resources depreciates in the light of external changes, the CBV focuses on the competitive advantage that can be gained from combining existing resources in novel ways.

==Limitations==
According to Luo and Child (2015), there exist several limitations of the composition-based strategy:
* It increases the difficulty in building brand awareness and customer loyalty because firms that adopt this strategy serve pragmatic consumers who are indifferent to brands but mindful of product offerings. Therefore, these firms are facing competitive pressures from new entrants that use a similar composition strategy and from substituting products or services offered by similar rivals.
* Composition mandates a myriad of inter-unit synchronization within the firm and requires inter-firm coordination with outsiders residing in a related upstream and downstream vertical chain, as well as specialized intermediaries and service providers from supporting industries. Coordination costs and difficulties of orchestration may undermine composition-based success.
* Composition-based strategies may cause the firm to depend on external resources. However, the open markets are not yet perfect and may cause a higher level of uncertainty and vulnerability to the firms. Also, the firms that do not have strong power in network exchanges will suffer from unintended consequences stemming from resource dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfeffer|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Salancik|first2=Gerald R.|title=The external control of organizations : a resource dependence perspective|date=1978|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=9780060451936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The advantages of composition are temporary in nature and will decline over time, especially after the firm passes the imitative or catch-up stage, due to the lack of patented technologies, corporate credibility, and organizational reputation,

&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; '''EUR.1 movement certificate''' (also known as '''EUR.1 certificate''', or '''EUR.1''') is a form used in international commodity traffic. The EUR.1 is most importantly recognized as a [[certificate of origin]] in the external trade in legal sense, especially within the framework of several [[Bilateralism|bi]]- and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] agreements of the Pan-European [[preference system]] (the [[European Union Association Agreement]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notice 827: European Community preferences - export procedures - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures#issue-of-movement-certificates-eur1eur-med|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EUR1 certificates|url = http://www.chamber-international.com/exporting-chamber-international/documentation-for-export-and-import/eur-1-certificates/|website = www.chamber-international.com|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EUROPA - Taxation and Customs Union / Preferential Origin|url = http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/introduction/article_774_en.htm|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
Each [[free trade agreement]] (bi- and multi-lateral) states which products are covered, and which ones can benefit from lower (or none) rates of duty. The condition of "origin" is that the products must have been completely manufactured, processed or transformed in a member country.

=== Issuance ===
The applicant for the EUR.1 (the exporter) must be able to prove the origin of the goods, which is usually done via presentation of the supplier invoice stating the product origin. This is called the supplier's declaration (SD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notice 827: European Community preferences - export procedures - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures#suppliers-declarations-sd|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-15|at = section 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exporter then fills in the EUR.1 application form, and hands it over to the competent authorities (usually the customs office) along with the supplier's invoice. The authorities certify the form with a stamp and send it back to the exporter.

=== Use ===
The EUR.1 is used to certify the origin of a product, and if applicable, benefit from favorable trade terms (tariffs mainly) under a preferential trade policy of the EU.

In order to benefit from the preferential rate during a [[customs clearance]], a valid EUR.1 movement certificate must be handed over to the competent authority (likely a customs office), in which the manufacturer certifies the origin of the goods.

In place of a movement certificate, a simple [[declaration of origin]] on the invoice can be provided by the manufacturer or sender of the goods in place of a proper movement certificate: this is called an invoice declaration. This is an accepted alternative to the EUR.1 only if the amount of items with EU [[preferential origin]] under a single shipment does not exceed at certain amount (for a non-approved exporter). If it concerns an [[approved exporter]] (that is, a regular authorized exporter), this value limit does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notice 827: European Community preferences - export procedures - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures/notice-827-european-community-preferences-export-procedures#simplified-procedures-for-approved-exporters|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TAXUD: [http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/preferential/article_781_en.htm Generalised System of Preferences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EUR.1 is valid between 4 and 10 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notice 827: European Community preferences - export procedures - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-827-european-union-preferences-export-procedures/notice-827-european-union-preferences-export-procedures#for-how-long-are-movement-certificates-eur1-and-eur-med-valid |website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-09|at = 3.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fifth Regiment Armory''' is a historic [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|armory]] located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is an imposing, fortress-type structure situated in midtown Baltimore. It consists of a full basement, a first floor containing a 200 foot by 300 foot [[drill hall]], a mezzanine or "balcony" level, and a newer second level (reconstructed in 1933 after a fire) housing the trussed steel drill hall roof.  The façade features [[buttress]]es, [[parapet]]s, casement windows, and a crenellated roofline, giving the appearance of a medieval fortification.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-928.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Fifth Regiment Armory|date=July 1985|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Susanne Moore|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]].

The Fifth Regiment Armory was designed by architects [[Wyatt &amp; Nolting]].  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It is included within the [[Baltimore National Heritage Area]].&lt;ref name="balto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Portals/0/agencies/heritage/public%20downloads/neighborhoods_heritageareas.pdf |title=Baltimore National Heritage Area Map |publisher=City of Baltimore |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522024255/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Portals/0/agencies/heritage/public%20downloads/neighborhoods_heritageareas.pdf |archivedate=May 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 1958, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] delivered a television speech from the Fifth Regiment Armory.  The event was attended by Maryland Governor [[Theodore McKeldin]], Senator [[John Glenn Beall, Jr.]], Senator [[John Marshall Butler]], and Congressman [[James Devereux]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=11283&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Financial risk types}}
{{Finance sidebar}}

'''Financial risk''' is any of various types of [[risk]] associated with [[finance|financing]], including [[financial transaction]]s that include company loans in risk of [[default (finance)|default]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialrisk.asp#axzz1b9QLCKIO|accessdate=1 October 2011|publisher=Investopedia|title=Financial Risk: Definition | date = 2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hmwsw/financial_risk|publisher=Credo Reference|year=2003|title=In Wall Street Words | accessdate = 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is understood to include only [[downside risk]], meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantitative risk management: concepts, techniques and tools|first1=Alexander J.|last1=McNeil|first2=Rüdiger|last2=Frey|first3=Paul|last3=Embrechts|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-691-12255-7|pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of financial risk management|first1=Karen A.|last1=Horcher|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-471-70616-8|pages=1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A science has evolved around [[financial risk management|managing market and financial risk]] under the general title of [[modern portfolio theory]] initiated by Dr. [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952 with his article, "Portfolio Selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markowitz|first=H.M.|date=March 1952|title=Portfolio Selection|journal=The [[Journal of Finance]]|volume=7|issue=1|pages=77–91|doi=10.2307/2975974|jstor=2975974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern portfolio theory, the [[variance]] (or [[standard deviation]]) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk.

==Types==

===Asset-backed risk===
Asset-backed risk is the risk that changes in one or more assets that support an [[asset-backed security]] will significantly impact the value of the supported security.  Risks include interest rate, term modification, and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk.

===Credit risk===
{{Main|Credit risk}}

Credit risk, also called ''default risk'', is the risk associated with a borrower going into [[default (finance)|default]] (not making payments as promised).  Investor losses include lost [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]], decreased [[cash flow]], and increased [[collection cost]]s.  An investor can also assume credit risk through direct or indirect use of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].  For example, an investor may purchase an investment using [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Or an investment may directly or indirectly use or rely on [[Repurchase agreement|repo]], forward commitment, or [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments.

===Foreign investment risk===
Foreign investment risk is the risk of rapid and extreme changes in value due to: smaller markets; differing [[Accountancy|accounting]], [[Financial statement|reporting]], or [[Financial audit|auditing]] standards; [[nationalization]], [[Confiscation|expropriation]] or confiscatory taxation; [[Economic sanctions|economic conflict]]; or political or diplomatic changes.  Valuation, liquidity, and regulatory issues may also add to foreign investment risk.

===Liquidity risk===
{{Main|Liquidity risk}}
{{See also|Liquidity}}

This is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk:
*''Asset liquidity'' – An asset cannot be sold due to lack of liquidity in the market – essentially a sub-set of market risk.  This can be accounted for by:
**Widening [[bid-offer spread]]
**Making explicit liquidity reserves
**Lengthening holding period for [[value at risk|VaR]] calculations
*''Funding liquidity'' – Risk that liabilities:
**Cannot be met when they fall due
**Can only be met at an uneconomic price
**Can be name-specific or [[systemic risk|systemic]]

===Market risk===
{{Main|Market risk}}

The four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk:
* [[Equity risk]] is the risk that [[share price|stock prices]] in general (not related to a particular company or industry) or the [[implied volatility]] will change.
* [[Interest rate risk]] is the risk that [[interest rate]]s or the implied volatility will change.
* [[Currency risk]] is the risk that [[exchange rate|foreign exchange rates]] or the implied volatility will change, which affects, for example, the value of an asset held in that currency.
* [[Commodity risk]] is the risk that [[commodity]] prices (e.g. corn, copper, crude oil) or implied volatility will change.

===Operational risk===
{{Main|Operational risk}}
Operational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment

===Other risks===
*[[Reputational risk]]
*[[Legal risk]]
*[[IT risk]]

===Model risk===
{{Main|Model risk}}

==Diversification==

{{Main|Diversification (finance)}}

Financial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].

The returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7535787.stm | work=BBC News | title=Another record profit for Exxon | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/16/idUKN16550720110516 | work=Reuters | first=John | last=Crawley | title=U.S. airline shares up as oil price slides | date = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification.
If one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that [[index fund]]s have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE.

However, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not "fully diversified". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes.

A key issue in diversification is the [[correlation]] between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the [[late-2000s recession]] when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|title=The Impacts of Extreme Events of Dynamic Interactions on Interest Rate, Real House Price and Stock Markets|journal=International Research Journal of Finance &amp; Economics|year=2010|issue=35|p=187|author1=Hsiu-Jung Tsai|author2=Ming-Chi Chen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040053/http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.mit.edu/Alo/www/Papers/august07.pdf | title=What Happened To The Quants In August 2007?∗ | author=Amir E. Khandani|author2=Andrew W. Lo | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. 
There is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations.

==Hedging==
{{Main|Hedge (finance)}}
[[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other.
For instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Video of optical fiber splicing - 01.ogv|thumbnail|Video of optical fiber fusion splicing]]
'''Fusion splicing''' is the act of joining two [[optical fiber]]s end-to-end using heat.  The goal is to fuse the two fibers together in such a way that light passing through the fibers is not [[scattering|scattered]] or [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] back by the splice, and so that the splice and the region surrounding it are almost as strong as the intact fiber. The source of heat is usually an [[electric arc]], but can also be a laser, or a gas flame, or a [[Electrical filament|tungsten filament]] through which [[electric current|current]] is passed.

==Process==
The process of fusion splicing normally involves heat to melt or fuse the ends of two optical fibers together. The splicing process begins by preparing each fiber end for fusion.

===Stripping the fiber===
Stripping is the act of removing the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for fusion splicing. The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber.

Fiber optical stripping is usually carried out by simply passing the fiber through a mechanical stripping device similar to a wire-stripper. Otherwise, a special stripping and preparation unit that uses hot sulphuric acid or a controlled flow of hot air is used to remove the coating. Under a process patented by Edward J Forrest, Jr (7,125,494) and assigned to Illinois Tool Works, Glenview, Illinois, there is a timed chemical removal process that does not require use of hot sulphuric acid or hot air.  The process is patented as a "solvent capture method" primarily conceived to remove the "matrix" that holds individual fibers and creates a "ribbon fiber".   This same procedure can be "timed" to remove not only matrix, but also coatings and claddings.
Cleaning the stripping and cleaving tools is also important.

===Cleaning the fiber===
The customary means to clean bare fibers is with alcohol and wipes.   However, high purity isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is hygroscopic: it attracts moisture to itself.  This is problematic as IPA is either procured in pre-saturated wiper format or in (host) containers ranging for USA quart to gallon to drums.   From the host container the IPA is transferred to smaller more usable containers.  The hydroscopic nature of IPA is such that the highest quality at 99.9% is also the most hygroscopic.   This means that moisture absorption into both the host container as well as the actual user's container begins with the time the original container is opened and continues as amounts are transferred and removed from both.  A 2003 laboratory study by ITW Chemtronics noted that 99.9% IPA began to absorb moisture (at 72F and 65% Relative Humidity) within fifteen minutes.  Since there is no provision to deter this, this unique quality of IPA makes it less desirable than chemicals such as HFE-7100 based products or precision hydrocarbons.  There is work being done to qualify aqueous based cleaners for this application.

===Cleaving the fiber===
The fiber is then cleaved using the score-and-break method so that its end-face is perfectly flat and perpendicular to the axis of the fiber. The quality of each fiber end is inspected using a microscope. In fusion splicing, splice loss is a direct function of the angles and quality of the two fiber-end faces. The closer to 90 degrees the cleave angle is the lower optical loss the splice will yield. The quality of the cleave tool being used is critical.

===Splicing the fibers===

[[File:Optical fiber fusion splicing.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fiber spliced, still unprotected]]

Current fusion splicers are either core or cladding alignment. Using one of these methods the two cleaved fibers are automatically aligned by the fusion splicer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aflglobal.com/ |title=AFL - Fiber optic cable, transmission and substation accessories, outside plant equipment, connectors, fusion splicers, test and inspection equipment, training services |publisher=aflglobal.com |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the x,y,z plane, then are fused together. Prior to the removal of the spliced fiber from the fusion splicer, a proof-test is performed to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use. The bare fiber area is protected either by [[recoating]] or with a splice protector. A splice protector is a heat shrinkable tube with a strength membrane and less loss.

A simplified optical splicing procedure includes:
# Characteristics of placement of the splicing process.
# Checking fiber optic splice closure content and supplementary kits.
# Cable installation in oval outlet.
# Cable preparation.
# Organization of the fibers inside the tray.
# Installing the [[heat-shrinkable sleeve]] and testing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgetelekom.com/What-is-Fiber-Optic-Splicing-aid-295.html|title=fiber optic splicing|publisher=fiberstore.com |date=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
[[File:FTTH APPLICATION.jpg|thumb|INNO View 7 splicer on a tripod and work table]]
The basic fusion splicing apparatus consists of two fixtures on which the fibres are mounted and two electrodes. These fixtures are often called sheath clamps. Inspection microscope assists in the placement of the prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibres are placed into the apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, fusion splicing used nichrome wire as the heating element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse together. The small size of the fusion splice and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) one of the most popular splicing techniques in commercial applications.

Alternatives to fusion splicing include using [[optical fiber connector]]s or [[mechanical splice]]s both of which have higher [[insertion loss]]es, lower reliability and higher [[return loss]]es than fusion splicing.

'''Henrique José de Sousa Neto''' (born 27 April 1936, in Lisbon) is a Portuguese [[entrepreneur]], [[industrialist]] and former member of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese parliament]] for the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]]. He founded the company [[Iberomoldes]] in 1975 and became one of the most noted businesspersons in the Portuguese engineering-related industry. Henrique Neto was the first candidate to step up for the [[Portuguese presidential election of 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=4471266 Henrique Neto é o primeiro candidato oficial a Belém, Carla Soares, Jornal de Notícias, 23/03/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Lisbon]] on April 27, 1936, Neto studied at first in the Lisbon Industrial School and then at the Commercial School of [[Marinha Grande]], a town from where his family had come from  to Lisbon and where he moved at age 14. He began working as a metal worker apprentice in a mold factory, where he became director and later owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.faz-acontecer.pt/autobiografia Autobiografia de Henrique Neto, Faz Acontecer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1975 he founded [[Iberomoldes]], which would become in the following years the holding company of a group of twelve industrial companies and more than 1000 employees. It was from this group that SET was born, an engineering company especialized in innovative products development and IBEROLEFF in [[Pombal Municipality|Pombal]] for the production and export of components for automotive and industrial companies. He sold his position in 2009 to a co-founder.

Alongside its professional life in industry he also started very young in Portuguese politics and activism, influenced by his family environment which was not aligned with the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo regime]]. He was affiliated with the MUD youth (an anti-regime organization), and participated in anti-regime conferences, illegally reproduced documents at home and worked actively in the presidential campaign of General [[Humberto Delgado]]. In 1969 he was even arrested for a while due to these anti-regime activities.

He joined the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] in 1968 but left it in 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution]], in disagreement with the positions that were being taken, devoting himself thereafter only to business life. In 1993 Neto joined the [[Portuguese Socialist Party]] at the invitation of [[Jorge Sampaio]]. He was elected in 1995, and worked as a deputy until the end of his term as member of the Portuguese Parliament in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.parlamento.pt/DeputadoGP/Paginas/Biografia.aspx?BID=1371 Biografia], Henrique José de Sousa Neto bio at the [[Portuguese Parliament]] webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Henry Ludington ''' (May 25, 1739 – January 24, 1817) was an American businessman who ran a [[grist mill]] and owned a substantial parcel of land in [[New York (state)|New York state]]. He founded Ludingtonville, which later became the town of [[Kent, New York]].  He was a citizen of [[Patterson, New York]], and was involved with its growth.

Ludington fought in the [[Seven Years' War]] and, as captain, commanded a volunteer regiment at the [[Battle of Ridgefield]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Ludington was promoted to Colonel and became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[General officer|General]] [[George Washington]] in providing spies for [[espionage]]. He was associated with [[John Jay]] in a ring of spies. His daughter [[Sybil Ludington]] is well known to historians for her role in the [[American Revolution]] in helping the cause for independence by undertaking a nighttime horseback ride similar to that done by the patriot [[Paul Revere]] to alert the colonial militia to the approach of [[British Armed Forces|British forces]].

Ludington's descendants have continued his legacy in several states besides [[New York (state)|New York]], including [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. Some became leaders in their own right and others were involved in developing towns.

== Ancestry ==

Ludington's great-great-grandfather William Ludington (b. 1608) and his wife Ellen (b. 1617) were of English origin. Their places of birth in England are unknown. They were married in England in 1636. A few years later they immigrated to America. William and Ellen moved permanently to [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], in 1640 and raised seven children (one had been born in England).{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=18}} William and his wife are the founders of the Ludington family in America and many of their descendants are in the [[Eastern United States]].{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=19}} William and Ellen moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], about 1660.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=9}} It is recorded by 20th-century historian Louis S. Patrick that William died in 1663 at East Haven.{{sfn|Patrick|1907|p=265}} By other historians his death is recorded as occurring in 1662.{{sfn|Pelletreau|1886|p=691}} The difference in dating is due to the use the [[Julian Calendar]] in the mid-18th century in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=10}}

The sixth child of William, founder of the American Ludingtons, was another William Ludington (second in family) who was born about 1655 (died 1737). His first wife was Martha Rose and they had two sons and a daughter. Their first child was a Henry Ludington, who was born in 1679. The second child of this Henry Ludington was still another William Ludington, born in [[Branford, Connecticut]], on September 6, 1702. He married Mary Knowles November 5, 1730, and they had eight children. Their third child was named Henry Ludington; his uncles were [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] and fought in one way or another for American independence.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=20–21}}

== Life ==
Henry Ludington was born May 25, 1739, in [[Branford, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Patrick|1907|p=265}}{{sfn|Miller|1907|pp=504–508}} He had two older sisters, Submit and Mary, and five younger siblings, Lydia, Samuel, Rebecca, Anne, and Stephen. Not all survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=22–23}}

Ludington was schooled as a child in Branford typical to that of schooling in colonial towns of the 18th century.{{sfn|Miller|1907|pp=504–508}} The school was controlled by the local Christian church and provided minimal basic education. Ludington was not interested in scholarly studies, but thought in terms of action instead. Ludington decided to discover the world and never completed his schooling.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=24–25}}

Ludington enlisted in the local military in September 1755, at the age of sixteen. He was with Captain Foote's company of the Second Connecticut Regiment.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=26–27}} Historian Louis S. Patrick says that Ludington re-enlisted on April 19, 1756, served under Colonel Andrew Ward at Crown Point, and was discharged on November 13, 1756. He was called back again for fifteen days of service at a "general alarm" for the relief of [[Fort William Henry]] in August 1757. He re-enlisted on April 14, 1759, for the
campaign of the Second Connecticut Regiment under Colonel [[Nathan Whiting]] and was a member of David Baldwin's Third Company.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=29-30}}

Ludington marched with the British and American troops to Canada and participated in the victory at Quebec on September 13, 1759. He was entrusted at the age of twenty with being in charge of a company of sixty wounded soldiers who returned to New England. The arduous journey was made from Quebec to Boston in the infamous winter of 1759–60. Even though there were many hardships Ludington got his disabled comrades home safely. He then proceeded from Boston to Branford, Connecticut, in the spring of 1760 and retired from his military career. He returned to civilian life and married his cousin Abigail on May 1, 1760. She was born on May 8, 1745, so was just turning fifteen. They had twelve children, all born in Kent, New York (then known as Fredericksburgh).{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=35–45}}

Ludington received from [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] the promotion of lieutenant in the British Colonial Army as an accolade in recognition of his services. He held that position until he heard of the [[Stamp Act 1765|''Duties in American Colonies Stamp Act'']], when he resigned in protest.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=30–31}} Ludington then accepted on February 13, 1773, a captain's commission from [[William Tryon]], the last British governor of New York. He held that position until the beginning of the American Revolution. Ludington then was the commander of the 7th regiment (infantry) of "Dutchess County" in [[Province of New York|New York]] in the [[Battle of Ridgefield]] in April 1777, of the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfn|NYGBS|1989|p=226}} The volunteers were mostly from the towns of Kent and [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]] of that county (later Putman County).{{sfn|Cole|2007|p=48}}{{sfn|Maxson|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Pierce|1901|p=270}}

Among the first spies Ludington collaborated with was [[Enoch Crosby]].{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=115}} Crosby was an American Revolutionary War soldier and worked in the territory where Ludington commanded troops. Crosby was a [[shoemaker]] by trade and while traveling for his trade, he obtained critical espionage information that was important to Washington for his troops.{{sfn|Patrick|1907|p=270}} Ludington knew that Crosby had this vital information and his objective to get it in the correct hands. He aided Crosby in providing shelter and necessary provisions. Ludington helped other spies also, among them Benajah Tubbs.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=115}} Ludington gathered information vital to Washington and passed it on to the Continental Army.{{sfn|Patrick|1907|p=270}} He worked with [[John Jay]] in a spy ring that gathered information about British activities.&lt;ref name=JohnJay&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ludingtonsride.com/history.htm |title=Sybil's Story |last=Welty |first=Charles R.  |date=2017 |website= |publisher= Reproduced from Sybil Ludington: The Call to Arms by V.

Ludington was much involved in the community of Patterson, New York. He built the "Ludington Mill" and gave the lumber required for building the first local academy, an important school for the town.&lt;ref name=academy&gt;{{cite web |url= http://connecticutsar.org/secret-service-of-the-american-revolution/ |title=SECRET SERVICE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION |last= |first= |date=2017 |website= |publisher=Connecticut (CT) Sons of the American Revolution |access-date=April 24, 2017 |quote= This is a true story of what might be termed the "secret service."

Ludington was sociable and often in his retirement would meet with John Jay and [[John Crane (soldier)|John Crane]] at Elijah Townsend's house to reminisce about their days as spies of the American Revolution. He died of cancer at the age of 78 on January 24, 1817. His remains were buried in the churchyard of the town's Presbyterian church. His  Patterson grave is marked with a tombstone that has a short inscription:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; H. L. ''
In Memory of
''Henry Ludington''
Jan. 24, 1817
Aged 78 years
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Historian William J. Blake of Putnam County said the epitaph was so simple that it didn't do justice for the patriot that helped develop the American government. Ludington's wife, Abigail, died eight years later at the age of 80 on August 3, 1825, and is buried beside him.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=208–209}}

The Will of Ludington is now on file in the surrogate's office of Putnam County. Ludington instructed the executors of his estate to sell off a part of his farm to pay for debts he owed. The remaining part of his farm was to go to his wife, daughter, son and granddaughter. The Will said that if any of them married, they would relinquish their portion of the estate and it would go to the benefit of those still unmarried.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=210–211}} The [[grist mill]] that Ludington built around 1775 and the immediate area was known as the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Ludingtonville, New York|Ludingtonville]].{{sfn|US Congress|1963|p=3168}}{{sfn|Miller|1907|pp=504–508}} The grist mill contained the local post office.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=v}} The mill was part of Ludington's Will.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|pp=210–211}} This area is now in the town of Kent which is near Carmel, New York.{{sfn|Johnson|1907|p=v}}

Ludington was the grandfather of [[Harrison Ludington]], who was the mayor of Milwaukee in 1871, 1873, and 1875 – also the 12th governor of Wisconsin.{{sfn|White|1904|p=78}} His daughter, Sybil Ludington, is known as the female [[Paul Revere]] for her role in alerting her father's [[Minute Men|minute men]] troops to meet the advancing [[United Kingdom|British]] army.{{sfn|National Magazine|1893|p=479}}{{sfn|Frank|2013|p=365}}{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=306}} Ludington's grandson [[James Ludington|James]] founded [[Ludington, Michigan]].

'''John Ezzidio''' (c. 1810 – October 1872) was a freed slave from [[Nigeria]] who became a successful businessman and politician in [[Sierra Leone]]. Rescued from a slave ship headed for [[Brazil]], he was apprenticed to a French shopkeeper and taught himself to read and write. Ezzidio eventually rose to the position of mayor of [[Freetown]] and later became a member the colonial governor's Legislative Council.

==Kidnapping==
Ezzidio, a [[Nupe people|Nupe]] from what is now [[Niger State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waado.org/nigerian_scholars/archive/debates/forpolicy/sierleone.html |title=A Perspective on Nigeria's Involvement in the Sierra Leone Imbroglio |accessdate=2007-12-31 |last=Omoigui |first=Nowa |work= |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; was kidnapped by slavers when he was young and brought to an area populated by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. In 1827, he was sold to white slave traders, who put him on board a ship bound for Brazil. The ship was intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]],

==Business and political career==
Ezzidio became the apprentice of a French shopkeeper named Beyaust; Beyaust named his apprentice "Isadore". The name was written down as "Ezzido", and eventually morphed into "Ezzidio". After the death of the Frenchman, Ezzidio was hired by an English firm. He managed a European-owned shop and then used the money he saved to start his own trading firm. He taught himself to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, Ezzidio purchased property for £100. He visited England the next year, making import deals with companies based there; by importing directly, he eliminated the need for middle men. Goods that were sent to his George Street property, at a total value of between £3000 and £4000 per year, included clothing such as suits and boots, foodstuffs such as ham, cookies, tea, and [[fortified wines]] (port and sherry).&lt;ref name=sanneh130&gt;Sanneh, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, [[William Fergusson]], Governor of Sierra Leone, appointed him to the position of alderman, and in 1845 Ezzidio became Mayor of Freetown.&lt;ref name=sanneh130/&gt;

In 1862, Governor [[Samuel Wensley Blackall]] split the Governor's Council into two parts, an Executive and a Legislative Council; the latter allowed representation from, among others, the colony's merchants. The Mercantile Association, in a vote consisting of twenty-four Africans, fourteen Europeans, and one Caribbean merchant, elected Ezzidio to represent them on this body. While on the council, he was noted for his fairness and unobtrusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezzidio described himself as an "[[oracle]]" of the people; some people, meanwhile, nicknamed him "dancing bear" due to his size and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wesleyan Church involvement==
Ezzidio joined the [[Methodism|Wesleyan Church]] in 1835. He became a lay preacher in 1842 and also ran a Sunday school. He is recorded to have made the largest donation of all contributors at an 1864 church celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Sanneh, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, at Ezzidio's request, a white superintendent was sent from England to supervise the Wesleyan mission. This superintendent, [[Benjamin Trebaskis]], was a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]], strongly sectarian, and opposed to the interdenominational cooperation Ezzidio and others in the church had previously supported.&lt;ref&gt;Salleh, pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Trebaskis feuded with Ezzidio over church policy until the latter's death in October 1872.&lt;ref name=heroes/&gt;

==Honours==
In 2007, in a campaign to [[Africanization|Africanise]] British street names, the government of Freetown announced plans to rename Howe Street after Ezzidio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Yvonne |last= Ndege-Burke |author2=Mohammed Fajah-Barrie|title= S Leone honours Africa slave campaigners |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6466951.stm |work= BBC News|publisher=BBC |date= 2007-03-20|accessdate=2007-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3347">'''John Robertson Dunlap''' (1857 – June 5, 1937) was an American journalist, editor and publisher of engineering magazines and books.&lt;ref name="NYT 1937"&gt;"John Dunlap dead: Long a publisher", ''The New York Times'', June 6, 1937:&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as founder of the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;George Worthington (1966) ''Factory.'' Vol. 124, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; which in the early 20th century became the "quality magazine in the field of business management."&lt;ref&gt;''Business Week.'' Part 3. (1966), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] to Henry Clay and La Belle Boyce Dunlap, Dunlap attended [[Linsly School]] in Wheeling, West Virginia. He started working in [[civil engineering]] at the age of 18 in 1873.&lt;ref name="NYT 1937"/&gt;

Dunlap came into prominence as president and general manager of the ''[[Louisville Commercial|Daily Louisville Commercial]]'' in 1884, a journal published in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] from 1869 to 1902. In 1889 he moved to New York City, where he started his first magazine ''The India Rubber World'',&lt;ref name="NYT 1937"/&gt; nowadays ''The India Rubber World and Electrical Trades Review'', or shortly ''Rubber World''.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Rohrer, "[http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/article/From+the+Editor/1614573/0/article.html 125th Anniversary celebrated]", ''Rubber World'', January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the magazine ''Hardware'' in 1890, The ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' in 1891, and The ''Engineering Index'' in 1895. The ''Engineering Magazine'' was renamed ''Industrial Management'' in 1916, and in 1917 the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] acquired the ''Engineering Index''. In 1921   Dunlap started his last great project the ''Industry Illustrated'' magazine.&lt;ref name="NYT 1937"/&gt;

In 1891 Dunlap had founded the Engineering Magazine Company in New York, and became its chairman of the board. Around 1917 this company merged into the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc. The Engineering Magazine Co also published over 40 books on industrial management issues, most noted the "Ford Methods and Ford Shops" by [[Horace L. Arnold]] and Fay L. Fauroto, which offered the first full description of [[Henry Ford]]'s work.&lt;ref name="NYT 1937"/&gt;

A '''layoff'''&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/layoff |title=layoff noun - definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionary Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the temporary suspension or permanent [[termination of employment]] of an [[employee]] or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff)&lt;ref name=govuk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/consultation|title=Redundancy: your rights|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization.  Originally, ''layoff'' referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or [[employment]]&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvard University. Graduate School of Business Administration|title=Labor Terminology|journal=Bulletin of the Bureau of Business Research|date=1921|volume=25|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPQsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English,&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}} requiring the addition of "temporary" to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with [[Wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]].  ''Laid off workers'' or ''displaced workers'' are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or [[Shift work|shift]] was abolished (Borbely, 2011).&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/lfcharacteristics.htm#displaced|title=Labor force characteristics|date=October 18, 2010|work=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=Glossary|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, W. J., Blinder, A. S. &amp; Wolff, E. N. (2003). Downsizing in America: Reality, Causes and Consequences. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.

(1997), ‘Effective downsizing strategies in Japan and America: is there a convergence of employment practices?’, Academy of Management Review, Vol.22, No.1, pp. 226–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmakjian and Robinson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mellahi, K. and Wilkinson, A. (2004) Downsizing and Innovation Output: A Review of Literature and Research Propositions, BAM Paper 2004, British Academy of Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.

== Terminology ==
[[Euphemism]]s are often used to "soften the blow" in the process of [[firing]] and being fired.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=A |year=2004 |title= Downsizing, rightsizing and dumbsizing: quality, human resources and sustainability - Total Quality Management |volume= 15 no 8 |url=http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/16844/1/34201_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RedWilk2006&gt;Redman T and Wilkinson A (2006) Downsizing, in T. Redman and A. Wilkinson(eds), Contemporary Human Resource Management,  London: FT/Prentice Hall,  pp.&amp;nbsp;356–381&lt;/ref&gt; The term "layoff" originally meant a temporary interruption in work&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"/&gt; (and usually pay). The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of "temporary" to refer to the original meaning. Many other euphemisms have been coined for "(permanent) layoff", including "downsizing", "excess reduction", "rightsizing", "leveraging synergies", "[[delayering]]", "smartsizing", "redeployment", "workforce reduction", "workforce optimization", "simplification", "force shaping", "recussion", and "reduction in force" (also called "RIF", especially in the government employment sector).  "Mass layoff" is defined by the [[United States Department of Labor]] as 50 or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time. "Attrition" implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire. "Early retirement" means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later. While "redundancy" is a specific legal term in [[UK labour law]]. When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/redundancy |title=Employers Redundancy procedure, Redundancy Policy, Redundancy compliance |publisher=Citation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be perceived{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as [[obfuscation]]. [[Firing]]s imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer's and employees' control, especially in the face of a recession such as the [[Late 2000s recession|one that began in the late 2000s]].

== Common abbreviations for ''reduction in force'' ==
'''RIF''' - A generic reduction in force, of undetermined method. Often pronounced like the word ''riff'' rather than spelled out. Sometimes used as a verb, as in "the employees were pretty heavily ''riffed''".

'''eRIF''' – Layoff notice by email.

'''IRIF''' - Involuntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did not voluntarily choose to leave the company. This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs, firings, or both, but would not usually imply resignations or retirements. If the employee is fired rather than laid off, the term "with cause" may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee's performance and/or behavior, rather than being financially motivated.

'''VRIF''' - Voluntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement. In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package. Conversely, the company is not obliged to accept an employees decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF.

'''WFR''' - Work force reduction.

== Layoffs in the public sector ==
Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recession of 2007-2008]], the [[public sector]] has seen significantly smaller job growth  in employment versus the [[private sector]] and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Čudanov|first1=Mladen|last2=Jaško|first2=Ondrej|last3=Săvoiu|first3=Gheorghe|title=Public and public utility enterprises restructuring: Statistical and quantitative aid for ensuring human resource sustainability|journal=Amfiteatru Economic|date=2012|volume=14|issue=32|pages=307–322|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31686847/Article_1126.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1512052342&amp;Signature=uXsCTUwHwImLMKJJZzloksIrMdY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPublic_and_Public_Utility_Enterprises_Re.pdf|ref=PublicSectorRestructuringSustainability}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the public sector declines the demand for services from the private sector decline as well. Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector, inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets.

== Unemployment compensation ==
The risk of being laid off varies depending on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an [[employee handbook]]. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wonk|first=Kim|date=2010|title=Unemployment Risks and the Origins of Unemployment Compensation|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=45|pages=57|doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9057-9|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Canada, Dorion (1995) states that white-collar workers who have been made redundant receive higher re-employment wages, than those in blue-collar occupations as their job is regarded as being of a higher status than blue collar workers, whereas in France, Margolis (1999, 2002) finds that workers who have been laid off have smaller unemployment periods and higher re-employment earnings in comparison with other unemployed people.&lt;ref name=Okatenko2010&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41219168|title=The Impact of the Reason for Layoff on the Subsequent Unemployment Duration|first=Anna|last=Okatenko|date=1 January 2010|publisher=|journal=Annals of Economics and Statistics|issue=99/100|pages=285–315|via=|doi=10.2307/41219168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company.

Packages may also vary if the employee is laid off, or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff (VRIF).  The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee's ability to collect whatever form of [[unemployment compensation]] might be available in their [[jurisdiction]]. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits.&lt;ref name=Lihzis2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |title=SUB-Pay Plan Legal Precedent |publisher=Subpay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331044842/http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the [[U.S. Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the [[IRS]] in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610155850/http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/ |date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for [[FICA]], [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|FUTA]], and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis.  There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized ‘anorexic organization’. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;168). However, some writers draw attention to the ‘obsessive’ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting, organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence ‘trimming’ and ‘tightening belts’ are the order of the day.&lt;ref name=TylerWilkinson2007&gt;Tyler M and Wilkinson A (2007) The Tyranny of Corporate Slenderness: Understanding Organizations Anorexically,  Work, Employment and Society,  21: 537-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of layoffs ==
Traditionally, layoffs directly affect the employee. However, the employee terminated is not alone in this. Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee. Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace, to the employee, and effects to the economy.

'''Effects of layoffs in the workplace:'''  Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs. Although from the employer's perspective a layoff is beneficial for the [[business]], layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees' [[job security]] as well as creates an apprehension and fear of [[Termination of employment|termination]] for the remaining employees, and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment.  According to ''Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations,''&lt;ref name=Noer&gt;{{cite book |url= |last=Noer |first=David |authorlink=David M. Noer |date=2009 |title=Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |doi=10.1002/jts.2490100119 |isbn=9781555425609}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the post-layoff environment, there is a need for empathy, tangibility, self-knowledge, and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees. The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt. In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs, Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as "Responsible restructuring" approach.&lt;ref name="CascioResponsible"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cascio|first1=Wayne|title=Strategies for responsible restructuring|journal=The Academy of Management Executive|date=November 1, 2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=39–50|doi=10.5465/AME.2005.19417906|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wayne_Cascio/publication/279927986_Strategies_for_responsible_restructuring/links/583cc32a08aeb3987e2f9b55/Strategies-for-responsible-restructuring.pdf|ref=Cascio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability. No matter the position in an organization, employees will look for job security.

'''Effects of layoffs to the employee:'''  [[Employment|Employees]] (or former employees in this case) can be affected in a couple of different ways. When an employee is laid off, his or her general trust in long-term work may decrease, reducing expectations upon rehire.  After an employee withstands a layoff, the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes. Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co-workers and [[management]]. Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances, job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs. Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee. At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact.

'''Effects of layoffs in the American economy:'''  Layoffs create lower job security overall, and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions. Layoffs have generally two major effects on the [[Economy of the United States|economy]] and [[stockholders]]. The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff. If an industry that employs a majority of a [[region]] (freight in the northeast for example) suffers and has to lay employees off, there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area. This can have leave [[ripple effect]]s nationwide. Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs.

== Layoffs abroad ==
In francophone Belgium, the term [[Procédure Renault]] has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s.  When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which is also known as severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave.  If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/redundancy/redundancy-pay-and-entitlements|title=Redundancy pay &amp; entitlements|last=Ombudsman|first=Fair Work|website=www.fairwork.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A layoff is also known as a '''retrenchment''' in ([[South African English]]). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called '''[[Redundancy in English law|redundancy]]'''.&lt;ref name=govuk/&gt;  Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving the company of one's own free will]], in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a [[Voluntary redundancy|onetime payment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour]] force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal ''redeployment''.

This '''list of video telecommunication services and product brands''' is for groupings of notable video telecommunication services, brands of videophones, webcams and video conferencing hardware and systems, all related to [[videotelephony]] for two-way communications with live video and audio.

* The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Section 1: Hardware and related product brands|first section]] includes video telecommunication ''devices'' such as [[videophone]]s, [[videoconferencing]] and [[telepresence|telepresence systems]], [[webcam]]s and related products such as [[codec]]s and [[software client|videoconferencing software clients]];
* the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Section 2: Video telecommunication services listing|second section]] is a listing of video telecommunication ''services'' such as [[Video Relay Service|Video Relay Services (for deaf, hard-of-hearing and speech-impaired individuals)]], [[telemedicine]], Public Access Videoconferencing facilities, etc...;
* the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Section 3: Defunct brands .26 services|last section]] at the bottom of this page lists ''defunct brands and services'' for historical research purposes.

The products below are listed by their ''&lt;u&gt;normal and intended&lt;/u&gt;'' purpose, even though their names or descriptions may differ from the categories shown here (refer to terminology within general article pages).

== Hardware, software and related product brands ==
[[File:KabelWelt Ojo.jpg|thumb|275px|Worldgate Ojo PVP-900 broadband videophone from 2005, notable for its vertical styling and the cordless handset resting on the support arm for its 'portrait' type display.]]

=== Videophone hardware brands for person-to-person (point-to-point) use ===

Stand-alone videophones are point-to-point units ''&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;'' employing ''[[Videoconferencing#Multipoint videoconferencing|Multipoint Control Units]]'' (centralized distribution and call management systems). Earlier models make video calls utilizing older [[Modulation#Analog modulation methods|analogue]] [[Plain old telephone service|POTS telephone lines]], while later models use newer, higher quality, [[ADSL]], [[ISDN]] or cable broadband technologies. Some videophones also employ Internet calling ([[Internet Protocol|IP]]) capabilities which can dispense with the need for telephone service.

Video conferencing systems allow multiple participants by use of a ''[[Videoconferencing#Multipoint videoconferencing|Multipoint Control Unit]]'' (a centralized distribution and call management system) or via a similar non-centralized multipoint capability technology embedded in each unit. Some multiple party systems utilize Web-based ''bridging service'' providers, which can incur slight time delays.

== Videotelephony descriptive names and terminology ==

The name ''[[videophone]]'' is not as standardized as its earlier counterpart, the ''telephone'', resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country.  Videophones are also known as '''videotelephones''' (or '''video telephones''') and often by an early trademarked name "'''Picturephone'''", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name'' "videophone" ''slowly entered into general use after 1950,&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;

[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/videophone Videophone definition], Merriam-Webster Online, retrieved April 13, 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt; although'' "video telephone" ''likely entered the lexicon earlier after'' "video" ''was coined in 1935.&lt;ref name="ED"&gt;

[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=video&amp;searchmode=none Video definition], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

''Videophone calls'' (also: ''videocalls'' and ''video chat''),&lt;ref&gt;PC Magazine. [https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=video+calling&amp;i=61765,00.asp Definition: Video Calling], PC Magazine website. Retrieved 19 August 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; differ from [[videoconferencing]] in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups.&lt;ref name="Mulbach-1995c"&gt;

Mulbach, 1995. Pg. 291.

&lt;/ref&gt; However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as [[Broadband Internet access|increased bandwidth]] and sophisticated [[software client]]s that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term ''videoconferencing'' is now frequently used instead of ''videocall'' for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a ''video link''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

''[[Webcam]]s'' are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.&lt;ref&gt;

Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman. Editors: Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman, Amy B. Woszczynski, Ken Hoganson, Herbert Mattord. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4aIXq5z8YC Handbook of Distance Learning for Real-Time and Asynchronous Information Technology Education], Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2008, pg. 17, {{ISBN|1-59904-964-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59904-964-9}}. Note costing: "....students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session."&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Video conferencing systems meant for multiple participants|videoconference system]]'' is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.&lt;ref&gt;

A ''[[Telepresence|telepresence system]]'' is a high-end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by [[company|enterprise-level]] corporate offices. Telepresence conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Typical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, [[Video Relay Service|deaf Video Relay Service]] and [[telemedicine|tele-medical, diagnostic]] and [[telerehabilitation|rehabilitative]] use or services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4675">{{distinguish|text= the [[Commercial Revolution]] of the 17th century}}

Some [[Economic history | Economic historian]]s use the term '''merchant capitalism''' to refer to the earliest phase in the [[development of capitalism]] as an economic and social system—though others argue that mercantilism, which has flourished widely in the world without the emergence of systems like modern capitalism, is not actually capitalist as such.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''[[The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View]]'' (London: Verso, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchant capitalism is distinguished from more fully developed capitalism by its focus on simply moving goods from a market where they are cheap to a market where they are expensive (rather than influencing the mode of the production of those goods), the lack of [[industrialization]], and of [[commercial finance]]. [[Merchant]] houses were backed by relatively small private [[financier]]s acting as intermediaries between [[simple commodity production|simple commodity producers]] and by exchanging debt with each other. Thus, merchant capitalism ''preceded'' the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] as a form of [[capital accumulation]]. A process of [[primitive accumulation of capital]], upon which commercial finance operations could be based and making application of mass [[wage labor]] and industrialization possible, was the necessary precondition for the transformation of merchant capitalism into industrial capitalism.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Early forms of merchant capitalism developed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] from the 9th century, and in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;Jairus Banaji (2007), "Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism", ''Journal Historical Materialism'' '''15''' (1), pp. 47–74, [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller (1994), ''Labor in the Medieval Islamic World'', pp. 402–03, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09896-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Y. Labib (1969), "Capitalism in Medieval Islam", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''29''' (1), pp. 79–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, merchant capitalism became a significant economic force in the 16th century. The [[mercantilism|mercantile era]] drew to a close around 1800, giving way to [[industrial capitalism]].  However, merchant capitalism remained entrenched in some parts of the West well into the 19th century, notably the [[Southern United States]], where the plantation system constrained the development of industrial capitalism (limiting markets for consumer goods) whose political manifestations prevented Northern legislators from passing broad economic packages (e.g. [[National Banking Act|monetary and banking reform]], a [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]], and [[Homestead Act|incentives for settlement of the American west]]) to integrate the states' economies and spur the growth of industrial capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Headlee, S. E. (1991). ''The political economy of the family farm: The agrarian roots of American capitalism''. Praeger series in political economy. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doctrine of "no-work-no-pay" ==

The doctrine of "no-work-no-pay" is a fundamental axiom in [[industrial relations]]. The philosophy are very simple. When a person
is employed, it is expected that the work assigned will be carried out. When this work is not done, the employee is not
eligible for payment of any salary.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/op/2006/07/30/stories/2006073000031400.htm The Hindu : Open Page : No work, no pay] The Hindu dated July 30, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006041613/http://www.hindu.com/op/2006/07/30/stories/2006073000031400.htm |date=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when a [[general strike]] or countrywide ban disrupts [[public transport]] systems, and consequently employees are unable to reach their workplaces, the same principle prevails. Even die-hard [[trade union]] leaders respect this principle of equity and natural justice. "No work, no pay" lays a strong foundation to industrial peace and harmony in the long run.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"/&gt;

The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through [[democratic election]]s) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of [[income]], [[physical ability]] or [[intelligence|mental acuity]]. Even where public services are neither publicly provided nor publicly financed, for social and political reasons they are usually subject to [[regulation]] going beyond that applying to most [[economic sectors]].

Public service is also a course that can be studied at a college or university. Examples of public services are the [[fire brigade]], [[police]], [[air force]], and [[paramedics]].

==Sectors==
Public services may be associated with fundamental [[human rights]] (such as the right to water). The Volunteer Fire Dept. and Ambulance Corps. are institutions with the mission of servicing the community. A service is helping others with a specific need or want. Here, service ranges from a doctor curing an illness, to a repair person, to a food pantry.

In modern [[developed countries]], the term "public services" (or "services of general interest") often includes:{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* [[Court|Courts]]
* [[Electricity]]
* [[Education]], [e.g. state (public) schools, public universities, etc...]
* [[Emergency service]]s, (e.g. Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, Search and Rescue, etc...)
* [[Environmental protection]]
* [[Health care]]
* [[Military]]
* [[Public transportation]]
* [[Public buildings]]
* [[Social services]], (e.g. public housing, social welfare, food subsidies, etc...) 
* [[Telecommunications]]
* [[Urban planning]]
* [[Transportation infrastructure]]
* [[Waste management]], (e.g. wastewater, solid waste, recycling, etc...)
* [[Water supply network]]

==Public administration==
{{Main article|Public Administration}}In modern democracies, public service is often performed by [[Employment|employees]] known as [[Civil service|civil servants]] who are hired by elected [[officials]]. Government agencies are not profit-oriented and their employees are motivated very differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies of their work have found contrasting results including both higher levels of effort&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Government Employees: Working Hard or Hardly Working? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |first1=Sue A. |last1=Frank |first2=Gregory B. |last2=Lewis |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36-51 |date=March 2004 |doi=10.1177/0275074003258823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/government-employees-work-less-private-sector-employees |title=Government Employees Work Less than Private-Sector Employees |journal=Backgrounder |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |first=Jason |last=Richwine |issue=2724 |pages=1-6 |date=11 September 2012 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in the UK found that private sector hiring managers do not credit government experience as much as private sector experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/public-sector-stigma |title=Public sector stigma: The 100,000 workers Tim Hudak removes from the provincial payroll could have a tough transition to the private sector |work=Financial Post |first=Dan |last=Ovsey |date=27 May 2014 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers tend to make less in wages when adjusting for education, although that difference is reduced when benefits and hours are included.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/07/are-public-sector-employees-overpaid/ |title=Are public-sector employees “overpaid”? |work=The Washington Post |first=Sasha |last=Volokh |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers have other intangible benefits such as increased job security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a [[public good]] (being [[non-rivalrous]] and [[non-excludable]]), but most are services which may (according to prevailing [[social norms]]) be under-provided by the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In most cases public services are [[Service (economics)|services]], i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of [[good (accounting)|goods]]. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]].

They may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work.

==History==

Governing bodies have long provided core public services. The tradition of keeping citizens secure through organized military defence dates to at least four thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J53rAgAAQBAJ |title=The Power of the Bull |publisher=Routledge |location=London |last1=Rice |first1=Michael |page=13 |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-317-72583-1 |quote=As the more advanced social institutions began to take shape they contributed to some counterbalancing of the essential insecurity of man's condition. It was inevitable that ambitious and assertive men should see an opportunity for establishing for themselves positions of power and influence. No doubt many such occasions had their origins in a genuine concern for the public good [...] The position of [...] the war-band leader as the strong arm of the community's defence would increasingly be confirmed by the subjection of the community to the members of what [...] were becoming, demonstrably, elites, [...] This period, embracing part of the fifth and all of the fourth and third millennia before the present era, is absolutely pivotal to the development of the modern world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining order through local delegated authority originated at least as early as the [[Warring States period]] (5th to 3rd centuries BCE) in ancient China with the institution of ''xian'' (prefectures) under the control of a centrally-appointed prefect. Historical evidence of state provision of [[dispute resolution]] through a legal/justice system goes back at least as far as ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3pmDAAAQBAJ |title=Law's Political Foundations: Rivers, Rifles, Rice, and Religion |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltemham, Gloucestershire |last1=Haley |first1=John O. |pages=43-44 |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-78536-850-9 |quote=Pharaonic Egypt epitomizes a regulatory, public law regime. [...] The principal function of this elaborate apparatus was to maintain order and security, and, above all, to acquire as much of the surplus agricultural wealth and labor as possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary public service in ancient history involved ensuring the general favor of the [[gods]] through a theologically and ceremonially correct [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcvZCgAAQBAJ |title=The Cambridge Companion to Political Theology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |last1=Hovey |first1=Craig |last2=Phillips |first2=Elizabeth |page=4-5 |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-05274-1 |quote=To ensure the favor of the gods was the preeminent task of ancient rulers worldwide, for they all were priestly kings. The Roman Caesar was the ''pontifex maximus'' of Rome's state god. The Chinese emperor certainly stood over his subjects as 'Son of Heaven,' but if he fell into disfavor with heaven and his country was visited by famine, plague, earthquakes, and floods, he could be overthrown. The Moloch of Carthage demanded children as sacrifices; the Aztecs and Mayas offered their Gods still-quivering hearts. These political religions were ''do ut des'' religions in which the relationship between deity and worshippers was one of contractual exchange.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread provision of [[public utility|public utilities]] as public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the [[municipal]] development of [[gas]] and [[water]] services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as [[electricity]] and [[healthcare]]. In most developed countries local or national governments continue to provide such services, the biggest exceptions being the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where private provision is arguably proportionally more significant.{{citation needed|reason=Compare: National Health Service in the UK|date=March 2015}} Nonetheless, such privately provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by [[Public Utility Commission]]s.

In [[developing countries]] public services tend to be much less well developed. For example, water services might only be available to the [[wealthy]] [[middle class]]. For [[political]] reasons the service is often [[subsidized]], which reduces the finance potentially available for expansion to [[Poverty|poorer]] communities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Nationalization==
{{main|Nationalization}}
Nationalization took off following the [[World War]]s of the first half of the twentieth century. Across [[Europe]], because of the extreme demands on industries and the economy, [[central planning]] was required to make production maximally efficient. Many public services, especially electricity, gas and public transport are products of this era. Following the Second World War, many countries also began to implement [[universal health care]] and expanded [[education]] under the funding and guidance of the state.

==Privatization==
[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital.]]
{{main|Privatization}}
There are several ways to privatize public services. A free-market corporation may be established and sold to private investors, relinquishing government control altogether. Thus it becomes a private (not public) service. Another option, used in the [[Nordic countries]], is to establish a corporation, but keep ownership or voting power essentially in the hands of the government. For example, the [[Finland|Finnish state]] owned 49% of [[Kemira]] until 2007, the rest being owned by private investors. A 49% share did not make it a "government enterprise", but it meant that all other investors together would have to oppose the state's opinion in order to overturn the state's decisions in the shareholder's meeting. Regulated corporation can also acquire permits on the agreement that they fulfill certain public service duties. When a private corporation runs a [[natural monopoly]], then the corporation is typically heavily regulated, to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Lastly, the government can buy the service on the free market. In many countries, [[medication]] is provided in this manner: the government reimburses part of the price of the medication. Also, bus traffic, electricity, healthcare and waste management are privatized in this way. One recent innovation, used in the UK increasingly as well as Australia and Canada is [[public-private partnership]]s. This involves giving a long lease to private consortia in return for partly funding infrastructure.

'''''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport'''''&lt;ref&gt;By convention, for judicial review cases the monarch appears in the title of the case as the nominal bringer of the action. In reality the action was brought by Factortame Limited against the Secretary of State.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[judicial review]] case taken against the [[United Kingdom government]] by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached [[European Union law]] by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.

The litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:
*''Factortame I'', where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]] on the legality of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]]'s ("MSA") requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, ''Factortame'' saw the House of Lords confirm the [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]] of [[EU law]] over national law in the areas where the EU has [[Principle of conferral|competence]] because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Lords judgment is referred to as ''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 2)'' [1991] 1 AC 603.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Factortame II'', where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law.
*''Factortame III'', where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law.
*''Factortame IV'', where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the ''[[Francovich v Italy]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-6/90&lt;/ref&gt; principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of [[state liability]]).
*''Factortame V''&lt;!--which court?--&gt;, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in [[tort]] under the [[Limitation Act 1980]].

==Facts==
The EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]], which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all [[member states]] and introducing [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural funds]] to ensure modernisation of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015910/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |archivedate=11 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their [[exclusive economic zone]], which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985,&lt;ref name=tcl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "FACTORTAME BACKGROUND"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105902/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on [[overfishing|fishing stocks]] led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of "[[total allowable catch]]es" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the [[British Fishing Boats Act 1983]] (BFBA).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt;

From 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy [[fishing vessel]] registration requirements contained in the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894]].  Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "ABOUT FACTORTAME"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105900/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as "quota hopping".

In order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked [[preliminary questions]] to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG - see [[Agegate]] (C-3/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:650}}) and [[Jaderow]] (C-216/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:651}}).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1988 the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] and the [[Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations]] were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had "a genuine and substantial connection" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any [[Chartering (shipping)|charterer]], manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A "qualified person or company" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, "qualified persons".

As from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] was brought by its owners in the [[Divisional Court]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] in December 1988.

Factortame Ltd sought, first, a [[preliminary injunction]] declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to [[direct effect|directly effective]] rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the [[Treaty of Rome]]), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43&amp;ndash;48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Secretary of State]] from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.

HMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries.  In the event this assertion proved false.

===High Court===
On 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court ([[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen|Neill LJ]] and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) for a [[preliminary ruling]] under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: [[European Union law]]). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of [[English law]] and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the ''[[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]''. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal ([[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson MR]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham LJ]] and [[Michael Mann (judge)|Mann LJ]]) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged "to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had "acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.

===House of Lords===
The case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ([[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]], [[Henry Brandon, Baron Brandon of Oakbrook|Lord Brandon]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Oliver]], [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] and [[Charles Jauncey, Baron Jauncey of Tullichettle|Lord Jauncey]]) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an [[Act of Parliament]]. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have "conferred upon them rights directly contrary to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s sovereign will". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.

Nevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts "against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.

===European Court of Justice===
The action was lodged at the [[ECJ]] on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.

[[Advocate-General]] [[Giuseppe Tesauro|Tesauro]] argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:216}}). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in [[Simmenthal]] (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not "be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect" (case 61/79, [[Denkavit]], {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1978:49}}). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.

On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as "full court" of 11 justices) ''en banc'' gave its ruling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/C21389.html bailii.org: 1st ECJ decision in re Factortame]. {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:257}} Tesauro, AG; [[David Vaughan (attorney)|David Vaughan]], [[Gerald Barling]], [[David Anderson (attorney)|David Anderson]], and [[Stephen Swabey]] for the Applicant; [[Timothy J G Pratt]], Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]] for the Respondent; as well as the state of Ireland, the [[European Commission]], and Rawlings Trawling Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; rephrasing the question posed as "whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.

===Back to the House of Lords===
On 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on Parliamentary sovereignty. [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]]).

In deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had "considerable force". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.

Addressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, [[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]] remarked that such comments were "based on a misconception", and that under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had "always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.

These comments&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bridge]] [1991] 1 AC 603, 658; quoted in {{cite book  | last = Craig  | first = Paul  | authorlink = Paul Craig (law professor)  |author2=Gráinne de Búrca | title = EU Law, Text, Cases and Materials  | edition = 4th| year = 2007| publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927389-8 |quote=Some public comments on the decision of the Court of Justice, affirming the jurisdiction of the courts of member states to override national legislation if necessary to enable interim relief to be granted in protection of rights under Community law, have suggested that this was a novel and dangerous invasion by a Community institution of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament. But such comments are based on a misconception. If the supremacy within the European Community of Community law over the national law of member states was not always inherent in the EEC Treaty it was certainly well established in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice long before the United Kingdom joined the Community. Thus whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary. Under the terms of the 1972 Act it has always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court, when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law. ... Thus there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas to which they apply ...|page=367f}}&lt;/ref&gt; were perceived by [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] as "revolutionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wade | first = Sir William | authorlink = Henry William Rawson Wade |author2=Forsyth, Christopher  | title = Administrative Law | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford  | isbn = 978-0-19-876525-7 | page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.

Such an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' and ''[[Hunt v Hackney Borough Council]]'' to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and "statutory" or "constitutional" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in ''Thoburn''.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.

Furthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by [[Lord Diplock]] in the case of ''[[Garland v British Rail Engineering]]''). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of ''[[Macarthys v Smith]]'', [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.

==''Factortame II'' compatibility==
On 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:320}}, 2nd ECJ decision in re Factortame.  David Vaughan, Gerald Barling, David Anderson, and Stephen Swabey for the Applicant, Timothy J.G. Pratt, Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]], and [[Andrew Macnab]] for the Respondent, and six national governments plus the [[European Commission]]. Opinion [[Advocate-General]]: {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:113}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General [[Jean Mischo|Mischo]]'s opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that "it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.

In the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as "the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.

The UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a "real economic link" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to "concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.

==''Factortame III'' state liability==
{{main|Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany}}
Following the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the [[Bundesgerichtshof|German Federal Court]] had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of ''[[Brasserie du Pêcheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland]]'' and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined.

At this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in ''[[Francovich principle|Francovich]]'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:428}}), which established the principle that "a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to "the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States".

In its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1996:79}}, Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93: Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd and Others" 5 Mar 1996. Tesauro, AG; 6 other EU member state governments; the [[European Commission]], 8 lawyers for 97 Claimants, and [[J.E. Collins]], [[Stephen Richards (judge)|Stephen Richards]], [[Christopher Vajda]] and [[Rhodri Thompson]] for the Respondent.&lt;/ref&gt; the court of nine justices ''en banc'' reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.

The court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:

# the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals;
# the breach must be sufficiently serious;
# there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.

In the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be "sufficiently serious" it must be "manifest" and "grave". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.

==''Factortame IV'' right to damages==
The matter came back to the Divisional Court ([[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Hobhouse LJ]], [[Lawrence Collins|Collins J]] and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for [[exemplary damages]]. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal ([[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf MR]], [[Konrad Schiemann|Schiemann LJ]] and [[Robert Walker, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe|Walker LJ]]) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/75815.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Spanish win legal fish fight|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMG appealed again to the House of Lords ([[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn]], [[Donald Nicholls, Baron Nicholls of Birkenhead|Lord Nicholls]], Lord Hoffmann, [[James Clyde, Baron Clyde|Lord Clyde]] and [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]).

The House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined.

In March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed £285 million, received £55 million including interest of some £26 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010208/text/10208w02.htm |title=House of Lords, Hansard Debates, 8 February 2001 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Factortame V'' limitation issues==
On 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the [[Technology and Construction Court]] (a division of the High Court) held, under the [[Limitation Act 1980]], Factortame's claims against the UK government were "actions founded on tort", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.

The judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for [[Measure of damages under English law#Special classes of damages|injury to feelings]] and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.

==Significance==
The ''Factortame'' case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]]. [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] argues that the Factortame judgment alters the [[Rule of Recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sovereignty - Evolution or Revolution?|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|year=1996|first=Sir William|last=Wade|authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade|volume=112|issue=|page=574|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice has ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which apply to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. In current practice, the UK recognises the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in ''[[Macarthys Ltd v Smith]]'', Lord Denning MR said, "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act—with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it—or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Denning in ''Macarthys Ltd v Smith'' [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in {{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Josephine |author2=Lorna Woods |author3=Christian Twigg-Flesner  | title = EU Law  | edition = 9th  | year = 2006  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927959-3|chapter=Section 4.4.2: Effect of the European Communities Act 1972, s.2(1) and (4) |quote=If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act    with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it   or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament. |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeuleg/38-xiv/5020802.htm| title = Select Committee on European Scrutiny Minutes of Evidence: Examination of Witnesses (Questions 229-239): Rt hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Frost| accessdate =2008-01-09 | author = Jack Straw MP| authorlink = Jack Straw| date = 2005-02-08| work = House of Commons Publications|quote = I think your Committee will be familiar with what Lord Denning, then Master of the Rolls, said in ''[[McCarthy v Smith]]'': "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision of it or with the intention of acting inconsistently with it—it says so in express terms—I should have thought it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute in our Parliament." That much is clear. Other consequences would follow in those circumstances, which arise from our signature on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty, Article 27, which says that you have to respect the international obligations into which you have entered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by [[John Laws (judge)|Lord Justice Laws]] in the ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' case, when he said that "there is nothing in the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]] which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions."

That European law has primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 ''[[Costa v ENEL]]'' (1964), the ECJ stated that "the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields". In Case 26/62 ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) their ruling states that "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights".

The question of who has the ultimate ''[[kompetenz-kompetenz]]'' (i.e. the right to decide the limits the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction) has not been settled.

The '''Real Net Output Ratio''' (or '''Vertical Range of Manufacture''') describes in a [[value chain]] the fraction of the internal (company specific) production on the total production value of one company. The total production value of a company consists of internal production plus the sum of externally produced goods and services.

&lt;math&gt;\textstyle Real\,Net\,Output\,Ratio = \frac{internal\,production}{total\,production\,value} = \frac{internal\,production}{internal\,production\,+\,externally\,produced\,goods\,+\,externally\,produced\,services}&lt;/math&gt;

A Real Net Output Ratio of 0% relates to a company that does not have its own production and therefore only does trading.

==Early life==

He studied vocational and business teaching there also at a later date. Between 1981 and 1986, he taught in production and engineering at the university, before completing a doctorate in industrial science and polytechnology.&lt;ref name=CEO /&gt;

==Career==
Grube started his career in 1989 at [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] and went on to work in a number of posts at [[DaimlerBenz]] including senior vice president and head of corporate strategy. He also worked for [[DaimlerChrysler]].&lt;ref name=Bus&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudiger Grube Executive Profile |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=10600533&amp;ticker=005380:KS |publisher=Business Week |accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2009, Grube signed a five-year contract to become [[CEO]] of [[Deutsche Bahn AG]], starting from May 1st 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D97PG04O0.htm |title= Ruediger Grube installed as Deutsche Bahn CEO |accessdate=2009-04-25 | publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company at the time had been hit very hard by the recession and was facing questions over some of its technology-based decisions. Grube announced cuts at the firm.&lt;ref name=Bus /&gt; Between 2013 and 2017, he accompanied [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] on a total of three state visits abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Schlesiger (September 8, 2017), [http://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/merkel-reisen-siemens-chef-kaeser-am-haeufigsten-bei-delegationsreisen-dabei/20292014.html Siemens-Chef Kaeser am häufigsten bei Delegationsreisen dabei] ''[[Wirtschaftswoche]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements no. 16 (SSAE 16)''' is an auditing standard for service organizations, superseding [[Statement on Auditing Standards no. 70]] (SAS 70). The "service auditor’s examination" of SAS&amp;nbsp;70 is replaced by a '''System and Organization Controls''' ('''SOC''') report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= System and Organization Controls (SOC): SOC Suite of Services |url=https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/FRC/AssuranceAdvisoryServices/Pages/SORHome.aspx|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 was issued in April 2010, and became effective in June 2011. Many organizations that followed SAS&amp;nbsp;70 have now shifted to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16. Some service organizations are becoming savvy to the ability to use the SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 report status to show they are more capable, also encouraging their prospective end-users to make having an SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard part of new vendor selection criteria. It is widely known that public companies in the United States fall under the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act]], also known as Sarbanes–Oxley or SOX. However, there are also a number of provisions of the Act (e.g. the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation) that apply to privately held companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.swipeclock.com/ssae-16-payroll-provider-competitive-advantage-workforce-software//&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 is largely an American standard, but it mirrors the [[ISAE 3402|International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 overview|url=http://ssae16.com/SSAE16_overview.html|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has two different kinds of reports. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 1 report is an independent snapshot of the organization's control landscape on a given day. A SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report adds a historical element, showing how controls were managed over time. The SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 standard requires a [http://www.a-lign.com/ssae-16-what-is-the-minimum-period-for-a-type-2-report/ minimum of six months of operation] of the controls for a SOC&amp;nbsp;1 Type 2 report.

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 reporting can help service organizations comply with [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes–Oxley]]'s requirement (section 404) to show effective internal controls covering financial reporting. It can also be applied to data centers or any other service that might be used in the delivery of financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Data Centers Need SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/09/27/why-data-centers-need-ssae-16/|website=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reports that are not specifically focused on internal controls over financial reporting, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) has issued an Interpretation under AT Section 101 permitting service auditors to issue reports. These reports will now be considered SOC&amp;nbsp;2 audits and focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOC 2 Audit Overview|url=https://www.ssae16professionals.com/services/soc-2/|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 provides guidance on an auditing method, rather than mandating a specific control set. In this respect, it is similar to [[ISO 27001:2013]]. 

Effective May 1, 2017, SSAE&amp;nbsp;16 has been superseded by SSAE&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssae-16.com/ssae-18-an-update-to-ssae-16-coming-2017/|title=SSAE-18 - An Update to SSAE&amp;nbsp;16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ssae-16.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship career (1999-today) ==

=== EASI ===

==== Founder &amp; Managing Partner ====
At the age of 35, Salvatore founded EASI on March 26, 1999 with Christian Castelain. EASI is a Belgian computer services company which offers solutions developed from the latest technology in sectors such as software and mobile applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solutions-magazine.com/inbox-zero-le-dernier-projet-fou-de-salvatore-curaba/|title=Inbox Zéro, le dernier projet -"fou"- de Salvatore Curaba|date=2014-11-24|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digimedia.be/News/fr/18095/inbox-zero-l-app-belge-qui-veut-detroner-gmail.html|title=Inbox Zero, l'App belge qui veut détroner Gmail|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; infrastructure and cloud computing. In 2012, the company counted 90 employees. This was an important tipping point. After more than 10 years of valuable collaboration between Salvatore Curaba and Christian Castelain, they decided that one person needed to take over the company. Salvatore decided to buy out his partner and became EASI’s unique CEO. From this moment, Salvatore managed his company the way he always wanted to: he developed a unique management style based on freedom, share and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b4c.be/2016/05/comment-le-bonheur-au-travail-peut-il-garantir-le-succes/|title=Comment le bonheur au travail peut-il garantir le succès?|website=www.b4c.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/928832/article/economie/entrepreneuriat/2015-07-06/quelques-conseils-pour-passer-un-ete-serein|title=Quelques conseils pour passer un été serein|last=lesoir.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main objective is his company’s performances combined to his employee’s happiness.

=== Football clubs ===
In 2015, after more than 30 years away from the football sector, Salvatore Curaba was approached to take over the Royal Albert Elisabeth Club from Mons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/2744/Mons/article/detail/2249679/2015/03/12/Mons-ne-sera-pas-repris-par-Salvatore-Curaba.dhtml|title=Mons ne sera pas repris par Salvatore Curaba|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antennecentre.tv/www/salvatore_curaba_candidat_la_reprise_du_raec_mons_-80514-999-226.html|title=Salvatore Curaba candidat à la reprise du RAEC Mons|last=http://www.antenne-centre.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carrementsteph.be/index.php?id=121|title=Rien à Foot - 23/03/2015|website=www.carrementsteph.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=http://www.telemb.be|title=TéléMB : RAEC Mons - Salvatore Curaba dit non à la reprise !! - Les reportages|url=http://www.telemb.be/les-reportages-raec-mons-salvatore-curaba-dit-non-a-la-reprise-_d_15399.html|accessdate=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivreici.be/videos/detail_urlc-salvatore-curaba-se-retire-provisoirement?videoId=21367|title=URLC : Salvatore Curaba se retire.

Later in 2015, the Union Royale la Louviere Centre also contacted him to take over the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanouvellegazette.be/1402054/article/2015-10-22/salvatore-curaba-je-serai-un-jour-president-de-la-louviere|title=Salvatore Curaba: "Je serai un jour président de La Louvière"|last=lanouvellegazette.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanouvellegazette.be/1237829/article/2015-03-16/football-approche-par-la-louviere-centre-salvatore-curaba-botte-en-touche|title=Football: approché par La Louvière Centre, Salvatore Curaba botte en touche|last=lanouvellegazette.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanouvellegazette.be/1284687/article/2015-05-11/entretien-exclusif-avec-salvatore-curaba-il-nourrit-de-grandes-ambitions-pour-la|title=Entretien exclusif avec Salvatore Curaba: il nourrit de grandes ambitions pour La Louvière Centre|last=lanouvellegazette.be|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations didn’t lead to a deal yet.

== Public speaker ==
Since 2014, Salvatore Curaba regularly gives speeches and conferences all around Belgium to share his story, his management philosophy, EASI’s keys to success and the happiness benefits. His speeches are particularly attractive because he likes to link his former challenges as professional football player with his career as a business man and entrepreneur.

'''Sectoral analysis''', also known as '''sectorial analysis''', is a [[statistic]]al [[analysis]] of the size, [[demographic]], pricing, competitive, and other economic dimensions of a sector of the [[economy]]. The analysis can be done by industry or by customer designation. The method was further developed by [[Wynne Godley]] for use in macroeconomic analysis of national economies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">A {{nihongo|'''shihainin'''|支配人||lit. "manager"}} is an authorized representative of a [[company]] or unincorporated [[business]] under [[Japan]]ese [[commercial law]].

A shihainin has full legal authority to represent the company/business at the place of business to which the shihainin is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 21; [http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This authority may be restricted, but any restriction is unassertable against a third party acting in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 21.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status is often granted to the managers of regional or local offices of the company, as well as to managers at the head office. Directors and [[corporate officer]]s (but not [[statutory auditor]]s) may be granted shihainin status in addition to any other titles they hold within the company. The term can lead to confusion in translation, as the literal translation of "manager" may be confused with internal "manager" titles that do not necessarily denote shihainin status.

In most businesses, the term is mainly used in corporate legal documents. However, it is popular in certain industries, such as [[hotel]]s and [[restaurant]]s, as the sole designation for the manager of a particular property.

Company shihainin are generally appointed by the [[board of director]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 348.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Their name, date of birth, residential address and place of business is recorded in the [[commercial register]] at the [[Legal Affairs Bureau]] and kept as [[public record]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 22; [http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 918; [http://www.houko.com/00/01/S38/125.HTM Commercial Registration Act], article 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telligent, A Verint Company''' is an enterprise collaboration and community software business founded in 2004 by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]]. The company changed its name to Zimbra, Inc in September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2013/09/25/zimbra-unveils-integrated-team-culture-and-vision-for-people-centered-collaboration-at-user-group-conference.aspx |last=Henry |first=Tiffany |title=Zimbra Unveils Integrated Team, Culture and Vision for People-Centered Collaboration at User Group Conference |publisher=Telligent |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; after completing the acquisition of [[Zimbra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2577-Telligent-acquires-Zimbra-Does-social-software-want-to-be-email-when-it-grows-up |last=Kompella |first=Kashyap |title=Telligent acquires Zimbra - Does social software want to be email when it grows up? |publisher=Real Story Group |date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[VMWare]]. In August 2015 Zimbra's Telligent business was acquired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.verint.com/customer-engagement/verint-acquires-telligent-and-extends-portfolio-into-communities |last=Stockford |first=Paul |title=Verint Acquires Telligent and Extends Portfolio into Communities |publisher=Saddletree Research |date=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Verint Systems]], Inc. Verint continues to operate Telligent as an independent business unit. Also in August 2015 the remaining assets of Zimbra, Inc were acquired by Synacor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/social-business/zimbra-acquired-again-this-time-by-synacor/ |publisher=CMS Wire |last=Nicastro |first=Dom |title=Zimbra Acquired Again, This Time by Synacor |date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Company history==
Telligent was founded by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]] in 2004. Howard was previously a founding member of Microsoft's [[ASP.NET]] team and helped build and run the Microsoft ASP.NET community. 

Telligent introduced its first product, [[Telligent Community|Community Server]], in the fall of 2004. Community Server was an integrated community platform that brought together blogs, wikis, forums, user profiles, etc. Community Server was based on the work done by Rob Howard on the ASP.NET Forums, Jason Alexander on nGallery, and Scott Watermasysk on .Text.

Dell and MySpace both became Telligent customers in 2006. Dell started a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/Direct2Dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2006/07/11/real-people-are-here-and-we-re-listening.aspx|title=Real People are Here and We're Listening|publisher=Lionel Menchaca|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Telligent's platform in response to [[Jeff Jarvis]]' post about his dissatisfaction with a Dell laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/10/18/dell-hell-the-end/|title=Dell Hell:The end?|publisher=BuzzMachine|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007 Telligent introduced a [[social analytics]] tool called [[Telligent Analytics|Harvest Reporting Server]].

In 2008, [[Intel Capital]] became Telligent's first capital partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/capital/news/releases/080922.htm|title=Intel Capital to Acquire $20 Million Stake in Telligent |publisher=Intel|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Patrick Brandt took over as CEO and Rob Howard became CTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2009/05/19/patrick-brandt-joins-telligent-as-chief-executive-officer.aspx|title=Patrick Brandt Joins Telligent as Chief Executive Officer|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Brandt was previously CEO of Skywire Software, which was acquired by Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2008_jun/skywire.html|title=Oracle Buys Skywire Software |publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an undisclosed amount. Telligent also re-branded its product offering as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-20/telligent-updates-and-rebrands-community-solutions-new-analytics-solution-004889.php|title=Telligent Updates and ReBrands Community Solutions, New Analytics Solution|publisher=CMS Wire|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Server became [[Telligent Community]], Harvest Reporting Server became [[Telligent Analytics]], and Community Server Evolution became Telligent Enterprise. Telligent also formally introduced the Telligent Evolution platform upon which Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise were based.

As part of the company re-positioning, Telligent discontinued development and support for Graffiti CMS and made it available as an open source project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2009/12/11/graffiti-cms-is-now-open-source.aspx|title=Graffiti CMS is now open source|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent also discontinued BlogMailr, a free email-to-blog service.

In 2010 David Mitchell joined Telligent's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/07/07/telligent-welcomes-new-board-member.aspx|title=Telligent Welcomes New Board Member|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is currently CEO of [http://www.global360.com/ Global 360] and was previously CEO of WebMethods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/WebMethods-names-new-CEO,-chairman/2100-1012_3-5395279.html|title=WebMethods names new CEO, chairman|publisher=CNet News|accessdate=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent additionally added Wendy Gibson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/10/07/announcing-chief-marketing-officer-wendy-gibson.aspx|title=Welcome Wendy Gibson as Telligent's CMO|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Chief Marketing Officer.

On December 19, 2011, Telligent acquired Leverage Software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastechpulse.com/telligent_buys_enterprise_social_networking_firm/s-0040067.html Telligent Buys Enterprise Social Networking Firm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2013, Telligent acquired [[Zimbra]] from [[Vmware]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/vmware-divests-zimbra-nyse-vmw-1810955.htm Vmware Divests Zimbra]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2015, Telligent was acquired by [[Verint Systems]], Inc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.verint.com/news-events/press-releases-2015/verint-extends-customer-engagement-optimization-vision-adding-innovative-community-software |title=Verint Extends Customer Engagement Optimization Vision, Adding Innovative Community Software |publisher=Verint |date=2015-08-17}}{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/CRM-Across-the-Wire/Verint-Acquires-Telligent-105795.aspx |title=Verint Acquires Telligent |publisher=DestinationCRM.com |date=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Products==
Telligent's products are built on the [[Microsoft .NET]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. They are primarily used as on-premises, white label software solutions.

===Telligent Community ===
[[Telligent Community]] (formerly Community Server), built on the Telligent Evolution platform, is Telligent's flagship product. It was first introduced in 2004 and the most recent version is 5.6 as of October 2010.

Telligent Community is designed to support external facing communities and the primary use cases are: digital marketing, support communities, and networking.

===Telligent Enterprise ===
Telligent Enterprise, built on the Telligent Evolution platform, was first introduced in 2008 in response to users of Telligent Community asking Telligent to provide an employee-focused solution. Telligent Enterprise version 2.6 was released October 2010.

Telligent Enterprise is designed to support enterprise 2.0 / internal communities, private business-to-business communities, and private networking communities. An emphasis on integration with enterprise email systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, and enterprise identity management systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory, are examples of how Telligent Enterprise differs from Telligent Community.

=== Telligent Analytics ===
Telligent introduced Telligent Analytics in 2007 as Harvest Reporting Server. Telligent Analytics is designed to analyze people and information created within the Telligent Evolution platform. This includes both Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise. It additionally includes any data created on applications that run on the Telligent Evolution platform.

'''Thaksin Shinawatra''' ({{lang-th|ทักษิณ ชินวัตร}}; {{RTGS|''Thaksin Chinnawat''}}; {{IPA-th|tʰák.sǐn t͡ɕʰīn.nā.wát|pron}}; born 26 July 1949) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] businessman, politician and visiting professor who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand|Prime Minister of Thailand]] from 2001 to 2006 and [[Royal Thai Police|Thai Police]] from 1973 to 1987. 

The former police officer founded the mobile phone operator [[Advanced Info Service]] and the IT and telecommunications conglomerate [[Shin Corporation]] in 1987, that made him one of the richest people in Thailand. He joined politics in 1994, founded the [[Thai Rak Thai Party]] (TRT) in 1998 and, after a landslide electoral victory, became prime minister in 2001.

Thaksin's government launched programs to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and universal healthcare coverage. Thaksin declared a "war on drugs" in which more than 2,500 people died and took a strong-arm approach against the [[South Thailand insurgency|separatist insurgency in the Muslim southern provinces]]. He was the first democratically elected prime minister of Thailand to serve a full term and was re-elected in 2005 by an overwhelming majority.

After selling shares of his corporation worth more than a billion dollars to foreign investors without paying taxes, considerable criticism resulted. A citizens' movement against Thaksin, called [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] or "yellow shirts", launched mass protests, accusing him of corruption, abuse of power and autocratic tendencies. Thaksin called snap elections that were boycotted by the opposition and invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].

He was [[Deposition (politics)|overthrown]] in a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|military coup on 19 September 2006]]. His party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin Shinawatra: from billionaire to fugitive ex-prime minister|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 26 February 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/feb/26/thailand?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487#/?picture=359796750&amp;index=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin has since lived in self-imposed exile except for a brief visit to Thailand in 2008. He was sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to two years in jail for abuse of power. From abroad he has continued to influence Thai politics, through the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] that ruled in 2008, and its successor organisation [[Pheu Thai Party]], as well as the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] or "red shirt" movement. His younger sister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] was the prime minister of Thailand from 2011 to 2014.

In 2009, Thaksin said in an interview that he was living in Dubai and still had access to about $100 million of his money.

==Heritage and early life==
Thaksin's great-grandfather, [[Seng Saekhu]], was an immigrant from [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]], China, who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in [[Chiang Mai]] in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Saekhu, was born in [[Chanthaburi]] in 1890 and married a Thai woman named Saeng Samana. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("routinely appropriate action") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement, and the rest of the family also adopted it.&lt;ref name="familytree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/08/08/the-shinawatra-family-tree/|title=The Shinawatra family tree|work=New Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seng Saekhu had made his fortune through [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farming]]. Chiang Saekhu/Shinawatra later founded Shinawatra Silks and then moved into finance, construction, and property development. Thaksin's father, Loet, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. Yindi's father, Charoen Ramingwong (born: Wang Chuan Cheng), was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] immigrant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2014/11/01/yingluckthaksin_go_on_a_family_trip.php |title=Former Thai leaders Yingluck, Thaksin visit ancestral village in Meizhou, Guangdong
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/04/content_456688.htm |title=Thai PM seeks out roots in Meizhou |work=China Daily |date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; who married Princess Chanthip na Chiangmai, a minor member of the [[List of the Kings of Lanna|Lanna (Chiang Mai) royalty]]. In 1968, Loet Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai and deputy leader of the now-defunct Liberal Party. Loet Shinawatra quit politics in 1976. He opened a coffee shop, grew oranges and flowers in Chiang Mai's San Kamphaeng district, and opened two cinemas, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.&lt;ref name="familytree"/&gt;

Thaksin was born in [[Amphoe San Kamphaeng|San Kamphaeng]], Chiang Mai province. He is [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]. He lived in the village of San Kamphaeng until he was 15, then moved to Chiang Mai city to study at [[Montfort College]].

He received a master's degree in Criminal Justice from [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a [[doctorate]] in criminal justice at [[Sam Houston State University]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]]. Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a [[Police rank|Police Lieutenant Colonel]] and leaving the police.

==Business career==

===Early ventures===
Thaksin and his wife began several businesses while he was still in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures and left him over 50 million baht in debt. In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tri333.exteen.com/ |title=Transcript of an interview between Thaksin Shinawatra and Cheeptham Khamwisit (Thai: ชีพธรรม คำวิเศษณ์) on the Thaiventure.com program on FM 102 radio station |publisher=Tri333.exteen.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503214920/http://tri333.exteen.com/ |archive-date=3 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaksin.net/life.html Personal background from personal website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419102042/http://www.thaksin.net/life.html |date=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1986, he founded [[Advanced Info Service]] (AIS), which started off as a computer rental business.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jobtopgun.com/profile/searchprofile?id_emp=255 |title=Google Cache of a JobTopGun profile of AIS's corporate milestones |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Thaksin resigned from the police. He then marketed a romance drama called ''Baan Sai Thong'', which became a popular success in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin Shinawatra-a biography |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/election2001/thaksinprofile.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Thai govt pins border hopes on soaps |date=25 May 2002 |access-date=5 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111093614/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=11 November 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he joined [[Pacific Telesis]] to operate and market the PacLink [[pager]] service, a modest success, though Thaksin later sold his shares to establish his own paging company.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal] 18 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, he launched IBC, a cable television company. At that time, Thaksin had a very good relationship with Chalerm Yoobumrung, the minister of the Prime Minister's Office, who was in charge of Thai press and media. It is a question whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://silance-mobius.blogspot.com/2007/11/blog-post_06.html |title=Thaksin's words }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group's UTV.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UBC 2004 Annual Report, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Thaksin established a data networking service, Shinawatra DataCom,&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt; today known as Advanced Data Network and owned by AIS and the TOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |title=Business Operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries |journal=Company Annual Report |format=PDF |access-date=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104301/http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Thaksin's businesses were later consolidated as [[Shin Corp]].

===Advance Info Service and later ventures===

[[Advance Info Service]] was given a monopoly contract by his contacts in the military in 1986&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt; and operates under GSM 900 frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1990"&lt;/ref&gt; AIS grew rapidly and became the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1994"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|listed]] in 1990.

In 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated four [[Thaicom]] communications satellites.

In 1999, the Shinawatra family spent some 1&amp;nbsp;billion baht establishing [[Shinawatra University]] in [[Pathum Thani]]. It offers international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management, though it ranks quite low in international standings.

In 2000, Thaksin acquired the ailing [[ITV (Thailand)|iTV]] television station from the [[Crown Property Bureau]], [[Nation Multimedia Group]], and [[Siam Commercial Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,98445,00.html Taming The Media: Allegations of political interference cast a cloud over Thaksin's incoming administration] Asia Week Vol.27, No.6 16 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 The Television Business, Democracy and The Army] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030702173146/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 |date=2 July 2003 }} December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into politics==

===Political debut===
Thaksin entered politics in late 1994 through [[Chamlong Srimuang]], who had just reclaimed the position of [[Palang Dharma Party]] (PDP) leader from [[Boonchu Rojanastien]]. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP Cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing [[Prasong Soonsiri]].&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL22Ae01.html Grumbles, revelations of a Thai coup maker], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin left Palang Dharma along with many of its [[House of Representatives of Thailand|MPs]] in 1996, and founded the [[populism|populist]] [[Thai Rak Thai]] (TRT) party in 1998. After a [[Thai general election, 2001|historic election victory in 2001]], he became prime minister, the country's first to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Jan McGirk |title= Thaksin Shinawatra: The man who turned disaster into victory |publisher=BBC |date= 7 February 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of [[Chuan Leekpai]] to collapse.

===PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister under Banharn===
Chamlong, strongly criticised for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.

Thaksin joined the government of [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]] and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, he and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/96/0524/nat12.html Thailand: Double Trouble For the PM: A parliamentary vote splits the government coalition] 24 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; But Chamlong lost to Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.

Chamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's "temple" faction and Thaksin's. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.

Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government, and in September 1996 Banharn dissolved Parliament.

Thaksin announced he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections but would remain as leader of the PDP. It suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only one seat, and soon imploded, with most members resigning.

===Deputy Prime Minister under Chavalit===
On 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government, after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the [[Asian Financial Crisis]]. He held the position for only three months, leaving on 14 November when Chavalit resigned.

During a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat [[Suthep Thaugsuban]] accused Thaksin of profiting from insider information about the government's decision to float the baht,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1010/nat2.html Pressure from below: Supporters of the new, improved Constitution now have to help turn words into action] 10 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; but the next Democrat party-led government did not investigate the accusations.

During this period, Thaksin also served on the Asia Advisory Board of the Washington, D.C. based [[Carlyle Group]] until he resigned upon becoming Prime Minister in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicalfriendster.com/rateConnection.php?id1=3190&amp;id2=145 |title=Rate Connection – Thaksin Shinawatra connected to Carlyle Group |publisher=Political Friendster |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections===
Thaksin founded the [[Thai Rak Thai]] ("Thais Love Thais" – TRT) party in 1998 along with [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], PDP ally [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]], Purachai Piumsomboon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 MSU alumni, friends, honored for outstanding achievements: Purachai Piumsombun of Bangkok, Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212200729/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 |date=12 February 2006 }} 14 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and 19 others.

With a populist platform often attributed to [[Somkid Jatusripitak|Somkid]], TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and 1&amp;nbsp;million THB locally managed development funds for all Thai villages.

After Prime Minister [[Chuan Leekpai]] dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the [[Thailand legislative election, 2001|January 2001 elections]], the first held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, some academics called it the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history.&lt;ref name="2001electionclean"&gt;Robert B.

Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the [[Chart Thai Party]] (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats).&lt;ref&gt;Aurel Croissant and Jörn Dosch, Old Wine in New Bottlenecks?

Thaksin returned to Thailand on 28 February 2008, after the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]], which he supported, won the post-coup elections.&lt;ref name=Thaksinreturn&gt;CNN, (note CNN did not state he actually returned and no one in Thailand knows of his return then.[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/25/thailand.thaksin.ap/index.html Lawyer: Thaksin 'poised' to return], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; But after visiting Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics, he did not return to hear the final supreme court sentence and applied for asylum in the United Kingdom.

The People's Power Party was later dissolved by the Supreme Court, but party members regrouped to form the [[Pheu Thai Party]], which Thaksin also supported.

==Prime Minister of Thailand, 2001–06==
[[Image:Thaksin Shinawatra (December 2001).jpg|thumb|Thaksin meeting [[Donald Evans]] in December 2001]]

Thaksin Shinawatra was the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country's modern history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Kevin. "Thaksin Shinawatra and the reshaping of Thai politics." Contemporary Politics 16, no. 2 (June 2010): 119–133.&lt;/ref&gt; They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.&lt;ref name=jam&gt;Protesters Jam Bangkok, but Rural Thais Love the Leader. ''The New York Times'', 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's most effective policies were reducing rural poverty&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely untapped support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.&lt;ref name=jam /&gt;

His Cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the [[Palang Dharma Party]], including [[Prommin Lertsuridej]], Chaturon Chaisang, [[Prapat Panyachatraksa]], Surapong Suebwonglee, [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], [[Surakiart Sathirathai]], and [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]]. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.

However, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, [[demagogy]], corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards [[Censorship in Thailand|a free press]]. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of [[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]], treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|religious desecration]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Economic policies===
Thaksin's government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed [[microcredit]] development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.

Thaksin's economic policies helped Thailand recover from the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the [[International Monetary Fund]] two years ahead of schedule.

Income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46% from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;NESDB, [http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip Economic Data, 1995–2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719090712/http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Thailand's [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of [[income inequality]], fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) ).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf Thailand Economic Monitor November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] outperformed other markets in the region. After facing fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin [[Balanced budget|balanced the national budget]], producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a [[balanced budget]] was projected for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank, [http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2006/tha.asp Asian Development Outlook 2006: Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905103151/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2006/tha.asp |date=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public sector debt fell from 57 per cent of GDP in January 2001 to 41 per cent in September 2006.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30&amp;nbsp;billion in 2001 to US$64&amp;nbsp;billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/12/25/headlines/headlines_30022396.php|title=Black Tuesday: Did the BOT overreact?|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108014929/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/12/25/headlines/headlines_30022396.php|archivedate=8 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say [[Thaksinomics]] is little more than a [[Keynesian economics#Active fiscal policy|Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy]] re-branded. Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor "hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|title=Forget the apologies, let the PM rebuild democracy|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221520/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|archivedate=14 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin helped legalise Thailand's massive underground lottery system [[numbers game]] (Thai: หวย) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2&amp;nbsp;billion) were used for social projects, including the "One District, One Scholarship" program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|title=Activists call for MCOT delisting|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930004248/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|title=Thaksinomics 'not a driver of growth'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717175908/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|archivedate=17 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare policies===
Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidised universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials.&lt;ref name=Dual-track&gt;{{cite news |first=Charoen |last=Kittikanya |title=Dual-track system |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820004448/http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=14 July 2006 |title=Bt30 health scheme still lacks funds, says official |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015165033/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |archivedate=15 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin lauds his own achievements |publisher=Bangkok Post |url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010025253/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in [[medical tourism]], with 1.3&amp;nbsp;million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33&amp;nbsp;billion (US$800&amp;nbsp;million) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 85 Bogus Doctors Arrested In Thailand Last Year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101121830/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 |date=1 January 2007 }} 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwebsites.com/medical-tourism-thailand.asp First International Trade Exhibition and Conference on Medical Tourism, Spa and Wellness Industries, in Bangkok, 20–23 March 2008] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-coup public health minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30 baht program a "marketing gimmick" and claimed that the government would "very soon" stop charging patients any fees for visits to state hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|title=Bt30 health fee may be scrapped|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|archivedate=31 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who received the treatment claimed that they prefer drugs from pharmacists than from facilities covered by the scheme and almost half of the patients were dissatisfied with the service given by the facilities.&lt;ref name=Dual-track /&gt; The universal health care scheme raised a debt of 7.7&amp;nbsp;billion baht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Fernquest |title=Thailand's draft government budget for 2007 |url=http://www.readbangkokpost.com/business/2007_currency_crisis/thailands_draft_government_bud.php |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall [[prevalence]] rate noticeably declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/2006_country_progress_report_thailand_en.pdf Follow-up to the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS)] December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public Health at Risk: A US Free Trade Agreement could threaten access to medicines in Thailand |publisher=The Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3&amp;nbsp;million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labour protection. [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticised the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais.

===The War on Drugs===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin administration#Anti-drug policies}}
Thaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to counter a perceived boom in the Thai drug market, particularly in [[methamphetamine]]. Earlier policies like border blocking (most methamphetamine is produced in [[Myanmar]]), education, sports, and promoting peer pressure had proved ineffective. In a 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol noted the rise in drug use and called for a "War on Drugs." Privy Councillor Phichit Kunlawanit called on the government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that "if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma".&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Connors, [http://sovereignmyth.blogspot.com/2009/09/ambivalent-about-rights.html Ambivalent About Rights: "Accidental" Killing Machines, Democracy and Coups D’etat.], Draft paper presented to Human Rights in Asia Workshop, University of Melbourne, 1–2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid "every square inch of the country" of drugs in three months.&lt;ref&gt;Anucha Yuwadee, Bangkok Post, 15 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets including "blacklists", awarding government officials for achieving targets and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeting dealers, and "ruthless" implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"&gt;National News Bureau of Thailand, [http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/378944-academics-call-for-law-to-prosecute-thaksin-in-world-court/ Academics call for law to prosecute Thaksin in World Court], 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/aids/2004/thai.htm |title=The War on Drugs, HIV/AIDS, and Violations of Human Rights in Thailand |quote=Beginning in February 2003, the Thaksin government instructed police and local officials that persons charged with drug offenses should be considered "security threats" and dealt with in a "ruthless" and "severe" manner. The result of the initial three-month phase of this campaign was some 2,275 extrajudicial killings |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government claimed that only around 50 of the deaths were at the hands of the police, the rest being drug traffickers who were being silenced by their dealers and their dealers' dealers.

King Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticised those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html |title=พระราชดำรัส พระราชทานแก่คณะบุคคลต่างๆ ที่เข้าเฝ้าฯ ถวายชัยมงคล ในโอกาสวันเฉลิมพระชนมพรรษา ณ ศาลาดุสิดาลัย สวนจิตรลดา พระราชวังดุสิตฯ วันพฤหัสบดีที่ ๔ ธันวาคม พ.ศ. ๒๕๔๖ (ฉบับไม่เป็นทางการ) |quote=ไอ้การชัยชนะของการปราบไอ้ยาเสพติดนี่ ดีที่ปราบ แล้วก็ที่เขาตำหนิบอกว่า เอ้ย คนตาย ตั้ง ๒,๕๐๐ คน อะไรนั่น เรื่องเล็ก ๒,๕๐๐ คน ถ้านายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ นายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ ทุกปี ๆ จดไว้นะ มีมากกว่า ๒,๕๐๐ คนที่ตาย ที่ตายทั้งคนที่เสพติด แล้วก็ขึ้นไป ฆ่าคน หรือทำอะไร เผาอะไรต่าง ๆ รวมทั้งเจ้าหน้าที่ที่ต้องไปปราบปกติ ก็ตายมากเหมือนกัน แต่ไม่พูดเท่านั้นเอง ไม่ไปนับ แต่นี้เขาก็นับไปชี้ ชี้ ชี้นับ พวกที่ค้า พวกที่ทำ ก็ตายเยอะเหมือนกัน ก่อนนี้ แต่ไม่พูดถึง เชื่อว่าพอๆ กับที่ได้จดว่า มีผู้ที่ตายในการสงครามต่อสู้ยาเสพติด ที่ทราบว่าคนตาย เพราะยาเสพติดนี่ มากมาย |publisher=The Golden Jubilee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb [the drug trade], over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Sentinel [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=185&amp;id=628&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view The Long Wait for Justice in Thailand], 10 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;"}}

Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Royal Jubilee Network, [http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html 2003 Birthday Speech of King Bhumibol Adulyadej]&lt;/ref&gt; Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.

The war on drugs was widely criticised by the international community. Thaksin requested that the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, "The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=75010&amp;date=4 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 March 2003 |title=DRUG-RELATED KILLINGS: Verify the toll, say diplomats }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee to investigate the anti-drug campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 "Kanit to chair extrajudicial killings probe"] ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', 3 August 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090211/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in January 2008: "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted."&lt;ref name=economist24jan08&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566797 "Thailand's drug wars. Back on the offensive"] 24 January 2008 ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was opposition leader, [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] accused Thaksin of [[crimes against humanity]] for his alleged role in the campaign. After being appointed Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation into the killings, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]]. Former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen led the investigation and the investigation committee was approved by Abhisit's Cabinet. Abhisit denied that the probe was politically motivated. Witnesses and victims were urged to report to the Department of Special Investigation, which operated directly under Abhisit's control.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thailand Times, [http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ Thaksin’s ‘Drug Murders’ investigated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402164354/http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ |date=2 April 2012 }}, 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalthailand.com/threads/677-Extra-juridical-killing-cases-by-Thaksin-government-investigated-again-in-Thailand|title=Extra-juridical killing cases by Thaksin government investigated again in Thailand|work=Personal Thailand - Travel and Live in Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the August 2011 parliamentary elections, Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicise any conclusive evidence linking Thaksin or members of his Government to any extrajudicial killings.

===Educational policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Education policies}}
[[File:LulaShinawatra.jpg|thumb|Thaksin in a meeting with the [[President of Brazil]], [[Lula da Silva]], in 2004]]

One of Thaksin's educational reforms was school decentralisation, as mandated by the 1997 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|title=54th Thai Government Policy|author=|date=26 May 2001|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010526124921/http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|archivedate=26 May 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. Teachers also feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 Crisis in the 'Land of the Smile'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917045902/http://internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 |date=17 September 2006 }} International Viewpoint, Online magazine: IV376 – March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other intended policy changes included learning reform and related curricular decentralisation, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |title=Thai News Agency, Rote learning to be eliminated from schools, says PM, 21 January 2006 |publisher=Etna.mcot.net |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205115/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase access to universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|title=New student loan scheme to have higher family-income limit|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709030754/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|archivedate=9 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was one of the first supporters of [[Nicholas Negroponte]]'s [[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712025355/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|archivedate=12 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junta later cancelled the project.

Thaksin also initiated the controversial "One District, One Dream School" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district had at least one high-quality school. It was criticised, with claims that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving inadequate financial support from the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |title=Suicide puts spotlight on model schools' money woes |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=15 September 2005 |access-date=4 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124804/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAI TALK: Nightmares haunt dream-school project |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=13 October 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614082702/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he altered the state university entrance system, which had relied exclusively on nationally standardised exams. Thaksin pushed for greater weighting of senior high-school grades in the hope of focusing students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.

===Energy policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Energy policies|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the [[Chuan Leekpai]] government's privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-[[Asian financial crisis]] policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale [[Electricity market|power pool]] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/ffd/domestic/2001/0927trump.htm |title=Far Eastern Economic Review, "Power Politics Trump Reform", 27 September 2001 |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=27 September 2001 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin's policies aimed to create [[Leadership|national champions]] that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm Bangkok Post, "Raising sector efficiency `crucial': Utility's B140bn debt strains public purse"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529234341/http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.

===South Thailand insurgency===
{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}

A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with their Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians (including Buddhist monks) are also regular targets. Thaksin was widely criticised for his management of the situation.

Of three key controversial incidents, the first was the Army's storming of the [[Krue Sae Mosque|Krue Se Mosque]], where protesters had holed up and were killed.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DA123CF931A15754C0A9639C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fThaksin%20Shinawatra U.N. Criticizes Emergency Powers], Warren Hoge, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, in October 2004, was the killing of 84 Muslim demonstrators at [[Tak Bai]], when the Army broke up a peaceful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAILAND: At least 84 people killed in Southern Thailand |publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission |date=26 October 2004 |url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2004/838/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims were reported to have been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.

In a third incident, Muslim lawyer [[Somchai Neelapaijit]] disappeared, allegedly abducted and killed by police for his role in defending alleged insurgents who claimed to have been tortured. Despite witness testimony and forensic evidence during the court of police investigations and court trials, all allegations against police said to be involved were dropped and the enforced disappearance case closed.

Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Somchai Phatharathananunth "Civil Society and Democratization" p.222&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organisations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/08/04/thaila11592.htm |title=Emergency Decree Violates Thai Constitution and Laws |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister [[Anand Panyarachun]] to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled South. In its final report in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing elements of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and making [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language in the region along with Thai. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, but nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |title=Government shrugs off NRC final report |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=7 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195700/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin blamed Malaysia's jungle that has occasionally been used to train Islamic militants to cause violence in the south and Indonesia for being an inspiration to the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|title=The Nation: Southern Unrest|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527043825/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|archivedate=27 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative reform===
One of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labelled the "big bang." It was hailed as a "historic breakthrough" and "the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand's modern system of departmental government in 1897." Plans had been studied for years to loosen perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system but were not implemented until the Thaksin government.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Painter, Managerial Reform and Political Control, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, [http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc the Case of Thaksin and the Thai Bureaucracy*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012055631/http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc |date=12 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.

Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors to that of active policy managers. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials who reported back to Bangkok, while the Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.

A key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, the "CEO-governors" epitomised what was called his "transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive." Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and co-ordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The "CEO governors" were assisted by "provincial CFOs" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. Governors were authorised to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kellogg School of Management |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/hits/030817bp.htm |title=CEO governors mini-premiers, says PM: Can issue bonds, use management methods |date=17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors.

The Thaksin era also saw the opening of a number of government one-stop service centres to reduce red tape for anything from investment to utilities and ID-card processing.

===Foreign policies===
[[Image:Vladimir Putin in Thailand 21-22 October 2003-1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thaksin with the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at [[APEC Bangkok 2003]] on 21 October 2003 in Bangkok]]
Thaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=กลุ่มศึกษาข้อตกลงเขตการค้าเสรีภาคประชาชน |url=http://www.ftawatch.org/ |title=FTA Watch Group website |publisher=Ftawatch.org |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

Thaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906011819/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 September 2004 |work=Straits Times |title=Thaksin's Chance for Leading Role in the Region |date=10 March 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was repeatedly attacked for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders and the international community. Besides his famous swipe at the UN (see The 'war on drugs' above), there were also allegations of gaffes at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Ex-envoys tell of 'multi-tasking' premier |date=17 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907051258/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |archivedate=7 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was keen to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries like Laos. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the impoverished country a 4&amp;nbsp;billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ 'Thaksin to face charges over Burma telecom deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103061415/http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ |date=3 January 2009 }}. ICT News, 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Powell Thaksin 20020729.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra at Government House]]
Thaksin energetically supported his former foreign minister [[Surakiart Sathirathai]]'s somewhat improbable campaign to become UN Secretary General.

===Suvarnabhumi Airport===
Despite debate and long abandonment of the plan due to the stability of the ground for the location of the airport, the Thaksin government pushed to complete the construction of the new Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The airport was officially opened a week after Thaksin's government was overthrown. It is one of the world's largest airports.

However, some members of Thaksin's government were accused of [[corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project]]. These allegations were used by the military junta to justify the 2006 coup.&lt;ref&gt;International Herald Tribune, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/02/news/thai.php Thailand's airport imbroglio grows], 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CDRM|junta]] initiated several investigations into the airport. Nevertheless, investigative panels found that damage to the airport was "minute" and "common." The cost of repairing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused by its opponents of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems to pin further blame on the Thaksin government. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Criticism===

===="Policy corruption"====
Thaksin was accused of "policy corruption", such as infrastructure and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|title=Thaksin-era corruption'cost state Bt400 bn'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212205/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|archivedate=15 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]]. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4&amp;nbsp;billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the minimum air fare of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about to enter into a joint venture with low-cost carrier [[AirAsia]] to open a Thai subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tackling the 'policy corruption' of the Thaksin regime |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013143400/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets based on charges of policy corruption.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;Asia Sentinel, [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=536&amp;Itemid=185 Thailand's Thaksin Freeze Out], 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin denied the allegations. "They just made up a beautiful term to use against me. There's no such thing in this government. Our policies only serve the interests of the majority of the people", he said.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt; From 2002 to 2006, the stock price of Shin Corp increased from 38 to 104 baht (an increase of 173 per cent) while the stock price of Shin Satellite fell. In the same period, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 161 per cent, and the price of other major SET blue chip companies increased vastly more. Industry deregulation caused the market share of AIS to fall from 68 per cent to 53 per cent.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

====Corruption====
[[Transparency International]] reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved somewhat during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61), whilst in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).&lt;ref&gt;Thai Public Relations Department, "Thailand's Image on Transparency", 26 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 TI 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512023516/http://transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 |date=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International, [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 Corruption Perceptions Index 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929153638/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 |date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a study of [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] by the [[World Bank]] gave Thailand a lower score on Control of Corruption during 2002–2005 under Thaksin when compared to the Democrat-led government of 1998–2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |title=Worldwide Governance Indicators |format=PDF |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710170031/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 Thaksin Shinawatra was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in absentia over a corrupt land deal. In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/thaksin-thailand-corruption|title=Former Thai PM Thaksin found guilty of corruption|author=Ian MacKinnon|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other charges====
Immediately after the events in March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajivas stated that he would talk to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin's wealth and extravagance, carving a contrast between the alleged opulence of the premier's house and the humbler, agrarian roots of many of the demonstrators. Shortly after, he also directly condemned his opponent's self-proclaimed affinity with the ordinary people, the "phrai", arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the "ammart", or the traditional elites in Thailand's army, bureaucracy, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat, [http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ Thailand's Blood Red Protest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095707/http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ |date=27 May 2010 }}, 21 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's government was accused of exerting political influence in its [[Censorship of radio and film (Thailand)|crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations]], and Thaksin brought massive defamation suits against critical journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |date=1 June 2005 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Community-radio crackdown panned |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215020/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acting prime minister files more criminal and defamation lawsuits |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=15 June 2006 |url=http://cpj.org/2006/06/thailand-acting-prime-minister-files-more-criminal.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was also accused of interference when the Senate appointed [[Wisut Montriwat]] (former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) to the position of Auditor General, replacing [[Jaruvan Maintaka]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Thaksin has been engaged in a series of lawsuits brought by American businessman [[William L. Monson]] regarding Thaksin's takeover of a cable-television joint venture the two partnered in during the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===2005 re-election===
Under the slogans "Four Years of Repair{{spaced ndash}}Four years of Reconstruction" and "Building Opportunities", Thaksin and the TRT won landslide victories in [[Thai general election, 2005|February 2005 elections]], sweeping 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. But his second term was soon beset by protests, with claims that he presided over a "parliamentary dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand Election Triumph: Re-packaging old politics? |publisher=ASEAN Focus Group, Australian National University |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720192841/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations by Sondhi Limthongkul===
The political crisis was catalysed by several accusations published by media mogul and popular talk show host [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a former Thaksin supporter who had broken with him. These included accusations that Thaksin:
* Restricted press freedom by suing Sondhi after he printed a sermon by a [[Luang Ta Maha Bua|controversial monk]] (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Luang Ta Maha Bua incident|Luang Ta Maha Bua incident]])
* Masterminded the desecration of the famous [[Erawan Shrine|Erawan]] shrine (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident]])

===Sale of Shin Corporation===
{{Main article|Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings}}
On 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in [[Shin Corporation]] to [[Temasek Holdings]]. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]] (about US$1.88&amp;nbsp;billion) tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|stock exchange]] exempt from [[capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Complex transaction a model for avoiding tax, ownership law |date=27 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712041022/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaksin was the target of accusations of corruption for selling forbidden national assets such as national utility company to a foreign entity in exchange for personal profits and kickbacks.  Thai laws at the time disallowed the sale of integral assets of national importance to the public or to any foreign entity, but Thaksin amended the laws to allow such sale.

===Anti-Thaksin rallies===
{{See also|Thailand political crisis 2005-2006}}
Thaksin faced pressure to resign following the Shin Corp. sale.

Protests, led by the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) whose leaders included Chamlong and Sondhi, soon swelled to tens of thousands who occupied the area around Government House in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Tens of thousands rally against Thailand's Prime Minister]]&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of both working-class and middle-class Bangkokians and included prominent social figures, academics and students.

===House dissolution and election===
{{Main article|Thailand legislative election, April 2006}}
Thaksin announced a [[Dissolution of parliament|House dissolution]] on 24 February 2006. General elections were scheduled for 2 April.

Thaksin was attacked for calling the snap elections, which in effect prevented any member of parliament from changing parties. In an editorial, ''The Nation'' noted it "fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept [of democracy], particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin's manipulation has been well documented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |title=Democracy put to the ultimate test |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=21 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election results and by-elections===
Thaksin's TRT Party won the widely boycotted elections, gaining 462 seats in Parliament, with the ratio of voters to no-voters 16:10, not counting non-voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Thai Rak Thai win 16&amp;nbsp;million votes: Thaksin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427050223/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |archivedate=27 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by-elections were needed for 40 TRT candidates who failed to win the minimum 20% required by the 1997 Constitution in an uncontested seat.&lt;ref name="NationSecond"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |title=38 one-horse candidates fail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162906/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Second round of elections be held on 23 April |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022737/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |archivedate=8 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party refused to contest them&lt;ref name="NationSecond" /&gt; and, along with the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|PAD]], petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrat asks court to cancel 2nd round of election |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120030/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamlong Srimuang declared that the PAD would ignore the elections and "go on rallying until Thaksin resigns and Thailand gets a royally appointed prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=PAD ignores vote results |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122030026/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |archivedate=22 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were held on 25 April and resulted in the TRT winning 25 of the constituencies and losing 2. Yet another round of by-elections on 29 April was scheduled for 13 constituencies. The Thai Rak Thai Party was later accused and found guilty of paying smaller parties to contest the election to fulfill the 20% rule, while the Democrat Party was accused of paying smaller parties not to. The by-elections were suspended by the Constitution Court while it deliberated whether to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=Thaksin Shinawatra Talkasia Transcript |date=12 February 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/22/talkasia.thaksin.script/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invalidation of the elections===
On 8 May 2006, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] ruled 8–6 to invalidate the April elections based on the awkward positioning of voting booths. The ruling was called a landmark case in "judicial activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bangkok Post |title=End of the beginning in Thailand's crisis 19 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party, which had boycotted the April elections, said they were now ready to contest an October election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |title=Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=8 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616174003/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |archivedate=16 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new election was ordered and later set for [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|15 October]]. The Court found the Election Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them. But the election was cancelled when the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military seized power on 19 September]].

===Break from politics===
Thaksin announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of Prime Minister after Parliament reconvened, but would continue as Caretaker Prime Minister until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Channel NewsAsia |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/201527/1/.html |date=4 April 2006 |title=Thai PM Thaksin says he'll stop down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then delegated his functions to Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister [[Chidchai Wannasathit]], moved out of Government House, and went on vacation.

==September 2006 coup==
{{Main article|2006 Thai coup d'état}}
In the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 soldiers ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex to lay down their weapons. Troops also surrounded the [[Thaicom]] satellite receiving station and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza and government units along Rajdamnoen Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai armed forces seize Bangkok |agency=Reuters |date=19 September 2006 |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-19T164005Z_01_BKK256153_RTRUKOC_0_UK-THAILAND-EMERGENCY.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211164830/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews |archivedate=11 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops participating in the coup were from the 1st and 3rd Army Regions, the [[Internal Security Operations Command]], the Special Warfare Centre and Army units in Nakhon Ratchasima and Prachin Buri provinces and sections of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=nationmultimedia.com|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|title=Caretaker PM tries to fight back|date=20 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102202724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|archivedate=2 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to coup leader Army Commander General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], the coup leaders had arrested Deputy Prime Minister [[Chitchai Wannasathit]] and Defense Minister [[Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece One night in Bangkok] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008104423/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece |date=8 October 2006 }}, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The military, originally calling itself the [[Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch]] (CDRM), issued a statement citing the government's alleged ''[[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]]'', corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |title=Statement from the military reformist |date=20 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212504/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It declared the king of Thailand the head of state, and said elections would be held soon to return democracy to the country. Thaksin later arrived in [[UK|Britain]], where he had family.

===Thai Rak Thai party===
Many [[Thai Rak Thai]] party members were reported to have resigned from the party in the aftermath of the coup for fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction. It was not clear whether [[Suriya Jungrungreangkit]], another influential member of the faction, would also resign. [[Sontaya Kunplome]] was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |title=Sonthaya leads 20 members out of Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221431/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |archivedate=14 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |title=Somsak leads 100 members to resign from Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528033455/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |archivedate=28 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2006 Thaksin and his former deputy Somkid Jatusipitak resigned from the TRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |title=Thaksin resigns from Thai Rak Thai |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183911/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |title=Somkid resigns from Thai Rak Thai Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012233156/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaturon Chaisang took over as party head.

The TRT was finally dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal, which banned over 100 of its executives, including Thaksin, from politics for five years, based on charges that two party executives (Defense Minister Thammarak and Pongsak Raktapongpaisarn) bribed a smaller party to stand in the [[April 2006 Thailand legislative election|April 2006 election]]. The Democrat party was cleared on a similar charge.

===2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings===
{{Main article|2006 Bangkok bombings}}
On 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2007, several bombs exploded in Bangkok, killing and wounding a number of bystanders. General Surayud accused "those who lost power as a result of the military takeover" of masterminding the bombings, but did not directly identify Thaksin. Thaksin went on CNN to publicly deny any involvement in the bombings. The government did not make any arrests in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|title=Surayud suspects "power losers" as finger--pointing begins|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220033330/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal charges===
Thaksin's [[diplomatic passport]] was revoked on 31 December 2006 after the junta accused him of engaging in political activities while in exile. Thai embassies were ordered not to facilitate his travels.

A junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets and attempted to bring charges against him. The AEC was criticised for being stacked with anti-Thaksin appointees. At one point, AEC Secretary [[Kaewsan Atibodhi]] claimed that "evidence and witnesses are useless", when an AEC panel recommended legal action without hearing 300 witnesses or considering 100 additional pieces of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The AEC froze Thaksin's assets

In January 2007, Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with an Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772&amp;nbsp;million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which prohibits government officials and their spouses from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authority.

The Assets Examination Committee also accused Thaksin of issuing an unlawful cabinet resolution approving the spending of state funds to buy rubber saplings.

In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General charged Thaksin's wife and brother-in-law with conspiring to evade taxes of 546&amp;nbsp;million baht (US$15.6&amp;nbsp;million) in a 1997 transfer of Shin Corp shares.

The Assets Examination Committee found Thaksin guilty of malfeasance for obstructing competition by imposing an excise tax on telecom operators. Thaksin's Cabinet had approved the relevant executive decree in 2003.

==Purchase of Manchester City Football Club==
As prime minister, Thaksin had unsuccessfully sought to buy the English [[Premier League]] football clubs [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and later [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in what critics claimed was a publicity stunt in response to his political problems.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/footballNews/idUKSP17548520070706?pageNumber=3 NEWSMAKER-City takeover keeps Thaksin in the political limelight], 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions and exile==
In May 2007, Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] said Thaksin was free to return to Thailand, and he would personally guarantee Thaksin's safety. In January 2008 Thaksin's wife Potjaman was arrested on arrival in [[Bangkok]] but released on bail after appearing at the Supreme Court, with orders not to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7176160.stm |title=/2, Thaksin's wife back in Thailand |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was set to be tried for alleged violation of [[stock]]-trading and land sale laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7203913.stm news.bbc.co.uk, Ex-PM's wife set for Thai trial] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratchadaphisek land verdict===
{{See also|Potjaman Shinawatra#Ratchadaphisek land purchase controversy}}
On 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions ruled that Thaksin, while prime minister, abused his power to help his wife buy public land at auction, and sentenced him to two years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[Online].

Soon after, Thaksin told [[Reuters]], "I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way", and added that the case was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=131548 ''Thaksin guilty of corruption''] Bangkok Post (21 October 2008.

The British Government [[Home Office]], meanwhile, revoked Potjaman and Thaksin's [[visa (document)|visas]] due to their convictions, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines directing them to disallow either of them to board flights to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/09/news/10thaksin.php UK visa revoked, Thaksin looks for new home] www.iht.com&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, ''[[Arabian Business]]'' reported after an exclusive interview that the UK froze $4.2&amp;nbsp;billion of his assets in the UK.

Thaksin had reportedly considered sanctuaries such as [[China]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Nicaragua]], and several other countries in [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. Reports said the Shinawatras were granted honorary citizenship by the Bahamas and Nicaragua, and were building a £5.5&amp;nbsp;million home in China.

===Songkran unrest===
{{Main article|April 2009 Thai political unrest}}
In mid-April 2009, violent protests of mostly Thaksin-supporters calling themselves the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD) led to the cancellation of the [[ASEAN]] summit in Pattaya and declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok. Thaksin had been giving enthusiastic encouragement at UDD rallies via satellite and phone-in link, at one point calling for a "people's revolution", following the suppression of the protests he claimed to have merely been offering "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opposition raises specter of civil war in Thailand |author=Brian McCartan |publisher=World Politics Review |url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=3691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin supported protests by the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship|UDD]] against the Abhisit Vejjajiva government, demanding Thaksin be allowed to return free from all the earlier corruption charges.&lt;ref name="Thaksin pitches 'all-out' fight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangkok Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enews.mcot.net"/&gt; Thaksin denied leading the UDD, claiming he only gave them "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;

===Money laundering allegations===
In April 2009, Privy Councilor General [[Pichitr Kullavanijaya]] reported he had been informed by former US ambassador to Thailand [[Ralph L. Boyce]] that Thaksin had laundered 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2.8&amp;nbsp;billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts to organise the anti-government protests.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KD17Ae02.html Smoke, mirrors and lies], 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic advisor to Cambodia===
On 4 November 2009, it was announced that Thaksin Shinawatra had been appointed a special advisor to the [[Cambodia]]n government and [[Hun Sen]] and stated that Cambodia would refuse to extradite Thaksin because it considered him a victim of political persecution.

===="Spy" controversy====
On 11 November 2009, [[Sivarak Chutipong]] was arrested by Cambodian police for passing the confidential flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia Air Traffic Service, the private firm which manages [[air traffic control]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009111329536/Online-Edition/thai-national-arrested-for-espionage.html|title=Search|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"/&gt; Sivarak denied that he was a spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct on the part of the First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/29256/irate-sivarak-demands-answers|title=Irate Sivarak demands answers - Bangkok Post: news|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivarak's mother appeared often on Thai television, pleading for the government to assist her son.

Sivarak was later sentenced to jail for 7 years. Thaksin personally requested the Cambodian government to pardon Sivarak, and he was soon pardoned by King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] and expatriated. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban later accused Sivarak of staging his own arrest in order to discredit the Abhisit government.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/162987/sivarak-mum-may-sue-suthep Sivarak's mum threatens to sue Suthep], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former Thai spy chief and Foreign Minister [[Prasong Soonsiri]] concurred, claiming, "It has been a set-up from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|title=Mother justifies seeking royal pardon for her son|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004136/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frozen asset seizure===

====Prior to the verdict====
On 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court was scheduled to render its verdict on whether to seize his family's Thai assets, worth 76&amp;nbsp;billion baht frozen by the AEC after the coup. The AEC froze the assets under the authority of Announcement No. 30 of the military junta.&lt;ref name="AECrationaleforfreeze"/&gt; Tensions ran high through Thailand, tens of thousands of government security forces were deployed, particularly in routes leading to Bangkok. However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/32952/security-forces-ready-for-action Security forces ready for action], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/168673/udd-won-t-rally-on-feb-26 UDD won't rally on 26 February], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption. Policy corruption, was defined by the court as the abuse of powers by implementing economic policies that, while in themselves legal and of potential benefit to society and the economy, also aided companies that were owned in part by the policy maker.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption" /&gt; The prosecution claimed that Thaksin abused his powers five times while Premier.

====The verdict====
The court first ruled that Thaksin and Potjaman were the real owners of the assets, rather than his children and relatives. The court also ruled that it had the authority to seize assets, based on the announcements of the junta. The court found Thaksin guilty of four out of five policy corruption, and ordered that 46&amp;nbsp;billion baht be seized. The remaining 30&amp;nbsp;billion continued to remain frozen.
* Count 1: Conversion of telecom concession fees into excise charges. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT/CAT a percentage of their revenue as a concession fee (TOT/CAT are state-owned enterprises, although they were going through the process of privatisation). The Thaksin government modified this into a system wherein all operators would instead directly pay the government an equivalent excise tax. The imposition of excise tax here would eventually be passed on to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|title=Telecom laws were manipulated to benefit Shin Corp subsidiary AIS, says court|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004210/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin claimed that all operators continued to pay the same total costs. The judges ruled that this benefited AIS while harming the TOT, and thus was an abuse of power.
* Count 2: Modification of a revenue sharing agreement on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|title=Minefield of criminal cases awaits Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302143058/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|archivedate=2 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled that the terms of the pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially as a result of the agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.
* Count 3: Modification of mobile roaming agreement. Previously, there were no roaming agreements between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator were not allowed to use services on another operator's network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its subscribers roaming on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT's income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS's new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.
* Count 4: Replacement of [[ThaiCom 4]] with [[iPSTAR]]. A previous government had originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 as a backup satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, at the time the largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as [[ThaiCom 3]]. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's communications security by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.
* Count 5: EXIM Bank loan to Myanmar to pay for ThaiCom services. Thaksin was scheduled to meet with Burmese leaders to negotiate trade deals between the two countries. One of the deals negotiated gave Myanmar a Thai EXIM Bank loan to purchase 376&amp;nbsp;million baht in satellite services from ShinSat. Thaksin noted that many deals were struck in the negotiations, and that 16 other companies also benefited from the EXIM Bank's loans. The judges ruled that the loans gave preferential treatment to Thaksin, and hence were an abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|title=Thaksin guilty,  Bt46 bn seized, Bt30 bn returned|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301054928/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|archivedate=1 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032201/http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-25|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=thaksinlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges decided to seize 46&amp;nbsp;billion differences in value of Shin Corp. shares from the date when he came to office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8&amp;nbsp;billion to 9&amp;nbsp;billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while [[Siam Cement]], one of Thailand's premier blue chip companies, gained 717%.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704625004575088720584763744?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories, Thai Court Rules to Seize $1.4&amp;nbsp;Billion From Thaksin], 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com%252Foption%252Fprint.php%253Fnewsid%253D30118020&amp;h=7fa87f0939dbf3b20d395d4dea9a35be&amp;ref=mf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
In an email to his supporters, Thaksin claimed that the court was used as a tool. He also noted how the Thai stock market rose to the benefit of many companies, not just his, and claimed that all charges against him were politically motivated. He thanked his supporters for not protesting while the verdict was being read, and implored them to use non-violent means in the future. Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It&amp;039;s-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|title=It's my money : Pojaman|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225141212/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It%26039%3Bs-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|archivedate=25 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Pojaman's claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company's account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|title=How evidence trapped Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004539/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some UDD members held a small protest in front of the court, but did not disrupt the ruling as the government had predicted they would. The UDD leaders announced that a large-scale protest was scheduled to be held on 14 March 2010.

On the evening of 27 February (Saturday of a 3-day holiday), [[M67 grenade]]s were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of [[Bangkok Bank]]. Nobody was hurt or injured in the attacks. The perpetrators were not caught, and no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks. Thaksin and the UDD were quick to deny any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303045519/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |archivedate=3 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }} PM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170009/stringent-security-measures-invoked Stringent security measures invoked], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170025/udd-denies-link-in-bomb-attacks UDD denies link in bomb attacks], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant was issued based on sketches of a motorcycle driver.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170129/warrant-issued-for-bomb-suspect Warrant issued for bomb suspect], 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer of Shin Corp. Shares===
The laws does not allow the prime minister to run a side business while holding office. Thaksin was pressed charged on wealth concealment while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20091221-187194.html|title=Thaksin assets case verdict due in January|work=asiaone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-Pu-Z/Shinawatra-Thaksin.html|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=notablebiographies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the wealth declaration of Thaksin and his family when he took office, there has been an appeal to The National Anti-Corruption Commission that there are some suspicions about the numbers in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokbiznews.com/home/detail/politics/opinion/sarinee-achavanuntak/20100305/103531/%E0%B8%8B%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99-301-:-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C-%E0%B8%9E.%E0%B8%95.%E0%B8%97.%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%93-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3-(1).html|title=กรุงเทพธุรกิจ - เกี่ยวกับกรุงเทพธุรกิจออนไลน์|work=www.bangkokbiznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring to maid and driver====
Thaksin was charged with illegally concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of [[Shin Corporation|Shin Corp.]] shares to his drivers and maids, without their knowledge. Thaksin tearfully told the Constitutional Court that it was an honest mistake before the Court acquitted him on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|title=Thaksin court drama grips Bangkok|work=CNN Travel|access-date=27 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504192344/http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|archive-date=4 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring shares to children who reached maturity====
There was also a controversy over whether there was any hidden tax evasion when Thaksin and Potjaman transferred their Shin Corporation shares to their children. [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Panthongtae]] and Pinthongta Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parent.

The transfer of shares from Thaksin and Potjaman to Parnthongtae was claimed to have been a sham, since there was no actual transfer of money. Panthongtae said the shares were sold to him at cost. Thaksin stated he had a written agreement proving the transfer to his son. Prior to the transfer, Panthongtae had signed an agreement with his father to settle a 4.5 billion baht debt from buying 300 million shares of the [[TMB Bank|Thai Military Bank]] (TMB). However, the actual market value of the TMB shares at that time was only 1.5 billion baht. This showed a "fake debt" of 3 billion baht had been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|title=Door now open for more agencies to reclaim their money|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304132514/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|archivedate=4 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assets Examination Committee (Thailand)|The Assets Examination Committee]] (AEC) discovered that Panthongtae's account that receives Shin Corporation's dividend has been used to transfer money to Potjaman's account to the amount of 1.1 billion baht.

Pintongtha also was accused of being nominee for her parents. She said that the money from her mother was a "birthday present". This birthday present was used to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corporation, which leaves her brother with the same amount. The AEC found the account has been receiving dividends from Shin Corp. There were no transactions between Pintongtha's account and her mother's account. However, the dividend money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark to the amount of 71 million baht and shares from 5 real-estate firms from 2 funds in 2004 worth of 485 million baht.

DSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that both WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and his former wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Potjaman insists family assets of B76bn were legally earned |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/23916/potjaman-insists-family-assets-of-b76bn-were-legally-earned |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Msk cao tverskoy.png|thumb|Tverskoy and [[Kitai-gorod]] on the map of Moscow. As of 2007, Kitai-gorod is a separate territory governed directly by Central Administrative Okrug]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Tverskoy (municipality in Moscow).png|thumb|Coat of arms of Tverskoy District]]

'''Tverskoy District''' ({{lang-rus|Тверско́й райо́н|p=tvʲɪrˈskoj|a=Ru-Тверской.ogg}}) is a [[administrative divisions of Moscow|district]] of [[Central Administrative Okrug]] of the [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Population: {{ru-census2010|75,378|;}} {{ru-census2002|75,955|.}}

The district extends from [[Kitai-gorod]] northwest to [[Belorussky Rail Terminal|Belorussky]] and [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]]s . Its southern boundary runs one or two city blocks south from [[Tverskaya Street]]; eastern boundary follows the track of the [[Neglinnaya River]] now flowing in a [[tunnel]] under Samotechnaya Street, [[Tsvetnoy Boulevard]], and Neglinnaya Street.

Tverskoy District houses [[State Duma]], [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Council, and [[Moscow Police]] Headquarters. It contains [[Theatre Square]], the business district of Tverskaya Street with [[Pushkin Square]], [[Petrovka Street]], Dmitrovka Street, and the western part of [[Kuznetsky Most]]. It has the highest concentration of theatres, including [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the historical Pillar Hall of the [[House of the Unions]].

Historical areas of [[Patriarshy Ponds]], Malaya Bronnaya Street, and most of [[Tverskoy Boulevard]], while closely associated with Tverskaya Street actually belong to [[Presnensky District]]. Since 2002 Tverskoy District also includes [[Kitai-gorod]], which was once a separate territory managed directly by Central Administrative Okrug.

==History==
''This section is based on P.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Sytin's "History of Moscow Streets"''&lt;ref&gt;Russian: П.В.Сытин, "Из истории московских улиц", М, 1948 (''Sytin'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Muscovy to 19th century===
[[File:Vysokopetrovsky Monastery 6.JPG|thumb|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter's Cathedral, Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, ca. 1508]]

Tverskaya Street emerged, as the road to [[Tver]], in the 12th century. Dmitrovka Street, the road to [[Dmitrov]], and [[Petrovka Street]], leading to [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], date back to the 14th century.

[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|left|Church of Nativity in Putinki, 1650s]]

Until the 1820s, the territory of what is now Tverskoy District was separated from the [[Moscow Kremlin]] by the [[Neglinnaya River]].  Because of that, the city grew primarily eastward in the Middle Ages—into the [[Red Square]] and Kitai-Gorod—while the development of western territories lagged behind. A stone bridge connecting Tverskaya with the Red Square was built in 1595. Urban development in the western part concentrated along Tverskaya Street. In the late 15th century, it was built out with country-like wooden homes to Pushkin Square, and by the end of the 16th century the city extended beyond the present-day [[Garden Ring]].  First stone [[Boyar]] houses appeared in downtown Tverskaya around that time. In 1654, [[Strastnoy Monastery]] was set up in present-day Pushkin Square, and three years later, Odoyevsky family set up a stone mansion on the site of present-day Museum of Modern History (formerly Museum of Revolution), beyond the [[Bely Gorod]] walls. 

[[File:Dmitrovka Street, 2010192.jpg|thumb|Dmitrovka Street]]

Dmitrovka Street also developed rapidly after the fire of 1648, as marked by the one-of-a-kind eight-[[tented church]] of [[Nativity Church at Putinki|Nativity in Putinki]]. Unusually for Moscow outskirts, it was financed by the State, as the church was located near the Embassy Inn ({{lang|ru|Посольский двор}}), home to foreign guests.&lt;ref&gt;''Sytin'', p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dmitrovka Street, 2010193.jpg|thumb|left|Dmitrovka Street]]

[[Peter the Great]]'s move of the national [[capital (political)|capital]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] actually improved the leading role of Tverskaya Street, as it became the main road of royal journeys between two capitals. Tverskaya acquired Moscow's first triumphal arch (1703, giving name to Triumphalnaya Square), [[Gagarin family]] palace (1760s), and [[Zakhar Chernyshyov]] mansion (1782); later the seat of Moscow Governor, [[Mossovet]], and currently of the Mayor of Moscow (which was rebuilt in the 1940s). The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of 1812]] wiped out wealthy mansions and peasant homes alike, sparing only the Pushkin Square;&lt;ref&gt;''Sytin'', p.128&lt;/ref&gt; Tverskaya was rebuilt as an upper-class street and retained this status ever since.

Northeastern side of Tverskoy District (east of Petrovka Street) lagged behind Tverskaya Street and Moscow's east side due to frequent floods on the Neglinnaya River. First attempt to control the river, proposed in 1775 by Matvey Kazakov, materialized in 1792 Neglinnaya Canal, which was running parallel to the river.  Once the canal was completed, the old river bed was filled with earth. In 1817–1819, the channel was covered with masonry vaults, locking the stream in an underground tunnel. This created Neglinnaya Street, the youngest street inside Boulevard Ring, but did not rule out future floods.  The most recent flood, in 1973, led to complete rebuilding of the aging tunnel (1974–1989, see [http://www.mosinzhproekt.ru/press-center/articles/print_neglinka.shtml 1965 flood photos])&lt;ref&gt;Russian, Contractor report: Река Неглинная. История и современность, Мосинжроект, 2005 [http://www.mosinzhproekt.ru/press-center/articles/print_neglinka.shtml www.mosinzhproekt.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; Another legacy of the Neglinnaya river survives in Central Baths (1890) and [[Sanduny|Sandunovsky Baths]] (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Russian: "Москва начала века", М, ООО "O-Мастер", 2001 {{ISBN|5-9207-0001-7}} стр.184 (''Builders of Moscow'', p.184). Dates are for extant buildings. Sandunov family owned the baths since the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandunovsky Baths on Neglinnays Street are actually located in [[Meshchansky District]] (on the eastern side of the street), just like the [[Central Bank of Russian Federation]] building.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theatre District====
[[File:MosMetro Teatralnaya img3 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|Theatre Square, Teatralnaya metro station]]

The first public theater, ''[[Petrovka Theatre|Petrovsky Teatr]]'', was set up in 1780 by English entrepreneur [[Michael Maddox]] and Prince Urusov in present-day [[Theatre Square]].  It burned down in October 1805 after 425 successful shows.&lt;ref&gt;German: [http://russlandonline.ru/bolschoi/morenews.php?iditem=27 http://russlandonline.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, [[Joseph Bove]] built a new, larger [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on the same site. By this time, downtown stretch of the Neglinnaya River was contained in an underground tunnel; Peter's [[bastion]]s of Kitai-gorod were razed, forming the [[Theatre Square]]. In the same 1825, landowner Vargin built Maly Theatre on his own adjacent lot. For the first five years, the State leased the building from Vargin; he was later convicted of fraud and the State bought out the building in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.184&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of the opposite land lots were obliged to build houses exactly like Maly Theatre, forming a perfectly symmetrical [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] square with a parade ground and water fountain. The symmetry was eventually ruined by expansions in the 1870s, which added the third theatre—originally Bronnikov private theater (now Molodyozhny Theater).

Another historical hall, the Assembly of Nobility (now the [[House of the Unions]]) stands on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka and [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] streets since 1790. The building, designed by [[Matvey Kazakov]], was rebuilt externally, but the Pillar Hall inside it, famous for its [[acoustics]], remains close to Kazakov's original design. When the State lifted the ban on private theatres in 1882, tradition continued with [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in Kamergersky Lane (1902–1909),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Russia'', p.187 says "minor construction work proceeded till 1909". Substantial completion is usually dated 1903&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yermolova Theatre]] (1925), Hermitage (1883), and Aquarium (1898) park theatres, etc. Currently, Tverskoy District has nineteen [[repertory]] theatres, the Pillar Hall, [[Tchaikovsky]] Hall (1940), and [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]] (originally Salamonovsky Circus, 1880, rebuilt in 1987–1989).

====Industrial expansion====
[[File:Wiki Zelenko Kindergarten Vadkovsky Lane.jpg|thumb|1907 Communal Club for working teenagers, funded by [[Nikolai Krotov (industrialist)|Nikolay Krotov]], designed and managed by [[Alexander Zelenko]] and [[Stanislav Shatsky]]]]

Unlike [[Presnensky District|Presnensky]] or [[Basmanny District]]s, Tverskoy has, and always had, very few industrial properties. However, its northern part, beyond Garden Ring, developed into a working-class neighborhood in line with the 19th-century industrialization. Development began in the 18th century with the [[Butyrka prison]] (rebuilt to a castle shape in 1800).&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt; For the next hundred years, the territories around the prison were filled with farms and small wooden homes.  Things changed with the construction of railroads—[[Smolensk]] railroad station was built in 1870; current building, known as [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]], was completed in 1909. [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]] and Moscow Ring Railroad followed in the 1900s. Territories near the railroads were quickly used for factories, cheap housing for workers followed soon.

Miusskaya Square, located three blocks from Belorussky Terminal, was a site of unusual urban development, a new center of blue-collar social life. In the course of one decade, 1904–1914, the city and private sponsors built Abrikosova Hospital and Nursery (1906),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Junior High School (1912),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.372&lt;/ref&gt; Shanyavsky University (1913),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.382&lt;/ref&gt; kindergartens, and trade schools. Development of similar social hubs in other working districts lagged behind and terminated with [[World War I]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====Modern history====
[[File:Corner of Manege Square, Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|Corner of [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]]: extant National Hotel and demolished Intourist Hotel (1970–2002)]]

Redevelopment of Tverskaya Street began in the late 1920s with infill buildings like [[Ivan Rerberg]]'s Central Telegraph (1927), and [[Grigory Barkhin]]'s [[Izvestia]] building in Pushkin Square (1927). This was followed by demolition of [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] and [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]].

Major reconstruction of Tverskaya Street began in 1937 with demolition of Strastnoy Monastery and dozens of smaller buildings. Three buildings, including Savvinskoye Podvorye, [[Mossovet]] building, and the Eye Clinic, were spared from demolition and moved to new foundations farther from the street. As a result, Savvinskoye Podvorye is now completely locked inside a 1930s [[stalinist architecture|stalinist]] block. Another building, a print shop at Pushkin Square, was moved in the 1970s to make way for Izvestia expansion.&lt;ref&gt;М.Трубилина, "Переезды во сне и наяву", Российская Газета, 1 марта 2004, [http://www.rg.ru/2004/03/01/pereezdy.html www.rg.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of the first stretch of new Gorky Street (the name of Tverskaya since 1935) was awarded to [[Arkady Mordvinov]], 1929 graduate in architecture known for his ultra-left public statements. Mordvinov proved himself a good project manager, successfully testing so-called ''flow method'' of fast-track construction. By 1941, most of central Gorky Street was completed; the rest was built out after [[World War II]].

[[File:Wiki St Nicholas u Tverskoy.jpg|thumb|Contemporary [[Old Believers]] murals near Belorussky Terminal&lt;ref&gt;St.Nicholas church of [[Rogozhskoye Cemetery|Rogozhskoye Old Believers]] was laid down shortly before [[World War I]] and was not properly completed and consecrated before the Revolution of 1917. All exterior and interior finished were made from scratch in the 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1970s, the street acquired [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]]-era boxlike buildings of 23-story [[Intourist]] Hotel (1970, demolished in 2002&lt;ref&gt;Russian: illustrated contractor's report on demolition [http://www.krealist.ru/showinfo.php?id=50 www.krealist.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;) and smaller Minsk Hotel (1964, demolished in 2005) and New Izvestia building; less controversial pseudo-stalinist infill buildings followed in the 1980s and late 1990s. However, outside Tverskaya, historical buildings and neighborhoods were being demolished throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Many blocks in the [[Novoslobodskaya]] station area are already rebuilt as post-2000 highrises. The City has declared plans to reconstruct Pushkin Square and Belorussky Terminal Square with mult-level underground tunnels, shopping space, and parking&lt;ref&gt;English: Pushkin Square Under Threat, The Moscow Times, 24.10.2006 [http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=149&amp;data_id=229&amp;do=view_single MAPS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515055542/http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=149&amp;data_id=229&amp;do=view_single |date=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but those plans were later abolished with mayor resignation.

Population of Tverskoy District is traditionally affluent and educated, with a substantial share of foreigners (most of them are not included in official population count). Its ethnic mix, changing rapidly since the 1980s, has high shares of [[Tatars]], [[Armenians]] and [[Jews]]; once-strong [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] community has dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: Ethnicity maps in: Вендина, Ольга (ред.)

'''Vid Morpurgo''' (1838&amp;ndash;1911) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist, publisher, politician and member of a notable [[Split, Croatia|Split]] family Morpurgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=K.|first=M.|coauthors=|title=Split - proslava 150. obljetnice knjižare 'Morpurgo'|pages=|publisher=www.culturenet.hr|date=2010-11-23|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=34323|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and family==
Morpurgo was born on 7 May 1838 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Croatia to a well-known [[Jews in Croatia|Jewish]] family of David-Elija and Anetta ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Gentili) Morpurgo. His great-great-grandfather David-Vita moved to Split in 1774 from [[Maribor]] ([[German language|Ger.]]: Marburg), [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Vid Morpurgo|pages=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.juditapalace.com/hr-hr/zanimljivosti/vid-morpurgo.aspx|accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose his surname ''Morpurgo'' from the Italian version of the German ''Marburger'' (i.e. someone from Marburg). From 1846 to 1849 Morpurgo attended and finished elementary school in Split. Later he attended the Royal grammar school in Split from which he graduated in 1856.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Duško Kečkemet|1963|pp=10, 21, 58, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tonkin|first=Boyd|coauthors=|title=Boyd Tonkin: The magnificent Morpurgos|pages=|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2010-08-20|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/boyd-tonkin-the-magnificent-morpurgos-2056968.html|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kuzmanić|first=Nepo|coauthors=|title=Obitelj Morpurgo, Židovi iz Marburga|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020517/feljton02.asp|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and business career==
[[File:Annuario Dalmatico.jpg|thumb|left|130px|"Annuario Dalmatico" (Dalmatian Yearly) from 1859. published by Morpurgo.]]
After completing his education, Morpurgo was employed at the library which was co-owned by his father and his business partner Petar Savo. There Morpurgo developed bookseller activity enabling him partnership with numerous foreign publishing houses. In 1855 he traveled to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] to sign contracts with booksellers and publishers. In 1860 Morpurgo founded his own bookstore "Libreria Morpurgo succ. Savo" by buying out Savo's shares. In 1861 he started the first [[interlibrary loan]] in Split. In 1862 bookstore was renamed to "Libreria Morpurgo". In 1859 Morpurgo published the ''Annuario Dalmatico'' (''Dalmatian Yearly'') and in 1861 he published the second volume which in contrast to the first volume discussed the political problems in the country. During 1861 out of ten political publications released in Split, five were published by Morpurgo. During that time he also published the variety of commemorative books and brochures.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pejković-Kačanski|first=Maja|coauthors=|title=Mala knjižara Vida Morpurga iz Splita slavi veliki, 150. rođendan|pages=|publisher=[[Večernji list]]|date=2010-11-19|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kultura/mala-knjizara-vida-morpurga-splita-slavi-veliki-150-rodendan-clanak-217836|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Vid Morpurgo|pages=|publisher=Palača Judita|date=|url=http://www.juditapalace.com/hr-hr/zanimljivosti/vid-morpurgo.aspx|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morpurgo's bookstore, from the very beginning of its activity, was the headquarters of the [[People's Party (Dalmatia)|People's Party]], where young intellectuals, inspired by the ideas of the ''Hrvatski narodni preporod'' (''Croatian national revival''), held their meetings. Morpurgo was an informal organizer and adviser of the People's Party. Morpurgo was involved in starting the independent Croatian weekly newspaper ''[[Narodni list]]'' (''People's paper''). He took upon himself the administration and management of the newspaper, and also wrote the articles, mainly against the mayor [[Antonio Bajamonti]] [[Autonomist Party]] policies. Morpurgo was often targeted by the Autonomist Party supporters who repeatedly physically attacked him in the street (in July 1867, July 1868 and during the summer 1870). In 1870 Morpurgo was elected representative of the People's Party in the [[Diet of Dalmatia]], assembly of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=B.|first=N.|coauthors=|title=Proslavljajući 150. godina knjižare Morpurgo, Split je Zagrebu opalio - pljusku!|pages=|publisher=Moderna vremena Info|date=2010-11-22|url=http://www.mvinfo.hr/najnovije-vijesti.php?ppar=4833|accessdate=2013-06-25|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, Morpurgo founded the first steam brick factory in Split. At home and abroad he was known for his alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo", largest [[Distillation|distillery]] in Dalmatia. In 1905 Morpurgo merged with [[Emil Stock]] to found the alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo, Stock e Comp." New company got the franchise to build the new liquor factory near Split (today part of Split). Factory concession was challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević due to environmental issues. Some attributed this problem to the political conflict (Mihaljević was member of the [[Party of Rights]]) between Morpurgo and municipal authorities. Due to the disappointment of failing to get the concession, Morpurgo and Stock built the factory in [[Rovinj]], Croatia.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;

Morpurgo was also the elected vice president of the "Split Trade Chamber" and later its president. In 1870 Morpurgo co-founded the ''Prva pučka dalmatinska banka'' (''First people's Dalmatian bank'') in order to help Dalmatian farmers regain material independence from the mostly autonomist (members of the Autonomist Party) landowners, small capitalists and usurers who were lending money to farmers and during elections forced them to vote for the Autonomist Party. The bank initially operated in the Morpurgo's bookstore, as he was the first vice-president and later a president.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hnp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Duško Kečkemet|1984|pp=87, 88, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Morpurgo bookstore.JPG|thumb|right|130px|Vid Morpurgo bookstore in Split, 2012.]]

==Death and legacy==
Morpurgo died on 31 January 1911 in Split. He was buried at the [[Marjan hill]] Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Novi Omanut (Prilog židovskoj povijesti i kulturi); Jadranka Brnčić; Napokon proučeni život i djelo Luciana Morpurga; stranica 3; broj 113, rujan – listopad 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many historians agree that Morpurgo's political ideas were aimed at the awakening of Croatian national consciousness, improving the economy of Dalmatia, education and cultural upliftment of its citizens. As a trader, bookseller, banker, publisher and columnist, Morpurgo dedicated his life to the People's Party goals.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;

'''Won Alexander Cumyow''' ({{zh|first=t|t=溫金有|s=温金有|p=Wēn Jīnyǒu|w=Wen Chin-yu}}) was an early Chinese Canadian public servant and community leader. Born 1861 March 17 or February 14 in [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]], [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] (at the north end of [[Harrison Lake]], at the start of the [[Douglas Road]] to [[Lillooet, British Columbia]] during the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]), Won Cumyow was the oldest son of Won Ling Sing, a [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]-speaking store and restaurant owner who had emigrated in 1858 from China to [[San Francisco]] and later to Port Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Shirley R.|title=Diversity and Multiculturalism: A Reader|publisher=Peter Lang "One of these, Won Alexander Cumyow, was born at Fort Harrison [Port Douglas] in 1861, the son of Hakka-speaking parents who had come from China."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Won Cumyow was the first person of Chinese descent known to have been born within the boundaries of present-day Canada ([[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] being a colony in 1861). He attended high school in [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]] and became a court interpreter (1888)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ccgwiki.vpl.ca/index.php/ccg_wiki/File:Cumyow-Directory2.jpg/ |title=Henderson's British Columbia Gazetteer and Directory |year=1890 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and labour contractor. He was an interpreter in the [[Vancouver]] police court from 1904 to 1936, speaking English, [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and also the [[Chinook Jargon]] which he had learned as a child at Port Douglas.  He studied law, even articled, but was not permitted a license because, being Chinese, he was denied the vote.

Cumyow voted for the first time in 1890 but provincial legislation in 1895-1896&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~canbc/vote1898/voteregs.htm |title=1898 Voter registration information}}&lt;/ref&gt; stripped Chinese (and Japanese and First Nations) voting rights in elections in BC (though his name still does appear on the [[British Columbia general election, 1898|1898 BC]] voters list).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~canbc/vote1898/votecr.htm |title=Won Cumyow &amp; brother Cumye on 1898 BC Voters' list}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voters' list in federal elections came from the provincial election's voters' list, and so the federal franchise was also blocked. The federal [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]] also known as the ''Chinese Exclusion Act'', was repealed after World War II on 1947 May 14, and he then voted again in the next [[Canadian federal election, 1949|federal election in 1949]] -- making him the only Chinese person to have voted both before and after the disenfranchisement. A photo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bcbooklook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Unknown-3.jpeg |title=1949 Photo of Cumyow voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; of him voting has been reprinted many times.&lt;!--- According to some accounts, he was also the ''first'' Chinese Canadian to vote in the 1949 federal election, but this is unlikely given the time-zone differences --&gt;

Active in the Vancouver's Chinese community, he was founder of the [[Chinese Empire Reform Association]] (an organization of overseas Chinese, active mostly between 1899 and 1911, made up of mostly the older, more prosperous Chinese merchants in Canada, and supporting the modernization of China through progressive reforms within the framework of a constitutional monarchy rather than by armed revolution), and a president of the [[Chinese Benevolent Association]]. Chinese merchants had formed the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]], with the first branch in Victoria in 1884 and the second one in [[Vancouver]] in 1895. The Association was mandatory&lt;ref&gt;All Chinese were asked to donate $2. If they did not, they would have to pay much more if they ever required the services of the association.&lt;/ref&gt; for all Chinese in the area to join, and it did everything from representing members in legal disputes to sending the remains of a member who died back to his or her ancestral homeland in [[China]].

Won Cumyow married Ye Eva Chan 1889 November 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/pop-up-Marriage_certificate_Won_Alexander_Cumyow.html |title=1889 Marriage certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Chinese Methodist missionary family had adopted her and brought her to Canada from [[Hong Kong]] in 1888. Together Won Cumyow and Ye Eva had ten children. Their third son, [[Gordon Won Cumyow]], took over the position of court interpreter and became the first Chinese notary public in Canada. Won Alexander Cumyow died on October 6, 1955, in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/pop-up-Obituary_Won_Alexander_Cumyow.html |title=Vancouver Sun obituary, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Žarko Zečević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|italic=yes|Жарко Зечевић}}, born 19 January 1950 in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]) is a Serbian retired basketball player, former football administrator, and current businessman. Known by his widely used nickname '''Zeka''', he is most notable as the controversial and all powerful general-secretary of [[FK Partizan]], a role he performed for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Press Online|author=STANIĆ, M.|title=Žarko Zečević: KUNEM SE, POVLAČIM SE!|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/sport/story/14005/%C5%BDarko+Ze%C4%8Devi%C4%87:+KUNEM+SE,+POVLA%C4%8CIM+SE!.html|language=Serbian|date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, he is employed at [[YugoRosGaz]], a subsidiary of [[Gazprom]].

Born to Slavko Zečević (former Police Minister and former [[FK Partizan]] managing board member) Žarko's entire sports career, both playing and administrative, is also tied to [[Partizan Belgrade|Partizan Sports Society]]. During the late 1960s and 1970s, he was a basketball player for [[KK Partizan]] and even managed 16 appearances in the Yugoslavia national basketball team jersey, though only in friendly preparation games and minor competitions - he never made the final cut for any of the major competitions (Eurobasket, World Championships, and the Olympics).

==Personal==
Žarko Zečević is married to Mira who used to work as marketing director at ''[[Politika]]'' daily newspaper during the 1990s. They have a son and a daughter.

Zečević's sister is married to Danko Đunić, former Partizan Sports Society president.
