[[File:AcrossTheWideMissouriBook.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Houghton Mifflin]])]]
'''''Across the Wide Missouri, With an Account of the Discovery of the Miller Collection'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Across the Wide Missouri|isbn= 0-395-92497-9|date=1947|author=DeVoto, Bernard|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Across_the_Wide_Missouri.html?id=VoZBbdPhEKIC |website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1947 book by American historian [[Bernard DeVoto]].  It is the second volume of a trilogy that includes ''The Year of Decision'' (1942) and ''The Course of Empire'' (1952).
==Description==
''Across the Wide Missouri'' is a history of the [[fur trade]] in the [[American West]], during its peak in the 1830s.  The trapping of [[American Beaver|beaver]] and other animals caused conflicts between the trappers and the various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the Upper [[Missouri River]] Basin.
==Reception==
The book was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1948 |title=1948 Pulitzer Prizes |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adapted as [[Across the Wide Missouri (film)|an eponymous 1951 film]] starring [[Clark Gable]].

'''''Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Filippino Lippi]], completed around 1485–1487.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Eliot W., and Marilyn Bradshaw. "Lippi family." Grove Art Online. January 01, 2003. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Badia Fiorentina]], a church in [[Florence]].

The picture was commissioned for the chapel of Francesco del Pugliese by the latter's son Piero, who is portrayed in the lower right corner in the traditional praying posture of the [[donor portrait]].

It is one of the most admired Lippi's works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 Page at artonline.it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001102/http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its powerful, Flemish-inspired chromatism and attention to details, which contribute in turning the mystical apparition of the Virgin to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] into an everyday life scene. The composition is set in a rocky landscape in which the saint, while writing on his [[lectern]], is suddenly visited by the Virgin. Behind Bernard's shoulders is depicted the demon biting his chains: this is a reference to a medieval hymn celebrating the Virgin as the liberator of humanity from the chains of their sins.

A scroll on a rock contains a verse by the 3rd century AD [[Stoicism|stoic]] writer [[Epictetus]]: ''Sustine et abstine'' ("Carry on and abstain"), a hint to Bernard's teachings.

Some scholars have identified in the faces of the Virgin and the angels on the left the portraits of the donor's wife and sons

[[File:Arnost Muka 1896 Hoeffert.png|thumb|Arnošt Muka (1896)]]

'''Arnošt Muka''' (10 March 1854 – 10 October 1932) was a [[Germany|German]] and [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] writer, linguist and man of science.

Muka was born in Großhänchen which is now in the municipality of [[Burkau]], and studied theology, classical languages and Slavonic in [[Leipzig]]. Because of his activities in connection with the [[Sorbian languages]], he was sent to teach in a [[gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] in [[Chemnitz]] in 1883, and later to [[Freiberg]]. In 1917, he moved back to [[Bautzen]], where he died on 10 October 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Weder Preis noch Ehr | work =Der sorbische Gelehrte Ernst Mucke (1854 - 1932) | publisher =National-museum der Sorben | date =2004 | url =http://www.museum.sorben.com/muka/mukadt.htm | accessdate =25 April 2014 | language =German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19947">An '''Assistant Language Teacher''' ('''ALT''') is a foreign national serving as an [[assistant teacher]] ([[paraprofessional educator]]) in a Japanese classroom, particularly for English.

The term was created by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] at the time of the creation of the [[JET Programme]] as a translation of the term 外国語指導助手 (''gaikokugo shidō joshu'') or literally "foreign language instruction assistant". The terms '''AET''' (Assistant English Teacher), '''ELT''' (English Language Teacher) and '''NESA''' (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education ('''BOE'''s) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to [[English language]] speakers who assist with [[Teaching English as a foreign language|teaching of English]] in [[primary school|elementary]], [[middle school|junior high]] and [[secondary school|senior high school]]s. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.

ALTs are required to be [[university]] graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues.

==Being an ALT==

===Requirements===

The JET Programme set the general prerequisites imposed by [[Immigration to Japan|Japanese immigration]] ([[bachelor's degree]], [[health]], [[nationality]]) and the characteristics that can be considered to be sought by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], [[board of education|boards of education]] (BOEs), and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |title=Teach English in Japan |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction |date=December 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207232329/http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ALTs from private language teaching companies, further requirements may include items such as [[Teaching English as a foreign language|TEFL]] [[certification]], [[Japanese language]] ability (at least spoken) at a communicative level, teaching experience (both within Japan and in other countries) and other specialized skills ([[foreign language]]s other than English, IT, etc.)  However, as a basic rule, the standards that are expected of JET Programme are still considered as norms among private language teaching companies that provide ALTs to BOEs, although agreements between BOEs and private companies often allow for a relaxing on some of these rules.

===Recruitment===
At one time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as "dispatch companies", either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area.  ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.

ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.

===Payment===

The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time [[Eikaiwa]] teacher and far less than a teacher from the [[JET Programme]] (¥3.36 to ¥3.96 million depending on year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jetprogramusa.org/contract-benefits/ |title=Contract Information |year=2016 |website=[[JET Programme|JET Program]] USA |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with some of the lowest salaries around ¥180,000 per month (¥2.16 million annually)
The Interac company ALTs/ dispatch staff make approximately ¥3600 (US $32) per hour, BUT, the ALT receives approximately half of that amount ¥1800( US$16 ) per hour before tax. Interac deducts approximately half of the monthly earnings with its justification being that it trains ALTs and incurs other administrative costs.In reality most Interac ALT's receive 5days of actual training before being dispatched to teach at schools. It is therefore a lucrative business for such companies, minimal initial investment, but constant monthly cashflow from the 3000+ active ALTs at Interac in Japan alone.If requested to attend 3 monthly briefing meetings,  the pay is ¥900 per hour( US $7.00).In Japan almost every business which employs a person for 30 hours(or more ), has to pay for the employees monthly health insurance.  Interac dodges having to pay health insurance for workers claiming to the government that its employees work only 29.5 hours per week instead of 30 hours. But in REALITY, employees are actually stuck at a school site or at a desk for 40hours(or more) per week {cn|date=October 16th 2018}}. Benefits and workload also vary.Elementary school ALTs are the most exhausted because they require extra 'Genki' energy to engage students and recently focus has changed with new MEXT ideologies as of March 2018 .  JHS and Highschool are less energy consuming but focus more on grammar and practical use of  English . Some companies pay their ALTs between semesters and some do not. Some provide benefits, such as access to employer subsidized health insurance, paid holidays, paid vacation/sick leave and unemployment insurance, and some do not.

===Job duties===
An ALT's primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks.Regarding Elemenary school,  the term ALT is often misleading, in many instances the ALT will solely be responsible for total lesson planning( for the academic year and delivering the lessons). This is mostly the case with Elementary schools outside of the Kanto region. During such lessons, Japanese teachers often act as a support teacher or translator.In those instances the term "Assistant" Language Teacher becomes unsuitable, as the ALT is not "assisting" but actually "leading and facilitating" the entire english class.   However in Junior Highschool and Highschool, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions|url=https://jetprogramusa.org/positions/|website=JET Program USA|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45–50 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (''bukatsudō''), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students' planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.

ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students.  They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.

ALTs may be required to read aloud stories about [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] and the lingering deaths of Japanese children to their classes, which omit any mention of [[World War II]] or the Japanese government's [[Japanese war crimes|conduct during the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[New Horizon (textbook)|New Horizon]] 3|chapter=A Mother's Lullaby|page=36|publisher=Tokyo Shoseki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://akitajet.com/wiki/A_Mother's_Lullaby| title=A Mother's Lullaby| publisher=Akita JET| accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the private ALT system in Japan==
In 1999, Dispatch Law (労働者派遣) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.

The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country.  There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.

===Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs===

*'''Application:''' The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.
*'''Compensation:''' As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between ¥3.36 and ¥3.96 million annually depending on their year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary" /&gt;. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as ¥2.2 million per annum{{cn|date=April 2018}}.
*'''Support:''' The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.
*'''Workload:''' The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.
*'''External Work:''' JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.
*'''Contractual Term Limits''': JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.

The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.

==Union Activity and ALTs==

===Education law===

Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal ''gyomu itaku'' (service contracts). According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, these contracts violate Japan's General Education Law since the principal must be in charge of all staff at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.150m.com/ |title=Gyomu Itaku Contracts are Illegal |date=February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alt.150m.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with these contracts, the company is actually in charge - not the principal.

The licensed Japanese teacher is normally in charge of junior high school and high school classes regardless of where the ALT originates; however in the case of elementary school classes, the ALT is normally responsible for the entire class, with the Japanese teacher either providing limited input or in some cases not being present in the classroom, and for that reason the continuity of school management is sometimes maintained with the school principal in compliance with any legal requirements, as the product being contracted itself is an abstract, education, and the contract basis for private language teaching corporations is to provide education and educational services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===29.5 hours per week===

It is common for ALTs to be recruited with job contracts with private language companies such as [[W5 (company)|W5]], [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], [[Borderlink]] and [[WING (company)|WING]] which stipulates ALT working hours as being 29.5 hours per week. In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or [[Social welfare in Japan|Shakai hoken]]. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, companies consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20080105f1.html|author=Kanako Takahara|title=Assistant language teachers in trying times|publisher=The Japan Times Online|date=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken. Furthermore, no company would ever be prohibited from enrolling their employees in the Social Insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacunion.org/to-interac-info-on-health-insurance/|title=To Interac: Info on Health Insurance|publisher=Nambu Foreign Workers Caucus|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some AETs dispatched to the City of [[Nagoya]] have a 35-hour work week and are not enrolled in Shakai Hoken, receive no paid sick leave, no paid holidays, no paid vacation leave, and are not enrolled in unemployment insurance. They are only paid for days worked and receive no pay between semesters except for a few training sessions.

===Kanagawa Board of Education===

In 2006, ALTs in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] who were previously hired directly as part-time workers rejected the privatization of their jobs to [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], a nationwide language services dispatch company, and took the Kanagawa Prefecture Board of Education to the Labour Relations Board where the case is still on-going.

As in many cases, the likely cause of the dissolution of the direct-hire situation draws back to Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] who took a hard-line stance on privatization (e.g. Japan Post) and the idea of allowing local governments more flexibility in deciding how to spend their budgets.

===Other local Boards of Education===

The General Workers Union has been involved with several boards of education in the Kanto area including the Tokyo Board of Education, the Koga Board of Education (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and the Fukaya Board of Education (in [[Saitama Prefecture]]). In the case versus the Tokyo Board of Education, the General Workers Union won a decision stating that the directly hired ALTs were indeed legally classified as "workers" (''rodosha'') and not simply contractors. Further victories were achieved through the private companies that had contracts with the Koga and Fukaya boards of education.

'''Atri''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀδρία}} or {{lang|grc|Ἀτρία}}; [[Latin]]: '''Adria''', '''Atria''', '''Hadria''', or '''Hatria''') is a ''[[comune]]'' in the [[Province of Teramo]] in the [[Abruzzo]] region of [[Italy]].  Atri is the setting of the poem ''[[Tales of a Wayside Inn|The Bell of Atri]]'' by American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. Its name is the origin of the name of the Emperor [[Hadrian]].

==History==
Ancient Adria was a city of [[Picenum]], situated about {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} from the [[Adriatic Sea]], between the rivers Vomanus (modern [[Vomano]]) and Matrinus (modern [[Piomba]]). According to the [[Antonine Itinerary]], it was distant 15 Roman miles from [[Castrum Novum]] (modern [[Giulianova]]) and 14 from Teate (modern [[Chieti]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites Itin. Ant. pp.&amp;nbsp;308, 310, 313; comp. [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Tab. Peut.]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been supposed, with much probability, to be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] origin, and a colony from the more celebrated city of the name, now [[Adria]] in the [[Veneto]] region,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites Mazocchi, Tab. Heracl. p. 532; Müiller, ''Etrusker'', vol. i. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; though there is no historical evidence of the fact. 

The city was founded by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s&lt;ref&gt;In An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis by Mogens Herman,{{ISBN|0-19-814099-1}},2004,Page 323,"... the face of the advancing Gauls. According to Strabo 8.6.16, Aiginetans founded a colony ''en ombrikois'', probably archaeologically attested in Adria (no. 75).&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Aegina]] and reestablished&lt;ref&gt;In An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis by Mogens Herman,{{ISBN|0-19-814099-1}},2004,page 325,In C4f Adria was, apparently, refounded by Dionysios I (Theopomp. fr. 128; Tzetzes ad Lycophr. 631; Etym. Magn. 1854-57). According to Just. Epit. ..."&lt;/ref&gt; by Dionysius&lt;ref&gt;In An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis by Mogens Herman,{{ISBN|0-19-814099-1}},2004,Page 228,"Dionysios I founded Adranon (no. 6) (Diod. 14.37.5 (r399), probably Adria (no. 75), possibly Ankon (no. 76), certainly Issa (no. 81); cf. Stylianou (1998) ad 13.4-5 at p. 196, Lissos no. ..."&lt;/ref&gt; I the tyrant of Syracuse in the 4th century BC.

The first certain historical notice of Adria is the establishment of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony there about 282 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites [[Livy]] ''Epit.'' xi.; Madvig, ''de Coloniis'', p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the [[Second Punic War]] (217 BCE) its territory was ravaged by [[Hannibal]]; but notwithstanding this calamity, it was one of the 18 Latin colonies which, in 209 BCE, were faithful to the cause of Rome, and willing to continue their contributions both of men and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites Livy xxii. 9, xxvii. 10; [[Polybius]] iii. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later period, according to the ''[[Liber de Coloniis]]'', it must have received a fresh colony, probably under [[Augustus]]: hence it is termed a ''Colonia'', both by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and in inscriptions. One of these gives it the titles of '''Colonia Aelia Hadria''', whence it would appear that it had been re-established by the emperor [[Hadrian]], whose family was originally derived from hence. Hadrian was a native of [[Italica]] in Spain, a colony of ''Italian'' settlers in [[Hispania Baetica]] and his family was the [[Aelia (gens)|gens Aelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites Lib. Colon. p. 227; Plin. ''H. N.'' iii. 13. s. 18; Orell. ''Inscr.'' no. 148, 3018; Gruter, p. 1022; [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]], ''De Coloniis'' p. 349; Spartian. Hadrian. 1.; Victor, ''Epit.'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of Adria (ager Adrianus), though subsequently included in Picenum, appears to have originally formed a separate and independent district, bounded on the north by the river Vomanus (Vomano), and on the south by the Matrinus (la Piomba); at the mouth of this latter river was a town bearing the name of [[Matrinum]], which served as the port of Adria; the city itself stood on a hill a few miles inland, on the same site still occupied by the modern Atri, a place of some consideration, with the title of a city, and the [[episcopal see|see of a bishop]]. Great part of the circuit of the ancient walls may be still traced, and mosaic pavements and other remains of buildings are also preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites [[Strabo]] v. p. 241; [[Silius Italicus]] viii. 439; [[Ptolemy]] iii. 1. § 52; [[Mela]], ii. 4; Romanelli, vol. iii. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites  Romanelli, vol. iii. pp.&amp;nbsp;308, 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Adria (which may have been the original terminus of the [[Via Caecilia]]), was the point of junction of the [[Via Salaria]] and [[Via Valeria]], a circumstance which probably contributed to its importance and flourishing condition under the [[Roman Empire]].

After the fall of Rome, the region was subjected, along with most of northern and central Italy, to a long period of violent conflict.  Ultimately, in the 6th century, the [[Lombards]] succeeded in establishing hegemony over the area, and Atri and other parts of Abruzzo found themselves annexed to the [[Duchy of Spoleto]].  The Lombards were displaced by the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]], whose noble [[House of Acquaviva]] family ruled the town for decades from about 1393,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=877}} before merging their lands into the [[Kingdom of Naples]], but remaining dominant in the city as Dukes of Atri until the 19th century.  The rule of the Acquaivivas marked the highpoint of Atri's greatest power and splendor.

==Ancient coinage==
It is now generally admitted that the coins of Adria (with the legend "HAT.") belong to the city of Picenum, not that of the Veneto; but great difference of opinion has been entertained as to their age. They belong to the class commonly known as [[aes grave]], and are even among the heaviest specimens known, exceeding in weight the most ancient Roman aeses. On this account they have been assigned to a very remote antiquity, some referring them to the Etruscan, others to the Greek, settlers. But there seems much reason to believe that they are not really so ancient, and belong, in fact, to the Roman colony, which was founded previous to the general reduction of the Italian brass coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|smith|1854|p=8}} cites [[Eckhel]], vol. i. p. 98; Müller, ''Etrusker'', vol. i. p. 308; Böckh, ''Metrologie'', p. 379; [[Mommsen]], ''Das Römische Münzwesen'', p. 231; [[James Millingen]], ''Numismatique de l'Italie'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Some historians say that the city was founded by the Illyrians in the eleventh century BCE. They think that the city Atri was named after the Illyrian god Hatranus (Hatrani). The ancient name has been also described as the source from which the Adriatic Sea derived its name. Others maintain that the sea was named for [[Adria]], an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city in [[Veneto]] region.

*[[Atri Cathedral|''Duomo'']] or ''Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta'': This 13th century church was built on the remains of an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] structure. The cathedral incorporates a {{convert|56|m|ft|adj=on}} high campanile, or bell tower, and a cloister. It houses a fresco cycle by the 15th-century Abruzzi painter [[Andrea de Litio]] (or Delitio). The Diocesian museum is located adjacent to cathedral. The crypt was originally a large Roman cistern; another forms the foundation of the ducal palace; and in the eastern portion of the town there is a complicated system of underground passages for collecting and storing water.
*''Palazzo Ducale of Atri'': Palace of the Duke of Acquaviva, built on the highest point in the city. The Palazzo now houses offices of both the municipal and provincial (Teramo) governments.

==Villa Comunale dei Cappuccini ==

The municipal park of Atri is a green area of about {{convert|3|ha|acre|0}} close to the historic center. It was built on areas owned by the Duke and the canons of the cathedral, realized by Paul Odescalchi, bishop of Atri. It comprises artificial terraces (made before  World War II) for about three hectares, in a pleasantly arid area.

The boulevards of the villa are about {{convert|600|m|ft}} long. The remaining viability inside of the park is closed to traffic, and it mainly comprises paths.

There are aso caves, probably once used as stables by the Capuchin friars. Their origin, however, is expected to be much older, and, although there is now no connection to the historic center, it is probable that they were used to escape during pirate raids.

Close to the lookout over the sea and all of the valleys of the Terre del Cerrano (from Roseto degli Abruzzi up to Silvi Marina), there is a  liberty-styled fountain, considered the emblem of the Villa Comunale. 

The eastern side of the Belvedere is erected over large walls, the ruins of an ancient fortress, once the summer palace of the local bishops.

Another symbol of the villa, renovated in the 1930s in an Italian garden, is the ''formaggione'' (the big cheese), a cylindrically shaped hedge, comprising conifers, with four entrances (located at the cardinal points). It represents the Garden of Secrets, a recurring element in many gardens of the castles and the noble villas of Italy, especially between the late 18th- early 19th century  century.

'''Base station''' (or '''base radio station''') is – according to the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s (ITU) [[ITU Radio Regulations|Radio Regulations]] (RR)&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.71, definition: "base station / base radio station"&lt;/ref&gt; – a "[[land station]] in the [[land mobile service]]."

The term is used in the context of [[mobile telephony]], [[wireless computer networking]] and other [[wireless communications]] and in [[land surveying]]. In surveying, it is a [[GPS receiver]] at a known position, while in wireless communications it is a [[transceiver]] connecting a number of other devices to one another and/or to a wider area.
In mobile telephony, it provides the connection between [[mobile phone]]s and the wider [[telephone network]]. In a [[computer network]], it is a transceiver acting as a [[switch (computing)|switch]] for [[computer]]s in the network, possibly connecting them to a/another [[local area network]] and/or the [[Internet]]. In traditional wireless communications, it can refer to the hub of a [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] fleet such as a [[taxi]] or [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] fleet, the base of a [[TETRA]] network as used by [[government]] and [[emergency services]] or a [[Citizen’s band radio|CB]] [[radio shack|shack]].

== Land surveying ==

In the context of external land surveying, a base station is a [[GPS]] receiver at an accurately-known fixed location which is used to derive correction information for nearby portable GPS receivers.  This correction data allows [[radio propagation|propagation]] and other effects to be corrected out of the position data obtained by the mobile stations, which gives greatly increased location precision and accuracy over the results obtained by uncorrected GPS receivers.

== Computer networking ==

{{see also|Wireless access point}}
In the area of wireless computer networking, a base station is a radio receiver/transmitter that serves as the hub of the local wireless network, and may also be the gateway between a wired network and the wireless network. It typically consists of a low-power transmitter and [[wireless router]].

== Wireless communications ==

In radio communications, a base station is a wireless communications station installed at a fixed location and used to communicate as part of one of the following:

* a [[Push to talk|push-to-talk]] [[two-way radio]] system, or;
* a [[Radiotelephone|wireless telephone]] system such as [[Mobile phone|cellular]] [[CDMA]] or [[GSM]] [[cell site]].
* [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio]]

=== Two-way radio ===

==== Professional ====

In professional two-way radio systems, a base station is used to maintain contact with a [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] fleet of [[Walkie talkie|hand-held]] or [[Mobile radio|mobile]] radios, and/or to activate one-way paging receivers. The base station is one end of a communications link. The other end is a movable vehicle-mounted radio or walkie-talkie.&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Regional Alternatives: Systems Design Considerations," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of base station uses in two-way radio include the dispatch of [[tow truck]]s and [[taxicab]]s.

[[File:Base station 2 channel block diagram.svg|left|thumb|500px|Basic base station elements used in a remote-controlled installation. [[Selective calling]] options such as CTCSS are optional.]]Professional base station radios are often one channel. In lightly used base stations, a multi-channel unit may be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Block diagram is from: "Figure 2: Two Channel VHF Base Station," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In heavily used systems, the capability for additional channels, where needed, is accomplished by installing an additional base station for each channel. Each base station appears as a single channel on the dispatch center control console. In a properly designed dispatch center with several staff members, this allows each dispatcher to communicate simultaneously, independently of one another, on a different channel as necessary. For example, a taxi company dispatch center may have one base station on a high-rise building in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and another on a different channel in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. Each taxi dispatcher could communicate with taxis in either Boston or Providence by selecting the respective base station on his or her console.&lt;ref&gt;Base stations in land mobile systems are often located at remote sites such as hilltops or water towers. Some are controlled from two or more locations. For example, a base station used to communicate with taxis may be connected to remote control consoles at both a taxi company office and an answering service for after-hours calls. The taxi company and answering service may be miles apart. Single channel base stations reduce confusion by eliminating the possibility that the wrong channel may be selected.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dispatching centers it is common for eight or more radio base stations to be connected to a single dispatching console. Dispatching personnel can tell which channel a message is being received on by a combination of local protocol, unit identifiers, volume settings, and busy indicator lights. A typical console has two speakers identified as ''select'' and ''unselect''. Audio from a primary selected channel is routed to the select speaker and to a headset. Each channel has a busy light which flashes when someone talks on the associated channel.&lt;ref&gt;To read more about multi-channel consoles, look at the service manual for a relatively simple console: ''8-Channel Remote Console, 120, 220, 240 V AC or 12 V DC T16167 AM or BM'', 68-81021E80, (Schaumburg, Illinois: Motorola, Inc. 1980.) This is a relatively simple analog console compared to large, enterprise-level Centracom-series units.&lt;/ref&gt;

Base stations can be local controlled or remote controlled. Local controlled base stations are operated by front panel controls on the base station cabinet. Remote control base stations can be operated over tone- or [[4-20 mA#Two-way radio use|DC-remote]] circuits. The dispatch point console and remote base station are connected by leased private line telephone circuits, (sometimes called ''RTO circuit''s), a [[Digital Signal 1|DS-1]], or radio links.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''RTO circuit'' is legacy jargon and comes from Bell System billing terminology. RTO circuits refer to analog radio remote control and radio broadcast leased telephone circuits.&lt;/ref&gt; The consoles multiplex transmit commands onto remote control circuits. Some system configurations require duplex, or four wire, audio paths from the base station to the console. Others require only a two-wire or half duplex link.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief discussion of remote controlled base stations, see: "Evaluating Regional Alternatives: Systems Design Considerations," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 39–41. Tone remote controls are described in this section.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Base station antenna network.svg|right|thumb|230px|The diagram shows a [[band-pass filter]] used to reduce the base station [[Receiver (radio)|receiver's]] exposure to unwanted signals. It also reduces the transmission of undesired signals. The [[Circulator|isolator]] is a one-way device which reduces the ease of signals from nearby transmitters going up the antenna line and into the base station [[transmitter]]. This prevents the unwanted mixing of signals inside the base station transmitter which can generate interference.]] Interference could be defined as receiving any signal other than from a radio in your own system. To avoid interference from users on the same channel, or interference from nearby strong signals on another channel, professional base stations use a combination of:&lt;ref&gt;Block diagram is from: "Figure 8: Bandpass Cavity/Isolator Location," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulleted items condensed from, "EMS Communications," "System Coordination," and "Site Engineering," in ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Local/Regional Level Planning Guide'', (Washington, D.C.: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US Department of Transportation, 1995) pp. 10–19, 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt;
* minimum receiver specifications and filtering.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of receiver specifications, see, "Table 9-3," ''800 MHz Trunked Radio Request for Proposals: Public Safety Projects Office,'' (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, 2000, pp. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of types of filtering used to prevent interference between equipment at the same site is included in "6.2.4 Electromagnetic Compatibility Studies," ''800 MHz Trunked Radio Request for Proposals: Public Safety Projects Office,'' (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, 2000, pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More detail of interference reduction equipment is provided in, "9.1.2 Base Station/Mobile Relay, 800 MHz," ''800 MHz Trunked Radio Request for Proposals: Public Safety Projects Office,'' (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, 2000, pp. 165–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* analysis of other frequencies in use nearby.
* in the US, coordination of shared frequencies by coordinating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, US federal government systems are coordinated and licensed by the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]. [[Business band|Business/Industrial Pool]] licenses are coordinated by the Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA) and licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;
* locating equipment so that terrain blocks interfering signals.
* use of directional antennas to reduce unwanted signals.

Base stations are sometimes called ''control'' or ''fixed'' stations in US [[Federal Communications Commission]] licensing. These terms are defined in regulations inside Part 90 of the commissions regulations. In US licensing jargon, types of base stations include:
* A '''fixed''' station is a base station used in a system intended only to communicate with other base stations. A ''fixed'' station can also be radio link used to operate a distant base station by remote control. (No mobile or hand-held radios are involved in the system.)
* A '''control''' station is a base station used in a system with a repeater where the base station is used to communicate through the repeater.
* A '''temporary base''' is a base station used in one location for less than a year.
* A '''[[Radio repeater|repeater]]''' is a type of base station that extends the range of hand-held and mobile radios.

==== Amateur and hobbyist use ====

In [[amateur radio]], a base station also communicates with [[mobile rig]]s but for hobby or family communications. Amateur systems sometimes serve as dispatch radio systems during disasters, search and rescue mobilizations, or other emergencies.

An [[Australia]]n [[UHF CB]] base station is another example of part of a system used for hobby or family communications.

=== Wireless telephone ===

[[Radiotelephone|Wireless telephone]] differ from two-way radios in that:

* wireless telephones are circuit switched: the communications paths are set up by dialing at the start of a call and the path remains in place until one of the callers hangs up.
* wireless telephones communicate with other telephones usually over the [[public switched telephone network]].

A wireless telephone base station communicates with a mobile or hand-held phone. For example, in a wireless telephone system, the signals from one or more mobile telephones in an area are received at a nearby base station, which then connects the call to the land-line network. Other equipment is involved depending on the system architecture. Mobile telephone provider networks, such as European GSM networks, may involve [[multiplexing|carrier]], [[microwave radio]], and [[Telephone exchange|switching facilities]] to connect the call. In the case of a portable phone such as a US cordless phone, the connection is directly connected to a wired land line.

=== Emissions issues ===
[[File:GaffneySC-CellTower.jpg|thumb|A cell tower near Thicketty, South Carolina.]]
While low levels of radio-frequency power are usually considered to have negligible effects on health, national and local regulations restrict the design of base stations to limit exposure to [[electromagnetic field]]s. Technical measures to limit exposure include restricting the radio frequency power emitted by the station, elevating the antenna above ground level, changes to the [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] pattern, and barriers to foot or road traffic.  For typical base stations, significant electromagnetic energy is only emitted at the antenna, not along the length of the antenna tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Warren PM|title=IEEE C95.1-2005 "IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz" Sources: US Department of Health; The World Health Organization|editor= |publisher=IEEE |location= |year=2006|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because mobile phones and their base stations are two-way radios, they produce radio-frequency ([[Radio frequency|RF]]) radiation in order to communicate, exposing people near them to [[RF radiation]] giving concerns about [[mobile phone radiation and health]]. Hand-held mobile telephones are relatively low power so the RF radiation exposures from them are generally low.

The [[World Health Organization]] has concluded that "there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs304/en/ |title=Electromagnetic fields and public health: Base stations and wireless technologies |work=World Health Organisation |accessdate=2014-09-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus of the scientific community is that the power from these mobile phone base station antennas is too low to produce health hazards as long as people are kept away from direct access to the antennas. However, current international exposure guidelines ([[ICNIRP]]) are based largely on the ''thermal'' effects of base station emissions, NOT considering the [[Non-thermal microwave effect|''non-thermal'' effects]] harmless.

=== Emergency power===
[[Fuel cell]] [[backup power]] systems are added to critical base stations or [[cell site]]s to provide emergency power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 Ballard fuel cells to power telecom backup power units for motorola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172302/http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantech.com/news/3674/india-telecom-get-fuel-cells India telecoms to get fuel cell power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126130543/http://cleantech.com/news/3674/india-telecom-get-fuel-cells |date=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bejucal''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site in the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]]. It is located {{convert|7|km|mi}} northeast of [[El Zotz]] and was subservient to that city.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al 2007, p.415. Houston, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is thought to date to the second half of the 4th century AD, in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Fialko 2000, p.558.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The site is located within the San Miguel La Palotada [[biotope]] in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[San José, El Petén|San José]] in the department of Petén in northern Guatemala. The biotope is a part of the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] that is bordered on the east by the [[Tikal|Tikal National Park]] and surrounded on all other sides by designated multiple-use zones of the Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte 2006, pp.949-951.&lt;/ref&gt; Bejucal is situated {{convert|20|km|mi}} west of the ruins of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Culbert 1991, 1996, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bejucal was the original capital of the royal dynasty that later ruled El Zotz, apparently transferring their capital to that city.&lt;ref&gt;Houston p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teotihuacan]]-linked general [[Siyaj K'ak']] ("Fire is Born") conquered Bejucal in the 4th century, together with many other sites in [[Petén Basin|Petén]], including the great city of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli &amp; Foley 2004, p.843.&lt;/ref&gt;
A text at the site mentions Siyaj K'ak' as overlord of Bejucal in AD 381.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes et al 2006, p.984.&lt;/ref&gt; [[stele|Stela]] 1 from Bejucal also indicates that Siyaj K'ak' was overlord of nearby El Zotz.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, p.8. Houston et al 2007, p.416.&lt;/ref&gt; From around this time the kings of Bejucal began to refer to themselves as vassals of Tikal, their giant neighbour, using the ''y [[ajaw]]'' phrase meaning subordinate lord.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, pp.200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions at Bejucal all fit within a very short 40-year span in the second half of the 4th century, ending about AD 396. The abrupt cessation of inscriptions at Bejucal is possibly the result of the expansion of the Tikal polity.&lt;ref&gt;Culbert 1991, 1996, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s [[Ian Graham]] visited Bejucal and recorded two [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and a sculpted altar.&lt;ref&gt;Houston p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018''' ({{USBill|115|hr|7059}}) is a [[United States Congress]] [[Bill (law)|bill]] to fund President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Border wall and illegal immigration|border wall]] along the [[Mexico–United States border]] and to follow federal immigration law. Estimated at $23.4 billion, the bill, along with the $1.6 billion from the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]], would amount to the $25 billion projected to complete the larger and fortified wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fredericks|first1=Bob|title=Trump says he wants another $1.6 billion for border wall|url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/26/trump-says-he-wants-another-1-6-billion-for-border-wall/|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=New York Post|date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced on October 12, 2018 by [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], who stated that "President Trump’s [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] was a wakeup call to Washington. The American people want us to build the wall and enforce the law. Maintaining strong borders is one of the basic responsibilities of any nation. For too long, America has failed in this responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Andrew|title=McCarthy introducing bill to fully fund Trump border wall|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-to-introduce-bill-to-fully-fund-trumps-border-wall|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=Fox News|date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segers|first1=Grace|title=Kevin McCarthy says he will introduce bill to fully fund border wall|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-introducing-bill-to-fully-fund-border-wall/|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bustan Birke''' or '''Boustan el Birke''' is a [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site of the [[Qaraoun culture]] that is located {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} southeast of [[Kefraya]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=444–446|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was found in a [[vineyard]] by [[Lorraine Copeland]] and Frank Skeels in 1966. Heavy Neolithic materials recovered resembled those from Kefraya with an increased proportion of lighter tools. Large flakes, picks, large scrapers and choppers made on discoid cores were found, most frequently in [[chert]]-like flint or silicious grey limestone. Other forms found included a [[grattoir de côté]] and a nose-scraper typical of the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

Another tell was found to the northwest of the site, opposing the road to the village but had been destroyed by the building of a villa so that only [[Roman empire|Roman]] material could be found among the debris.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The government has changed from a monarchy to a democracy by order of a king who had ascended to the throne by succession. While the people have now attained the right to vote, the only candidates are the king’s twenty-four sons, who will each serve for terms lasting two years. In the successive reign of each brother, oppression and injustice abound, and they spend their terms feasting, pillaging and plundering the country as much as possible, lining their pockets with enough cash to live out their days in luxury. Each time heading up to the new election, the people take refuge in their wishful thinking that the administration of the “next” prince will make things better. But things never change. The princes had all inherited their grandfather’s first name, “Demo” as a prefix to their names. The king had named his twenty-fifth son who was lacking in both appearance, intelligence and character, Demo C’est Assez (meaning Demo “is enough”) but this last prince became known among the people instead as Demo Crazy because of his devious mind and volatile behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphmedia.org/%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%87-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C/|title= دموکراسی یا دموقراضه |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tnews.ir/news/3e1758467226.html|title= ممول حاکم غربستان خیالی - کتاب نیوز |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghatreh.com/news/nn30511686/%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1|title= کتاب صوتی «دموکراسی یا دموقراضه» منتشر شد |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to deny any of the twenty-four brothers a second chance at the throne, the people finally decide to vote for prince number twenty-five, Demo Crazy, who is in no way considered qualified for the position. The people actually do not believe that he will win, but they vote for him because they believe that he will most likely be the least brutal, and less of a tyrant than any of the other brothers. Demo Crazy forms a circle of cohorts and enacts his own Demo Crazian principles which consist of a combination of oppression and deception of the masses. He embarks upon a mission to destroy the country, playing off his actions as a “service” to the people. As it turns out, he is really in fact an enemy agent, who after ultimately fleeing his own country and ta king refuge in enemy lands, surrenders his nation to them. The behavior and documented speeches of Demo Crazy are truly astonishing, and even more unusual are the laws and regulations he exercised in ruling over his country. The question of whether or not the standard and conventional democracy in the world today is predicated upon the principles and methods that Demo Crazy carried out in this book is presented only as food for thought and not as a steadfast claim. The answer to this question will be left for the reader to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Crazy-Seyed-Mehdi-Shojaei/dp/9642667800|title= Democracy or Demo Crazy by Seyed Mehdi Shojaee|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=English|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27025426-democracy-or-demo-crazy|title= Democracy or Demo Crazy by Seyed Mehdi Shojaee|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=English|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15418686|title= دموکراسی یا دموقراضه by سید مهدی شجاعی |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the site of a 13th-century [[qubba|Muslim shrine]] and a [[necropolis]] from the late [[History of ancient Lebanon#Rome|Roman Imperial]] period that is currently undergoing archaeological investigation.&lt;ref name=germs&gt;{{citation |contribution=Late Antique Necropolis in Baalbek Douris (Lebanon) |contribution-url=https://new.dainst.org/projekt/-/project-display/155744?p_r_p_1690909578_redirectURL=%2Fen%2Fdfg-projekte%2F-%2Fasset_publisher%2FyHwDA2RQ0Bml%2Fproject%2Fid%2F155745%3Bjsessionid%3D45E3DC9F8037C79DF464D1962457EAD8%3F_101_INSTANCE_yHwDA2RQ0Bml_redirectURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnew.dainst.org%252Fes%252Fdfg-projekte%253Bjsessionid%253D7310FE488ED946C122F3ED393C801971%253Fp_p_id%253D101_INSTANCE_yHwDA2RQ0Bml%2526p_p_lifecycle%253D0%2526p_p_state%253Dnormal%2526p_p_mode%253Dview%2526p_p_col_id%253Dcolumn-2%2526p_p_col_count%253D1 |title=Deutsches Archäologisches Institut |url=https://www.dainst.org/dai/meldungen |location=Berlin |publisher=[[German Archaeological Institute]] |date=2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qubbat Duris''' was built in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;1243 ([[AH (era)|{{sc|ah}}]]&amp;nbsp;641){{sfnp|Jamil|1948|p=281}} during the [[Ayyubids|Ayyubid]] era.&lt;ref name=germs/&gt; Its sarcophagus was raised or left standing to serve as a [[mihrab]], helping to direct [[Islamic prayer|prayer]] towards [[Mecca]].{{sfnp|Jessup|1881|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzdQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452 452]}} Its columns were probably removed from the ruins of nearby [[Baalbek]] and are assembled haphazardly, one being upside-down.{{sfnp|De Saulcy|1853|p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=cDQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA639 639]}}

Another archaeological site which is not on the tell near the village exists {{convert|1|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Duris at the north of a [[vineyard]] that can be reached via a track from the road to Baalbek. This site was found to contain both [[Shepherd Neolithic]] and [[Heavy Neolithic]] material together, being unusual in this respect. It was found by M. Billaux in 1957 who showed it to two archaeologists who were also members of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Henri Fleisch]] and [[Maurice Tallon]]. The Shepherd Neolithic material was unpatinated and appeared similar to that of [[Maakne]]. The larger pieces were patinated to white, appearing to represent different periods. Three [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] flakes were found in 1966 by [[Lorraine Copeland]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Copeland|author2=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16961">'''Enterprise legal management''' ('''ELM''') is a practice management strategy of corporate legal departments, insurance claims departments, and government legal and contract management departments.

ELM developed during the 1990s in response to increased corporate demands for accountability, transparency, and predictability, and employs software to manage internal legal documents and workflows, [[electronic billing]] and invoicing, and to guide decision-making through reporting and analytics.

==Definitions==
Still an evolving term, ELM is a recognized management discipline and a strategic objective of [[general counsel]].&lt;ref name=Hyperion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have argued that ELM falls within the broader category of [[corporate governance]], risk, and compliance ([[Governance, risk management, and compliance|GRC]]); others maintain that ELM and GRC are separate entities along a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate but related technologies include [[information governance]], [[electronic discovery]], [[legal hold]], [[contract management]], [[corporate secretary]], and board of directors’ communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ELM software may integrate some or all of these components.

==Historical Development==

===Early Practice Management===
[[Law practice management]] refers to the business aspect of operating a law firm or in-house legal team. Components include economics, workplace communication and management, ethics, and client service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mont|first1=Joe|title=When Enterprise Legal Management and GRC Collide|url=https://www.complianceweek.com/news/news-article/when-enterprise-legal-management-and-grc-collide|website=Compliance Week|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, corporate legal spend was considered a “black box” with limited predictability and transparency, making it difficult for corporate legal teams to parse differences of efficiency and cost among outside firms, or to benchmark firm performance against previously hired counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition and Early Adoption===
Several factors led to a shift away from traditional, low-technology solutions and toward ELM, most notably the expansion of the Internet during the 1990s and subsequent development of [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) platforms. Within legal departments, factors included greater regulatory compliance risk, smaller budgets, and board member demands for greater accountability, predictability, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the demand for budgetary information, including metrics such as the ratio of legal spend to total enterprise revenue, extended beyond board members to include other stakeholders. Corporate legal departments were positioned as the next frontier of corporate efficiency and risk management, and encouraged to operate as a true business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created pressure to reduce costs and, when possible, generate revenue for the larger enterprise.

Departments’ varied sizes and responsibilities created a range of practice management needs. A legal department with a small number of in-house attorneys might oversee thousands of cases managed by outside counsel, while a large internal legal department could handle most cases in-house. Smaller departments focused on management of workflow, collaboration, and [[spend management]]; larger departments had greater needs for internal [[matter management]], attorney utilization, and document management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iffergan|first1=Eyal|title=New Solution Models Evolve for ELM|url=http://www.hgpresearch.com/new-solution-models-evolve-for-elm/|website=Hyperion GP Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first electronic transitions were to generic matter management applications, which replaced paper files as the system of record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialization and Expansion===
Initial [[enterprise resource planning]] systems did not meet the specific needs of legal departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozubek|first1=Michael|title=ELM Systems Provide Global Solutions|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2010/12/01/elm-systems-provide-global-solutions|website=Inside Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; External legal costs presented unique management challenges because of the billable-hour model and unpredictable labor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software specialization integrated matter management and preexisting, internal billing software. This integration provided the opportunity to meet management demands for increased communication and information from within corporate legal departments. Ultimately, it extended further to combine legal information with finance, compliance, and risk-management departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozubek|first1=Michael|title=ELM Systems Provide Global Solutions|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2010/12/01/elm-systems-provide-global-solutions|website=Inside Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments also presented risks to enterprise-wide information management. Specialized software generated the potential for conflicts between company‐wide enterprise solutions and the ELM systems of in-house legal departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, maintaining [[data security]] was and remains a preeminent concern, especially for SaaS-based ELM platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in four [[chief legal officer]]s (CLOs) reported a data breach during 2013–15, with the health-care industry especially vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Legal Officers 2015 Survey|url=http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=1389460&amp;page=/legalresources/surveys/index.cfm&amp;qstring=&amp;title=ACC%20Chief%20Legal%20Officer%20(CLO)%202015%20Survey%20%20Executive%20Summary|website=Association of Corporate Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ELM Software==
The expansion of ELM as a practice management strategy was fostered by the growth of ELM software. That growth, in turn, was made possible through the expansion of the Internet and adoption of SaaS platforms across a wide range of industries. Total revenue of all SaaS providers accelerated into the 2010s, with the [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC) forecasting revenue to grow from $22.6 billion to $50.8 billion during 2014–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dover|first1=Christine|title=Worldwide SaaS Enterprise Applications 2014–2018 Forecast and 2013 Vendor Shares|url=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=252568|website=International Data Corporation|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ELM software primarily supports matter management and electronic billing, with derived analytics and reporting guiding legal department business processes. As of 2013, the maturity level of the industry was characterized as early mainstream, with market penetration of less than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Blue Hill Research report stated that economic motivations have encouraged adoption, with an average return on investment of 766%; median spend contraction of 4.5% from automated processing and rejection of nonconforming invoices; and median recurring annual spend reduction of 4% from use of analytics to support data-driven spend management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables affecting the purchase of ELM software include considerations of license type, usage scope, maintenance and support, installation location, and license fee calculation. Vendors employ a range of licensing practices, with no model inherently advantaged or disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components of ELM Software===

====Matter Management====
[[Matter management]] includes the storage and retrieval of all data related to matters handled by a legal department, including the creation, revision, approval, and consumption of legal documents. Matter management is used to facilitate document collaboration internally and with outside counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In complex legal matters such as [[mass tort]] litigation, ELM software provides matter management capabilities such as batch uploading of invoices to expedite review and approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal E-Billing Technology Geared toward Mass Tort Litigation Drastically Reduces Client Review Time|url=http://www.acuityelm.com/legal-e-billing-technology-geared-toward-mass-tort-litigation-drastically-reduces-client-review-time/|website=Acuity ELM|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electronic Billing====
[[Electronic billing]] provides a centralized repository for legal bills and invoices, and a method to deliver those bills securely for review and payment. ELM software integrates with internal electronic billing software through the [[Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard]] ([[LEDES]]) format, which has standardized the transfer of legal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDES: The Global Standard in Legal Data Exchange|url=http://ledes.org|website=LEDES|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of LEDES in the late 1990s was supplemented by the [[American Bar Association]]’s creation of [[Uniform Task-Based Management System]] ([[UTBMS]]) to establish consistent coding of services by outside counsel.

Electronic billing automates review for compliance errors, allocation to cost centers, and routing for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research suggests that it reduces costs by decreasing manual labor and paper costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analytics and Business Process Management====
Matter management and electronic billing data collected by ELM software is used to generate reports and provide analytics that influence [[business process management]] within legal departments.

According to a [[Gartner]] survey, CLOs increasingly focus on regulatory compliance, customer and stakeholder satisfaction, and risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to reduce legal spend center on the reduction of outside counsel costs, achieved through the negotiation of [[alternative fee arrangements]], increased reliance on internal counsel, and convergence of outside counsel. Use of flat fees for entire matters grew from 12 to 20% during 2013–15, with larger legal departments—those serving companies with at least $4 billion in annual revenue—more than twice as likely to use a flat fee structure compared to companies with less than $100 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Legal Officers 2015 Survey|url=http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=1389460&amp;page=/legalresources/surveys/index.cfm&amp;qstring=&amp;title=ACC%20Chief%20Legal%20Officer%20(CLO)%202015%20Survey%20%20Executive%20Summary|website=Association of Corporate Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Legal departments use analytics to inform these budgeting and forecasting decisions, with the selection of outside law firms based on tradeoffs between cost and attorney performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal historical billing data and industry benchmarks identify trends and differences among providers, and average fees associated with matter types. Some ELM software vendors offer comparative metrics harvested from subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vendor Landscape==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Vendors come from one of two backgrounds: content provision or [[software development]]. Some vendors specialize in ELM software, while others include ELM software as part of a broader suite of legal software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; SaaS-based and on-premises solutions exist, although many on-premises providers have shifted to SaaS-based models or added SaaS-based options.

Multiple acquisitions occurred within the industry during 2011–15. In 2011 Bottomline Technologies acquired Allegiant Systems; in 2014 [[Wolters Kluwer]], owner of TyMetrix, acquired competitor Datacert; and in 2015 Mitratech purchased Houston-based Bridgeway Software and EAG's CaseTrack.

'''Ethnozoology''' is the study of the past and present interrelationships between [[human culture]]s  and the [[animal]]s in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml Ethnozoology Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508024045/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes classification and naming of zoological forms, cultural knowledge and use of wild and domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson,  Leslie Main. Ethnobiology - Traditional Biological Knowledge in Contemporary Global Context.  Anthropology 491 study guide,  Athabasca University 2002. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the main subdisciplines of [[ethnobiology]] and shares many methodologies and theoretical frameworks with [[ethnobotany]].

Ethnozoology is the study of human and animal interaction. Ethnobiology includes ethnobotany, which concerns the study of human-plant relationships and ethnozoology. Ethnozoology focuses explicitly on human-animal relationships and knowledge humans have acquired concerning the Earth's fauna. Ethnozoological study concerns the significance of this knowledge to our understanding of the roles played by animals in human society. Faunal resources play a variety of roles in human life throughout history, and their importance to human beings is not only utilitarian but cultural, religious, artistic, and philosophical. Ethnozoology can be understood broadly, from ecological, cognitive, and symbolic perspectives. Human knowledge about natural faunal resources entails sensing, recognizing, classifying, living things. Ethnozoology is a discipline that connects scientific methods to traditional systems of knowledge and cultural beliefs.

== Conservation ==
In a broader context, ethnozoology and its companion discipline, ethnobotany, contribute to the larger science of [[ethnobiology]]. The history of ethnobiology is divided into three periods. The pre-classical period, which began around 1860, focused on collecting information about humans' use of resources, while the classical period, which began in 1954, produced anthropological studies on [[linguistics]] and biological classifications. The current period, or post-classical period, has been described as a meeting of [[social science]] and the study of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Alves2012&gt;Alves, R. (2012). Relationships between fauna and people and the role of ethnozoology in animal conservation. Ethnobiology and Conservation, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the profound human influence on faunal biodiversity, wildlife conservation planning is becoming increasingly urgent. It is widely acknowledged that environmental health is important to human health, and [[biodiversity loss]] can have both indirect and direct negative effects on human wellbeing. The close link between human health and ecological/faunal health is substantiated with five important concepts: animals cause and disseminate disease for humans and vice versa, animals can be guards of human health, animals are used in traditional medicine practices throughout the world, animals are a source of drugs and treatments in human diseases, and animals are used in medical research.&lt;ref name=Alves2012/&gt;

== The social sciences ==

=== Sociology ===

[[Sociology]] has been slow to explore ethnozoology and grant it credibility.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003&gt;Arluke, A. (2003). Ethnozoology and the future of sociology. International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 23(3), 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ethnozoology is important because policy makers and concerned citizens are too often left to be informed only by animal advocates or biomedical researchers, both of which are inherently biased. Animals provide humans with a better understanding of ourselves, and how we think and act toward animals has the potential to reveal our attitudes toward other people and social order. Evidence of this can be seen in the ways that animal images may at times be expressing underlying racism: "the most damning testimony given by accused police at the [[Rodney King]] trial involved characterization of King as a 'gorilla'; during the Gulf War Saddam Hussein was described in the American press as a 'rat'; and the actions of people in the Los Angeles riots were likened by the media commentators to 'packs of vicious animals'".&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt;

Sociology is a science concerned with groups and group formation, including those facing structural and interpersonal oppression, suffering, and vulnerability. Sub-fields in this area include [[African-American studies|African Americans studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[gay/lesbian studies]]. However, not much attention or legitimacy is awarded animal studies as a sub-field. Modern use of animals in the developed world, especially in the United States, can be characterized by exploitation, domination, and oppression.&lt;ref name=Irvine&gt;Irvine, L. (2008). Animals and sociology. Sociology Compass, 2(6), 1954–1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal cruelty and abuse is not only present in the industrial farming of livestock, but also in such circumstances as dog fighting, cow tipping, horse racing, circus acts, and other entertainment industries and practices. Furthermore, animals are often victims and pawns used in domestic violence. The widespread abuse of animals in modern society is important for sociology because it involves an entrenched assumption about the connection between cruelty toward animals and violence directed and human beings. Some research has even suggested ways in which the human-animal interaction can challenge dominant sociological theories about the self.&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

=== Anthropology ===
[[Anthropology]] has done more to study ethnozoology in terms of the history of the function of animals in non-industrialized societies and the role that animals play symbolically and religiously in different cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt; The [[domestication]] process has been a chief concern for anthropologists, whose interests are in the history of human desire to understand animals, enslave them, and harness their power. Animal-derived products have been used especially for food, but also for clothing, tools, toys, and for medicinal and magic-religious purposes. Many cultures associate strong supernatural powers between the animal and human worlds, including mythologies and connections with totemic, ancestral, or magical animals and animal-gods.&lt;ref&gt;Alves, R. R., Rosa, I. L., Neto, N. A. L., &amp; Voeks, R. (2012). Animals for the gods: Magical and religious faunal use and trade in Brazil. Human Ecology, 40(5), 751-780.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax2001&gt;Sax, B. (2001). The mythical zoo. An Encyclopedia of Animals in World Myth, Legend and Folklore.Santa Barbara, CA: ABC Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals are given symbolic meaning, as in the western association of [[black cat]]s with poor luck.&lt;ref name=Sax2001/&gt; Biological knowledge varies according to cultural and traditional knowledge and experiences. People share a basic way of comprehending the natural world based on common [[evolution]]ary history, and this foundation connects scientific biology with its historical roots in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary perspective on human cognition and affect indicates some degree of universality in perception and decision-making with regard to the natural world and its fauna. The interaction between these aspects of [[psychology]], [[biodiversity]] of the Earth's wildlife, and the unique social, cultural, and economic contexts within which humans interact and develop produces [[cultural diversity]]. Paleoanthropological studies suggest that linguistic approaches to ethnobiology have only recently evolved in the context of human history,&lt;ref&gt;Hunn, E. (2007). Ethnobiology in four phases. Journal of Ethnobiology, 27(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that these linguistic approaches only provide a partial understanding to how humans perceive and engage with the natural world around them.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S. (2006). Ethnobiology and the evolution of the human mind. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 12(s1), S45-S61.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">The [[OECD]] '''Gender, Institutions and Development''' ('''GID''') '''Database''', or '''GID-DB''', contains more than 60 data indicators of [[gender equality]].  The GID-DB was introduced in 2006 by the [[OECD Development Centre]] to provide a data tool to help researchers and policy makers determine and analyze obstacles to women's social and economic development.  It provides these gender-related data for up to 162 countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, thereby covering all regions and country-income-categories of the world.&lt;ref name='W.247'&gt;Johannes Jütting, Christian Morrisson, Jeff Dayton Johnson and Denis Drechsler (2008): http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791546193~db=all~order=page Measuring Gender (In)Equality: The OECD Gender, Institutions and Development Data Base, ''Journal of Human Development, Volume 9, Issue 1 March 2008'', pp. 65-86. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Database composition==
The GID Database is structured around key traditional measurements of [[gender equality]], including ''Education'' (data such as literacy rates and school enrollments for each gender), ''Health'' (such as percentage of births attended by skilled personnel), ''Economic status'' and ''Political status'' (such as percentage of legislators for each gender).  The GID-DB also introduced non-traditional data indicators for "social institutions" such as cultural practices and social norms which affect gender equality.&lt;ref&gt; Jütting, et al; 2006, pp. 9-32. &lt;/ref&gt;  These new measurements are thoroughly presented here, in the next section.  By providing new indicator information on these formerly "hidden" instances of gender discrimination, the database complements other data compilations such as the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Report]], the [[World Bank Group]]'s ''GenderStats'' database,&lt;ref&gt;WorldBank (up-to-date). http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTGENDER/EXTANATOOLS/EXTSTATINDDATA/EXTGENDERSTATS/0,,menuPK:3237391~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3237336,00.html "GenderStats". &lt;/ref&gt; or the [[World Economic Forum]]'s ''[[Global Gender Gap Report]]''.

==Measures of social institutions==
The GID database groups its 12 social-institution indicators into 5 different categories, below.  Each of these 12 indicators is a cultural and traditional practice that impacts upon ''gender equality''.  Each indicator is coded between 0 (indicating no discrimination, i.e., equality) and 1 (indicating high discrimination, or high inequality) depending on the extent of discrimination and the percentage of females that suffer from its application, for each specific social institution.  As an example, consider Inheritance, the second social institution or indicator below:  If 10 percent of the female population in a country report restricted access to inheritance, with daughters inheriting only half the amount granted to sons, the indicator for inheritance would be 10 percent x 0.50 = 0.05, nearly equality.  Values above 0 can be too complicated to describe briefly, in which case they are omitted below.

'''Family Code''':
*Parental authority – authority is granted to father and mother equally (yes = 0).
*Inheritance – inheritance practices in favour of male heirs (no = 0).
*Early marriage (women) – share of girls between 15 and 19 who are or have been married.
*Polygamy – acceptance or legality of polygamy (no = 0).
'''Civil Liberties''':
*Freedom of movement – freedom to move freely outside of the house (no discrimination = 0).
*Dress code in public – obligation to wear a veil in public (no = 0).
'''Physical Integrity''':
*Violence against women/Legal indicator – existence of laws against 3 categories (domestic, assault or rape, and sexual harassment; averaged together), with totally illegal = 0.
*Female genital mutilation – share of women with genital mutilation.
'''Son Preference''':  
*Son preference (missing women) compares "the number of women that should be alive (assuming no son preference) and the actual number of women in a country." – No women are missing = 0.
'''Ownership Rights''':
*Women's access to land ownership – (value between 0 = full access and 1 = impossible).
*Women's access to bank loans – (between 0 = full access and 1 = impossible).
*Women's access to owning property other than land – (between 0 = full and 1 = no).

The GID database itself is the source for these brief descriptions.  Namely, the GID-DB includes a complete description for each data indicator, called its metadata, which stays hidden until one clicks on that indicator's little red "i" – the working definitions for the data indicators are easily ''available'' online right with the data.
&lt;ref name=GID-DB&gt; OECD (up-to-date). http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=GID2 "OECD StatExtracts (GID-DB)". &lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the GID-DB tool==
The GID-DB has been statistically applied toward identifying the factors which determine how women's labour-force participation varies across the database countries.  The reported results suggest that the social-institution factors or indicators can outweigh the other traditional indicators such as income per capita.&lt;ref&gt; Jütting, et al; 2006, p.32 (the report's Conclusions) &lt;/ref&gt;  The GID database including its social-institution indicators thus may be useful in solving various economic development problems,&lt;ref name=W.247 /&gt; by offering a more complete set of indicators from which to choose for answering policy questions or for other research topics.&lt;ref&gt; OECD (up-to-date). http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3746,en_2649_33935_39323280_1_1_1_1,00.html "Gender, Institutions and Development Database (GID-DB)". &lt;/ref&gt;

==Composite index of gender equality==
The [[UNDP]] (UN Development Programme) publishes two [[composite (finance)|composite index]]es of ''gender equality'', based on traditional indicators (such as the above-mentioned ones in the GID-DB), namely the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or GEM, and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] or GDI.  

In 2009, similarly the ''OECD Development Centre'' introduced the ''[[Social Institutions and Gender Index]]'' (SIGI), which is described in its own article.  The SIGI is exclusively based on the 12 new social institutions above, their 5 groups providing the SIGI's 5 components. Given its exclusive focus on social institutions, the ''SIGI'' is a highly specialized measure of gender equality – and should not be confused with the ''GEM'' and the ''GDI''.

The SIGI and its 5 components were added in 2009 to the GID-DB, readily accessible (as described below) as a specific part of the latter.&lt;ref name=GID-DB /&gt;

==Accessing the GID-DB data==
These data can be accessed via the OECD website StatExtracts (GID-DB),&lt;ref name=GID-DB /&gt; whose sidebar has all of the GID database's components selected and ready to click on, with its 12 ''Social Institution'' indicators already on display in the main part of the screen.  More information such as working definitions of the data, plus the country notes, can be displayed (or hidden again) by clicking on the little red i's.&lt;ref name=GID-DB /&gt; 

Many other OECD datasets are listed in the sidebar, in addition to the GID-DB data which are the subject of this article.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Latin America Vol 1.jpg|thumb|General History of Latin America - Volume I]] --&gt;
The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-latin-america/ General History of Latin America] is part of [[UNESCO]]’s [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/ General and Regional Histories] Collection.  The publication seeks to contribute to mutual understanding and dialogue between cultures and civilizations. This series seeks to illustrate the encounters between cultures across history and their respective contributions to the general progress of humankind. This is done through the promotion of a pluralist vision of history.

== Objectives and main themes ==
The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-latin-america/ ''General History of Latin America''] is a new approach to the historical evolution of [[Latin America]]. It sets out to capture both the unity and the diversity of the region and outlines the great contributions made by Latin American societies (indigenous and others) to the progress of humanity. [[Latin America]] has become one of the world’s major geocultural regions. Its importance on the world cultural scene is beyond dispute. The region is recognized for its ongoing and increasingly successful efforts to develop as a group of modern, democratic societies. Latin America as a comprehensive entity is an historical reality.

Coordinated and directed by UNESCO and an International Scientific Committee consisting of 240 prominent researchers and scholars from all over the world, the outcome of this project has been the publication of nine volumes of comprehensive studies and information on ideas, civilizations, societies, and institutions covering the development of Latin American societies from the [[pre-Columbian era]] [[File:Mayan Zodiac Circle.jpg|thumb|Mayan Zodiac Circle – Photo taken by Theilr via Wikimedia Commons]] to the twentieth century. Using methodological instruments of current historiography, these volumes present [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Latin American societies]], their contacts with European culture, the colonial orders, and the participation of African communities in the region to highlight the history of inter-continental interactions in Latin America.

Published in Spanish and launched in 1983, the fundamental aim of the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-latin-america/ General History of Latin America], is to help heighten the historical awareness of the region.

== History ==
As a central part of its mandate, [[UNESCO]] is committed to promoting mutual understanding and to facilitating discussion and dialogue amongst peoples and nations. The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-latin-america/ General History of Latin America] makes a significant contribution to this objective. This project was initially suggested in the recommendations of a meeting of experts convened by the Director-General of UNESCO in Lima, Peru, in 1967. In 1983 a Drafting Committee of 21 members (two-thirds of whom were specialists from Latin America) was established and the project was completed in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13243">{{Hegelianism}}
The following list of works by German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831).

==Collected works in German==
===Standard citation numbers===
Hegel is cited—unless otherwise specified—on the basis of his output according w Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Markus Michel, Frankfurt a. M.: Suhrkamp, 1979. Prior to 1979, see below. Additions such as "A" or "B" refer to annotations added to the original text.

'''Band''' or the abbreviation '''Bd.''' is the German word meaning the volume number of the work.

The "1817 Encyclopaedia" contained only outline notes for students, called ''Zusatz'' ("addition").  They are often combined with the three books of Hegel's later work called "System der Philosophie I, II, III," the combinations being called the Encyclopaedia I, II and III.

==History==
In October 2015, the editors and [[editorial board]] of [[Lingua (journal)|''Lingua'']] resigned en masse to protest their inability to come to an agreement with [[Elsevier]] regarding fair pricing models for [[open access]] publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://twitter.com/fonolog/status/659073042795077632 |title=NEWS: All editors and entire editorial board of Lingua have resigned, bec. agreement with Elsevier about fair Open Access was impossible |publisher=[[Twitter]] |first=Marc |last=van Oostendorp |authorlink=Marc van Oostendorp |date=October 27, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Needs better reference --&gt;

The '''Golden Hat of Schifferstadt''' ({{lang-de|Der Goldene Hut von Schifferstadt}}) was discovered in a field near the town of [[Schifferstadt]] in Southwest [[Germany]] in 1835. It is a [[Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] made of thin sheet gold and served as the external decoration of a head-dress, probably of an organic material, with a brim and a chin-strap. The hat is on display in the [[Historical Museum of the Palatinate]] in [[Speyer]].  It is one of a group of four similar artifacts known as the [[Golden hats]], all cone-shaped Bronze Age head-dresses made of sheet gold.

== Cultural context ==
The Schifferstadt specimen was the oldest of the group of four known [[Golden hats]],  The Schifferstadt hat was the first to be discovered. After the [[Berlin Gold Hat|example from Berlin]], it is the best-preserved one, fully preserved with the exception of a small part of the brim. 

Three associated bronze axes and a comparison with other Late Bronze Age metwalwork date the Schifferstadt Hat to ''circa'' 1,400-1,300 BC. 

The hat, like its counterparts, is assumed to have served as a religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun-cult common in Bronze Age Europe. The hats are also suggested to have served [[Golden hats#Calendars|calendrical functions]].

== Description ==
[[File:Schifferstadt Golden Hat schematic.jpg|thumb|Schifferstadt hat: Ornamental bands and respective stamped patterns]]
The Schifferstadt Hat is a 350 g gold cone, subdivided into horizontal ornamental bands, applied in the [[Repousse|repoussé]] technique. It has a blunt, undecorated tip. The shaft is short and squat, with a distinct widening and a wide brim at the bottom. The hat is 29.6 cm high and has a lower diameter of about 18 cm. The brim is 4.5 cm wide.  At its base  the gold sheet was wound around a copper wire (now lost) for extra stability.

Along its whole length the hat is subdivided and decorated by rows of horizontal symbols and bands. Five different stamps and a chisel or liner were used to create the horizontal bands of repeated stamped symbols, following a systematic scheme. 

The optical separation of the individual ornamental bands was achieved by ring ribs or bands around the whole external face of the hat. The symbols in the bands are mostly disk and circle motifs, usually with an internal disk or buckle, surrounded by up to six concentric circles. 

Striking are two bands with eye-like motifs, resembling similar symbols on the hats of [[Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch|Ezelsdorf]] and [[Berlin Gold Hat|Berlin]]. Unlike the other known examples, the cone's top is not decorated with a star but left entirely unembellished.

The illustration shows the scheme of the shape and composition of the hat, as well as number of ornamental zones and of the number of stamps used for each.

== Provenance and find history ==
The Golden Hat of Schifferstadt was discovered on the 29th of April 1835, during agricultural work in a field named ''Reuschlache'', one km north of [[Schifferstadt]]. On the following day the find was handed to officials at [[Speyer]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. 

The known circumstances suggest a cult-related deposition: The hat was buried upright, about 60 cm deep. Its top reached to just below the ground surface. When found the hat stood on a slab of back-burnt [[clay]]. It was filled with earth or an earth-ashes mixture, of which nothing remains. 

The clay slab, which crumbled during its recovery and is now entirely lost, sat on a one-inch layer of sand, placed in a rectangular pit. Three bronze axes were leaning against the cone.

== Manufacture ==
[[File:Denkmal Goldener Hut Schifferstadt.JPG|thumb|Monument at the findspot]]
The hat is hammered from a single piece of gold [[alloy]] of 86.37% [[Gold|Au]], 13% [[Silver|Ag]], 0.56% [[Copper|Cu]] and 0.07% [[Tin|Sn]]. Its average thickness is 0.2 to 0.25 cm, except the brim, which is far thinner, at 0.08 to 0-13 mm. The latter may suggest that it had been re-worked at some stage.

If the amount of gold used for the hat was moulded into a square bar, it would only measure 2.5 cm square. Such a bar or lump was hammered to the thickess of a modern sheet of printing paper during its production.

Because of the [[tribology|tribological]] characteristics of the material, it tends to harden with increasing deformation (see [[ductility]]), increasing its potential to crack. To avoid cracking, an extremely even deformation was necessary. Additionally, the material had to be softened by repeatedly heating it to a temperature of at least 750 °C. 

Since gold alloy has a relatively low [[melting point]] of ''circa'' 960 °C, a very careful [[temperature control]] and an [[isothermal process|isothermal heating process]] were required, so as to avoid melting any of the surface. For this, the Bronze Age artisans used a charcoal fire or oven similar to those used for [[pottery]]. The temperature could only be controlled through the addition of [[oxygen]], using a [[bellows]]. 

In the course of its further manufacture, the hat was embellished with rows of radial ornamental bands, [[Chasing|chased]] into the metal. To make this possible, it was filled with a [[putty]] or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] based on [[resin|tree resin]] and [[wax]], traces of which have survived. The thin gold leaf was structured by chasing: stamp-like tools or moulds depicting the individual symbols were repeatedly pressed into (or rolled along) the exterior of the gold.

'''Harriet Malinowitz''' is an American academic scholar specializing in lesbian and gay issues in higher education, [[women's studies]], the rhetoric of Zionism and Palestine, and writing theory and [[pedagogy]].

==Life and work==
A Professor of English at Long Island University, Malinowitz earned her Ph.D. from New York University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard L. Conolly College of Liberal Arts and Sciences: Faculty|url=http://www.liu.edu/Brooklyn/Academics/Faculty/Faculty/M/Harriet-Malinowitz|website=Long Island University|publisher=Long Island University|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable works by Malinowitz include ''Textual Orientiations: Lesbian and Gay Students and the Making of Discourse Communities'' (Heinemann, 1995), an ethnographic study focusing on the community emerging in a college course that examines lesbian and gay experience. ''Textual Orientations'' highlights the productive intersections of two academic fields: [[composition studies|rhetoric and composition]] and [[lesbian and gay studies]] while providing a pedagogical model that values the "vantage point of the social margin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malinowitz|first1=Harriet|title=Textual Orientations: Lesbian and Gay Students and the Making of Discourse Communities|date=1995|publisher=Boynton/Cook Publishers: Heinemann|location=Portsmouth, NH|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Malinowitz is also a writer of lesbian [[stand-up comedy]], most notably for her partner Sara Cytron's shows ''A Dyke Grows in Brooklyn'' and ''Take My Domestic Partner--Please!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggerty|first1=George|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Bonnie|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories|date=2000|publisher=Garland|location=New York|page=XXXV|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Historical Reflections''''' (fr: ''Réflexions Historiques'') is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] of [[history]] published by [[Berghahn Books]]. It publishes articles in both English and French and was established in 1974. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Linda Mitchell]].

The journal was published by the [[University of Waterloo]] from 1974 until 1989, then by [[Alfred University]]'s Division of Human Studies until 2008, when it became a joint publication of Alfred University and [[Berghahn Books]]. After financial difficulties, the journal is now published solely by Berghahn Books. The journal was edited first by Stanley K. Johannesen (University of Waterloo), then by Stuart Campbell for most of the time after it moved to Alfred University. Daniel Gordon joined Campbell as the co-editor in 2003, until Mitchell became editor in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.berghahnbooks.com/hrrh/ |title=Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques |publisher=Berghahn Books |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ifrit''', also spelled as '''efreet''', '''efrite''', '''ifreet''', '''afreet''', '''afrite''' and '''afrit''' ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]: ''{{transl|ar|ʻIfrīt}}'': {{lang|ar|عفريت}}, [[plural|pl]] ''{{transl|ar|ʻAfārīt}}'': {{lang|ar|عفاريت}}) are [[supernatural]] creatures in some [[Middle Eastern]] stories. In [[Islam]], this term refers to the most powerful and dangerous [[Jinn]].

==Description==
[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan --- devils talking.jpg|thumb|right|The Chief-Ifrit sitting on the right listening to the complaints of jinn; Al-Malik al-Aswad, from the late 14th&amp;nbsp;century [[Book of Wonders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maximillien |last=de Lafayette |title=Early &amp; contemporary spirit artists, psychic artists, and medium painters from 5000&amp;nbsp;BC to the present day economy |website=Lulu.com |year=2017 |ISBN=978-1-365-97802-9 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Ifrits are a class of [[wikt:infernal|infernal]] [[djinn]] and also held to be a [[ghost|death spirit]] drawn to the life-force (or blood) of a murdered victim seeking revenge on the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=el-Sayed El-Aswad |title=Religion and Folk Cosmology: Scenarios of the visible and invisible in rural Egypt |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |ISBN=978-0-897-89924-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Lebling"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Lebling |title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and genies from Arabia to Zanzibar |publisher=I.B. Tauris |year=2010 |ISBN=978-0-857-73063-3 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ordinary djinn, an Ifrit may be either a believer or an unbeliever, good or evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ifrit |article=ifrit |series=Islamic mythology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is most often depicted as a wicked, ruthless, and evil being; a powerful [[Shaitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Hughes |first=Thomas Patrick |dictionary=Dictionary of Islam |publisher=Asian Educational Services |year=1995 |article=Genii |pages=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ifrits are believed to inhabit the levels of the [[Jahannam|underworld]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Valery |last=Rees |title=From Gabriel to Lucifer: A cultural history of angels |publisher=I.B. Tauris |year=2013 |ISBN=978-1-848-85372-0 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; or desolated places on the surface, such as  in ruins or caves.

According to Islamic sources, the Ifrit has a fiery appearance with flames leaping from his mouth. It may be a danger to people, but can be destroyed if someone recites a [[Dua|Du'a]] (Islamic prayer) near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hajjah Amina Adil |title=Muhammad the Messenger of Islam: His life &amp; prophecy |publisher=BookBaby |year=2012 |ISBN=978-1-618-42913-1 |chapter=Ezra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In folklore, they are commonly thought to take the shape of the deceased at the moment of death, or the appearance of the Shaitan. In the Islamic traditions of [[Cirebon]], the Afarit are known as ''Mrekayangan'', a subcategory of [[Shaitan|demon]]s. But their origin is different from the other demons, since the Mrekayangan appear after someone died improperly, while the demons are descendants of [[Iblis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A.G. |last=Muhaimin |title=The Islamic Traditions of Cirebon: Ibadat and Adat among Javanese muslims |publisher=ANU E Press |year=2006 |ISBN=978-1-920-94231-1 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:MakhanEmbracedByAnEfreeti.jpg|thumb|upright|Makhan embraced by an Ifrit. [[Persian miniature|Illustration]] to [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s poem ''Hamsa''. [[Bukhara]], 1648.]]
The word Ifrit seems to be of Arabic origin. Traditionally, Arab philologists trace the derivation of the word to {{lang|ar|عفر}} (''{{transl|ar|ʻafara}}'', "to rub with dust").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=J. |first1=Chelhod, |title=ʿIfrīt |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ifrit-SIM_3502?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=ifrit |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western philologists, such as [[Johann Jakob Hess]] and [[Karl Vollers]], attribute it to [[Middle Persian]] ''afritan'' which corresponds to [[Modern Persian]] {{Nastaliq|{{lang|fa|آفريدن}}}} (to create).

==Islam==
An Ifrit is mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur'an]], [[Sura]] [[An-Naml]] (27:38-40): &lt;blockquote&gt;[Solomon] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her [the Queen of Sheba's] throne before they come to me in submission?" An Ifrit (strong one) from the jinn said: "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work." One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: "I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when Solomon saw it placed before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his own self; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his own self). Certainly, my Lord is Rich (Free of all needs), Bountiful."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a [[hadith]] from [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], an Ifrit tried to interrupt the prayers of [[Muhammed]]. Muhammed overpowered the Ifrit and wanted to fasten him to a pillar so that everyone can see him in the morning. Then, he remembered the statement of [[Süleyman|Solomon]] and he dismissed the Ifrit.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinndemons.com/jinn-in-hadith-sahih-bukhari/|title=Jinn in Hadith Sahih Bukhari - Jinn &amp; Demons - Jinn &amp; Demons|website=www.jinndemons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a narration about [[Isra and Mi'raj|Muhammeds Night Journey]], an Ifrit sought Muhammed with a fiery torch. To get rid of him, he asked [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibraʾil]] for help. Jibraʾil then taught him how to seek refuge from [[God in Islam|God]], whereupon the Ifrit get away from him.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Olson Vuckovic ''Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam'' Routledge 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-135-88524-3}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ifrit, meeting [[Imam Ali]], is mentioned in different [[Shiism|Shi'i]] accounts. According to the [[Shabakism|Shabak]] community, Imam Ali became incensed against an Ifrit for his unbelieving. Consequently, he bound the Ifrit in chains. The Ifrit appealed to all prophets since [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] for his release. But no one was able to free him, until [[Muhammed]] found him and took the Ifrit to Imam Ali. He freed him on the condition that he would profess his faith for Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Moosa ''Extremist Shiites: The Ghulat Sects'' Matti Moosa 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-815-62411-0}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qisas Al-Anbiya]] (Stories of the Prophets), Afarit perform the orders of [[Iblis]] to plague [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]. Each of these Afarit are endowed with specific abilities such as turning into a firy storm or killing by shouting out.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Ashaq Ahmad At-Talabi, Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Thaʻlabī ''Islamische Erzählungen von Propheten und Gottesmännern: Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʼ'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-447-05266-5}} S. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic literature==
In ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in a tale called "The Porter and the Young Girls", there is a narrative about a prince who is attacked by pirates and takes refuge with a woodcutter. The prince finds an underground chamber in the forest leading to a beautiful woman who has been kidnapped by an Ifrit. The prince sleeps with the woman and both are attacked by the jealous Ifrit, who changes the prince into an ape. Later a princess restores the prince and fights a [[pitched battle]] with the Ifrit, who changes shape into various animals, fruit, and fire until being reduced to cinders. In the book, the word is used interchangeably with ''[[genie]]'' and the spirit is malevolent but easily tricked by the protagonist.&lt;ref name=Hale&gt;{{cite news|author = Leon Hale|title = Arabic mythology is worth revisiting|publisher = ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date = January 13, 2002|url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?di}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind poet [[Al-Maʿarri]] mentioned in his narrations, a [[paradise]] for ''Afarit'' with "narrow straits" and "dark valleys".&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Amira El-Zein 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In early folklore, the Ifrit is said to be formed from the blood of a murder victim. Driving an unused nail into the blood was supposed to stop their formation. The creatures were reported as being able to take the form of [[Satan]], the murder victim, or even a sandstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Aeromancy | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World | volume = | pages = 10 | publisher = Harper Element | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern popular culture ==
An Ifrit plays a major role as a story element in bollywood film ''[[Pari: Not a Fairytale]]'' where the lead character played by Anushka Sharma is the progeny of an Ifrit and human, due to a cult practice. The film was based on a book series called ''An Ember in the Ashes'.

The trading card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has featured several "efreet" since the earliest expansion sets.&lt;ref&gt;https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/arabian-nights&lt;/ref&gt;

Ifrit is a prominent Summon to fight with in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. Like their mythological counterparts, Ifrit's are spirits of fire and destruction, almost always appearing as a devilish monster that uses either fire, earth, or both to do damage to either the monster the player is fighting or as a boss against the player himself.

[[Indian art]] evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically.

== Rasas in the performing arts ==
{{main|Rasa (aesthetics)}}
[[Image:Durga-mudra.png|right|thumb|Raudram rasa of the destructive fury of goddess [[Durga]] in Bharatanatyam]]
The theory of [[rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]s still forms the [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kudiyattam]], [[Kathakali]] and others. Expressing ''Rasa'' in classical Indian dance form is referred to as '''''Rasa-abhinaya'''''. The ''Nātyasāstra'' carefully delineates the ''bhavas'' used to create each ''rasa''.

The expressions used in Kudiyattam or Kathakali are extremely exaggerated theatrical expressions. The opposite of this interpretation is [[Balasaraswathi]]'s school of subtle and understated abhinaya of the devadasis. There were serious public debates when [[Balasaraswathi]] condemned Rukmini Devi's puritanistic interpretations and applications of [[Sringara]] rasa. The abhinaya of the [[Melattur style]] of abhinaya remains extremely rich in variations of the emotions, while the [[Pandanallur style]] expressions are more limited in scope.

==History==
===Natyashastra===
[[Image:Kondadakuli.jpg|thumb|left|"A [[Yakshagana]] artist expressing emotions on stage. Vaachikabhinaya is an important part of Yakshagana"]]
Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the [[Sanskrit]] text [[Nātyashāstra]] (''nātya'' meaning "drama" and ''shāstra'' meaning "science of"), a work attributed to [[Bharata Muni]] where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole.  Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of ingredients.

===Kashmiri aestheticians===
The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician Ãndandavardhana's classic on poetics, the Dhvanyāloka which introduces the ninth rasa, shānta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace (''śānta'') which arises from its bhāva, weariness of the pleasures of the world.  The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept ''dhvani'' or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of ''rasa-dhvani'', primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work "suggests" a real-world emotional state or bhāva, but thanks to [[aesthetic distance]], the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of tragedy, heroism or romance.

The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as "the nondual Shaivism of Kashmir" (or "Kashmir Shaivism") and aesthetician, [[Abhinavagupta]] brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the Dhvanyāloka, the Dhvanyāloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the [[Nātyashāstra]], portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and Patwardhan.  Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] colored by the emotional tone of a drama.

===Inclusion of bhakti===
In the literary compositions, the emotion of Bhakti as a feeling of adoration towards God was long considered only a minor feeling fit only for Stothras, but not capable of being developed into a separate rasa as the sole theme of a whole poem or drama. In the tenth century, it was still struggling, and Aacharya [[Abhinavagupta]] mentions Bhakti in his commentary on the [[Natya Shastra]], as an important accessory sentiment of the Shanta Rasa, which he strove with great effort to establish. However, just as Shantha slowly attained a state of primacy that it was considered the Rasa of Rasas, Bhakti also soon began to loom large and despite the lukewarmness of the great run of Alankarikas, had the service of some distinguished advocates, including [[Tyagaraja]]. It is the [[Bhagavata]] that gave the great impetus to the study of Bhakti from an increasingly aesthetic point of view.

===Attention to rasas===
Poets like [[Kālidāsa]] were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed aesthetic system.  Even in contemporary India the term ''rasa'' denoting "flavor" or "essence" is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As one of its major tasks the association sees the enhancing of cooperation between institutions and forums that contribute to the study of Hungarian Studies in Hungary and worldwide. The association acquaints itself with Hungarian studies-related activities and renders accessible this information. The association has a publication series of its own, which undertakes the publication of articles and [[monograph]]s and publishes the journal ''[[Hungarian Studies (journal)|Hungarian Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hungarologia.net/publications/hungarian-studies/ Hungarian Studies] International Association for Hungarian Studies, 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress of Hungarian Studies, organized every five years, brings together 400–500 scholars worldwide. In addition to the congresses, the association organizes several [[Academic conference|conferences]] in between the congresses, mainly with the purpose of supporting the doctoral education within Hungarian Studies. Through these conferences the association provides a forum for doctoral students in and outside Hungary.

The '''Orlando Deanery Boychoir and Girls Choir''' are internationally renowned choirs based in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The choirs are open to youth of all religions and backgrounds in grades 3-12.

The Orlando Deanery Boychoir and Girls Choir are founded on European models and affiliated with the [[Royal School of Church Music]] in England. This music outreach program of the Cathedral Church of Saint Luke&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccslorlando.org&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Orlando serves the community, nation and world. Performances include religious services, civic festivals, opera and symphony, charity concerts, private parties, weddings, conventions, TV commercials and Disney events, often with prominent local orchestras. While creating beautiful music of the highest standards, the choirs develop musicianship, vocal skills, teamwork, responsibility, leadership, courtesy, respect for other cultures, poise, and professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccslorlando.org/choir-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

Tours play an integral part in their musical education, cultural enrichment, and outreach mission. As Cultural Ambassadors of the United States and the City of Orlando, the choirs have toured to Japan, England, Ireland, Wales, Canada, Vienna, Salzburg, Munich, Prague, Washington D.C., New York (and Carnegie Hall three times), Niagara Falls, New England, New Orleans, Florida, the Bahamas, and much of the Southeastern U.S. Tours are funded entirely by fundraising efforts and individual and corporate contributions. The boys and girls also attend Summer Choir Courses of the Royal School of Church Music in America.

The Orlando Deanery Boychoir and Girls Choir were issued a special invitation by First Lady Michele Obama, and performed in the White House in Washington D.C. for a 2-hour concert during the Christmas holidays of 2011. In August of 2012, during London's Summer Olympics, they presented an Anglican Heritage Tour as the Choir-in-Residence for one week each at both St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford UK. In 2014, they participated in the inaugural American Music Performance Nationals for Children’s and Youth Choirs in New York City at [[Carnegie Hall]], which was their third trip to sing in Carnegie Hall. They also performed at [[Saint Thomas Episcopal Church (Manhattan)|Saint Thomas Episcopal Church]] in Manhattan and [[St Paul's Chapel]] near Ground Zero.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deanerychoirtour.org&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 they will be in residence at Washington National Cathedral (D.C.) to sing for three services with members of the Orlando Deanery Men's Choir, and St. Luke's Cathedral Choir and Choristers.

The choir has been under the direction of Canon Benjamin Lane, St. Luke's Cathedral Musician, since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccslorlando.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Boychoir was founded in 1981 by then Cathedral Musician Murray Forbes Somerville. The Girls Choir was founded in 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">'''Princess Rosette''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] written by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Madame d'Aulnoy]], ''Les Contes des Fees'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/aulnoy/1892/princessrosette.html "Princess Rosette"]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Red Fairy Book'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/aulnoy/rosette.html "Princess Rosette"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]] included an orally collected tale, ''The King of the Peacocks'', in his ''[[Italian Folktales]]'', but observed in the notes that it was clearly a variant on ''Princess Rosette''.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 735 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

A [[king]] and [[queen consort|queen]], who had two sons, had a daughter as well.  All the fairies came to the christening.  When the queen pressed them to [[self-fulfilling prophecy#Classic|predict]] Rosette's future, they said that she might cause great misfortune to her brothers, and even their deaths.  The king and queen consulted with a hermit, who advised them to lock Rosette in a tower.  They did so, but one day they died, and their sons instantly freed her from it.  She marveled at everything, but in particular, at a peacock.  When she heard that people sometimes ate them, she declared that she would never marry anyone except the King of the Peacocks, and then she would protect her subjects.

Her brothers, the new king and the prince, set out to find the King of the Peacocks, and at last were directed there by the King of the Mayflies.  There, they showed the king Rosette's portrait.  He said he would marry her if she was as beautiful, but kill them both if she was not.

When the news came, Princess Rosette set out with her nurse.  The nurse bribed the boatman to throw the princess, bed and all, with her little dog, into the sea in the middle of the night.  The bed was made of [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] feathers and floated, but the nurse put her own [[False hero|daughter]] in the princess's place.  The outraged king was about to execute her brothers, who persuaded him to give them seven days to prove their innocence.

When the princess woke, she was convinced that the king had decided not to marry her after all, and so had her thrown into the sea.  An old man saw her on the shore and brought her to shelter, but saw by her possessions that she was a great lady, and he could only give her meager fare.  The princess sent her dog to the best kitchen in town, and the dog stole all the food being cooked for the King of the Peacocks.  This happened for several days, until the Prime Minister spied on the kitchen, saw the dog, and followed it.  He told the king, and they went to the hut and seized Rosette and the old man.  The old man begged for mercy and told the story, and the king realized that this was his bride.  He freed her brothers and married her.

{{double image|right|Erich von Daniken.jpg|105|Graham-Hancock.jpg|185|[[Erich von Däniken]] (left) and [[Graham Hancock]] (right) are two of the most widely published proponents of pseudoarchaeology.}}

'''Pseudoarchaeology'''—also known as '''alternative archaeology''', '''fringe archaeology''', '''fantastic archaeology''', or '''cult archaeology'''—refers to interpretations of the past from outside of the [[archaeology|archaeological]] science community, which reject the accepted datagathering and analytical methods of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fagan720"&gt;[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil87|Williams 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt; These [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] interpretations involve the use of artifacts, sites or materials to construct  scientifically insubstantial theories to supplement the pseudoarchaeologists' claims. Methods include exaggeration of evidence, dramatic or romanticized conclusions, and fabrication of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pse12|Pseudoarchaeology – Atlantis to Aliens]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not one singular pseudoarchaeological theory, but many different interpretations of the past that are at odds from those developed by persons who know and understand the data. Some of these revolve around the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]], an idea propagated by those such as Swiss author [[Erich von Däniken]] in books such as ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' (1968) and Italian author [[Peter Kolosimo]]. Others instead hold that there were human societies in the ancient period that were significantly technologically advanced, such as [[Atlantis]], and this idea has been propagated by figures like [[Graham Hancock]] in his ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995).

Many alternative archaeologies have been adopted by religious groups. Fringe archaeological ideas such as [[archaeocryptography]] and [[pyramidology]] have been embraced by religions ranging from the [[British Israelites]] to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]. Other alternative archaeologies include those that have been adopted by members of [[New Age]] and [[Neopaganism|contemporary pagan]] belief systems.

Academic archaeologists have heavily criticised pseudoarchaeology, with one of the most vocal critics, John R. Cole, characterising it as relying on "sensationalism, misuse of logic and evidence, misunderstanding of scientific method, and internal contradictions in their arguments".&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 02"&gt;[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between alternative and academic archaeologies has been compared to the relationship between [[intelligent design]] theories and [[evolutionary biology]] by some archaeologists.&lt;ref name="fagan721"&gt;[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Various different terms have been employed to refer to these non-academic interpretations of archaeology. During the 1980s, the term "cult archaeology" was used by figures like John R. Cole (1980)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col80|Cole 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt; and William H. Stiebing Jr. (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the term "alternative archaeology" began to be instead applied by academics like Tim Sebastion (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seb01|Sebastion 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Wallis (2003),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal03|Wallis 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelius Holtorf (2006),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabriel Moshenka (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mos08|Moshenka 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett F. Fagan and [[Kenneth Feder]] (2006) however claimed this term was only chosen because it "imparts a warmer, fuzzier feel" that "appeals to our higher ideals and progressive inclinations".&lt;ref name="fagan720"/&gt; They argued that the term "pseudoarchaeology" was far more appropriate,&lt;ref name="fagan720"/&gt; a term also used by other prominent academic and professional archaeologists such as [[Colin Renfrew]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other academic archaeologists have chosen to use other terms to refer to these interpretations. [[Glyn Daniel]], the editor of ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', used the derogative "bullshit archaeology",&lt;ref name="fagan720"/&gt; and similarly the academic William H. Stiebing Jr. noted that there were certain terms used for pseudoarchaeology that were heard "in the privacy of professional archaeologists' homes and offices but which cannot be mentioned in polite society".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr 1987]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
William H. Stiebing Jr. argued that despite their many differences, there were a set of core characteristics that almost all pseudoarchaeological interpretations shared. He believed that because of this, pseudoarchaeology could be categorised as a "single phenomenon". He went on to identify three core commonalities of pseudeoarchaeological theories: the unscientific nature of its method and evidence, its history of providing "simple, compact answers to complex, difficult issues", and its tendency to present itself as being persecuted by the archaeological establishment, accompanied by an ambivalent attitude towards the scientific ethos of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea that there are core characteristics of pseudoarchaeologies is shared by other academics.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of scientific method===
Academic critics have pointed out that pseudoarchaeologists typically neglect to use the [[scientific method]]. Instead of testing the evidence to see what hypotheses it fits, pseudoarchaeologists "press-gang" the archaeological data to fit a "favored conclusion" that is often arrived at through hunches, intuition, or religious or nationalist dogma.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Different pseudoarchaeological groups hold a variety of basic assumptions which are typically unscientific: the [[Nazi]] pseudoarchaeologists for instance took the cultural superiority of the ancient [[Aryan]] race as a basic assumption, whilst Judeo-Christian [[fundamentalist]] pseudoarchaeologists conceive of the Earth as being less than 10,000 years old and Hindu fundamentalist pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' species is much older than the 200,000 years old it has been shown to be by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many of pseudoarchaeology's proponents claim that they reached their conclusions using scientific techniques and methods, even when it is demonstrable that they have not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. pp. 721–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic archaeologist John R. Cole believed that most pseudoarchaeologists do not understand how scientific investigation works, and that they instead believe it to be a "simple, catastrophic right versus wrong battle" between contesting theories.&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 03"&gt;[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of this failure to understand the scientific method, he argued, that the entire pseudoarchaeological approach to their arguments was faulty. He went on to argue that most pseudoarchaeologists do not consider alternative explanations to that which they want to propagate, and that their "theories" were typically just "notions", not having sufficient supporting evidence to allow them to be considered "theories" in the scientific, academic meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly lacking scientific evidence, pseudoarchaeologists typically use other forms of evidence to support their arguments. For instance, they often make use of "generalized cultural comparisons", taking various artefacts and monuments from one society, and highlighting similarities with those of another to support a conclusion that both had a common source—typically an ancient lost civilisation like [[Atlantis]], [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], or an extraterrestrial influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This takes the different artefacts or monuments entirely out of their original contexts, something which is anathema to academic archaeologists, for whom context is of the utmost importance.&lt;ref name="fagan26"&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of evidence used by a number of pseudoarchaeologists is the interpretation of various [[mythology|myths]] as reflecting historical events, but in doing so these myths are often taken out of their cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, pseudoarchaeologist [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] claimed that the myths of migrations and war gods in the Central American [[Aztec]] civilisation represented a cosmic catastrophe that occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vel50|Velikovsky 1950]]. pp. 253–254, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticised by academic archaeologist William H. Stiebing Jr., who noted that such myths only developed in the 12th to the 14th centuries CE, over a millennium after Velikovsky claimed that the events had occurred, and that the Aztec society itself had not even developed by the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Opposition to the archaeological establishment===

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#F0F0F0|align=right|quote=[Academics] have formed a massive and global network through universities, museums, institutes, societies and foundations. And this immense powerhouse and clearing-house of knowledge has presented their dogma of history to the general public totally unhindered and unchallenged from the outside.&amp;nbsp;... On a more sinister note: now this "church of science" has formed a network of watchdog organisations such as [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] and [[The Skeptics Society|The Skeptical Society]] {{sic}} (to name but a few) in order to act as the gatekeepers of the truth (as they see it), ready to come down like the proverbial ton of bricks on all those whom they perceive as "frauds", "charlatans", and "pseudo-scientists" – in short, heretics.|source=Pseudoarchaeologist Robert Bauval on his views of academia (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pseudoarchaeologists typically present themselves as being underdogs facing the much larger archaeological establishment.&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fagan721"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They often use language which disparages academics and dismisses them as being unadventurous, spending all their time in dusty libraries and refusing to challenge the orthodoxies of the establishment lest they lose their jobs. In some more extreme examples, pseudoarchaeologists have accused academic archaeologists of being members of a widespread [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to hide the truth about history from the public.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; When academics challenge pseudoarchaeologists and criticise their theories, many pseudoarchaeologists see it as further evidence that their own ideas are right, and that they are simply being suppressed by members of this academic conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent English archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] admitted that the archaeological establishment was often "set in its ways and resistant to radical new ideas" but that this was not the reason why pseudoarchaeological theories were outright rejected by academics.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2006. p. xii"&gt;[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garrett G. Fagan]] expanded on this, noting how in the academic archaeological community, "New evidence or arguments have to be thoroughly scrutinised to secure their validity&amp;nbsp;... and longstanding, well-entrenched positions will take considerable effort and particularly compelling data to overturn." Fagan noted that pseudoarchaeological theories simply do not have sufficient evidence to back them up and allow them to be accepted by professional archaeologists.&lt;ref name="fagan26"/&gt;

Conversely, many pseudoarchaeologists, whilst criticising the academic archaeological establishment, also attempt to get support from people with academic credentials and affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, they quote historical, and in most cases dead academics to back up their arguments; for instance prominent pseudoarchaeologist [[Graham Hancock]], in his seminal ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995), repeatedly notes that the eminent physicist [[Albert Einstein]] once commented positively on the [[pole shift hypothesis]], a theory that has been abandoned by the academic community but which Hancock supports.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Han95|Hancock 1995]]. pp. 9–11, 468, 471.&lt;/ref&gt; As Fagan noted however, the fact that Einstein was a physicist and not a geologist is not even mentioned by Hancock, nor is the fact that the understanding of [[plate tectonics]] (which came to disprove earth crustal displacement) only came to light following Einstein's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist motivations===

Pseudoarchaeology can be motivated by [[nationalism]] (''[[cf.]]'' [[Nazi archaeology]], using cultural superiority of the ancient Aryan race as a basic assumption to establish the Germanic people as the descendants of the original Aryan 'master race') or a desire to prove a particular [[Religion|religious]] (''cf.'' [[intelligent design]]), [[Pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]], [[politics|political]], or [[anthropology|anthropological]] theory. In many cases, an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conclusion is established, and fieldwork is undertaken explicitly to corroborate the theory in detail. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://facweb.northseattle.edu/ccummings/Archaeology/NSC/the%20past%20as%20propoganda.pdf|title=The Past as Propaganda|last=Arnold|first=Bettina|date=1992|website=northseattle.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists distinguish their research from pseudoarchaeology by pointing to differences in research methodology, including recursive methods, falsifiable theories, peer review, and a generally systematic approach to collecting data. Though there is overwhelming evidence of cultural connections informing folk traditions about the past,&lt;ref name=LOWENTHAL1985&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Lowenthal|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; objective analysis of folk archaeology—in [[anthropology|anthropological]] terms of their cultural contexts and the cultural needs they respond to—have been comparatively few. However, in this vein, [[Robert Silverberg]] located the [[Mormon]]'s use of [[Mound Builders|Mound Builder culture]] within a larger cultural nexus&lt;ref name=SILVERBERG1968&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverberg, Robert|authorlink=Robert Silverberg|title=Moundbuilders of Ancient America|location=Greenwich|publisher=New York Graphics Society|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the voyage of [[Madoc]] and "Welsh Indians" was set in its changing and evolving sociohistorical contexts by Gwyn Williams.&lt;ref name=GWYNWILLIAMS1987&gt;{{cite book|author=Williams, Gwyn A. |authorlink=Gwyn A. Williams|title=Madoc: The Making of a Myth|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious motivations===

Religiously motivated pseudoarchaeological theories include the [[Young Earth creationism|young earth]] theory of some Judeo-Christian fundamentalists. They argue that the Earth is 4,000-10,000 years old, with figures varying, depending on the source. Some Hindu pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''Homo sapiens'' species is much older than the 200,000 years it is generally believed to have existed. Archaeologist John R. Cole refers to such beliefs as "cult archaeology" and believes them to be pseudoarchaeological. He went on to say that this "pseudoarchaeology" had "many of the attributes, causes, and effects of religion".&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 03"/&gt;

A more specific example of religious pseudoarcheology is the claim of [[Ron Wyatt]] to have discovered [[Noah's ark]], the graves of [[Noah]] and his wife, the location of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the [[Tower of Babel]], and numerous other important sites. However, he has not presented evidence sufficient to impress Bible scholars, scientists, and historians. [[Answers in Genesis]] propagates many pseudoscientific notions as part of its [[creationist]] ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ohehir|first1=Andrew|title=Archaeology from the dark side|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/08/31/archaeology/|work=Salon|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trollinger|first1=Susan L.|last2=Trollinger, Jr.|first2=William Vance|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|pages=223–225|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:The Bible and Creationism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Pseudoarchaeology can be practised intentionally or unintentionally. [[Archaeological forgery|Archaeological frauds]] and [[hoax]]es are considered ''intentional pseudoarchaeology''. Genuine archaeological finds may be unintentionally converted to pseudoarchaeology through unscientific interpretation. (''cf.'' [[confirmation bias]])

Especially in the past, but also in the present, pseudoarchaeology has been motivated by [[racism]], especially when the basic intent was to discount or deny the abilities of [[person of color|non-white]] peoples to make significant accomplishments in astronomy, architecture, sophisticated technology, ancient writing, seafaring, and other accomplishments generally identified as evidence of "[[civilization]]".  Racism can be implied by attempts to attribute ancient sites and artefacts to [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes]], [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]], or even [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] rather than to the intelligence and ingenuity of [[indigenous peoples]].

Practitioners of pseudoarchaeology often rail against academic archaeologists and established scientific methods, claiming that conventional science has overlooked critical evidence. [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] may be invoked, in which "the Establishment" colludes in suppressing evidence.

Countering the misleading "discoveries" of pseudoarchaeology binds academic archaeologists in a quandary, described by Cornelius Holtorf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holtorf, Cornelius|title=Beyond Crusades: How (Not) to Engage with Alternative Archaeologies|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4| postscript =Debates in "World Archaeology" |date=December 2005|pages=544–551|doi=10.1080/00438240500395813}}&lt;/ref&gt; as whether to strive to disprove alternative approaches in a "crusading" approach or to concentrate on better public understanding of the sciences involved; Holtorf suggested a third, relativist and contextualised&lt;ref&gt;"We might want to remind ourselves of the truism that every past is the construct of a particular present-day context" (p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; approach, in identifying the social and cultural needs that both scientific and alternative archaeologies address and in identifying the engagement with the [[Material culture|material remains]] of the past in the present in terms of critical understanding and dialogue with "multiple pasts", such as Barbara Bender explored for [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;Bender, ''Stonehenge'', vol. 1 ''Making Space (Materializing Culture) '', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In presenting the quest for truths as process rather than results, Holtorf quoted [[Gotthold Lessing]] (''Eine Duplik'', 1778):
&lt;blockquote&gt;If God were to hold in his right hand all the truth and in his left the unique ever-active spur for truth, although with the corollary to err forever, asking me to choose, I would humbly take his left and say "Father, give; for the pure truth is for you alone!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Archaeological readings of the landscape enrich the experience of inhabiting or visiting a place," Holtorf asserted. "Those readings may well be based on science but even non-scientific research contributes to enriching our landscapes."&lt;ref&gt;Holtorf 2005:548.&lt;/ref&gt; The question for opponents of folk archaeology is whether such enrichment is delusional.

Participatory [[community archaeology|"public" or "community" archaeology]] offers guided engagement.

==In history==

In the mid-2nd century, those exposed by [[Lucian]]'s sarcastic essay [[Alexander of Abonoteichus|"Alexander the false prophet"]] prepared an archaeological "find" in [[Chalcedon]] to prepare a public for the supposed oracle they planned to establish at [[Abonoteichus]] in [[Paphlagonia]] (Pearse, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Translated and notes by A.M. Harmon, 1936, Published in Loeb Classical Library, 9 volumes, Greek texts and facing English translation: Harvard University Press. This extract transcribed by Roger Pearse, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;):
{{quote|[I]n the temple of Apollo, which is the most ancient in Chalcedon, they buried bronze tablets which said that very soon [[Asclepius]], with his father Apollo, would move to [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] and take up his residence at Abonoteichus. The opportune discovery of these tablets caused this story to spread quickly to all [[Bithynia]] and Pontus, and to Abonoteichus sooner than anywhere else.}}

At [[Glastonbury Abbey]] in 1291, at a time when [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] desired to emphasize his "Englishness", a fortunate discovery was made: the coffin of [[King Arthur]], unmistakably identified with an inscribed plaque. Arthur was reinterred at Glastonbury in a magnificent ceremonial attended by the king and queen.

==Academic archaeological responses==
Pseudoarchaeological theories have come to be heavily criticised by academic and professional archaeologists. Prominent academic archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] stated his opinion that it was appalling that pseudoarchaeologists treated archaeological evidence in such a "frivolous and self-serving way", something he believed trivialised the "serious matter" of the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Academics like John R. Cole,&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 02"/&gt; [[Garrett G. Fagan]] and Kenneth L. Feder&lt;ref name="fagan720"/&gt; have argued that pseudoarchaeological interpretations of the past were based upon sensationalism, self-contradiction, fallacious logic, manufactured or misinterpreted evidence, quotes taken out of context and incorrect information. Fagan and Feder characterised such interpretations of the past as being "anti-reason and anti-science" with some being "hyper-nationalistic, racist and hateful".&lt;ref name="fagan720"/&gt; In turn, many pseudoarchaeologists have dismissed academics as being close minded and not willing to consider theories other than their own.&lt;ref name="Cole 1980. p. 02"/&gt;

Many academic archaeologists have argued that the spread of alternative archaeological theories is a threat to the general public's understanding of the past. Fagan was particularly scathing of television shows that presented pseudoarchaeological theories to the general public, believing that they did so because of the difficulties in making academic archaeological ideas comprehensible and interesting to the average viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fag03|Fagan 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Renfrew however believed that those television executives commissioning these documentaries knew that they were erroneous, and that they had allowed them to be made and broadcast simply in the hope of "short-term financial gain".&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2006. p. xii"/&gt;

Fagan and Feder believed that it was not possible for academic archaeologists to successfully engage with pseudoarchaeologists, remarking that "you cannot reason with unreason". Speaking from their own experiences, they thought that attempted dialogues just became "slanging matches in which the expertise and motives of the critic become the main focus of attention."&lt;ref name="fagan721"/&gt; Fagan has maintained this idea elsewhere, remarking that arguing with supporters of pseudoarchaeological theories was "pointless" because they denied logic. He noted that they included those "who openly admitted to not having read a word written by a trained Egyptologist" but who at the same time "were pronouncing how academic Egyptology was all wrong, even sinister."&lt;ref name="Fagan 2006a. p. xvii"&gt;[[#Fag06a|Fagan 2006a]]. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences and anthologies===

At the 1986 meeting of the [[Society for American Archaeology]], its organizers, [[Kenneth Feder]], Luanne Hudson and Francis Harrold decided to hold a symposium to examine pseudoarchaeological beliefs from a variety of academic standpoints, including archaeology, physical anthropology, sociology, history and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; From this symposium, an anthology was produced, entitled ''Cult Archaeology &amp; Creationism: Understanding Pseudoarchaeological Beliefs about the Past'' (1987).

At the 2002 annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], a workshop was held on the topic of pseudoarchaeology. It subsequently led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misinterprets the Past and Misleads the Public'' (2006), which was edited by [[Garrett G. Fagan]].&lt;ref name="Fagan 2006a. p. xvii"/&gt;

On 23 and 24 April 2009, The [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] and the [[Duke University]] Center for Jewish Studies, along with the Duke Department of Religion, the Duke Graduate Program in Religion, the [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]] Committee on Faculty Research, and the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]], sponsored a conference entitled "Archaeology, Politics, and the Media," which addressed the abuse of archaeology in the [[Holy Land]] for political, religious, and ideological purposes. Emphasis was placed on the media's reporting of sensational and politically motivated archaeological claims and the academy's responsibility in responding to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://fds.duke.edu/db?attachment-110--0-view-790|title=The Duke Symposium on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media:Re-visioning the Middle East|date=April 23–24, 2009|publisher=[[Duke University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url=http://asorblog.org/?p=252|title=Audio of Duke Conference on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=ASOR Blog|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013191654/http://asorblog.org/?p=252 |archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url=https://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/center-for-jewish-studies/id420501356#ls=1|title=Center for Jewish Studies – Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=Duke Center for Jewish Studies iTunesU page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive attitudes===
Academic archaeologist Cornelius Holtorf believed however that critics of alternative archaeologies like Fagan were "opinionated and patronizing" towards alternative theories, and that purporting their views in such a manner was damaging to the public's perception of archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt; Holtorf highlighted that there were similarities between academic and alternative archaeological interpretations, with the former taking some influence from the latter. As evidence, he highlighted [[archaeoastronomy]], which was once seen as a core component of fringe archaeological interpretations before being adopted by mainstream academics.&lt;ref name="Holtorf 2005. p. 547"&gt;[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that certain archaeological scholars, like [[William Stukeley]] (1687–1765), [[Margaret Murray]] (1863–1963) and [[Marija Gimbutas]] (1921–1994) were seen as significant figures to both academic and alternative archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Holtorf 2005. p. 547"/&gt; He came to the conclusion that a constructive dialogue should be opened up between academic and alternative archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; Fagan and Feder have responded to Holtorf's views in detail, asserting that such a dialogue is no more possible than is one between evolutionary biologists and creationists or between astronomers and astrologers: one approach is scientific, the other is anti-scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[Fagan and Feder 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Kenneth Feder conducted a survey of his archaeology students. On the 50-question survey, 10 questions had to do with archaeology and/or pseudoscience. Some of the claims were more rational; the world is 5 billion years old, and human beings came about through evolution. However, questions also included issues such as, [[King Tut]]’s tomb actually killed people upon discovery, and there is solid evidence for the existence of Atlantis. As it turned out, some of the students Feder was teaching put some stake in the pseudoscience claims. 12% actually believed people on [[Howard Carter]]’s expedition were killed by [[Curse of the pharaohs|an ancient Egyptian curse]].&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L. (1984). "Irrationality and Popular Archaeology.” American Antiquity Vol 49(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi.jpg|center|280px]]|caption=Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi. The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}

A '''rite of passage''' is a ceremony of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', "The Rites of Passage".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.

== Original conception ==
In English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, "as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors."&lt;ref name=Journet&gt;{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque société générale peut être considérée comme une sorte de maison divisée en chambres et couloirs}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.

Van Gennep further distinguishes between "the secular" and "the sacred sphere." Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent "the simplest level of development," he hypothesizes that "[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations." Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.

The rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ...." He is able to find some universals, mainly two: "the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred." (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.

==Stages==
Rites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. "I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. "The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80.&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a detachment or "cutting away" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is "cutting away" the former self: the civilian.

The transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. "The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the rite and assumed their "new" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus "in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==

Laboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson &amp; Mills 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.&lt;ref&gt;Keating ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural==

Initiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.&lt;ref name="Shahadah"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are "a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim&lt;/ref&gt; In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].

==Types and examples==
Rites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. [[Adventure education]] programs, such as [[Outward Bound]], have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase.&lt;ref&gt;Cushing 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the "Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11902">'''Robert Jaulin''' (7 March 1928, [[Le Cannet]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]] – 21 November 1996, [[Grosrouvre]]) was a French [[ethnologist]]. After several journeys to [[Chad]], between 1954 and 1959, among the [[Sara people]], he published in 1967 ''La Mort Sara'' (The Sara Death) in which he exposed the various [[initiation rite]]s through which he had passed himself, and closely analyzed Sara [[geomancy]].&lt;ref name=EU&gt;[http://vadeker.club.fr/corpus/robert_jaulin.html Entry ''Robert Jaulin''] in the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''La Paix blanche'' (The White peace, 1970), he redefined the notion of [[ethnocide]] in relation to the extermination by the [[Western world]] of the [[Motilon people|Bari]] culture, located between [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]. If a [[genocide]] designs the physical extermination of a people, an ethnocide refers to the extermination of a culture.

== Life ==

Jaulin has given particular attention to phenomenons of [[acculturation]] and highlight the importance of [[cultural relativism]] in order to respect other cultures. Although he was part of the [[humanism|humanist]] tradition of [[universalism]] seen through a [[multiculturalist]] viewpoint, he opposed a universalist method of ethnology which would try to abstract general laws from the study of particular societies &amp;mdash; targeting in particular [[structuralism]],&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; preferring, on [[Malinowski]]'s steps, to immerge himself in one specific culture and closely describe it. In this aim, he theorized a specific approach to ethnology, dubbed in 1985 ''ethnologie pariseptiste'' by [[Yves Lecerf]] in an attempt to describe Jaulin's teachings at the [[University of Paris-VII]] since [[May '68]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert de Luze, [http://vadeker.club.fr/corpus/pariseptisme_ethnologie.html L'ethnologie pariseptiste et Robert Jaulin], extract of ''La Science de l'homme : d'Hécatée de Milet à Harold Garfinkel : esquisse panoramique d'une grande aventure intellectuelle à l'usage de ceux qui n'en ont qu'une idée vague.'' Paris. Loris Talmart. 1997 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaulin signed the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]'' opposed to the use of [[torture during the Algerian War]] (1954–62). After a journey among the Bari in [[South America]], he called for a convention on ethnocide in the Americas at the Congress of [[International Congress of Americanists|Americanists]], and in February, 1970, the French Society of Americanists convened for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/div/theme2.htm Yale-Edinburgh Group on the History of the Missionary Movement and Non-Western Christianity] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaulin criticized in particular the role of [[Catholic Church and colonialism|Christian missionaries]] towards non-Western cultures.

In 1970, he created at the [[University of Paris-VII]] the first department dedicated to ethnology, [[anthropology]] and [[Religious studies|science of religions]], to which participated scholars such as the philosopher [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Pierre Bernard (philosopher)|Pierre Bernard]], [[Bernard Delfendahl]], [[Serge Moscovici]], [[Jean Rouch]], [[Michel de Certeau]], etc.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

== The concept of ethnocide ==
{{see also|Ethnocide}}

Robert Jaulin redefined the concept of ethnocide in 1970 with his ground-breaking ''La paix blanche : introduction à l’ethnocide'' ("White Peace: Introduction to Ethnocide"). This capital work, which remains to be translated into English, gives a detailed account of the ethnocide-in-motion suffered by the Bari, an Indian people living on the border between Venezuela and Colombia, in the second half of the sixties, as witnessed by Robert Jaulin himself. Whether conflicting or collaborating among themselves, multiple vectors of ethnocide in place (the [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|Catholic Church]] and other Christian confessions, the Venezuelan and the Colombian armies, the American oil company [[Colpet]], and all the “little colonists” as Jaulin calls them) converged to the relentless disavowal and destruction of Bari’s culture and society. 

In Jaulin’s understanding of the notion, it is not the ''means'' but the ''ends'' that define ethnocide. Accordingly, the ethnocide would be the systematic destruction of the thought or culture and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the ethnocide kills them in their spirit and culture.

Collective and arbitrary murder, systematic abduction of children to raise them away from their parent’s culture, active and degrading religious propaganda, forced work, expulsion from the homeland or compulsory abandonment of cultural habits and social structure, all these practices, described by Robert Jaulin, have in common a deep despise for the other man and woman as representatives of a different cultural world.

Along with a detailed description and analysis of Bari’s case, ''La paix blanche'' is also a broad reflection on [[Western culture|Western civilization]]’s tendency to disacknowledge, lower and destroy other cultural worlds as it comes in touch with them, while extending its own domain, bringing the focus of the discussion back from the frontiers of Western civilization to its core and its history. As he takes his inquiry back in time, Jaulin shows that the way the West relates to other civilizations is a continuation of the way it has always related to its own inner cultural diversity, from the monotheistic exclusion of the representatives of different and differing cultural spaces (the “other” gods, divinities, entities, etc.) to its reinstatement under the successive garments of Reason, Revolution, Progress or Science.

A long reflection on the dynamics that led to worldwide ethnocide, its different “masks”, its history and, according to him, one of its earliest manifestations, [[monotheism]], led Robert Jaulin to a complete reappraisal of the phenomenal and conceptual fields polarized by the notion of ethnocide. 

This reassessment took its final shape in the 1995’s work, ''L’univers des totalitarismes : Essai d’ethnologie du “non-être”'' (in free translation: "The Universe of Totalitarianisms: An Ethnological Essay on “Non-Being”"). In this book, the notion of “totalitarianism” (which should not be mistaken for [[Hannah Arendt]]’s concept of [[totalitarianism]]) depicts the underlying dynamics of which ethnocide becomes a manifestation among others.

Robert Jaulin defines totalitarianism as an abstract ''scheme'' or ''machine'' of non-relation to cultural otherness characterized by the expansion of "oneself " ("''soi''") through an election/exclusion logic. The totalitarian machine operates by splitting the universe into its own “agents” on the one side, and its “objects” on the other, whether they be individuals, families, groups, societies or whole civilizations. It proceeds by depriving the later of their quality of ''cultural subjects'' through the erosion and finally the suppression of their space of tradition and cultural invention, which mediates their relation with themselves, i.e. their reflexivity. With the mutilation of their “field of cultural potentialities”, as Jaulin calls it, the totalitarian dynamics transforms its “objects” into new “agents” of expansion, reduced to a mock self-relation defined by the horizon of a potential ''election''. However, to become actual this election needs to articulate with a pole of ''exclusion''; thus the need of a new expansion of this universe of non-relation, the ''universe of totalitarianisms'', by definition an endlessly expanding universe whose theoretical limits paradoxically coincide with its own self-destruction.

The election/exclusion logics works by means of pairs of contradictory and, therefore, mutually exclusive terms. Their content may be as varied as the different semantic domains invested by the totalitarian machine: chosen/doomed, religion/magic, truth/falseness, literate/illiterate, savage/civilized, subject/object, intellectual/manual, proletarians/capitalists, science/illusion, subjectivity/objectivity, etc. In all these contradictory pairs, one of the poles “means” to occupy the whole field; but at the same time, its own meaning and “existence” depends on the virtually excluded pole.

According to Robert Jaulin, the asymmetrical relation portrayed by these pairs is but the starting point of totalitarian movement, its static and temporary position. Its dynamics derives from the “wished for” or prospective ''inversion'' of the relation between its two poles. This may happen through the totalitarian pair defining the pre-existing situation, the design of a new one or, more often, through recovery and adaptation of old formulas.

The recovery of the Marxist proletarian/capitalistic contradictory pair or the even older monotheistic chosen/doomed couple by many Independence or Prophetic Movements in the former European colonies as a means of inverting the pre-existing totalitarian field is an instance of the shifts through which the “totalitarian trajectory” reinvents itself. This example also shows the place of ethnocide within the overall totalitarian dynamics as the dialectical alternate to totalitarian inversion.

Such an inexorable and elementary logic, with its ability to migrate to, pervade and finally destroy ever-differing cultural and social worlds, accounts for the endlessly restarted trajectory of totalitarianism’s two-pole field through time and space.

"'''Selma's Choice'''" is the thirteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 21, 1993.&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-4_episode-13 |title=Selma's Choice |accessdate=2011-09-17 |publisher=The Simpsons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]] decides to have a baby, inspired by her late aunt's wish that she would not spend her life alone. She experiences what life with children is like by taking [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] to the [[Duff Gardens]] amusement park, which does not go as planned. It was written by [[David M. Stern]] and directed by [[Carlos Baeza]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Plot==
After watching an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] decide to go. As they prepare to leave, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] tells them that spinster [[Gladys Gurney|Great Aunt Gladys]] died and they will be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with [[Patty and Selma]], drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her [[will (law)|will]]. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her [[chronobiology|biological clock]], and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by [[Groundskeeper Willie]]. She goes to a [[psychic]] who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates [[Hans Moleman]] after revoking his license at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through [[artificial insemination]].

When the day comes for Homer to take Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens, he falls ill from [[food poisoning]] after eating a [[Submarine sandwich|hoagie]] that became spoiled days, if not weeks earlier after he took it home from a company picnic. In an attempt to give Selma a taste of motherhood, Marge nominates her to take the kids to Duff Gardens while she stays home to look after Homer.

When the trio arrives at Duff Gardens, Bart and Lisa wear Selma out, especially when they go on the Little Land of Duff ride and Bart dares Lisa to drink the toxic "water". Lisa is confused, but Bart mocks her until Selma intervenes, shouting at Bart to shut up and ordering Lisa to drink the water. When Lisa takes a sip, she hallucinates, grows violent and paranoid, and wanders away from the ride, tripping out to the parade music. While Selma is looking for Lisa, Bart gets on a roller coaster called The Barrel Roll and ends up having to be rescued after the car stops in the center of one of the inversions. Lisa is soon found [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]] in the Fermentarium, returned to Selma and given pills by an unlicensed doctor.

After Bart and Lisa return home, Selma decides she can live without children for now and adopts [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jub-Jub|Jub-Jub]], Gladys' pet [[iguana]].

==Production==
Writer David Stern said he wanted to go back to a "Patty and Selma episode", because it was sustained so well when he wrote "[[Principal Charming]]".&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite video |people=Stern, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Selma's Choice" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it was important to "keep these characters (Patty and Selma) alive." The animators had trouble with the size of the characters' pupils during [[The Simpsons (season 4)|the season]]. In this episode, they are noticeably larger.&lt;ref name=Reardon&gt;{{cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Selma's Choice" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the family watches the video will, Julie Kavner did five voices in the scene.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; When Great Aunt Gladys shows off her collection of potato chips, the scene was inspired by Myrtle Young, who appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. During an interview with David Letterman, Young said she was working in quality control at a potato chip factory, and collected potato chips that looked like, amongst other things, famous people.&lt;ref name=Jean&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Selma's Choice" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene where Homer ate a chip is a reference to the Johnny Carson appearance, where, whilst Young was looking away, Johnny ate a chip from a separate bowl (not of the collection), Young, thinking Johnny had ate a chip from her collection, was shocked, before Johnny cleared up the misuderstanding. [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jub-Jub|Jub-Jub]] made his debut appearance in this episode; the name of the iguana Jub-Jub came from [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

Though research is usually done when real languages are used on the show,&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; the language heard on Selma's ham radio is fictional.&lt;ref name=Jean/&gt;

==Cultural references==
The episode title is a take on the 1982 film ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]''. Marge's flashback of her and her sisters swimming in a lake is based on ''[[The Prince of Tides]]''.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; The singers at Duff Gardens, Hooray for Everything, are a parody of the musical group [[Up with People]].&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite video |people=Reiss, Mike |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Selma's Choice" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is seen performing a kid-friendly version of the [[Lou Reed]] song "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]". Homer and Bart start to sing "[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]" from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The poem that Great Aunt Gladys reads at the start of her video will is "[[The Road Not Taken (poem)|The Road Not Taken]]" by [[Robert Frost]].  Duff Gardens is a parody of [[Busch Gardens]], originally developed as a marketing vehicle for the Anheuser-Busch brewing company.  The song and ride that Bart, Lisa, and Selma go on, with animatronic kids from all over the world singing is a parody of the song "[[It's a Small World]]".&lt;ref name=Jean/&gt; The Duff Gardens parade is a parody of [[Disneyland]]'s [[Main Street Electrical Parade]].&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;as Lisa's hallucination where she sees Selma after drinking the water on the ride is based on the work of artist [[Ralph Steadman]], particularly in the novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''. When Lisa says "I am the Lizard Queen!", it is a tribute to [[Jim Morrison]]'s poem "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; After acquiring Jub-Jub, Selma sings "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]", a reference to the season four finale of the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', in which reporter Murphy Brown sings the song after giving birth to her baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtJ28qOEG1g | title="The Simpsons" Writers Reunion – Serious Jibber-Jabber with Conan O'Brien – CONAN on TBS | publisher=Team Coco | date=17 April 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"Selma's Choice" finished 27th in the weekly ratings for the week of January 18–24, 1993 with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 14.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings/Jan. 18–24 |date=1993-01-27 |page=C5 |publisher=[[Press-Telegram]] |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said, "A nice episode for Selma and good for Marge and Homer as well. But it's the kids who provide the highlights in this one, with their antics at Duff Gardens."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season4/page14.shtml |title=Selma's Choice |accessdate=2008-01-21 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=1993 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation'', Chris Turner said it "Fills in with the usual grab bag of great gags" and "The episode had some crowd-pleasing moments."
He went on to say, "The last few minutes of the show played out to continuous laughter [in the pub he was watching it in]".{{sfn|Turner|2004}}

'''Terrassa''' ({{IPA-ca|təˈrasə}}, {{lang-es|Tarrasa}}) is a city in the east central region of [[Catalonia]], in the [[province of Barcelona]], ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Vallès Occidental]], of which it is the cocapital along with [[Sabadell]].

It is the site of Roman '''Egara''', a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

The city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressió Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range (Natural reserve of Sant Llorenç del Munt) and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from [[Barcelona]] and [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] respectively.

Terrassa is the third largest city in Catalonia, after Barcelona and L’Hospitalet.
== History ==
[[File:Masia Freixa 1.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Masia Freixa of Terrassa, sea of parabolic arches]]
The remains that have been found indicate that the area where Terrassa stands has been inhabited since prehistory. In 2005, during the construction of a tunnel for one of the city's railway lines, a prehistoric site was found in the Park of Vallparadís [http://www.terrassa.cat/vallparadis], with stone tools and fossils of hunted animals dating back  800,000 to 1,000,000 years, making this is one of the oldest prehistoric sites in [[Europe]].

Terrassa originated as the Roman town of ''Egara'' (''Municipium Flavium Egara''), which was founded during the time of the emperor [[Vespasian]] (69-79 CE), alongside the torrent of Vallparadís (nowadays an urban park) close to the [[Iberians|Iberian]] town of ''Egosa'',  on the site of which some ceramics and coins have been found.

Other important remains from the Middle Ages are the former cathedral, the castle of Vallparadís (from 1344 to 1413 a [[Carthusian]] monastery and today a municipal museum) and the tower of the castle-palace of the [[Counts of Barcelona|count-king]].

In the 19th century the city played an important role in the industrial revolution, specializing in woollen fabrics, and today there is a major ''[[Modernisme|Modernista]]'' legacy as a result of the city's importance at that time. Particularly notable ''Modernista'' buildings include the [[Masia]] Freixa (1907), the Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover [[textile mill]] (1907) (now the [[MNACTEC|Museum of Science and Industry of Catalonia]]), the Principal theater (1920), the city hall (1902), the Alegre de Sagrera house/museum (1911), [[School of Engineering of Terrassa|the Industrial School]] (1904), the Gran Casino (1920), the Parc de Desinfecció (1920), and the Independència market (1908). Terrassa is a partner city of the [[Réseau Art Nouveau Network|Art nouveau network]] [http://www.artnouveau-net.eu], a European network of co-operation created in 1999 for the study, preservation and development of [[Art Nouveau]].

=== Catastrophies ===
[[File:Flood 1962.jpg|alt= Terrassa Flood 1962|thumb|Results of the 1962 flood in Terrassa the day after. Picture obtained in the Tobella's archive.]]
The 25 September 1962, after a long dry season, between 212 and 252 litres of rain per square metre fell in three hours. It caused rivers [[Llobregat]] and [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] and their tributaries to overflow, creating a water avenue that caused 700 victims and lots of material losses.

The [[Vallès Occidental]] ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' was the most damaged. In particularly Terrassa, with 327 victims. The reason of these numbers was that building was permitted around two dry streams used to bring rain water to the [[Llobregat]] river. They met in a wedge shape and were not properly [[Channelized (river)|channelized]]. When the streams overflowed created what was called "the dead triangle", with more than a hundred victims only in the Ègara neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recordsdeterrassa.wordpress.com/riuades-1962/|title=Riuades 1962|date=2012-03-04|language=ca-ES|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==
[[File:Egara. Conjunt episcopal.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Ancient churches of Ègara.]]
The episcopal see of Ègara already existed by about 450 CE, when it was established on territory split off from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barcelona|Roman Catholic Diocese of Barcelona]], under the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Tarragona]]. [[Pope Hilarius]] confirmed its autonomy be denying a request around 469 to unite it with the Barcelona under its own first bishop, Ireneus.

It comprised parts of these [[Comarques of Catalonia]] (Catalan districts) : [[Alt Penedès]], [[Anoia]], [[Baix Llobregat]], [[Vallès Occidental]] and [[Vallès Oriental]]. A Provincial Council of Tarragona was held there in 615.

It effectively succumbed to the Arab (Muslim) conquest in the 8th century and was probably suppressed, its territory being (rather nominally) returned to the [[Diocese of Barcelona]]. The Marian cathedral continued to exist until 718, when it was taken over during the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], but was rebuilt in the 12th century, and remains part of a monumental complex of ancient [[Visigoths|Visigothic]]-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches of Sant Pere de Terrassa and Sant Miquel on the site.

After the Catholic [[Reconquista]] of the region in the tenth century, the see was not restored, its territory being incorporated in the (mother) diocese of Barcelona. Why a request to restore the bishopric by its Metropolitan of Tarragona, Cesareo, wasn't honored by [[Pope John XII]] (955-964) is unclear.
 
=== Episcopal Ordinaries ===
;''Suffragan Bishops of Egara''
* Ireneo (450? – death 465)

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank:
* Justo Goizueta Gridilla, [[Augustinian Recollects]] (O.A.R.) (1970.01.14 – retired 1978.02.15), as [[Bishop-Prelate]] of [[Territorial Prelature of Madera]] ([[Mexico]]) (1970.01.14 – 1988.02.02), previously Apostolic Administrator of same Madera (1967 – 1970.01.14); died 1991
* Juan Francisco Sarasti Jaramillo, [[Eudists]] (C.I.M.) (1978.03.08 – 1983.12.23) as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cali]] ([[Colombia]]) (1978.03.08 – 1983.12.23); later Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Barrancabermeja|Barrancabermeja]] (Colombia) (1983.12.23 – 1993.03.25), Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ibagué|Ibagué]] (Colombia) (1993.03.25 – 2002.08.17), Metropolitan Archbishop of above Cali (2002.08.17 – retired 2011.05.18) and Apostolic Administrator of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buenaventura|Buenaventura]] (Colombia) (2004.02.21 – 2004.04.29)
* Paulius Antanas Baltakis, [[Friars Minor]] (O.F.M.) (1984.06.01 – ...), no prelature so far

== Notable Sites ==

=== The churches of Sant Pere (Saint Peter) ===
[[File:Egara. Sant Miquel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sant Miquel.]]
[[File:Huguet-santsAbdoSenen-0021 collage.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Altarpiece of Sant Abdó i Sant Senén.]]
These three churches were built close to the site of old Ègara to be the seat of the Ègara [[Diocese]], which was founded around 450 CE and remained in existence until the 8th century. This episcopal complex follows the Byzantine model of antiquity, with two churches (Sant Pere and Santa Maria) and a [[mausoleum]] (Sant Miquel). After a long period of construction, the churches were finished in the then-current manner about the 11th and 12th  centuries and in Romanesque style, on the site of the  pre-Romanesque buildings of the Visigothic period.
The church of Santa Maria contains outstanding works of art, and there are murals dating from the  Romanesque period to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

== Transportation ==
Terrassa is well connected with Barcelona's [[port]] and [[airport]] by [[highway]] and [[railway]]. The C-58 and [[C-16 (highway)|C-16]]  also link the city with ([[Manresa]]), ([[Girona]], [[France]]), and ([[Tarragona]]).

The [[railway]] reached Terrassa in 1856, and nowadays two lines serve the city. The first, operated by [[RENFE]], connects with Barcelona and [[Lleida]], and the second, operated by [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]], with Barcelona. Recently FGC extended its line to the north of the city, building three new stations; one of them acts as a rail hub with the RENFE line. This extension is known as the [[Terrassa Metro]].

Several interurban bus lines connect Terrassa with the closest cities and towns such as [[Sabadell]], [[Castellar del Vallès]], [[Martorell]], [[Rubí, Barcelona|Rubí]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]] and [[Vacarisses]].

Transport inside the city is provided by [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008043512/http://www.tmesa.com/PopUpPlanoGral.asp?Idioma=CA&amp;Diseno= 14 bus lines] operated by a municipal company (Transports Municipals d'Ègara). In the future, when the three new FGC stations and the two planned for the RENFE line are in use, the railway will also serve as urban transport.

== Culture ==
A lot of musicians and actors are based in Terrassa because of the large number of music schools, a long amateur theater tradition and the local seat of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051030003931/http://www.institutdelteatre.org/ University of Drama]. From 1982 the [http://www.jazzterrassa.org Terrassa Jazz Festival] is specially outstanding, with guests like [[Stan Getz]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Tete Montoliu]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]].

=== Mass media ===
Terrasa has a local newspaper, the ''Diari de Terrassa'', that is published daily from Tuesday to Saturday, as well as several radio stations: Ràdio Terrassa/Cadena SER Vallès on 828 AM and 89.4 FM, with more than 75 years of history behind it, being one of the pioneering radio stations in Catalonia and Spain; the municipal radio (Noucincpuntdos, 95.2 FM); and Radio Star de Terrassa, the city's cultural station, on 100.5 FM, which was founded in 1984 and is one of the historic local radios of Catalonia.

Also the city has several local channels - TV20 Locàlia Vallès and Canal Terrassa, with an audience of more than 50,000 viewers. In addition, there is the free newspaper ''Terrassa Societat'', published monthly with a circulation of  50,000, and ''Terrassa Month'',  published of Monday through Friday and also covering local events. Since 2005  the municipal digital newspaper e-newsterrassa.com, in Catalan, has been on line ''(today as for 2013 this digital newspaper has been taken down now)''.

== Sports ==
Terrassa was a pioneer in the introduction of [[field hockey]] and [[korfball]] in Catalonia and played an important role in the introduction of [[basketball]]. The most important sport in the city is field hockey. During the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympic Games]] in 1992, Terrassa was the city where the field hockey competition was played. The great number of hockey players from Terrassa who have participated in the [[Olympic Games]] over the years has led to Terrassa's being referred to as the "most Olympic city in the world". Between 1928 and 2004, Terrassa sent 124 athletes to the Olympic Games, the majority of whom were hockey players. Three local field hockey clubs play in the main Spanish league championship:
*Atlètic Terrassa Hockey Club (also with a women's team) 
*Club Egara (also with a women's team)
*Club Deportiu Terrassa (also with a women's team)

Atlètic Terrassa and Club Egara have won the EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.

Other local sports teams include Club Natació Terrassa ([[water polo]]), which won the 2006 LEN Trophy); [[Terrassa FC]] ([[football (soccer)|football]]), and Sferic Terrassa ([[basketball]]).

Terrassa is the home and birthplace of [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Spain national football team]] midfielder [[Xavi]].

The city's [[castell]]s teams are the [[Minyons de Terrassa]] and the [[Castellers de Terrassa]].

'''''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''''' is an essay written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] which first appeared in The New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine in 1843. It was later reprinted in the “Medical Essays” in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.htm|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is included as Volume 38, Part 5 of the [[Harvard Classics]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Classics, Vol. 38, Part 5   The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Synopsis==

In just under 12,000 words Holmes argues forcefully and convincingly that the rampant infection killing women within a few days of childbirth was caused mainly through infection spread by their birth attendants. He also laid down well-thought out and easy to execute behaviors through which the spread of infection could be contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==

Holmes developed an interest in [[puerperal fever]] by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1838 to 1840.  In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination of a woman who had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
“The disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|date=1843|publisher=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery 1|page=213|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery in April 1843.  Due to low circulation of this specialized journal and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary of Practical Medicine. Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that "Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=James|title=A Dictionary of Practical Medicine|date=1852|publisher=New York: Harper and Brothers|location=volume 7|page=559|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnellé, Dugé, Dewees and others still denying this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Twelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it “Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.” He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence|date=1855|publisher=Boston: Ticknor and Fields|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">{{Toc right}}'''''The Vows of the Heron''''' (''Voeux du héron'') c.1346 is a satirical Flemish poem, which purported to explain the causes of the [[Hundred Years' War]] in terms of the goading into action by a Low Country exile of [[Edward III of England]].

==Background==
[[Robert III of Artois]], in exile in England, was a significant bone of contention between England and France, as well as a persistent agitator of Edward to take action against France.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tanner ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History VOL VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
''The Vows'' presents Robert as offering Edward a [[heron]] at a royal banquet: "I believe I have caught the most cowardly bird...It is my intention to give the heron to the most cowardly one who lives or has ever lived: that is Edward Louis, disinherited of the noble land of France...because of his cowardice".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D Jones, ''The Plantagenets'' (London 2012) p.455&lt;/ref&gt; The poem satirizes Robert as the cunning instigator of the war;&lt;ref&gt;D Kagay ed., ''The Hundred Years War Pt II'' (2006) p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; and presents Edward as his naïve, blustering victim.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D Jones, ''The Plantagenets'' (London 2012) p.455&lt;/ref&gt;

While almost certainly a fictional account, modern historians consider that the poem nonetheless reveals a kind of truth about the relations of the two men, and the approach to war.&lt;ref&gt;D Kagay ed., ''The Hundred Years War Pt II'' (London 2006) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Nagel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ei|g|əl}}; born July 4, 1937) is an American philosopher and University Professor of Philosophy and Law Emeritus at [[New York University]], where he taught from 1980 to 2016.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; His main areas of philosophical interest are [[philosophy of mind]], [[political philosophy]] and [[ethics]].

Nagel is well known for his critique of [[Materialism|material]] [[reductionist]] accounts of the mind, particularly in his essay "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" (1974), and for his contributions to [[deontological]] and liberal moral and political theory in ''The Possibility of Altruism'' (1970) and subsequent writings. He continued the critique of reductionism in ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'' (2012), in which he argues against the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view of the emergence of [[consciousness]].

==Philosophical work==

===Overview===
Nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two; his career now spans over fifty years of publication. Nagel thinks that each person, owing to his or her capacity to reason, instinctively seeks a unified world view. However, if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments, whether about the external world, knowledge, or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be, this leads one into error. For contingent, limited and finite creatures, no such unified world view is possible. That is because ways of understanding are not always better when they are more objective.

Like the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]], Nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it. A modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces. It is more objective because it is less dependent on our peculiarities as the kinds of thinkers that people are. Our modern scientific understanding involves the mathematicized understanding of the world represented by modern [[physics]]. Understanding this beached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility. The way in which modern science and philosophy has [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|drawn a distinction]] between the mathematically and structurally describable "primary qualities" of objects such as shape and solidity and those properties dependent on our sensory apparatus, "secondary qualities" such as taste and color, is a prime example that Nagel returns to repeatedly in his work.

Despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science, Nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us. His contention, rather, is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective. He argues that the subjective viewpoint of scientific understanding, when applied to the mind, leaves out something essential and is fundamentally unable to help people fully understand themselves. In "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]" and elsewhere, he writes that science cannot describe what it is like ''to be'' a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective.

Nagel argues that some [[phenomena]] are not best grasped from a more objective perspective. The standpoint of the thinker does not present itself to him: he is that standpoint. One learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one's own mind, whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact. It would, of its nature, leave out what it is to be a thinker, and that, Nagel believes, would be a falsely objectifying view. Being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain.

Nagel thinks that philosophers over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science tend to produce [[Philosophy of mind|theories of the mind]] that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way. They are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity. The kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand.

As a philosophical [[Rationalism|rationalist]], Nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of [[mental properties]] in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental, and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future. A plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects. Now, it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight, or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap, but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding.

Nagel's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite, structured around our capacity to reason, explains why he thinks that [[Therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that [[radical skepticism]] is, strictly speaking, irrefutable.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The therapeutic or deflationary philosopher, influenced by the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our "form of life". Nagel accuses Wittgenstein and American philosopher of mind and language [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] of [[philosophical idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1986, ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared, objective world. This, for Nagel, elevates contingent conditions of our make-up into criteria for that which is real. The result 'cuts the world down to size' and makes what there is dependent on what there can be interpreted to be. Nagel claims this is no better than more orthodox forms of idealism in which reality is claimed to be made up of mental items or claimed to be constitutively dependent on a form supplied by the mind.

===Philosophy of mind===

====What is it like to be a something====
{{further|What Is it Like to Be a Bat?}}
Nagel is probably most widely known within the field of [[philosophy of mind]] as an advocate of the idea that [[consciousness]] and [[subjective experience]] cannot, at least with the contemporary understanding of [[physicalism]], be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics. This position was primarily discussed by Nagel in one of his most famous articles: "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974). The article's title question, though often attributed to Nagel, was originally asked by [[Timothy Sprigge|Timothy M.B. Sprigge]]. The article was originally published in 1974 in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', and has been reprinted several times, including in ''[[The Mind's I]]'' (edited by [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]]), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Psychology'' (edited by Ned Block), Nagel's ''Mortal Questions'' (1979), ''[[The Nature of Mind]]'' (edited by [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]]), and ''[[Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings]]'' (edited by [[David J. Chalmers]]).

In "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a ''subjective character,'' a ''what it is like'' aspect.  He states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to ''be'' that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" (1974), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics{{who|date=March 2017}} have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world (trivially, one can only do so from his own point of view) to a false claim about the world, that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it. On that understanding, Nagel is a conventional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] about the physical and the mental. This is, however, a misunderstanding{{according to|date=March 2017}}: Nagel's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state, namely, that one be directly acquainted with it. Concepts of mental states are only made available to a thinker who can be acquainted with his/her own states; clearly, the possession and use of physical concepts has no corresponding constraint.

Part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination: influenced by his [[Princeton University|Princeton]] colleague, [[Saul Kripke]], Nagel believes that any [[Type physicalism|type identity]] statement that identified a physical state type with a [[mental state]] type would be, if true, [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. But Kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where, for example, one's [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibres]] are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair. (A parallel argument does not hold for genuine [[Identity (philosophy)|theoretical identities]].) This argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded, Nagel argues, by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways. When asked to imagine ''sensorily'', one imagines C-fibres being stimulated; if asked to imagine ''sympathetically'', one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain. These two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap, whether or not this is the case. (Some philosophers of mind{{who|date=October 2018}} have taken these arguments as helpful for [[physicalism]] on the grounds that it exposes a limitation that makes the existence of an explanatory gap seem compelling, while others{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued that this makes the case for physicalism even more impossible as it cannot be defended even in principle.)

Nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden [[essence]] that underpins a scientific identity in, say, chemistry. But his skepticism is about current physics: he envisages in his most recent work that people may be close to a scientific breakthrough in identifying an underlying essence that is neither physical (as people currently think of the physical), nor [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional]], nor mental, but such that it necessitates all three of these ways in which the mind "appears" to us. The difference between the kind of explanation he rejects and those that he accepts depends on his understanding of [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]]: from his earliest paper to his most recent Nagel has always insisted that a prior context is required to make identity statements plausible, intelligible and transparent.

====Natural selection and consciousness====
{{further|Mind and Cosmos}}
In his 2012 book ''Mind and Cosmos'', Nagel argues against a [[Materialism|materialist]] view of the emergence of life and consciousness, writing that the standard [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] view flies in the face of common sense.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} He writes that [[mind]] is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|16ff}} He argues that the principles that account for the emergence of life may be [[teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Despite Nagel's being an atheist and not a proponent of [[intelligent design]] (ID), his book was "praised by [[creationists]]", according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt; Nagel writes in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that he disagrees with both ID defenders and their opponents, who argue that the only naturalistic alternative to ID is the current reductionist neo-Darwinian model.&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Nagel has argued that ID should not be rejected as non-scientific, for instance writing in 2008 that "ID is very different from [[creation science]]," and that the debate about ID "is clearly a scientific disagreement, not a disagreement between science and something else."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. (2008). "Public education and intelligent design," ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 36(2), pp. 187–205&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he recommended ''[[Signature in the Cell]]'' by the philosopher and ID proponent [[Stephen C. Meyer]] in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' as one of his "Best Books of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article706973.ece|title=Arguments: Thomas Nagel and Stephen C. Meyer’s Signature in the Cell - TLS|publisher=The-tls.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagel does not accept Meyer's conclusions but he endorsed Meyer's approach, and argued in ''Mind and Cosmos'' that Meyer and other ID proponents, [[David Berlinski]] and [[Michael Behe]], "do not deserve the scorn with which they are commonly met."&lt;ref name="Nagel 2012"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

[[Steven Pinker]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] both dismissed the book.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

====Nagel's Rawlsian approach====
Nagel has been highly influential in the related fields of moral and [[political philosophy]]. Supervised by [[John Rawls]], Nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a [[Kantian]] and [[rationalist]] approach to [[moral philosophy]]. His distinctive ideas were first presented in the short [[monograph]] ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' published in 1970. That book seeks by reflection on the nature of [[practical reasoning]] to uncover the formal principles that underlie reason in practice and the related general beliefs about the self that are necessary for those principles to be truly applicable to us. Nagel defends motivated desire theory about the motivation of moral action. According to motivated desire theory, when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire. But it is important to get the justificatory relations right: when a person accepts a moral judgment he or she is necessarily motivated to act. But it is the reason that does the justificatory work of justifying both the action and the desire. Nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification. An account based on presupposing sympathy would be of this kind.

The most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person. When one reasons prudentially, for example about the future reasons that one will have, one allows the reason in the future to justify one's current action without reference to the strength of one's current desires. If a hurricane were to destroy someone's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it: that future reason gives him a reason, now, to take out insurance. The strength of the reason ought not to be hostage to the strength of one's current desires. The denial of this view of prudence, Nagel argues, means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time. One is dissolving oneself into distinct person-stages.

====Altruistic action====
This is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions: in cases of [[altruistic]] action for another person's good that person's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons. Genuine reasons are reasons for anyone. Comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]], Nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one's good as an impersonal good and one's reasons as objective reasons. That means, practically, that a timeless and intrinsic value generates reasons for anyone. A person who denies the truth of this claim is committed, as in the case of a similar mistake about prudence, to a false view of him or herself. In this case the false view is that one's reasons are irreducibly his, in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone: Nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she cannot make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally. Nagel calls this "[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]" and considers it a practical analogue of [[solipsism]] (the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist). Once again, a false view of what is involved in reasoning properly is refuted by showing that it leads to a false view of the nature of people.

====Subjective and objective reasons====
Nagel's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person's personal or "[[Subjectivity|subjective]]" reasons and his or her "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reasons. Earlier, in ''The Possibility of Altruism,'' he took the stance that if one's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then, ''qua'' subjective reason, one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones. In later discussions, Nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values, and speaks instead of "agent-relative" and "agent-neutral" reasons. In the case of agent-relative reasons (the successor to subjective reasons) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to honor his or her parents." By contrast, in the case of agent-neutral reasons (the successor to objective reasons) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason. An example of this might be: "Anyone has a reason to promote the good of parenthood."

====Objective reasons====
The different classes of reasons and values (i.e., agent-relative and agent-neutral) emphasized in Nagel's later work are situated within a Sidgwickian model in which one's moral commitments are thought of objectively, such that one's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole. The structure of Nagel's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself. Those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective, but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated. However, the most striking part of the earlier argument and of Sidgwick's view is preserved: agent-neutral reasons are literally reasons for anyone, so all objectifiable reasons become individually possessed no matter whose they are. Thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint, one must take every other agent's standpoint on value as seriously as one's own, since one's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole; one's personal set of reasons is thus swamped by the objective reasons of all others.

====World agent views====
This is similar to "world agent" [[consequentialist]] views in which one takes up the standpoint of a collective subject whose reasons are those of everyone. But Nagel remains an [[individualist]] who believes in the separateness of persons so his task is to explain why this objective viewpoint does not swallow up the individual standpoint of each of us. He provides an extended rationale for the importance to people of their personal point of view. The result is a hybrid ethical theory of the kind defended by Nagel's Princeton PhD student [[Samuel Scheffler]] in ''The Rejection of Consequentialism''. The objective standpoint and its demands have to be balanced with the subjective personal point of view of each person and its demands. One can always be maximally objective but one does not have to be. One can legitimately "cap" the demands placed on him by the objective reasons of others. In addition, in his later work, Nagel finds a rationale for so-called [[deontic]] constraints in a way Scheffler could not. Following Warren Quinn and Frances Kamm, Nagel grounds them on the [[inviolability]] of persons.

====Political philosophy====
The extent to which one can lead a good life as an individual while respecting the demands of others leads inevitably to political philosophy. In the Locke lectures published as the book ''Equality and Partiality'', Nagel exposes [[John Rawls|John Rawls's]] [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]] to detailed scrutiny. Once again, Nagel places such weight on the objective point of view and its requirements that he finds Rawls's view of liberal equality not demanding enough. Rawls's aim to redress, not remove, the inequalities that arise from class and talent seems to Nagel to lead to a view that does not sufficiently respect the needs of others. He recommends a gradual move to much more demanding conceptions of equality, motivated by the special nature of political responsibility. Normally people draw a distinction between that which people do and that which people fail to bring about. But this thesis, true of individuals, does not apply to the state, which is a collective agent. A Rawlsian state permits intolerable inequalities and people need to develop a more ambitious view of equality to do justice to the demands of the objective recognition of the reasons of others. For Nagel, honoring the objective point of view demands nothing less.

===Experience as a good in itself===
Nagel has said that "''There are elements [of living] which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive.''"&lt;ref&gt;Further; "''Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.''" 'Death' (essay), Thomas Nagel, CUP, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/the-vise-side-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Nagel received the 1996 [[PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay]] for ''Other Minds'' (1995). He has also been awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] in Moral Philosophy (2008), the [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Rolf Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (2008) and the  Distinguished Achievement Award of the [[Mellon Foundation]] (2006).&lt;ref name=degreesin/&gt;

The '''[[Thracia]]n tomb Griffins''', found in [[Bulgaria]], has a façade decorated with plastic columns and with a pediment above them. The pediment`s ends are semi-palmettes, the lower leaves of which are elongated and look like heads of griffins. The temple was built in the 5th century BC. There is a corridor made from river stones, floored with earth. The façade, the antechamber and the circular chamber are built of granite blocks. The entrances to the antechamber and the dome chamber had been closed by stone doors which were found broken during the research of the facility. The antechamber is of rectangular shape and has a double-pitched roof. The round chamber is covered with fine-made dome. The floors of both rooms are made of plastered granite slabs. Opposite the entrance of the circular chamber is situated a ritual stone bed with decorations. On a stone block in front of the bed were found gold paws. A funeral took place in the temple in the 4th century BC. The corridor was filled with river stones and soil. It was robbed in antiquity.

'''Tibor Živković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Тибор Живковић}}; March 11, 1966 – March 26, 2013) was a Serbian academic, historian and writer who specialised in the period of the early Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Živković was born in [[Mostar]], and history studied at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] at the [[University of Belgrade]] between 1985–90, when he graduated at the Department of Antiquity. He received his MA in 1996 with a thesis ''slavizacija na teritoriju Srbije VII-XI stoljeća'' (Slavicization on the territory of Serbia 7th-11th centuries). He received his PhD in 2000 with a dissertation ''Slavs under Byzantine rule from the 7th to 11th Centuries (until 1025'').

As of 1997, he worked at The Institute of History of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU),&lt;ref name="Nova"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sami smo odsekli deo naše istorije|date=13 March 2012|publisher=nspm.rs|url=http://www.nspm.rs/kulturna-politika/sami-smo-odsekli-deo-nase-istorije.html?alphabet=l}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the director of the Historical Institute from 2002–10, as well as editor in chief of the Drafting Committee editions of the Historical Institute.&lt;ref name="Nova"/&gt;

During the doctoral studies he was a scholar of the Greek government (1997-1999). As a scholar of the [[Minister of Education (Serbia)|Ministry of Science and Technological Development]] of Serbia stayed at the postdoctoral studies at the Center for Byzantine Research (Institute for Byzantine Research, [[National Hellenic Research Foundation]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

He participated as a team leader in archaeological excavations along the [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]] river between 2003 and 2009. He taught general Middle Ages at the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Banja Luka]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Works==
His field of historical research involved complex issues related to the Early Middle Age history of South Slavs, and the territory of Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece. Emphasis in his research was on the history of Serbs in the early Middle Ages. He also researched and gave new insights on the ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]'' (Gesta Regum Sclavorum), the early ecclesiastical history of the Serbian territory, and the early Serbian rulers. He published many scientific papers and books.

'''Turrell Verl''' "'''Terry'''" '''Wylie''' (August 20, 1927 &amp;ndash; August 25, 1984) was an American scholar, Tibetologist, sinologist, and professor, known as one of the 20th century's leading scholars of [[Tibet]]. He taught as a professor of Tibetan Studies at the [[University of Washington]] and served as the first chair of the Department of Asian Languages and Literature. Wylie founded the Tibetan Studies program at the University of Washington, the first of its kind in the United States, setting a major precedent for future programs and research in the field. His system for rendering the [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan language]] in Latin script, known as [[Wylie transliteration]], is the primary system used for transcribing Tibetan in academic and historical contexts.

==Life and career==
[[File:Wylie transliteration.png|thumb|400px|Wylie transliteration of Tibetan script]]
Turrell V. "Terry" Wylie was born in [[Durango, Colorado]] on August 20, 1927. He attended the [[University of Washington]] as an undergraduate student, where he graduated with a [[B.A.]] degree.{{sfnp|Miller|1986|p=150}}  Wylie continued on at the university as a graduate student, receiving a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in 1958 with a dissertation entitled "The Geography of Tibet According to the ''&amp;#39;Dzam-gling-rgyas-bshad''". Wylie also studied under [[Giuseppe Tucci]], an early pioneer of Buddhist studies in the West, and he was one of very few American scholars in the field whose education "combined solid linguistic preparation with a rigorous command of text-oriented philological discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asian.washington.edu/sites/asian/files/documents/newsletters/asia_notes_-_1985_spring.pdf|title=Asian Languages and Literature Newsletter|last=Miller|first=Roy Andrew|date=May 1985|website=University of Washington|page=|pages=5-7|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wylie is best known for the system of Tibetan [[transliteration]] described in his groundbreaking article, "A Standard System of Tibetan Transcription" (1959). Today, it is an almost universally adopted scheme for accurately representing the [[orthography]] of [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]] in the [[Latin script]], and is commonly referred to as the ''[[Wylie transliteration]]''.

Following the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s takeover of [[Tibet]], Wylie invited the first group of Tibetan refugees to Seattle in 1960, courtesy of the Rockefeller Foundation. Among them included Geshe Nawang L. Nornang, a renowned lecturer of Tibetan language at the University of Washington who subsequently worked with Wylie to establish the first Tibetan Studies program in America under the [[National Defense Education Act]], and Lhadon Karsip, co-contributor with Geshe Nornang to ''A Manual of Spoken Tibetan'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asian.washington.edu/news/2014/11/24/memory-geshe-nornang-1924-2014|title=In Memory of Geshe Nornang  (1924-2014) {{!}} Asian Languages &amp; Literature {{!}} University of Washington|website=asian.washington.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the group were [[Jigdal Dagchen Sakya|Sakya Dagchen Rinpoche]], a hierarch of the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and [[Dezhung Rinpoche]], co-founder of the Sakya Dharma Center in Seattle.

Wylie died on August 25, 1984. Upon his death, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] remarked, "Dr. Wylie's strong and genuine feelings for the Tibetan people and their just cause will long remain deeply appreciated. In the death of Dr. Wylie we have lost a true friend and a distinguished scholar of Tibetan studies."&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Tibetan Culture: Essays in Memory of Turrell V. Wylie''. ed. Lawrence Epstein &amp; Richard F. Sherburne. Edwin Mellen Pr: 1990 {{ISBN|0-88946-064-7}} pg x&lt;/ref&gt; At the memorial service on 9 October 1984, Jigmie Yuthok speaking on behalf of the Seattle Tibetan Community said, "As a scholar in the truest sense of the word, whose life-long research in the histories of Tibet and China led him to discern fact from fiction, he stood up for the truth of Tibet's independent status and spoke out at every opportunity even in the face of overwhelming opposition from numerous vested interest groups. He was not the one to compromise anything for the Truth. To the Tibetans here in particular, he was a great teacher, a mentor, a patron, and an affectionate brother whose kindness and generosity had nurtured the first batch of Tibetans that he brought to Seattle in 1960 to grow into a thriving little community it is today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asian.washington.edu/sites/asian/files/documents/newsletters/asia_notes_-_1985_spring.pdf|title=Asian Languages and Literature Newsletter|last=Miller|first=Roy Andrew|date=May 1985|website=University of Washington|page=|pages=5-7|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valaam''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Валаам or Валаамский архипелаг), also known historically by the Finnish name '''Valamo''', is an [[archipelago]] in the northern portion of [[Lake Ladoga]], lying within the [[Republic of Karelia]], [[Russian Federation]]. The total area of its more than 50 islands is 36&amp;nbsp;km². The largest island is also called Valaam. Other known islads are: [[Skitsky Island|Skitsky]] (second by size), Lembos, Sviatoy, Bayonny, Moskovsky, Predtechensky, Nikonovsky, Divny, Emelyanov, Oboronny, Goly, Savvaty's, Zosima's, Skalisty, Lukovy, Ovsiany, Rzhanoi, Nikolsky.

It is best known as the site of the 14th century [[Valaam Monastery]]  on Valaam Island and for its natural environment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Selby p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, the islands were a part of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In the 17th century, they were captured by [[Sweden]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], but [[Russia]] reconquered them less than a century later. When the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was set up in the early 19th century as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, [[Alexander I of Russia]] made Valaam a part of Finland. In 1917, Valaam became a part of newly independent [[Finland]], but it was annexed by the [[USSR]] after the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]].
The name of the island is from the Finno-Ugric word ''valamo'', which means the high, mountain, ground. The climate and natural history of the island are unique because of its position in Lake Ladoga. Spring begins at the end of March and a typical summer on Valaam consists of 30-35 sunny days, which is more than on the mainland. The average temperature in July is 17&amp;nbsp;°C. The winter and snow arrive in early December. In the middle of February the ice road to the nearest city of [[Sortavala]] (42&amp;nbsp;km) is traversable. The average temperature of February is minus&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;°C.

More than 480 species of plants grow on the island, many of which have been cultivated by monks. The island is covered by coniferous woods, about 65% of which are pine.  Ten species of mammals and more than 120 avian species call the archipelago home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Valaam Tourist Map|last = -|first = -|publisher = discus|year = 2003|isbn = |location = St. Petersburg|pages = |ISBN= 5-94059-038-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was visited repeatedly by emperors Alexander I, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], and other members of the imperial family. Other famous visitors include [[Tchaikovsky]] and [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleyev]].

[[File:Cathedral of Valaam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral of Valaam Monastery]]
The island is permanently inhabited by monks and families. In 1999, there were about 600 residents on the main island; including army service personnel, restoration workers, guides and monks.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There is a kindergarten, an arts and sports venue, a school, a small museum and a medical centre. The community on Valaam at the moment has no official administrative status.

During the summer, the main island can be reached by tour boats which leave St. Petersburg at night and arrive at the island the following morning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[president of the Russian Federation]] has a [[dacha]] on one of the islands of Valaam, but its precise location is not publicly known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/ulkomaat/art-1288682534205.html?pos=ok-nln | title = Tässä on Putinin vaiettu huvila Valamon saaressa (‘Here is Putin’s secret dacha in Valaam’) | last = Paananen | first = Arja | date = 2014-04-28 | work = [[Iltasanomat]] | publisher = [[Sanoma|Sanoma Oyj]] | accessdate = 2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wrong''' (from [[Old English]] ''wrang ''– ''crooked'')&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an act that is illegal or [[immoral]].&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Legal wrongs''' are usually quite clearly defined in the [[law]] of a [[State (polity)|state]] and/or [[jurisdiction]]. They can be divided into [[civil wrong]]s and [[crime]]s (or ''criminal offences'') in [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries,&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries tend to have some additional categories, such as [[contraventions]].

'''[[Morality|Moral]] wrong''' is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, [[rape]] or [[murder]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as parking  offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;

==Legal wrong==
In law, a wrong can be a legal [[injury]], which is any damage resulting from a violation of a [[legal right]]. A legal wrong can also imply the state of being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as ''[[De minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]''. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between [[civil wrong]]s (governed by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]) and [[crime]]s (defined by [[criminal law]]), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;
