'''''A Slower Speed of Light''''' is a [[freeware]] video game developed by [[MIT]] Game Lab that demonstrates the effects of [[special relativity]] by gradually slowing down the [[speed of light]] to a walking pace. The game runs on the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine|engine]] using the own [[Open-source software|open source]] OpenRelativity toolkit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"A Slower Speed of Light." ''MIT Game Lab''. MIT, n.d. Web. 24 Dec. 2013. http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GitHub"&gt;[https://github.com/MITGameLab/OpenRelativity MITGameLab/OpenRelativity: An open source framework to add the effects of traveling at relativistic speeds to visualizations or games.] on [[GitHub]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
In ''A Slower Speed of Light'', the player controls the ghost of a young child who was killed in an unspecified accident. The child wants to "become one with light", but the speed of light is too fast for the child. This is solved through the use of magic orbs which, as each are collected, slow down the speed of light, until by the end it is at walking speed. These orbs are spread throughout the level. At the beginning of the game, walking around and collecting these orbs is easy; however, as the game progresses, the effects of special relativity become apparent. This gradually increases the difficulty of the game.

== Effects of special relativity ==
As the game progresses and light becomes slower, the effects of special relativity start to become more apparent. These effects include the [[Doppler effect]] (red/blue-shifting of visible light and the shifting of ultraviolet and infrared into the visible spectrum), the [[searchlight effect]] (increased brightness in the direction of travel), [[time dilation]] (difference between the passage of time perceived by the player and the outside world), the [[Lorentz transformation]] (the perceived warping of the environment at near-light speeds), and the runtime effect (seeing objects in the past because of the speed of light).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These effects combine as the game progresses to increase the difficulty and challenge the player.

== OpenRelativity ==
OpenRelativity is a toolkit designed for use with the Unity game engine. It was developed by MIT Game Lab during the development of ''A Slower Speed of Light''. The toolkit allows for the accurate simulation of a [[3D computer graphics|3D environment]] when light is slowed down.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"OpenRelativity." ''MIT Game Lab''. MIT, n.d. Web. 24 Dec. 2013. http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/&lt;/ref&gt; It is hosted on [[GitHub]] and has been published under the [[permissive license|permissive]] [[MIT license]].&lt;ref name="GitHub"/&gt;

== Use in education ==
''A Slower Speed of Light'' was developed in hopes of being used as an educational tool to explain special relativity in an easy-to-understand fashion.&lt;ref&gt;"A Slower Speed of Light: MIT Game Lab Scores."

'''Almaty International School (AIS)''' in [[Kazakhstan]] is a private non-profit institution that opened in August 1993. It offers education in English for preschool (3–4 years), elementary, middle, and secondary students. The school year consists of three terms extending from late August until mid-June. The school is located on nearly seven hectares of land on the edge of [[Almaty]], the largest city in [[Kazakhstan]].

==Students==
Students come from 45 countries around the world including Kazakhstan, South Korea, United States, Russia, Canada, and many others. The school offers a mastery-learning program with a curriculum similar to that of U.S. public and private schools. 
 
While instruction is in English, language classes are offered in French, Spanish, and Russian. For Kazakh citizens, Kazakh language, history, and geography classes are required. Subjects include Literature, History, Geography, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Technology, and electives.

==Enrollment==
As of June, 2016, the enrollment is 549 students.

==Activities==
Activities for elementary students include outdoor sports, indoor games, creative drama, dance, model making, sewing, needlepoint, crochet painting, drawing, art and crafts, storytelling, puzzles, board games, science activities, computer simulations, and bookmaking. Older students can be involved in drama, soccer, volleyball, and basketball after school.

Clubs in AIS for middle school and secondary students include National Honor Society, Tuck Shop (a student-run store during break time), Student Council AIS, Helping Hands (a volunteer philanthropy club), Roots and Shoots (a volunteer club focused on the making AIS environmental friendly as well as doing environmental service projects around Almaty), Youth x Women Club (founded in 2017-18 school year by Aiganym "Aiko" Sadykova that helps underprivileged women in Almaty), Yearbook Club, and Debate Club (founded and led by an experienced coach from St. Louis, Mr. Adam Saligman). AIS also has junior varsity, varsity and elementary sports teams. Sports vary through seasons. The sports offered at AIS are cross country, soccer, basketball, volleyball, track and field, ping pong, badminton, swimming, and debate.

==Sports Achievements in 2017-2018 School Year==
During Central Asian Soccer Classic (CASC) 2017, JV Boys Soccer Team earned second place in their division. Varsity Girls A team finished third, and Varsity Boys A team finished third as well.
The cross-country season came to its culmination during the Central Asian Cross-Country Classic (CAXC) at Tien Shan and CEESA (Central and Eastern European Schools Association) meet in Tbilisi. AIS dominated the CAXC, grabbing first places, while in Tbilisi JV AIS team finished third overall, and AIS Varsity team finished second overall.
In November 2017, 5 students from Debate Club went to World Scholar's Cup's Tournament of Champions held at Yale University. While all 5 of students earned medals for various achievements, Sultan Kamysbayev ranked in the Top 50 (of over 1000 qualifying students from around the world) in several of the academic subjects, and Alice Gilman earned a gold medal in debate, writing, a couple of the academic subjects, and ranked #62 overall (factoring in every event in the World Scholar's Cup), out of again, over 1000 students. Additionally, she was chosen for the Showcase Debate, based on her performance in the competition and delivered a sterling performance for all the students, coaches, and parents to watch.


==Student evaluation==
Students are expected to achieve mastery grades of "A" or "B". Student evaluations, called "status reports", are issued five times each year at the end of each "Quintile". Data is electronically entered regularly and parents may request a status report at any time. Quality Schools International teaches their students the success orientations which include actions such as concern for others, kindness and politeness, aesthetic appreciation, independent endeavor, group interaction, responsibility, and trustworthiness. When students achieve mastery in any of these sections they receive an "E" for exemplary work, otherwise, a student may receive an "S" for success or an "N" for not yet achieved.

== Success Orientations ==
-Concerns for others&lt;br /&gt;
-Responsibility&lt;br /&gt;
-Group Interaction&lt;br /&gt;
-Aesthetic Appreciation &lt;br /&gt;
-Independent Endeavor&lt;br /&gt;
-Kindness and politeness &lt;br /&gt;
-Trustworthiness&lt;br /&gt;

==History==
The first QSI school was founded in 1971 in [[Sana'a]], [[Yemen]]. AIS was opened in September 1993. After 10 years, the school moved to a large purpose-built facility on a large piece of land on the edge of the city. The new school has two main buildings, one annex, a middle school building, two playground areas, tennis courts, two gyms, and a professional soccer field with a running track.

==Accreditation==
Almaty International School has been accredited through the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA.

'''Anti-corruption''' (or '''anticorruption''') comprises activities that oppose or inhibit [[corruption]]. Just as corruption takes many forms, anti-corruption efforts vary in scope and in strategy. A general distinction between preventive and reactive measures is sometimes drawn. In such framework, investigative authorities and their attempts to unveil corrupt practices would be considered reactive, while education on the negative impact of corruption, or firm-internal [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] programs are classified as the former. Legal and moral frameworks to reduce corruption date back to antiquity and gained broad international support since the last decade of the 20th century.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
[[File:Code of Hammurabi 70.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the code of Hammurabi stele as displayed in the Louvre|Among the earliest documented anti-corruption efforts include the code of Hammurabi, dated to around 1754&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The [[code of Hammurabi]] ({{circa|1754&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), the [[Horemheb#Internal reform|Great Edict of Horemheb]] ({{circa|1300&amp;nbsp;BC}}), and the [[Arthasastra]] (2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olivelle |first=Patrick |title=King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford UK |isbn=978-0-19-989182-5 |pages=30–31 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; are among the earliest written proofs of anti-corruption efforts. All of those early texts are condemning bribes in order to influence the decision by civil servants, especially in the judicial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Bacio Terracino (2012), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the [[Roman empire]] corruption was also inhibited, e.g. by a decree issued by emperor [[Constantine]] in 331.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=John T. |authorlink=John T. Noonan Jr. |title=Bribes |page=90 |publisher=Macmillan |place=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-02-922880-8 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, moral principles based on religious beliefs were common, as several major [[religion]]s, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Taoism]] condemn corrupt conduct in their respective religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bacio Terracino (2012), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The described legal and moral stances were exclusively addressing [[bribery]] but were not concerned with other aspects that are considered corruption in the 21st century. [[Embezzlement]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], and other strategies of gaining public assets by office holders were not yet constructed as unlawfully or immoral, as positions of power were regarded a personal possession rather than an entrusted function. With the popularization of the concept of [[public interest]] and the development of a professional [[bureaucracy]] in the 19th century offices became perceived as trusteeships instead of property of the office holder, leading to legislation against and a negative perception of those additional forms of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Bacio Terracino (2012), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in diplomacy and for international trad purposes, corruption remained a generally accepted phenomenon of the political and economic life throughout the 19th and big parts of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In contemporary society ===
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2018}}
In the 1990s corruption was increasingly perceived to have a negative impact on [[economy]], [[democracy]], and the [[rule of law]], as was pointed out by [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |authorlink=Anne Peters |first=Anne |editor1-last=Thelesklaf |editor1-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Gomes Pereira |editor2-first=Pedro |year=2011 |chapter=Preface |title=Non-State Actors in Asset Recovery |language=en |publisher=Peter Lang |pages=vii–ix |isbn=978-3-0343-1073-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those effects claimed by Annan could be proven by a variety of empirical studies, as reported by Juli Bacio Terracino.&lt;ref&gt;Bacio Terracino (2012), pp.31-34&lt;/ref&gt; The increased awareness of corruption was widespread and shared across professional, political, and geographical borders. While an international effort against corruption seemed to be unrealistic during the [[Cold War]], a new discussion on the global impact of corruption became possible, leading to an official condemnation of corruption by governments, companies, and various other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 12 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s additionally saw an increase in press freedom, the activism of civil societies, and global communication through an improved communication infrastructure, which paved the way to a more thorough understanding of the global prevalence and negative impact of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mccoy |first=Jennifer L. |last2=Heckel |first2=Heather |date=2001 |title=The Emergence of a Global Anti-corruption Norm |journal=International Politics |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=65–90 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8892613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence to those developments, international [[non-governmental organizations]] (e.g. [[Transparency International]]) and [[inter-governmental organization]]s and initiatives (e.g. the [[OECD]] Working group on bribery) were founded to overcome corruption.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2000s, the discourse became broader in scope. It became more common to refer to corruption as a violation of [[human rights]], which was also discussed by the responsible international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boersma |first=Martine |authorlink= |date=2012 |title=Corruption: A Violation of Human Rights and a Crime Under International Law? |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=978-1-78068-105-4 |pages=358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides attempting to find a fitting description for corruption, the integration of corruption into a human rights-framework was also motivated by underlining the importance of corruption and educating people on its costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sepúlveda Carmona |first1=Magdalenda |last2=Bacio-Terracino |first2=Julio |editor1-last=Boersma |editor1-first=Martine |editor2-last=Nelen |editor2-first=Hans |date=2010 |title=Corruption &amp; Human Rights: Interdisciplinary Perspectives |chapter=Chapter III. Corruption and Human Rights: Making the Connection |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=9789400000858 |pages=25–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
In national and in international legislation, there are laws interpreted as directed against corruption. The laws can stem from resolutions of international organizations, which are implemented by the national governments, who are ratifying those resolutions or be directly be issued by the respective national [[legislative]].

Laws against corruption are motivated by similar reasons that are generally motivating the existence of [[criminal law]], as those laws are thought to, on the one hand, bring justice by holding individuals accountable for their wrongdoing, justice can be achieved by sanctioning those corrupted individuals, and potential criminals are deterred by having the consequences of their potential actions demonstrated to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Seumas |last2=Roberst |first2=Peter |last3=Spence |first3=Edward |title=Corruption and Anti-Corruption: An Applied Philosophical Approach |date=2005 |lccn=2004002505 |isbn=978-0-13-061795-8 |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |page=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International law ===
Approaching the fight against corruption in an international setting is often seen as preferential over addressing it exclusively in the context of the [[nation state]]. The reasons for such preference are multidimensional, ranging from the necessary international cooperation for tracing international corruption scandals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |last=Stukalo |first=Alexey |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=208 et seq |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the binding nature of international treaties, and the loss in relative competitiveness by outlawing an activity that remains legal in other countries.

==== OECD ====
{{Main|OECD Anti-Bribery Convention}}
The [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was the first large scale convention targeting an aspect of corruption, when it came in 1999 into force. Ratifying the convention obliges governments to implement it, which is monitored by the OECD Working Group on Bribery. The convention states that it shall be illegal bribing foreign public officials. The convention is currently signed by 43 countries. The scope of the Convention is very limited, as it is only concerned with active bribing. It is hence more reduced than other treaties on restricting corruption, to increase – as the working group's chairman Mark Pieth explained – the influence on its specific target.&lt;ref name=p59&gt;International Anti-Corruption Norms, pp. 59 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research by Nathan Jensen and Edmund Malesky suggests that companies based in countries that ratified the convention, are less likely to pay bribes abroad.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=Nathan M. |last2=Malesky |first2=Edmund J. |title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention |volume=72 |issue=1 |doi= 10.1017/S0020818317000443 |journal=[[International Organization]] |date=2017 |pages=33–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are not exclusively explainable by the regulatory mechanisms and potential sanctions triggered through this process but are equally influenced by less formal mechanisms, e.g. the peer reviews by officials from other signatories and the potentially resulting influences on the respective country's image.&lt;ref&gt;International Anti-Corruption Norms, Chapter 2, pp. 59–95&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like TI, however, also questioned whether the results of the process are sufficient, especially as a significant number of countries is not actively prosecuting cases of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

20 years before the OECD convention was ratified, the [[United Nations]] discussed a draft for a convention on corruption. The draft on an international agreement on illicit payments proposed in 1979&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2001): "Illicit Payments", UNCTAD Series on International investment agreements. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] did not gain traction in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], and was not pursued further.&lt;ref&gt;International Anti-Corruption Norms, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) presented its draft of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC) in 2003, it proved more successful. UNCAC was ratified in 2003 and became effective in 2005. It constitutes an international treaty, currently signed by 186 partners, including 182 member states of the United Nations and four non-state signatories. UNCAC has a broader scope than the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as it does not exclusively focus on public officials but includes inter alia corruption in the [[private sector]] and non-bribery corruption, like e.g. [[money laundering]] and [[abuse of power]]. UNCAC also specifies a variety of mechanisms to combat corruption, e.g. international cooperation in detecting and prosecuting corruption, the cancellation of permits, when connected to corrupt behavior, and the protection of [[whistleblower]]s. The implementation of UNCAC is monitored by the [[International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities]] (IAACA)

==== International organizations ====
===== International Anti-Corruption Court =====
{{Main|International Anti-Corruption Court}}
[[Mark Lawrence Wolf]] floated in 2012 the idea to launch an [[International Anti-Corruption Court]], as either a part of the already existing [[International Criminal Court]], or as an equivalent to it. The suggestion was widely discussed and endorsed by a variety of NGOs including [[Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption]] (GOPAC), [[Global Witness]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Integrity Initiatives International]] (III), and TI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Magistad |first=Mary Kay |title=Disrupting the Kleptocrat's Playbook, one investigative report at a time |date=April 21, 2017 |publisher=[[Public Radio International]] |access-date=September 12, 2018 |language=en |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-04-21/disrupting-kleptocrats-playbook-one-investigative-report-time }}&lt;/ref&gt; An implementation of the concept is currently not scheduled by any organizations with the authority of conducting such step.

===== Existing international organizations =====
In 2011, the [[International Anti-Corruption Academy]] was created as an [[intergovernmental organization]] by [[treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schermers |first1=Henry G. |author-link1=Henry G.

Many other intergovernmental organizations are working on the reduction of corruption without issuing conventions binding for its members after ratification. Organizations that are active in this field include, but are not limited to, the [[World Bank]] (such as through its [[Independent Evaluation Group]]), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomson |first=Alistair |title=Beheading the Hydra: How the IMF Fights Corruption |url=https://blogs.imf.org/2017/05/18/beheading-the-hydra-how-the-imf-fights-corruption/ |date=May 18, 2017 |access-date=September 17, 2018 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regional organizations like the [[Andean Community]] (within the framework of the {{lang|es|Plan Andino de Lucha contra la Corrupción}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolivia asume la presidencia del Parlamento Andino por un año |newspaper=[[Opinión]] |url=http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2011/0809/noticias.php?id=20910 |access-date=September 17, 2018 |date=August 9, 2011 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regulations by continental organizations ====
===== Americas =====
{{Main|Inter-American Convention Against Corruption}}
The first convention adopted against corruption by a regional organization was the [[Organization of American States]]' (OAS) [[Inter-American Convention Against Corruption]] (IACAC). The Convention, which targeted both active and passive bribing, came into force in 1997. It is currently ratified by all 34 active OAS-Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_B-58_against_Corruption_signatories.asp |title=List of signatories of IACAC |access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Cuba was suspended from the OAS from 1962 to 2009. After the ban on Cuba's participation was lifted in 2009, the country elected not to participate. See: [[Cuban relations with the Organization of American States]].}}

===== Europe =====
In 1997 the [[European Union]] (EU) adopted the EU Convention against corruption involving officials, which makes it illegal to engage in corrupt activities with officials from the European Union's administrative staff, or with officials from any member state of the EU. It forces the signatories to outlaw both active and passive bribing which involves any aforementioned official. Liability for unlawful actions is extend to the heads of those entities, whose agents were bribing officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.business-anti-corruption.com/anti-corruption-legislation/european-anti-corruption-conventions/ |title=European Anti-Corruption Conventions |access-date=August 10, 2018 |publisher=GAN Integrity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European states]] also ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Criminal Law Convention on Corruption|Criminal]] and [[Civil Law Convention on Corruption]], which were adopted in 1999. The former was an addition extended by passing the [[Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption]]. The two conventions on criminal law were signed by [[Belarus]] and all Council of Europe members, with the exception of [[Estonia]], which abstains from the Additional Protocol.{{efn|The [[Czech Republic]], [[Italy]] and the [[Russian Federation]] signed the Protocol but did so far not ratify it.&lt;ref name=Criminal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/de/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/173/signatures?p_auth=GzSRsV7F |title=List of signatories of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption |accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Protocol&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/191/signatures?p_auth=GzSRsV7F |title=List of signatories of the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption |accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Criminal Law Convention is currently by 48 States, while the Additional Protocol is signed by 44 countries.&lt;ref name=Criminal /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protocol /&gt; Both conventions are aiming at the protection of judicial authorities against the negative impact of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |last=Stukalo |first=Alexey |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=16 |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention on Civil Law is currently ratified by 35 countries, all of which are, with the exception of Belarus, members of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/de/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/174/signatures?p_auth=GzSRsV7F |title=List of signatories of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption |accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, it requires the States Parties to provide remedies for individuals materially harmed by corruption.

Membership to GRECO is open to all countries worldwide and is not conditional on membership at CoE.

===== Africa =====
{{Main|African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption}}
Since its launch in 2003, the [[African Union]]'s [[African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption|Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption]] was ratified by 38 States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7786-sl-african_union_convention_on_preventing_and_combating_corruption_5.pdf |title=List of signatories of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption |accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the consensus of the signatories on minimal standards for combating corruption. The resolution was criticized in the [[Journal of African Law]] for disregarding other aspects of the rule of law, like e.g. [[data protection]] and the [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schroth |first=Peter W.|date=2005 |title=The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption |journal=[[Journal of African Law]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=24–38 |jstor=27607931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National law ===
While bribing domestic officials was criminalized in most countries even before the ratification of international conventions and treaties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = OECD Bribery Awareness Handbook for Tax Examiners | publisher = OECD | date = 2009 | pages = 15 | language =en | url =https://www.oecd.org/tax/crime/37131825.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; many national law systems did not recognize bribing foreign officials, or more sophisticated methods of corruption as illegal. Only after ratifying and implementing above mentioned conventions the illegal character of those offenses was fully recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pacini |first1=Carl |last2=Swingen |first2=Judyth A. |last3=Rogers|first3=Hudson |date=2002 |title=The Role of the OECD and EU Conventions in Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials |journal= [[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=385–405 |doi=10.1023/A:1015235806969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where legislation existed prior to the ratification of the OECD convention, the implementation resulted in an increased compliance with the legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cuervo-Cazurra |first1=Alvaro |date=2008 |title=The effectiveness of laws against bribery abroad |journal=[[Journal of International Business Studies]] |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=634–651 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is often addressed by specialized investigative or prosecution authorities, often labelled as [[List of anti-corruption agencies|anti-corruption agencies]] (ACA) that are tasked with varying duties, subject to varying degrees of independence from the respective government, regulations and powers, depending on their role in the architecture of the respective national law enforcement system. One of the earliest precursors of such agencies is the anti-corruption commission of [[New York City]], which was established in 1873.&lt;ref name=Graycar4&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graycar |first1=Adam |last2=Prenzler |first2=Tim |year=2013 |chapter=Chapter 4: The Architecture of Corruption Control |title=Understanding and Preventing Corruption |series=Crime Prevention and Security Management |language=en |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |pages=50–69 |doi=10.1057/9781137335098 |isbn=978-1-137-33508-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A surge in the numbers of national ACAs can be noted in the last decade of the 20th and the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heilbrunn |first=John R. |title=Anti-Corruption Commissions Panacea or Real Medicine to Fight Corruption? |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/WBI/Resources/wbi37234Heilbrunn.pdf |access-date=August 30, 2018 |agency=[[World Bank Institute]] |language=en |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
Already at the foundation of the [[United States]] discussions on the possibility of preventing corruption were held, leading to increased awareness for corruption's threads. [[Title of Nobility Clause|Article 1, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] can be seen as an early anti-corruption law, as it outlawed the acceptance of gifts and other favors from foreign governments and their representatives. [[Zephyr Teachout]] argued that giving and receiving presents held an important role in [[diplomacy]] but were often seen as potentially dangerous to a politician's integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Teachout |first=Zephyr |authorlink=Zephyr Teachout |date=2014 |title=Corruption in America|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05040-2|pages=17 et seq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early attempts to oppose corruption by law were enacted after the end of [[World War II]]. The [[Bribery and Conflict of Interest Act]] of 1962 for example regulates the sanctions for bribing national officials, respectively the acceptance of bribes by national officials, and the abuse of power for their personal interest. The [[Hobbs Act]] of 1946 is another law frequently applied by US-American prosecutors in anti-corruption cases. Prosecutors are using the act by arguing that the acceptance of benefits for official acts qualifies as an offence against the act. Less frequently laws to prosecute corruption through auxiliary criminal activities include the [[Mail Fraud Statute]] and the [[False Statements Accountability Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Seumas |last2=Roberst |first2=Peter |last3=Spence |first3=Edward |title=Corruption and Anti-Corruption: An Applied Philosophical Approach |date=2005 |lccn=2004002505 |isbn=978-0-13-061795-8 |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |page=130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[United States of America]] adopted the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA), which criminalized corrupt interactions with foreign officials. Since its implementation, the law served to prosecute domestic and foreign companies, who bribed officials outside of the United States. As no other country implemented a similar law up to the 1990s, US-American companies faced disadvantages for their global operations. In addition to the legal status of corruption abroad, many countries also treated bribes as [[tax-deductible]]. Through applying the law to companies with ties to the United States and by working on global conventions against foreign bribery, the government of the US tried to reduce the negative impact of FCPA on US-American companies.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 72 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the FCPA, additional laws were implement that are directly influencing anti-corruption activities. Section 922 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] for instance extents the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] by a new Section 21F that protects whistleblowers from retaliation and grants them financial awards them when collaborating with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). Conway-Hatcher et al. (2013) attributed an increase the number of whistleblowers, who are reporting to SEC, inter alia on corruption incidents to the provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conway-Hatcher |first1=Amy| last2=Griggs |first2=Linda |last3=Klein |first3=Benjamin |editor1-last=Del Debbio |editor1-first=Alessandra |editor2-last=Carneiro Maeda |editor2-first=Bruno |editor3-last=da Silva Ayres |editor3-first=Carlos Henrique |title=Temas De Anticorrupção e Compliance |publisher=Elsevier |date=2013 |pages=251–267 |chapter=Chapter 12: How whistleblowing may pay under the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act: implications and best practices for multinational companies |isbn=9788535269284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TI's last report on enforcement of the OECD Convention against bribery published in 2014 concluded that the United States are complying with the convention.&lt;ref name=Vogl&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogl |first=Frank |title=Trade Trumps Anti-Corruption |date=2014 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/trade-trumps-anticorrupti_b_6075936.html?guccounter=1 |access-date=August 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
The [[United Kingdom]] was a founding member of the OECD working group on bribery and ratified the Anti-Bribery Convention, but faced significant problems in complying to its findings and the convention.&lt;ref&gt;International Anti-Corruption Norms, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It was severely affected by the [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]], in which the British company [[BAE Systems]] faced allegations of having bribed members of the [[Saudi-Arabia|Saudi]] [[House of Saud|royal family]] to facilitate an arms deal. British prosecution of BAE Systems was stopped after an intervention by than Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], which caused the OECD working group to criticize the British anti-corruption laws and investigations.

The [[UK Bribery Act of 2010]] came into force on July 1, 2011, and replaced all former bribery-related laws in the United Kingdom. It is targeting bribery and receiving bribes, both towards national and foreign public officials. Furthermore, it is assigning responsibility to organizations whose employees are engaging in bribing and hence obliges companies to enforce [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]]-mechanisms to avoid bribing on their behalf. The Bribery Act goes in many points beyond the US-American FCPA, as it also criminalizes [[facilitation payment]]s and private sector corruption inter alia.&lt;ref name=Compliance17&gt;{{cite book |last=Bleker-van Eyk |first=Sylvie C. |editor1-last=Bleker-van Eyk |editor1-first=Sylvie C. |editor2-last=Houben |editor2-first=Raf A.

Transparency International stated in 2014 that the United Kingdom fully complied to the OECD Convention against Bribery.&lt;ref name=Vogl /&gt;

==== Canada ====
[[Canada]] remained one of the last signatories of the OECD-convention on bribery that did not implement its national laws against bribes for foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act]] (CFPOA) was passed in 1999, it was often not used to prosecute foreign bribery by Canadian companies, as the bill had a provision that the act of bribery had to have a "real and substantial link" with Canada. Such provision was canceled in 2013 by the [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2013_26/FullText.html Bill S-14] (also called Fighting Foreign Corruption Act). Additionally, Bill S-14 banned facilitation payments and increased the possible punishment for violating the CFPOA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramsay |first1=Christopher J |last2=Wilson |first2=Clark |title=The Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Review – Edition 6: CANADA |date=January 2018 |publisher=The Law Reviews |url=https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-anti-bribery-and-anti-corruption-review-edition-6/1151845/canada |access-date=August 20, 2018 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the maximum prison sentence for bribery to 14 years was one of the increases in sanctioning.&lt;ref name=Aiolfi&gt;{{cite book |last=Aiolfi |first1=Gemma |editor1-last=Brodowski |editor1-first=Dominik |editor2-last=Espinoza de los Monteros de la Parra |editor2-first=Manuel |editor3-last=Tiedemann |editor3-first=Karl |editor4-last=Vogl |editor4-first=Joachim |title=Regulating Corporate Criminal Liability |publisher=Springer |date=2014 |pages=125–134 |chapter=Mitigating the Risks of Corruption Through Collective Action |isbn=978-3-319-05992-1 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-05993-8_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TI's report from 2014, Canada is moderately enforcing the OECD Convention against bribery.&lt;ref name=Vogl /&gt;

==== China ====
In the wake of economic liberalization, corruption increased in [[China]] because anti-corruption laws were insufficiently applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gong |first=Ting |last2=Zhou |first2=Na |date=2015 |title=Corruption and marketization |journal=[[Regulation &amp; Governance]] |volume=9 |pages=63–76 |doi=10.1111/rego.12054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign that started in 2012]], however, changed the relation towards corruption. This campaign led to increased press coverage of the topic and a sharp increase in court cases dedicated to the offense. The campaign was primarily led by the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), an internal body of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] and secondarily by the [[People's Procuratorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=Lyric |title=Who Enforces China's Anti-corruption Laws?

The underlying legal regulations for the campaign is rooted in provisions of the [http://www.lawinfochina.com/Display.aspx?lib=law&amp;Cgid=6359 Anti-Unfair Competition Law] and the [[Law of the People's Republic of China#Criminal Law|criminal law]].

==== Japan ====
After signing the OECD-Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf|title=Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions|last=|first=|date=2011|website=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Japan]] implemented the [http://www.mizogami.gr.jp/english/images/Unfair_Competition_Prevention_Act_of_Japan.pdf Unfair Competition Prevention Act] (UCPA) to comply with the convention. The law states that it is illegal to bribe foreign public officials. The individual who was offering the bribes and the company on whose behalf the bribes were offered may face negative consequences. The [http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=338223 Company Act] also enables the punishment of senior management if the payment was made possible by their [[negligence]]. Transparency International criticized Japan in 2014 for not enforcing the law, hence only complying to the convention on paper and providing no consequences to offenders.&lt;ref name=Vogl /&gt; Nevertheless, a study conducted by Jensen and Malesky in 2017 provides empirical evidence that Japanese companies are less involved in bribery than companies based in other Asian countries that did not sign the convention.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt;

== Governmental anti-corruption beyond the law ==
=== Prevention of corruption ===
[[Values education]] is believed to be a possible tool to teach about the negative effects of corruption and to create resilience against acting in a corrupt manner, when the possibility of doing so arises.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Another stream of thought on corruption prevention is connected to the economist [[Robert Klitgaard]], who developed an economic theory of corruption that explains the occurrence of corrupt behavior by producing higher gains than the assumed punishment it might provoke. Klitgaard accordingly argues for approaching this rational by increasing the costs of corruption for those involved by making fines more likely and more severe.

=== Good governance ===
As corruption incidences often happen in the interaction between representatives of private sector companies and public officials, a meaningful step against corruption can be taken inside of public administrations. The concept of [[good governance]] can accordingly be applied to increase the [[integrity]] of administrations, decreasing hence the likelihood that officials will agree on engaging in corrupt behavior.&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |last=Stukalo |first=Alexey |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=55 et seq |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency is one aspect of good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rubbra |first=Alice |title=What makes good governance? #2 in series: Why transparency in governance is so important |url=http://www.rightforeducation.org/all-topics/law-governance/good-governance-transparency/ |access-date=September 4, 2018 |language=en |publisher=R:Ed |date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency initiatives can help to detect corruption and hold corrupt officials and politicians accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schnell |first=Sabina |title=Cheap talk or incredible commitment?

Another aspect of good governance as a tool to combat corruption lies in the creation of trust towards state institutions. Gong Ting and Xiao Hanyu for instance argue that citizens, who have a positive perception of state institutions are more likely to report corruption related incidents than those, who espress lower levels of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gong |first1=Ting |last2=Xiao |first2=Hanyu |title=Socially Embedded Anti-Corruption Governance: Evidence from Hong Kong |journal=Public Administration &amp; Development |year=2017 |volume=37 |issue=3 |doi=10.1002/pad.1798 |issn=0271-2075 |pages=176–190 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanctions ===
Even though [[Sanctions (law)|sanction]]s seem to be underwritten by a legal framework, their application is often lying outside of a state-sponsored legal system, as they are frequently applied by [[International financial institutions#Multilateral development banks|multilateral development banks]] (MDB), state agencies, and other organizations, who are implementing those sanctions not through applying laws, but by relying on their internal bylaws. [[World Bank]], even though reluctant in the 20th century to use sanctions,&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'' pp.49 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; turned into a major source of this specific kind of applying anti-corruption measures.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; the involved MDBs are typically applying an administrative process that includes judicial elements, when a suspicion about corruption in regard to the granted projects surfaces. In case of identifying a sanctionable behavior, the respective authority can issue a [[debarment]] or milder forms, e.g. mandatory monitoring of the business conduct or the payment of fines.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'' pp. 213 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public sector procurement ===
Excluding companies with a track record of corruption from [[bidding]] for contracts, is another form of sanctioning that can be applied by procurement agencies to ensure compliance to external and internal anti-corruption rules.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect is of specific importance, as public procurement is both in volume and frequency especially vulnerable for corruption. In addition to setting incentives for companies to comply with anti-corruption standards by threatening their exclusion from future contracts, the internal compliance to anti-corruption rules by the procurement agency has central importance. Such step should according to anti-corruption scholars Adam Graycar and Tim Prenzler include precisely and unambiguously worded rules, a functional protection and support of whistleblowers, and a system that notifies supervisors on an early base about potential dangers of conflicts of interest or corruption-related incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graycar |first1=Adam |last2=Prenzler |first2=Tim |year=2013 |chapter=Chapter 7: Preventing Corruption in Public Sector Procurement |title=Understanding and Preventing Corruption |series=Crime Prevention and Security Management |language=en |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |pages=100–113 |doi=10.1057/9781137335098 |isbn=978-1-137-33508-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society ==
Michael Johnston, among others, argued that [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), [[Civil Society Organization]]s (CSOs), and the [[Mass media|media]] can have an efficient influence on the level of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Johnston |editor-first=Michael |title=Civil Society and Corruption: Mobilizing for Reform |date=2005 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-3125-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More over, Bertot et al. (2010) extended the list of potentially involved agents of civil society by introducing the notion of decentralized, non-formally organized anti-corruption activism through [[social media]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertot |first1=John C. |last2=Jaeger |first2=Paul T. |last3=Gimes |first3=Justin M. |title=Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies |journal=Government Information Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/j.giq.2010.03.001 |year=2010 |pages=264-271 |language=en |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X10000201#! |access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into consideration that precise and comprehensive definitions of corrupt actions are lacking, the legal perspective is structurally incapable of efficiently ruling out corruption. Combined with a significant variety in national laws, frequently changing regulations, and ambiguously worded laws, it is argued that non-state actors are needed to complement the fight against corruption and structure it in a more holistic way.&lt;ref name=Graycar4 /&gt;

=== Ensuring transparency ===
An example for a more inclusive approach to combating corruption that goes beyond the framework set by lawmakers and the foremost role taken by representatives of the civil society is the monitoring of governments, politicians, public officials, and others to increase [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]]. Other means to this end might include pressure campaigns against certain organizations, institutions, or companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Büthe |first=Tim |date=2004 |title=Governance through private authority? Non-state actors in world politics |journal=[[Journal of International Affairs]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=281–290 |url=https://people.duke.edu/~buthe/downloads/Buthe_JIA_corrected.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Investigative journalism]] is another way of identifying potentially corrupt dealings by officials. Such monitoring is often combined with reporting about it, in order to create [[publicity]] for the observed misbehavior. Those mechanisms are hence increasing the price of corrupt acts, by making them public and negatively impacting the image of the involved official. One example for such strategy of combating corruption by exposing corrupt individuals is the [[Albania]]n television show ''[[Fiks Fare]]'' that repeatedly reported on corruption by airing segments filmed with hidden cameras, in which officials are accepting bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Musaraj |first=Smoki |title=Corruption, Right On! Hidden Cameras, Cynical Satire, and Banal Intimacies of Anti-corruption |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |year=2018 |volume=59 |pages=105–116 |doi=10.1086/696162 |issn=0011-3204 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education on corruption ===
Another sphere for engagement of civil society is the prevention by educating about the negative consequences of corruption and a strengthening of ethical values opposing corruption. Framing corruption as a moral issue used to be the predominant way of fighting it but lost importance in the 20th century as other approaches became more influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bardhan |first=Pranab |authorlink=Pranab Bardhan |title=Corruption and Development: A Review of Issues |year=1997 |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=1320-1346 |jstor=2729979 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacio Terracino (2012), pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest organization in the field of civil societal opposition towards corruption is the globally active NGO [[Transparency International]] (TI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |last=Stukalo |first=Alexey |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=142 et seq |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs are also providing material to educate practitioners on anti-corruption. Examples for such publications are the rules and suggestions provided by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), and TI.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent work by civil societal organizations can also go beyond establishing a knowledge about the negative impact of corruption and serve as way to build up political will to prosecute corruption and engage in counter-corruption measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayogu |first1=Melvin |chapter=Non-state actors and value recovery: Ganging up political will |editor1-last=Thelesklaf |editor1-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Gomes Pereira |editor2-first=Pedro |year=2011 |title=Non-State Actors in Asset Recovery |language=en |pages=93–108 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-3-0343-1073-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-state actors in the field of asset recovery ===
{{Main|International asset recovery}}
One prominent field of activism for non-state actors (NSAs) is the area of [[international asset recovery]], which describes the activity of returning property to its legitimate owners after it was illegally acquired through corrupt actions. The process describes the whole procedure from gathering information on the criminal offence that initiated the transfer of assets, over their confiscation to their return. While recovery is mandated by UNCAC, it is not an activity singularity conducted by governments but attracts actors with different backgrounds, including [[academia]], the media, CSOs, and other non state actors. In this field of anti-corruption activism, representatives of the civil society are often taking a different stance than in other areas, as they are regularly consulted for assisting administrations with their respective expertise and are hence enabling state actions. Such strong role of NSAs was also recognized by UNCAC's States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gomes Pereira |first1=Pedro |last2=Roth |first2=Anja |last3=Attisso |first3=Kodjo |chapter=A stronger role for non-state actors in the asset recovery process |editor1-last=Thelesklaf |editor1-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Gomes Pereira |editor2-first=Pedro |year=2011 |title=Non-State Actors in Asset Recovery |language=en |pages=1–15 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-3-0343-1073-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate anti-corruption approaches ==
=== Compliance ===
{{Main|Regulatory compliance}}
Instead of relying purely on deterrence, as suggested by Robert Klitgaard (see [[#Prevention of corruption|section on prevention]]), [[economist]]s are pursuing the implementation of [[incentive]] structures that reward [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] and punish the non-fulfillment of compliance rules. By aligning the self-interest of the agent with the societal interest of avoiding corruption, a reduction in corruption can thus be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Teichmann |first=Fabian Maximilian Johannes |date=2017 |title=Anti-Bribery Compliance Incentives |publisher=Kassel University Press |isbn=978-3-7376-5034-2 |pages=102 et seq |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of compliance can generally be perceived as an internalization of external laws in order to avoid their fines. The adoption of laws like the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act of 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents|title=Bribery Act 2010|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; strengthened the importance of concepts like compliance, as fines for corrupt behavior became more likely and there was a financial increase on these fines. When a company is sued because its employers engaged in corruption, a well-established compliance system can serve as proof that the organization attempted to avoid those acts of corruption. Accordingly, fines can be reduced and this incentivizes the implementation of an efficient compliance system.&lt;ref name=Compliance17 /&gt; In 2012, the US-authorities decided not to prosecute [[Morgan Stanley]] in a case of bribery in China under FCPA-provisions due to its compliance program.&lt;ref name=Aiolfi /&gt; This case demonstrates the relevance of the compliance approach. 

=== Collective action ===
Anti-corruption collective action is a form of [[collective action]] with the aim of combatting corruption and bribery risks in [[Government procurement|public procurement]]. It is a collaborative anti-corruption activity that brings together representatives of the private sector, public sector and civil society. The idea stems from the academic analysis of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in [[game theory]] and focuses on establishing rule-abiding practices that benefit every stakeholder, even if unilaterally each stakeholder might have an incentive to circumvent the specific anti-corruption rules. Transparency International first floated a predecessor to modern collective action initiatives in the 1990s with its concept of the ''Island of Integrity'', now known as an [[integrity pact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Integrity Pact |publisher=Transparency International |date=2016 |language=en |url=https://transparency.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Integrity-Pact-ENG.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Transparency International, "collective action is necessary where a problem cannot be solved by individual actors" and therefore requires stakeholders to build trust and share information and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collective Action on Business Integrity |publisher=Transparency International |date=2018 |language=en |url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/collective_action_on_business_integrity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank Institute states that collective action "increases the impact and credibility of individual action, brings vulnerable individual players into an alliance of like-minded organizations and levels the playing field between competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalcompact.de/wAssets/docs/Korruptionspraevention/Publikationen/fighting_corruption_through_collective_action.pdf ''World Bank Institute: Fighting Corruption Through Collective Action'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-corruption collective action initiatives are varied in type, purpose and stakeholders but are usually targeted at the supply side of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collective-action.com/resources/collective_action B20 Collective Action Hub]&lt;/ref&gt; They often take the form of collectively agreed anti-corruption declarations or standard-setting initiatives such as an industry [[code of conduct]]. A prominent example is the [[Wolfsberg Group]] and in particular its ''Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Private Banking and Anti-Corruption Guidance'', requiring the member banks to adhere to several principles directed against money laundering and corruption. The mechanism is designed to protect individual banks from any negative consequences of complying with the strict rules by collectively enforcing those regulations. The Wolfsberg Group in addition serves as a back-channel for communication between the compliance officers of the participating banks.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 225 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Economic Forum's initiatives against corruption can also be seen in this framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=155 |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other initiatives in the field of collective action include the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] (EITI), [[Construction Sector Transparency Initiative]]/[[Infrastructure Transparency Initiative]] (CoST) and [[International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct]] (IFBEC).&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'' pp.226-227&lt;/ref&gt; Collective action is included in the national anti-corruption statements of the UK&lt;ref&gt;[https://iaccseries.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/United_Kingdom_National_Statement_2018.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;, France&lt;ref&gt;[https://iaccseries.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/France_National_Statement_2018-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghana&lt;ref&gt;[https://iaccseries.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ghana_National_Statement_2018.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;, delivered at the [[International Anti-Corruption Conference]] 2018.

The [[List of G20 summits#B20 summits|B20]] policy interventions are another form of engaging in the anti-corruption discourse, as B20 members are attempting to support the [[G20]] by offering their insights as business leaders, including in regard to strengthening anti-corruption policies, e.g. transparency in government [[procurement]] or more comprehensive anti-corruption laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OSCE Handbook on Combating Corruption |last=Stukalo |first=Alexey |publisher=OSCE |date=2016 |pages=155 et seq |language=en |url=https://www.osce.org/secretariat/232761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the B20 mandated the [[Basel Institute on Governance]] to develop and maintain the [https://www.collective-action.com/ B20 Collective Action Hub], an online platform for anti-corruption collective action tools and resources including a database of collective action initiatives around the world. The B20 Collective Action Hub is managed by the Basel Institute's International Centre for Collective Action (ICCA) in partnership with the [[UN Global Compact]].

Another tangible outcome of the B20 meetings was the discussion (and implementation as a test case in [[Colombia]]) of the [[High Level Reporting Mechanism]] (HLRM), which aims to implement a form of [[ombudsman]] office in a high-level government position for companies to report possible bribery or corruption issues in public procurement tenders.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Colombia, the HLRM concept has been implemented in different ways in Argentina, Ukraine and Panama.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collective-action.com/initiatives/hlrm HLRM case studies on the B20 Collective Action Hub]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation ===
Sylvie Bleker-van Eyk from [[VU University Amsterdam]] sees value in the implementation of strong compliance departments in the respective company.&lt;ref name=Compliance17 /&gt; Fritz Heimann and Mark Pieth are described the environment where those departments are working, as being in a best cased monitored from outside experts.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'' p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Another measure that – according to Heimann and Pieth – supports the work of compliance officers is when the company is joining collective action initiatives.&lt;ref name="CC Collective Action"&gt;''Confronting Corruption'', pp. 235 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments like [[ethical code]]s can serve as underlying documents to promote support for anti-corrupt corporate policies. Seumas Miller et al. (2005) also stress the process of reaching the aspired result, which should include an open discussion among the employees of a company, in order to implement steps that are approved by consent inside of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Seumas |last2=Roberst |first2=Peter |last3=Spence |first3=Edward |title=Corruption and Anti-Corruption: An Applied Philosophical Approach |date=2005 |lccn=2004002505 |isbn=978-0-13-061795-8 |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such shift in culture can be implemented through and accompanied by exemplary behavior by top management, regularly conducted  training programs on anti-corruption and a constant monitoring of the development in those sections.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting Corruption'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==
{{Main|International Anti-Corruption Day}}
[[International Anti-Corruption Day]] has been annually observed on [[December 9]] since the United Nations established it in 2003 to underline the importance of anti-corruption and provide visible sign for anti-corruption campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anticorruptionday.org/actagainstcorruption/index.html |access-date=August 14, 2018 |publisher=UNODC |title=Main page of the campaign for an International Anti-Corruption Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Change, formerly The '''Center for Community Change''' ('''CCC'''), is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[community organizing]] group active in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/deepak-bhargava/|title=Activists to Watch: Deepak Bhargava|date=October 24, 2013|publisher=Moyers &amp; Company|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1968 in response to civil rights concerns of the 1960s and to honor [[Robert F.

==Activities==
Community Change generally works in low-income areas, especially within communities of color, and attempts to create resident-based groups to work on local issues of concern. The organization sponsors internships and training programs in several areas, including [[community organizing]], [[service learning]], [[union organizing]], electoral engagement, and youth/student organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/fashion/12organizer.html?_r=2|title=Community Organizing Never Looked So Good|date=April 10, 2009|publisher=New York Times|last1=Rimer|first1=Sara|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides resources for grassroots groups including campaign strategy, funding and social media strategy. In 2004, through the collaboration with immigrant groups, Community Change organized the Fair Immigration Reform Movement that "empowered immigrants to speak out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stolz|first=Rich|year=2011|title=Lessons For The Future Of Immigration Reform|url=|journal=Social Policy|volume=41.3|pages=4–19|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Change has helped to create government programs like the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] and the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps program]].&lt;ref name="poverty22"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Poverty, Volume 1|date=2006|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452265186|page=134|last1=Odekon|first1=Mehmet}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization seeks to create workplace environments that value family, to guarantee minimum wage, "unlock opportunities in the poorest communities, and increase income taxes for the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leong|first=F|last2=Tang|first2=M|year=2016|title=Career Barriers for Chinese Immigrants in the United States|url=|journal=Career Development Quarterly|volume=64.3|pages=259–271|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Community Change launched the [[Fair Immigration Reform Movement]] (FIRM), an immigration reform movement working for comprehensive immigration reform. FIRM received funding from the [[Open Society Foundations]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/center-community-change-fair-immigration-reform-movement|title=Center for Community Change / Fair Immigration Reform Movement|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/grantdetails?grantid=121322|title=Center for Community Change|publisher=Ford Foundation|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chester E Groth Music Company''' was founded in 1939 in downtown [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] by professional musician Chester E. Groth.  Prior to opening Groth Music, he was a cornetist in the [[United States Navy Band]], and he also performed under the direction of [[John Philip Sousa]].  In addition to importing and selling musical instruments, music lessons were provided by Mr. Groth and his staff. Groth's daughter Nancy Groth-Kersten assumed ownership of the company in 1985 when it moved to [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/nancy-groth-kersten Oral History:  Nancy Groth-Kersten] (January 19, 2012).  [[NAMM|National Association of Music Merchants]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Groth Music acquired Music Products Inc. from [[Elmhurst, Illinois]], expanding its nationwide service to school music programs.  In 2014 the company acquired Eble Music Company from [[Iowa City, Iowa]], which expanded Groth Music's printed music division.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Critical theory of maker education''' asserts that [[maker education]] curriculum and pedagogy necessarily aligns itself with the greater educational imperative (as described in the ''[[Critical Pedagogy Primer]]'') that "questions of democracy and justice cannot be separated from the most fundamental features of teaching and learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Pedagogy|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe L.|publisher=Peter Lang Primer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8204-7262-1|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational Critical Theorists like [[Paulo Freire]] in his seminal work, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', stressed the need for a new relationship between teacher, student, and school, that would cultivate in students radical liberation from the political injustices that oppress them. [[Maker education]] is another avenue by which radical liberation is possible.

Scholars Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of [[Northwestern University]], and Meg Escude of [[Exploratorium]], offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces [[educational inequality]] by perceiving learners from backgrounds that are not "grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices" through the deficit lens of the [[culture of poverty]]. Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for "equity-oriented design" of maker experiences which include, "critical analyses on educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making".

In his article "A more lovingly made world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=2013|title=A more lovingly made world|url=|journal=Cultural Studies Review|volume=19|pages=296–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie Wark of [[The New School]] writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] and Mark Hatch evoke [[Karl Marx|Marx]] in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer.

Alessandro Carelli, Massimo Bianchini, and Venanzio Arquilla of the [[Politecnico di milano|Politecnico di Milano]] argue that [[maker culture]] presents a "maker contradiction" in which [[DIY]] producers in the "so-called Third Industrial Revolution" become post-production consumers, further reinforcing hierarchies of social, political, and economic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carelli|first=Alessandro|last2=Massimo Bianchini|first2=and Venanzio Arquilla|year=2014|title=The 'Makers contradiction.'

'''DBLP''' is a [[computer science]] [[bibliography]] website. Starting in 1993 at the [[University of Trier]], [[Germany]], it grew from a small collection of HTML files&lt;ref name="Ley2009"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ley |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Ley |title=DBLP: Some Lessons Learned |url=https://dblp.org/xml/docu/dblpxml.pdf |event=[[VLDB conference|VLDB]] |work=Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=2009 |pages=1493–1500 |citeseerx=10.1.1.151.3018 |issn=2150-8097 |doi=10.14778/1687553.1687577 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an organization hosting a [[database]] and [[logic programming]] bibliography site. DBLP listed more than 3.66 million journal articles, conference papers, and other publications on computer science in July 2016, up from about 14,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dblp.org/statistics/recordsindblp |title=Records in DBLP |department=Statistics |website=DBLP |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All important journals on computer science are tracked.

For his work on maintaining DBLP, [[Michael Ley]] received an award from the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and the VLDB Endowment Special Recognition Award in 1997.

''DBLP'' originally stood for ''DataBase systems and Logic Programming''. As a [[backronym]], it has been taken to stand for ''Digital Bibliography &amp; Library Project'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ley |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Ley |last2=Reuther |first2=Patrick |title=Maintaining an Online Bibliographical Database: the Problem of Data Quality. |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c21/813827533edf65744772d471433cba0c15a6.pdf |journal=EGC, ser.

Users of dblp remain unaffected by some additional attributes in the DTD {{as of|2016|February|lc=y}}, which are meant to support future versions of the data file. Thus consumers of the raw dblp.xml file should update their local dblp.dtd file, according to the notice on the home page, {{as of|2016|February|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 29, 2016 |title=Small modifications to dblp's XML format |url=https://dblp.org/news/2016 |department=News |website=DBLP |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''DBL-Browser'' (''Digital Bibliographic Library Browser'') is a utility for browsing the DBLP website. The browser was written by Alexander Weber in 2005 at the [[University of Trier]]. It was designed for use off-line in reading the DBLP, which consisted of 696,000 bibliographic entries in 2005 (and in 2015 has more than 2.9 million).

DBL-Browser is [[GPL]] [[software]], available for download from [[SourceForge]]. It uses the [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]. Written in [[Java programming language]], this code shows the bibliographic entry in several types of screens, ranging from graphics to text:
*Author page
*Article page
*Table of contents
*Related conferences / journals	
*Related authors (graphic representation of relationships)
*Trend analysis (graphics histogram)

DBLP is similar to the bibliographic portion of [[arxiv.org]] which also links to articles. DBL-Browser provides a means to view some of the associated computer science articles.

The '''Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme (DTUS)''' is a university sponsorship programme for students who want to join the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]] or [[DESG|Engineering and Science branch]] of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Civil Service as technical officers after they graduate; Army sponsored students are destined for either the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]], [[Royal Engineers]] or [[The Royal Logistic Corps]]. Students on the scheme are sponsored by the MOD to study accredited technical degree programmes.

==Background==

The DTUS was created following the 2001 [[Defence Training Review]] (DTR). The DTR identified that the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[DESG|MOD Civil Service]] had difficulties in recruiting engineering officers. As a result, DTUS was created whereby sponsored students study at eleven partner universities ([[Aston University|Aston]], Birmingham, Cambridge, Imperial College, Loughborough, Newcastle, Northumbria, Portsmouth, Southampton and Strathclyde)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsfc.ac.uk/University-and-Degree-Choices}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   DTUS is expected to reach and maintain a strength of eight hundred students in September 2016.

==Aim==

The aim of DTUS is ‘to educate and develop selected individuals to prepare them for further training and careers as engineer or technical officers in the Armed Forces or as graduate entrants to the MOD Civil Service’.&lt;ref&gt;DEFAC/DCMT/20/65/20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support units==

DTUS students are able to choose the partner university they wish to study at and select a degree course that has been approved by their sponsoring service. Whilst at their partner university, all students belong to a support unit who are responsible for their leadership development, mentorship and administration.  They also closely monitor academic progress, to that end the commanding officer of each support unit has visiting lecturer status at their university to support this.  There are four support units throughout the UK:

*'''Taurus Squadron'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTOESS – Taurus Squadron|url=http://www.da.mod.uk/dtoees/taurus-squadron|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Birmingham]] supports students at [[Aston University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.aston.ac.uk/eas/undergraduate/dtus/ Aston University – School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science – DTUS]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Birmingham]].  It also administers students at the [[University of Oxford]].
*'''Thunderer Squadron'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTOESS – Thunderer Squadron|url=http://www.da.mod.uk/dtoees/thunderer-squadron|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Southampton]] supports students at the [[University of Southampton]] as well as the [[University of Portsmouth]].  It also administers students at [[Imperial College London]].
*'''Trojan Squadron'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTOESS – Trojan Squadron|url=http://www.da.mod.uk/dtoees/trojan-squadron|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] supports students at [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armed Services choose Newcastle University to train Officers of the future |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/1024492050 |publisher=[[Newcastle University]] |date=19 June 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711015954/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/1024492050 |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northumbria University|Northumbria]] universities. It administers students at the [[University of Strathclyde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strathclyde joins the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme|url=http://www.strath.ac.uk/mec/news|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Typhoon Squadron'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTOESS – Typhoon Squadron|url=http://www.da.mod.uk/dtoees/typhoon-squadron|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Loughborough]] supports students at [[Loughborough University]].  It also administers students at [[Cambridge university]].

===Staffing===

Each support unit is commanded by the same equivalent rank from each service; Taurus and Trojan Squadrons – [[lieutenant colonel]], Thunderer Squadron – [[commander]] and Typhoon Squadron – [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]].  There are a Royal Navy lieutenant, an Army [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and a Royal Air Force [[flight lieutenant]] working as training officers in each squadron.  Additionally at each squadron there is an SNCO and a civilian administrator. Assisting at each squadron are in-service degree officers who are commissioned officers reading for a degree at the partner university.

==Students==

Each military sponsored student is a member of their respective service reserve forces (and holds a Service number) and holds the rank of [[officer cadet]] ([[midshipman]] for Royal Navy-sponsored students).  All students receive an annual bursary and also receive training pay for the activities that they participate in.  In return, students are expected to remain physically fit (pass an annual fitness assessment known as a PFA), advance each academic year and serve for a minimum of three years in the Armed Forces or MOD Civil Service after graduating from Initial Officer Training (IOT).

The majority of entrants on the DTUS are graduates of the [[Welbeck College|Defence Sixth Form College (Welbeck)]] near [[Woodhouse, Leicestershire]].  However, students studying or scheduled to study an approved degree at either of the partner universities may also apply to join the scheme as a Direct Entrant (DE)

'''[[Second Life]]''' is used as a platform for education by many institutions, such as colleges, universities, libraries and government entities.

==Impact and current status==
There are over one hundred regions used for educational purposes covering subjects such as chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slusage.com/chemistry.asp |title=Chemistry in Second Life |publisher=Slusage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagelab.com/ |title=A Real School in Second Life |publisher=Languagelab.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literaturealive.blogspot.com/ |title=English Literature in Second Life |publisher=Literaturealive.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors and researchers in Second Life favor it because it is more personal than traditional distance learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Lagorio |title=The Ultimate Distance Learning |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/education/edlife/07innovation.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate = 2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2007 suggested that development, teaching and/or learning activities using Second Life were present in over 80 percent of UK universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Kirriemuir |title=Snapshots of Second Life use in UK HE and FE|url=http://www.eduserv.org.uk/foundation/studies/slsnapshots |work=[[Eduserv Foundation]] |date=2007-05-05 |accessdate = 2008-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, at least 300 universities around the world teach courses or conduct research in SL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Michels |title=Universities Use Second Life to Teach Complex Concepts|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/252550 |work=[[Government Technology]] |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New educational institutions have also emerged that operate exclusively within Second Life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Erard |title=A Boon to Second Life Language Schools|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18510/?a=f |work=[[Education]] |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking advantage of the platform to deliver content to a worldwide audience at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Cowan |title=The 'second wave' of Second Life|url=http://uk.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=92549&amp;videoChannel=6 |work=[[News]] |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the announced closure of [[Teen Second Life]] in 2010-2011, many derivative [[OpenSimulator]] grids have been established for hosting educational projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Structure==
''Info Islands'' uses library programming sponsored by the Illinois' [[Alliance Library System]] and OPAL currently offered online to librarians and library users within Second Life. Another virtual continent called ''[[SciLands]]'' is devoted to science and technology education. While initially centered on the [http://slispaceflightmuseum.org/drupal/ International Spaceflight Museum], it now hosts a number of organizations including [[NASA]], [[NOAA]], [[NIH]], [[JPL]], [[NPR]], [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]], and a host of other government agencies, universities, and museums. In December 2008, the United States [[Air Force]] launched MyBase, a Second Life island overseen by the Air Education and Training Command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123126243 |title=AETC opens virtual doors to MyBase |publisher=Af.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Life's usefulness as a platform for pre-[[K–12 (education)|K–12]] education is limited due to the age restrictions on the main grid and the difficulties of collaborating among various educational projects on the teen grid. New approaches to fostering collaboration on the teen grid, such as the ''Virtual World Campus'', offer some hope of overcoming some of these obstacles. For now, however, the primary utility of Second Life for pre-K–12 education is in the education and professional development of teachers and school librarians. Still, K–12 educators use Second Life to meet each other and to create objects and structures that help them develop curriculum, as [[EnergyTeachers.org]] does with its Sustainability Energy Science Lab.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Controversy==

===Ban of educational institution===
[[File:Woodbury University SL Campus 100411.jpg|thumb|[[Woodbury University]]'s virtual campus]]

Second Life has twice, in 2007 and 2010, banned a California educational institution, [[Woodbury University]], from having a representation within Second Life. On 20 April 2010 four simulators belonging to the university were deleted and the accounts of several students and professors terminated, according to ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. Dr. Edward Clift, the dean of Woodbury University's School of Media, Culture and Design, stated that their campus "was a living, breathing campus in Second Life", that included educational spaces designed mostly by students, including a mock representation of the former [[Soviet Union]] and a replica of the [[Berlin Wall]]. 
As Dr. Clift told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', the virtual campus did not "conform to what Linden Lab wanted a campus to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Death of a Virtual Campus |author=Andrea L. Foster |newspaper= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date= July 13, 2007 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Death-of-a-Virtual-Campus/12732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle-2010"&gt;{{cite news |title= Woodbury U.

The university has since moved to a separate, dedicated [[OpenSimulator]] grid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

The '''General Archive of the Nation''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Archivo General de la Nación'') are the national archives of [[Argentina]]. It is a body under the Ministry of the Interior, Public Works and Housing, which aims to collect, order and keep the documentation that the law entrusts to it, to spread knowledge of the sources of Argentine history.

==Overview==
The archives were established on August 28, 1821, by Governor [[Martín Rodríguez (politician)|Martín Rodríguez]] as the [[Buenos Aires Province]] Archive. The institution (AGN) absorbed numerous historical archives, libraries, and other collections over the subsequent decades, and in 1957 acquired the National Print Archive, a bureau established in 1939. Its collections occupy around 14&amp;nbsp;km (9&amp;nbsp;mi) of shelf stacks, and the AGN is a member of the [[Memory of the World Programme]], a [[UNESCO]] initiative.

Operated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the AGN is organized into five departments:

*''Written Documents''. This section curates parchments and manuscripts originating in the colonial [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and [[Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata]], as well as those dating from the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, and of the series of fledgling governments assembled during the [[Argentine War of Independence]].
*''Photographic Documents''. [[Photograph]]s dating from 1853 to 1983, totalling over 800,000, as well as the Witcomb Collection (images taken in the renowned former [[art gallery]] of its many exhibitions).
*''Library and Dissemination''. Oversees partnerships with archives and kindred institutions from around the world, serves as liaison to journalists and researchers, publishes all archive newsletters and periodicals, and maintains the sum of the institute's [[bibliography]] (over 100,000 books). This department, in turn, includes:
**''Bibliography Fund''. 80,000 volumes, and a [[periodicals]] library of over 1,500 titles.
**''Ernesto Celesia Collection''.13,000 volumes dating from the 19th century, and from several countries in South America.
**''José Juan Biedma Collection''. 717 period publications regarding the [[Paraguayan War]] and [[Argentina-Chile relations|boundary disputes with Chile]].
**''José A. Pillado Collection''. 1,044 tomes on Argentine and Western Hemisphere history.
**''[[Juan Domingo Perón]] Collection''. 4,000 volumes donated by the populist leader from his personal library. 
**''Periodicals Library''. Magazine and newspaper issues from the 19th and 20th centuries.
*''Cinema and Media''. Over 3,000 [[Cinema of Argentina|films]], [[newsreel]]s, [[Ampex]] tapes, and more recent multimedia items.
*''Intermediate Archive''. Established in 1979, the [[library science]] arm of the AGN assists archives and libraries nationwide and elsewhere with the classification and curation of items. This office also maintains the bulk of documentation produced by the array of [[State enterprise]]s, and was entrusted with these during President [[Carlos Menem]]'s [[privatization]]s drive.

===Headquarters===

Housed within the former Congress building in 1906, the AGN was relocated to its present address at 246 [[Leandro Alem Avenue]] (a former [[Banco Hipotecario|National Mortgage Bank]] office designed by Arturo Prins, and completed in 1920), upon the inaugural of the new Mortgage Bank building in 1950.

The headquarters cannot house the entirety of its vast collections, which include over {{convert|17|km|mi}} of shelves of documentation;&lt;ref name=caseros&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Historia-bien-custodiada_0_722327887.html|title=La Historia, bien custodiada|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Intermediate Archive, for instance, was opened in another, nearby building. Plans were announced for the archives' transfer to the former ALEA Building, a [[Rationalist architecture|Rationalist]] structure located behind the [[Alas Building]] that was ultimately sold to developer [[Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima (IRSA)|IRSA]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1998/08/31/e-04401d.htm  ''Clarín'' (August 31, 1998)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was approved in 2012 for a new main building for the AGN, designed by Fabio Estremera, Luciana Deschamps and Javier Gavernet, and to be located on the site of the former [[Caseros Prison]] in the [[Parque Patricios]] district.&lt;ref name=caseros/&gt;

'''Hilde Boman-Behram''' (née '''Hilde Sofer''', stage name '''Hilde Holger'''; 18 October 1905 – 24 September 2001) was an [[expressionist dance]]r, choreographer and [[dance teacher]] whose pioneering work in [[Physically integrated dance|integrated dance]] transformed [[modern dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://50yearsindance.com/category/hilde-holger/ |title=Hilde Holger  : Central European Expressionist Dancer |publisher=www.50yearsindance.com/category/hilde-holger/ |date=2011 |access-date=12 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212205154/http://50yearsindance.com/category/hilde-holger/ |archivedate=12 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hildeholger.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114194324/http://www.hildeholger.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 November 2006 |title=Hilde Holger: Central European Expressionist Dancer |publisher=hildeholger.com |date=2007 |access-date=18 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Holger came from a [[Reform Judaism|liberal Jewish]] family. She was born in 1905, the daughter of Alfred and Elise Sofer Schreiber.&lt;ref&gt;Sassenberg, Marina (2009). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100408232906/http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/holger-hilde "Hilde Holger"]] in ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. Jewish Women's Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Her father wrote poetry, and had died by 1908. Her grandfather [[Shoemaking|made shoes]] for the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian court]].

After [[Nazi Germany]] invaded [[Austria]], Holger fled [[Vienna]] in 1939, because her entry into England was denied, she went to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/08/guardianobituaries2 |title=Adi Boman : Scientist on an unresolved search for a cancer cure |author=Pascal, Julia |work=The Guardian |date=8 March 2000 |access-date=18 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mumbai]] she met the [[Homeopathy|homeopath]] and art loving Dr. Ardershir Kavasji Boman-Behram, they married in 1940.&lt;ref name="sueyounghistories.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sueyounghistories.com/archives/2008/12/22/ardeshir-kavasji-boman-behram-1909-2000/ |title=Ardeshir Kavasji Boman Behram 1909–2000 |publisher=sueyounghistories.com |date=22 December 2008 |access-date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, step-father and fourteen other relatives all perished in [[the Holocaust]].

Hilde Holger had two children. The first was born 1946 in India, her daughter Primavera Boman-Behram. In New York she became a dancer, sculptor and [[jewelry designer]]. In 1948 Holger's family emigrated to Britain.&lt;ref name="sueyounghistories.com" /&gt; Her second child, a son named Darius Boman-Behram, was born in 1949. He had [[Down syndrome]], but inspired Holger to work with physically disabled people.

==Work==
Hilde Holger started to dance at age six. At that time she was too young to join the ''Vienna State Academy of Music and Dramatic Art'', so she settled for ballroom dancing lessons taken with her sister (Hedi Sofer), until she was accepted to study with radical dancer [[Gertrud Bodenwieser]],&lt;ref&gt;Vernon-Warren, B. and Warren, C. (eds.) (1999) ''Gertrud Bodenwieser and Vienna's Contribution to Ausdruckstanz''. Routledge. p. 22. {{ISBN|90-5755-035-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then a professor at the Vienna State Academy. They were admirers of the work of [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]], as well as the artists of the [[Vienna Secession|Secession]]. Holger soon rose to be Bodenwieser's principal dancer and friend, and toured with Bodenwieser's company all over [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. She toured with her own Hilde Holger Dance Group as well. At age eighteen she had her first solo performance in the Viennese Secession. Later in the Viennese Hagenbund and theaters in [[Vienna]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]], her much-lauded [[expressionist dance]] caused quite a stir. Because of her passion for dance, in 1926 she formed the New School for Movement Arts in Palais Ratibor, right in the heart of [[Vienna]]. Her children's performances were danced in parks and in front of monuments there.

On 12 March 1938 [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] sent troops into [[Austria]], and adopted a law to unify the country with [[Austria]], at that time it was forbidden for [[Jews]] to perform. She received help to flee [[Austria]] from her friend Charles Petrach. She decided to go to [[India]] because that country's art was the most compelling to Western people, she said at that time.

In [[India]] she had the opportunity to incorporate new experiences into her work, especially the hand movements of [[Indian dance]]. Classical Indian dance has over three hundred of them, used to express life and nature. In 1941 Holger founded a new school of dance in [[Bombay]], she took students of all race, religion and nationality without prejudice. Like when she was in [[Vienna]], Holger again took part in the artistic community. Amongst her friends whom collaborated with her were the Indian dancers [[Uday Shankar]] and [[Ram Gopal (dancer)|Ram Gopal]]&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;, the later of whom danced in Holger's dance school. In 1948 because of the [[partition of India]] and the growing violence between [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] she emigrated again, this time to Britain.

Once in England, her Holger Modern Ballet Group performed in parks, churches and theaters. She again opened a new dance school, ''The Hilde Holger School of Contemporary Dance'' and remained faithful to their style of teaching that the body and mind must form one unit in order to be a good dancer. Her breakthrough in London, 1951, celebrated Holger with the [[premiere]] of "Under the Sea", inspired by the composition by [[Camille Saint-Saens]].

In 1972 she performed a piece titled "Man against flood", it was in honour of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] member [[Rewi Alley]]. It included dancers forming a human wall against a flood of water.&lt;ref&gt;Lei, W. (28 October 1972) "Man Against Flood". ''[[The New Evening Post]]''(in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt;

Her performance "Apsaras" (1983) explored her experiences in [[India]]. In the summer of 1983 she went back to [[India]], where she had been last in the year 1948. There she worked as a choreographer for a large dance group directed by Sachin Shankar.

Holger was particularly proud of her work with the mentally handicapped. She created a form of [[dance therapy]] for children who, like her son Darius, have [[Down syndrome]]. Holger was the first choreographer who mixed professional dancers with young adults with severe learning disabilities. In 1968 at the [[Sadler's Wells]], Holger orchestrated "Towards the Light", with music by [[Edvard Grieg]]. It was pioneering, innovative, and one of the first integrated dance pieces to be seen on a professional stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/26/guardianobituaries1 |title=Hilde Holger : As a dancer and teacher she kept the spirit of German expressionism alive in London |author=Pascal, Julia|work=The Guardian |date=26 September 2001 |access-date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life work==
Hilde Holger left a lasting impression on three generations of dancers and choreographers. While teaching her standards were high and she was not afraid of risk.&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt; She accepted students without prejudice, including students with disabilities, as long as they were sincere. One of her students, Wolfgang Stange, continued her work with people with learning difficulties, like [[Down syndrome]] and [[autism]], as well as people with physical disabilities. Stange's [[Amici Dance Theatre Company]] which was the first physically integrated dance company in Great Britain, which created a performance titled "Hilde" that was performed at the Riverside Theatre in London in 1996, and at the Odeon in [[Vienna]] in 1998. This HILDE Performance in Vienna excited the Ballet Master of the Vienna State Opera Ballet, who in turn put a performance on the stage of the Opera House with people with learning disabilities. These performances were received with great applause!

In her last few weeks Holger still held dance lessons in her basement studio in [[Camden Town|Camden]], London, where she lived for more than fifty years. Among some of her students included [[Lindsay Kemp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/lindsay-kemp-obituary

'''Jade Mitchell''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Gemma Pranita]]. Pranita's casting was announced on 7 September 2010 and she began filming her first scenes the day before. The actress was in Russia when she received a call from her agent about the audition for ''Neighbours''. She returned to Australia and her agent managed to get her in on the last day. Pranita won the part of Jade and she was given a twelve-month contact with the show. She relocated to Melbourne for filming and she made her first screen appearance as Jade during the episode broadcast on 10 December 2010. In June 2012, Pranita announced her departure from ''Neighbours''. She filmed her final scenes in August and departed on 29 October 2012.

Jade is the younger sister of [[Sonya Mitchell]] ([[Eve Morey]]). Prior to her arrival in Erinsborough, Jade had not seen Sonya for seven years. Pranita revealed that Jade was holding onto one of Sonya's darkest secrets and that she would have the potential to cause trouble for her. Jade has been described as "vivacious, confident and beautiful" by a writer for the official ''Neighbours'' website. She is an opinionated feminist, who has a fighting spirit. While Jade is flirtatious and a bit of a maneater, Pranita said she is "anti-relationships" and more interested in finding fun. Jade is a personal trainer and Pranita chose to take up an exercise routine for the role.

Jade's early storylines often saw her trying to mend the rocky relationship she had with her sister and bond with her nephew, [[Callum Jones]] ([[Morgan Baker]]), who she "loves and adores". Other storylines have revolved Jade's relationships with men. She immediately clashed with Sonya's partner and kissed [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) shortly after her arrival. She had a [[one-night stand]] with [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and developed feelings for her housemate, [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]). The couple initially entered into a [[Casual relationship|friends with benefits]] arrangement and Jade began an affair with [[Malcolm Kennedy]] ([[Benjamin McNair]]). Kyle and Jade later started a serious relationship together.

==Casting==
On 7 September 2010, a reporter for the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' announced Pranita had joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' as Jade Mitchell.&lt;ref name="Neighbourhood"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pranita moves into Neighbourhood|date=7 September 2010|work=[[Herald Sun]]|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said Pranita's character would arrive on Ramsay Street to expose a secret held by her sister, [[Sonya Mitchell|Sonya]] ([[Eve Morey]]).&lt;ref name="Neighbourhood"/&gt; Pranita was in Russia researching [[Anton Chekhov]] when her agent called her about an audition for ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="DoorOpen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neighbours.com.au/One_Door_Closes_Another_Opens!.htm|title=One Door Closes and Another Opens!|date=12 October 2010|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told a writer for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] "They were holding auditions and I happened to be in Russia doing a Chekhov pilgrimage because I'd received a grant. I just thought, oh well, it's not to be but then I came back and my agent called and said I can squeeze you in on the last day. So within a week I was moving cities."&lt;ref name="Pilgrimage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/news/gemmas-ramsay-st-pilgrimage|title=Gemma's Ramsay St pilgrimage|date=8 February 2011|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita was initially given a twelve-month contact and she began filming her first scenes on 6 September.&lt;ref name="Neighbourhood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prisoner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neighbours.com.au/Prisoner-Babes-Hit-the-Street.htm|title=Prisoner Babes Hit the Street!|date=7 September 2010|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=8 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916212115/http://neighbours.com.au/Prisoner-Babes-Hit-the-Street.htm|archivedate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her first on screen appearance as Jade in December 2010.&lt;ref name="Prisoner"/&gt; During an interview published the ''Neighbours'' official website, Pranita revealed that she had found the filming schedule was "quite full-on" and that she was still getting used to the early starts.&lt;ref name="PUncovered"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neighbours.com.au/Gemma-Uncovered.htm|title=Gemma Uncovered|date=5 May 2011|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
Jade has been described as being "vivacious, confident and beautiful" by a writer for the official ''Neighbours'' website.&lt;ref name="JMAus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neighbours.com.au/6972.htm|title=Jade Mitchell|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a flirtatious side and a "fighting spirit", which means nothing will stand in her way.&lt;ref name="JMAus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMHoly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/neighbours/cast/jade-mitchell-12496|title=Jade Mitchell|work=[[Holy Soap]]|accessdate=6 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xMAur1XJ?url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/neighbours/cast/jade-mitchell-12496|archivedate=21 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Brygel, writing for ''[[TV Week]]'', said Jade "clearly isn't backward in coming forward when it comes to getting what she wants in life."&lt;ref name="LookLucas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brygel|first=Jackie|date=11–17 December 2010|title=Look out, Lucas!|journal=[[TV Week]]|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita told Brygel that Jade is a feminist and a bit of a man eater.&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; The actress believed that she was not that similar to her character, saying "She is very opinionated which I can be, but I don't think I'm brash with my ideas or assert my ideas on to people which she does."&lt;ref name="Pilgrimage"/&gt; Pranita also said Jade is "anti-relationships" and more interested in having fun, whereas she has been in a relationship for five years.&lt;ref name="Pilgrimage"/&gt; However, when she was asked about what she would like to see in Jade's future, Pranita said she wanted her to meet a love interest who "really challenges her and breaks her down a bit, because she's a little bit of a martyr."&lt;ref name="SisterAct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/neighbours/news/sister-act-sonya-and-jade-12279|title=Sister act: Sonya and Jade|date=14 February 2011|work=[[Holy Soap]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jade is a personal trainer and a "fitness freak".&lt;ref name="Pilgrimage"/&gt; Pranita took up exercise during her research for the role, something she had not done before, and commented that she had enjoyed it.&lt;ref name="Pilgrimage"/&gt; In May 2011, Pranita confessed that she had not been able to maintain Jade's fitness routine and that, while she was still into it, her filming schedule had increased.&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; The actress also revealed that she had found that she now shared some similar personality traits with her character.&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; Pranita admitted that she and Jade hide their vulnerability and they do not like putting their "issues onto other people".&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; In July 2011, executive producer, Susan Bower revealed Jade would continue to be a "naughty girl" and that she was hiding a dark secret.&lt;ref name="Teases2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a330665/neighbours-character-teasers-from-exec-susan-bower.html|title=Exclusive: 'Neighbours' character teasers from exec Susan Bower|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita teased the storyline further saying Jade was too proud to share her secret with anyone and initially only the audience would know what the secret was.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/interviews/gemma-jade-will-surprise-viewers|title=Gemma: Jade will surprise viewers|date=27 July 2011|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers would also see Jade go on a "self-destructive path and becomes involved with an older man."&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt;

During an August 2011 interview with [[Digital Spy]]'s Daniel Kilkelly, Pranita said she was pleased with how the audience had responded to her character considering she was a "big personality".&lt;ref name="GP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a334889/gemma-pranita-neighbours-jade-mitchell.html|title=Gemma Pranita - 'Neighbours' Jade Mitchell|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita quipped that viewers had forgiven her "brash approach" and said they liked having a strong female character around.&lt;ref name="GP"/&gt; Asked if she had managed to put her own stamp on the character, Pranita revealed "I think there has been a marriage between the work I've done and what the writers have created, so we have inspired each other.

Before her arrival in Erinsborough, Jade had been estranged from her sister for seven years.&lt;ref name="JMHoly"/&gt; Jade calls Sonya out of the blue and Pranita explained "Sonya's response is 'Why are you calling me? Why now? Don't come anywhere near me!' But Jade keeps ringing and harassing Sonya and then rocks up on her doorstep."&lt;ref name="SecretPast"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brygel|first=Jackie|date=6–10 December 2010|title=Sonya's secret past|journal=[[TV Week]]|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jade's appearance on her doorstep sends Sonya into a panic.&lt;ref name="DoorOpen"/&gt; Pranita told ''TV Week's'' Jackie Brygel that the history between Jade and Sonya is bad and that Jade is "holding one of Sonya's darkest secrets".&lt;ref name="SecretPast"/&gt; Pranita believed that Jade had the potential to cause a lot of trouble for Sonya and expose her for lying to the people around her. She added that Jade would "completely rock the boat."&lt;ref name="SecretPast"/&gt; Morey revealed that the last time Sonya saw her younger sister was when she left her son, [[Callum Jones|Callum]] ([[Morgan Baker]]) with their grandmother, [[Hilda Jones|Hilda]] (Maureen Edwards). Sonya believes that Jade has come to Erinsborough to get "some revenge."&lt;ref name="SisterAct"/&gt; When Jade learns that Sonya has been living with Callum and that he is unaware of who she really is, she urges her sister to tell him the truth.&lt;ref name="SisterAct"/&gt; However, after seeing how happy the family is, Jade changes her mind.&lt;ref name="JMHoly"/&gt;

Pranita stated that Jade and Sonya's relationship was initially very "rocky", but after Jade sees how happy her sister is, she becomes "fiercely supportive" of her.&lt;ref name="SisterAct"/&gt; Pranita said "It's almost the Mitchell sisters against Ramsay Street."&lt;ref name="SisterAct"/&gt; Of her role in the Sonya/Callum storyline, Pranita told a writer for the show's official website "I was overwhelmed and completely intimidated, especially since Jade is such a confident character. I was so nervous and terrified but I had to exude confidence which was really hard. But at the same time it was thrilling. I was definitely thrown in the deep end with a bang."&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; Susan Bower said Jade "loves and adores" her sister and nephew and she quipped that the audience could tell Jade is "not a cold fish."&lt;ref name="Teases2011"/&gt; Jade does not initially get on well with Sonya's partner, [[Toadfish Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]). Pranita said both characters struggle with each other.&lt;ref name="SharedLove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/news/jade-and-toadies-shared-love|title=Jade and Toadie's shared love|date=13 February 2011|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told a reporter for Channel 5 "It's a very push-pull relationship and they can both be quite fiery so they really lay into each other."&lt;ref name="SharedLove"/&gt; Jade and Toadie eventually learn they both have a secret passion for board games and they begin to bond with one another.&lt;ref name="SharedLove"/&gt; When Sonya suffers a pregnancy scare she immediately confides in Jade, who is "level-headed" about the situation.

===Relationship with Kyle Canning===
When Pranita was asked which character she would like Jade to start a relationship with, she chose [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]).&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; She thought Jade and Kyle's contrasting personalities would work together, saying "They're opposites and personally, I really enjoy working with Chris. I think the characters can learn a lot from each other. Jade is very worldly and smart and Kyle has a more simple and uncomplicated nature."&lt;ref name="PUncovered"/&gt; Jade eventually develops feelings for Kyle and Pranita believed her character's feelings were for real and said it had taken her by surprise.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt; Jade and Kyle share a house together and on the night of their housewarming party they kiss, making Jade fall for Kyle even more.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt; However, she is frustrated when Kyle reveals that he still sees her as a friend.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=9–15 July 2011|title=What happens when?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=27|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita told a Channel 5 reporter that Jade is trying to fight her feelings for Kyle because she is terrified of relationships, however she does want him.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt; Jade decides to "let go of her reservations" and gets dressed up to make a move on Kyle.&lt;ref name="Woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/scoop/a335162/neighbours-jade-finally-tries-to-woo-kyle-video.html|title='Neighbours' Jade finally tries to woo Kyle - video|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=15 August 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have sex and Kyle suggests they engage in a [[Casual relationship|friends with benefits]] arrangement to which Jade agrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/neighbours/story-so-far/has-susan-gone-too-far/10436|title=Has Susan gone too far?|date=13 September 2011|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=24 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918145200/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/neighbours/story-so-far/has-susan-gone-too-far/10436|archivedate=18 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita told an ''Inside Soap'' journalist that Jade agrees to the arrangement as it is her way of working Kyle out of her system, but the opposite happens and she falls in love with him.&lt;ref name="Jealous"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1–7 October 2011|title=Jealous Jade!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=39|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle is unaware of Jade's feelings for him and he flirts with local nurse, [[Danielle Paquette]] (Georgia Bolton), in front of her.&lt;ref name="Jealous"/&gt; Jade becomes jealous and Pranita said she has never been affected like that before and is unsure how to handle it.&lt;ref name="Jealous"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=20%|align=left|bgcolor=#cccfff|quote="I would like to see her settle down, although I don't think she would actually settle.

Jade's situation gets worse as her new housemate, [[Rhys Lawson|Rhys]] ([[Ben Barber]]), notices how uncomfortable she is around Kyle and Danielle.&lt;ref name="Jealous"/&gt; Rhys confronts Jade and she denies her interest in Kyle because she is scared Rhys will tell him. Of this, Pranita said "Deep down, she's afraid that if Kyle ever finds out the truth about her feelings, he'll simply reject her..."&lt;ref name="Jealous"/&gt; Pranita quipped that Jade is too proud to admit she has fallen for someone, but Rhys becomes determined to make Jade face up to reality. Pranita explained "It's really challenging having that dynamic in the house, with another person knowing her secret.

She reveals that she was physically abused by her ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref name="EverAfter"/&gt; Pranita explained "She's never told anyone, not even her sister, Sonya. But Jade's a vault like that and, as hard as it is for her to talk about it, deep down there's an element of relief to share a part of her life with him. It is so difficult for her to talk about her personal life to anyone. So that's a really big deal."&lt;ref name="EverAfter"/&gt;

The moment between Jade and Kyle is ruined when Kyle learns of her relationship with [[Malcolm Kennedy]] ([[Benjamin McNair]]).&lt;ref name="EverAfter"/&gt; Jade tells Kyle that she only went with Malcolm to get over him, but it was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="JKTwist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a354461/neighbours-airs-new-jade-kyle-twist.html|title='Neighbours' airs new Jade, Kyle twist|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 December 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jade then declares her love for Kyle, but he turns his back on her and Jade decides to leave Erinsborough and go to Sydney.&lt;ref name="JKTwist"/&gt; However, she changes her mind at the last minute and decides not to get on the coach because she cannot leave Kyle.&lt;ref name="JKClimax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a354672/neighbours-airs-kyle-jade-plot-climax.html|title='Neighbours' airs Kyle, Jade plot climax|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 December 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jade then finds Kyle has come to stop her and they kiss.&lt;ref name="JKClimax"/&gt; The conclusion to Jade and Kyle's "will they, won't they?" storyline aired during ''Neighbours''' 2011 season finale week.&lt;ref name="JKClimax"/&gt; When asked about Jade and Kyle finally becoming a couple, Pranita told ''Inside Soap's'' Jason Herbison "Kyle is definitely thinking, 'Thank God she's finally come round!'. But I'm sure he's walking on eggshells because Jade is still so guarded."&lt;ref name="LoveList"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|date=11–17 February 2012|title=Love list 2012 - Kyle and Jade|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=6|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita explained that Jade has a lot of rules when it comes to relationships and she is on a huge emotional journey. The actress said that Jade wants to enjoy it, but cannot help worrying about when it will all stop.&lt;ref name="LoveList"/&gt;

Jade's relationship with Kyle ends in July 2012, after Kate confesses that they kissed.&lt;ref name="BrygelMiller"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brygel|first=Jackie|author2=Miller, Erin|date=7–13 July 2012|title=Kate confesses|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=27|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kate is feeling guilty about her kiss with Kyle and she tells Jade in the middle of the street. Jade then makes it clear that she want nothing more to do with Kate.&lt;ref name="BrygelMiller"/&gt; Pranita told ''TV Week's'' Jackie Brygel and Erin Miller that the news comes a complete shock to Jade and she is not sure how to process it in the moment. Pranita revealed "She had no clue, not a hint, that something was happening between them. Jade allowed herself to fall completely for Kyle. She felt as though she was in this amazing place and now Kate bursts that bubble in the most shocking of ways."&lt;ref name="BrygelMiller"/&gt; The actress explained that Jade feels it is the worst sort of betrayal and after she confronts Kyle, she "goes into self-defence protection mode" and decides to eliminate him from her life.&lt;ref name="BrygelMiller"/&gt; Pranita stated that she understands her character's reaction as she needs time to process and reflect. However, it is hard for her to punish Kyle as she really loved him.&lt;ref name="BrygelMiller"/&gt;

===Other relationships===

====Lucas Fitzgerald====
Shortly after her arrival, Jade sets her sights on [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]). After spending the evening flirting with him, she kisses him.&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; Pranita said Jade thinks Lucas is cute and there is an attraction between them. Of the kiss, Pranita said "Jade and Lucas have only just met, but Jade is very free-spirited and does things on impulse."&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; Lucas pulls away from the kiss as he has feelings for someone else, but Sonya witnesses it and is angry with her sister.&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; Pranita admitted that she was nervous about filming the scene as it was her first screen kiss and it occurred during her first week on the show.&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; When asked if the kiss is the start of a romance for Jade and Lucas, Pranita said that Jade is caught up with a lot of family issues for the moment, but anything could happen in the future.&lt;ref name="LookLucas"/&gt; In February 2011, Pranita commented on Jade and Lucas, saying they are both strong characters, who are quite similar as they are "loners who dance to their own beat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a304779/gemma-pranita-teases-neighbours-love.html|title=Gemma Pranita teases 'Neighbours' love|last=Rainey|first=Naomi|date=19 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major also said that he would like his character to have a romance with Jade.

[[File:Scott McGregor 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jade had a one-night stand with Mark Brennan, played by Scott McGregor (''pictured'').]]

====Mark Brennan====
In April 2011, a reporter for ''TV Week'' stated that Jade would have a [[one-night stand]] with [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]).&lt;ref name="TwistForJade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a316669/neighbours-twist-ahead-for-mark-jade.html|title='Neighbours' twist ahead for Mark, Jade|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=27 April 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jade and Mark grow closer after he goes for a drink at Charlie's, they play pool together and then "find themselves kissing."&lt;ref name="TwistForJade"/&gt; Pranita told the reporter that Jade is "risking the wrath" of her close friend [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]), who recently broke up with Mark.&lt;ref name="TwistForJade"/&gt; She said "Jade doesn't consider Kate in that moment, as she knows she's broken up with Brennan and doesn't appreciate that it's just not cool to hook up with other people's exes. But I think Kate will be horrified and shocked and angry."&lt;ref name="TwistForJade"/&gt; McGregor told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that he did not think Jade and Mark would have made a good match, and that it was a one off thing. He added that in some ways they regret it, but in others they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/scoop/a330497/neighbours-scott-mcgregor-on-bowing-out-as-brennan.html|title='Neighbours': Scott McGregor on bowing out as Brennan|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita later revealed that what Jade had learnt from the one-night stand with Mark was not to risk a friendship for a man again.&lt;ref name="SurpriseViewers"/&gt;

====Malcolm Kennedy====
Jade befriends Malcolm Kennedy in October 2011, and they begin flirting with each other.&lt;ref name="Mal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/215904|title=Jade Mitchell turns her attentions to Malcolm Kennedy|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=16 October 2011|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Hill from the ''Daily Star'' said Jade uses Malcolm to distract her from her feelings for Kyle. The fact Malcolm is married appeals to her because she knows there is no chance of a relationship there.&lt;ref name="CheatingHeart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mal"/&gt; Jade tells her sister that she is no longer thinking about Kyle and a concerned Sonya tries to warn her off Malcolm. However, Jade decides she needs some fun and reckons he is the person to help her.&lt;ref name="Mal"/&gt; Jade and Malcolm's innocent flirting turns into something more serious when they arrange a "late-night rendezvous."&lt;ref name="CheatingHeart"/&gt; Malcolm reminds Jade he is married, but that does not stop them from kissing.&lt;ref name="CheatingHeart"/&gt; Pranita said her character is a commitment-phobe and she told a ''TV Week'' writer "The reason she goes to Malcolm is purely to gain some sort of control back in her life because everything's spiralling out of control due to these feelings she has for Kyle. Her default position is to go back to what she knows - which is to hook up with men who won't want anything serious, like taken men or people who are up for a one-night stand. He's like a safety harness really."&lt;ref name="CheatingHeart"/&gt; Malcolm and Jade's affair comes to an end when [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) finds out about it.&lt;ref name="SaucyAffair"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/soaperstar/view/222752/Neighbours-Malcolm-Kennedy-ends-saucy-affair/|title=Malcolm Kennedy Ends Saucy Affair|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=27 November 2011|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jade does not appear to be fussed about the end of the affair and Malcolm is left "a little rattled" by her reaction.&lt;ref name="SaucyAffair"/&gt;

====Troy Miller====
[[File:Dieter Brummer 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|150px|In 2012, it emerged that Jade had been in an abusive relationship with [[Troy Miller (Neighbours)|Troy Miller]] ([[Dieter Brummer]] (''pictured'')).]]
In late 2011, Jade opened up to Kyle about her past and revealed that she had been in a relationship with an abusive man.&lt;ref name="TroysBack"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mercado|first=Andrew|date=26 May – 1 June 2012|title=Troy's back!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=21|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GShearer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/tv-learning-the-ropes-on-soaps/story-fn6ck8la-1226214300077|title=TV: Learning the ropes on soaps|last=Shearer|first=Geoff|date=6 December 2011|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pranita revealed to Geoff Shearer of ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' that Jade's ex would be introduced to the show in the new year.&lt;ref name="GShearer"/&gt; When [[Troy Miller (Neighbours)|Troy Miller]] ([[Dieter Brummer]]) returned to Ramsay Street in May 2012, Jade appeared "horrified" at his reappearance and in "an explosive development" it was revealed that he was her abusive ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref name="TroysBack"/&gt; Claire Crick from ''[[All About Soap]]'' commented that Troy "stooped to a new low" when he seemed almost proud of the fact that he was once "heavy-handed" with Jade.&lt;ref name="TrueColours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/neighbours-troy-shows-his-true-colours/|title=Neighbours: Troy shows his true colours!|last=Crick|first=Claire|date=27 June 2012|work=[[All About Soap]]|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick went on to say "We're so used to seeing Jade as the feisty fitness freak who's always in control, but Troy clearly has a hold over her that no one else has. She's still terrified of her ex, and it seems she's got good reason to be. We always knew he was a bad egg, but who'd have thought he was nasty enough to hurt his girlfriend?"&lt;ref name="TrueColours"/&gt; Pranita explained that she had to some research into domestic, physical and emotional violence for the storyline, as she had never been in an abusive relationship.&lt;ref name="GoodbyeVideo"&gt;{{cite video|people=Pranita, Jade|year=2012|title=Gemma Pranita on leaving Neighbours|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R503ciY-CM&amp;sns=tw|medium=Video interview|publisher=[[Neighbours]] and [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troy was Sonya's ex-boyfriend and the biological father of Callum. He returned to try and win custody of his son. After Callum confronts his father about reneging on a deal they had, Troy snaps and refuses to let him leave his house.&lt;ref name="Siege"&gt;{{cite journal|date=16–22 June 2012|title=Siege situation|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=24|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sonya and Jade become anxious at the development and eventually burst through the door and get Callum out, but Troy then locks them inside.&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt; Pranita revealed "Jade is taking on the very protective auntie role of looking after Callum. But she also knows Callum has no idea about how much of an untamed wild animal Troy is. Now, locked in the house with, she feels this is history repeating itself. Jade loathes Troy more now than she ever has."&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt; The actress found the scenes were some of the toughest she has ever shot, as they were unlike the normal drama they usually filmed. She called the storyline "intense" and found it harder than normal to let go of it when she went home.&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt; Pranita later stated that the Troy storyline had been her most difficult storyline to film during her time on ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="GoodbyeVideo"/&gt;

===Departure===
On 8 June 2012, Fiona Byrne of the ''Herald Sun'' reported Pranita would be departing ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="FByrne"/&gt; Byrne revealed that the actress had been offered a contract extension, but she had decided to leave.&lt;ref name="FByrne"/&gt; Pranita stated "The decision was made with a heavy heart as I love this job, but I just felt that two years was long enough to play one character.

During their housewarming party, Kyle and Jade kiss, but Jade is disappointed when Kyle says it did not mean anything. [[Michelle Tran]] (HaiHa Le) moves in to the spare room, but she soon annoys Jade and Kyle. Jade and Kyle have sex and enter into a [[Casual relationship|friends with benefits]] arrangement. Michelle later exposes Jade and Kyle's arrangement to Sonya and Lucas. Kyle then invites [[Rhys Lawson]] ([[Ben Barber]]) to move in. Kyle admits that he has feelings for Jade, but she rejects him. She later has an affair with Malcolm Kennedy, despite knowing he is married.

Jade is touched when Kyle gives her a handmade photo frame for Christmas and she opens up to him about her abusive ex-boyfriend and her commitment issues. The moment is ruined when Kyle learns of her affair with Malcolm. When Jade tells Kyle that she loves him, he walks away and she decides to leave. Just before she boards a coach to Sydney, Kyle finds her and tells her he loves her too. When Jade needs to boost her business, she comes up with the idea for a singles boot camp. Kyle asks Jade to move into his room, but she states that she is not ready although she does love him. Kyle's grandmother, [[Sheila Canning|Sheila]] ([[Colette Mann]]), arrives and make it clear that she does not think Jade is the right girl for Kyle.

Lawyer [[Charlotte McKemmie]] (Meredith Penman) tells Jade that she has some clients who are looking to [[franchising|franchise]] her singles boot camp idea. Sonya's ex-partner, Troy Miller, moves onto Ramsay Street and when Jade confronts him, it emerges that Troy was her abusive ex-boyfriend. Jade explains that she has medical records proving that he hit her and she gives them to Toadie to help his custody case. Jade explains to Sonya and Kyle that she was young and lonely when she fell for Troy. Jade later gives evidence at a mediation meeting. Troy locks Callum in his house and Jade and Sonya manage to get him out, before being locked in themselves. As Troy explains that he just wants to spend time with his son, Jade punches him in the stomach and she and Sonya escape. Troy ends up in hospital with a head injury and he claims that Jade attacked him. The police come to question Jade and she realises that she could face manslaughter charges if Troy dies. Troy regains consciousness and tells the police that Jade was not responsible for his injuries. Troy later dies and Jade admits that she is relieved.

Kate tells Jade that she and Kyle kissed, and a devastated Jade orders Kyle to leave the house. Sheila later apologises to Jade for encouraging Kate to go after Kyle. Jade is touched when Kyle organises a party for her and when one of her clients asks her out, she turns him down as she is not over Kyle. She then admits to Kyle that she still loves him and they get back together. Jade purchases [[Lou Carpenter]]'s ([[Tom Oliver]]) share of Kyle's business and demonstrates her skill in negotiating a lower price from hardware suppliers. Jade learns that some potential investors from the United States want to buy the rights to her singles boot camp franchise, and she decides to go to Los Angeles for six months to sort out the deal. Jade returns home a couple of times to see Kyle and Sonya. She later tells Kyle that she has been offered the chance to stay in Los Angeles for a year and he decides to break up with her, as he cannot leave Erinsborough. Jade thinks about staying, but Kyle tells her that she has to go and Jade leaves for Los Angeles.

'''''Kids Can Say No!''''', stylized as '''''Kids Can Say &lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt;''','' is a 1985 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Short film|short]] [[educational film]] produced and directed by Jessica Skippon and written by Anita Bennett. It is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]], how to escape such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. In the film, Australian celebrity [[Rolf Harris]] is in a park with a group of four children and tells them about proper and improper [[physical intimacy]], which he calls "yes" and "no" feelings. The film has four [[role-playing]] scenes in which children encounter [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], with Harris and the children discussing each scene.

Harris said that he came up with the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw [[Vancouver]]'s [[Green Thumb Theatre]] production of ''[[Feeling Yes, Feeling No]]'', a play about [[child sexual abuse]]. ''Kids Can Say No!'', released in October 1985 on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom, was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, ''[[The Times]]'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of ''Kids Can Say No!'' and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel ''Beyond the Scare'', which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of ''Kids Can Say No!'' eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.

''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault|indecently assaulting]] young girls. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]]. Harris was found guilty of all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming ''Kids Can Say No!'', he was in the midst of a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

Harris, then host of ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Time]]'', approached the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC) and the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] with his idea about making a film on child [[sexual abuse]]. Both organisations were receptive.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use [[child actor]]s in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Express]]|title=Hypocrisy: Rolf Harris Warned of Paedophiles in Children's Charity Video|author=Twomey, John|date=1 June 2014|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485939/Rolf-Harris-warned-of-paedophiles-in-children-s-charity-video|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris approached [[Film director|director]] Jessica Skippon, with whom he had made a film about water safety,&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; and said that he wanted to make ''Kids Can Say No!'' to protect children.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

In an interview, he said that his role of talking with children about sexual abuse in the film was a natural one because "my track record has made me a believable person. I have never betrayed the kids' trust".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

''Kids Can Say No!'' was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Artist to the Queen and Adored by Generations of Viewers|author=Bingham, John|date=1 July 2014|page=2|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=DT00000020140701ea710008d&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, how to get out of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt;

In April 1986, Harris met with [[Western Australia Police]] officials and members of several state-government departments in [[Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia|Mount Hawthorn]] to propose another film for children about how to handle [[sexual predator]]s. Despite Harris' offer to work for free, the officials declined and instead developed a broader campaign on the subject without Harris.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Sydney Opera House (9587195189).jpg|thumb|alt=Sydney Opera House|[[Child abuse|Child-abuse]] expert Carolyn Okell Jones presented ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the [[Sydney Opera House]] (''pictured'') in 1986 as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]].]]
''Kids Can Say No!'' was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; on [[VHS]]&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; with notes for teachers and two relevant books,&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were on the market in the UK including several also released that year, ''Kids Can Say No!'' was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In August 1986, Jones presented the film at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]], the largest conference in the world on child abuse. The 56-year-old Harris, who was chosen to be [[master of ceremonies]] for the three-day conference's opening event because of his celebrity and involvement with the film, told the audience that paedophilia was finally "coming out from under its veil of secrecy".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=The Dark Double Life of Rolf Harris|author=Guilliatt, Richard|author2=[[Jacquelin Magnay]]|date=12 July 2014|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/the-dark-double-life-of-rolf-harris/story-e6frg8h6-1226981773650|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
After the release of ''Kids Can Say No!'', many teachers who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of how to deal with the disclosures,&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt; ''Beyond the Scare''.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; ''Kids Can Say No!'' encourages children to report abuse they experience and ''Beyond the Scare'' advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

''Beyond the Scare'', filmed in a [[North London]] school, consists of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers to listen to the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote [[child protection]] projects in schools. Although Harris appears in ''Beyond the Scare'', his role is less prominent than in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=The Importance of Listening: The Issue of Child Sex Abuse|date=7 October 1986|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=40GH-HB00-00VY-8177&amp;csi=270944,270077,11059,8411&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=25 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

==Harris' trial==
[[File:Rolf Harris.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rolf Harris|In 2014, Harris was convicted of twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] against four young girls, having committed nine counts before the 1985 release of ''Kids Can Say No!'']]
''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the youngest was seven years old. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]].&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt;

After the trial began, Skippon warned media outlets that it was illegal to use the film without written permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|title=Rolf Harris Starred in Video about Protecting Children in 1980s|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/rolf-harris-starred-in-video-about-protecting-children-in-1985-9573633.html|first=Paul|last=Cheston|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director wrote to ''[[The Independent]]'' that no complaints were made against Harris during the making of the film.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; In an article about the allegations against Harris, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' noted that ''Kids Can Say No!'' was commissioned by the NSPCC;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|title=BBC Sex Scandal: A Gifted Entertainer who was Nervous of Groupies|author=Flint, John|date=21 April 2013|page=17|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=SUNTEL0020130421e94l00066&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; a NSPCC spokesperson responded, "The film was made independently by Rolf Harris and a film company nearly 30 years ago&amp;nbsp;... We did not commission it, fund it, make it or distribute it".&lt;ref name=Twomey/&gt;

[[Southwark Crown Court]] found Harris guilty of all twelve counts of indecent assault.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; During the trial, it was learned that, while making ''Kids Can Say No!'', Harris was involved in a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release,&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; The first complainant was about the age of the children in ''Kids Can Say No!,''&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; although the conviction related to this count was quashed in 2017.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42012064|title=Rolf Harris indecent assault conviction overturned|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt; A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in ''Kids Can Say No!'' said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Kids Can Say No!'' have generally been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music that is hard to forget".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

''The Times'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. [[Northampton]] [[social work]]er Helen Kenward said that she would not show the film to children. [[Psychiatrist]] Brendan McCarthy called it simplistic. According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. [[Physician]] Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt; Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that ''Kids Can Say No!'' is "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, best not for children at all, but as&amp;nbsp;... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to paedophilia and incest".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In a 1988 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' review, Judith Whelan writes that Harris is more serious in the film than he was when performing "[[Jake the Peg]]". According to Whelan, the film "would best be seen by children in a group, with an adult (teacher or parent) nearby who could encourage discussion after the show or answer children's questions during it".&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Saying 'No' is a Child's First Defence|author=Whelan, Judith|date=21 November 1988|page=6|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=smhh000020011117dkbl0214s&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, Peter Walker wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the film "illustrates with grim eloquence, in retrospect, the prosecution notion that [Harris] was a man of two distinct sides: the avuncular and trustworthy public figure, and lurking behind, the groper and abuser".&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Walker notes that the scene in which a man assaults his child's friend mirrors what Harris did to his daughter's best friend, and that the closing sequence has "an accidental resonance that would only emerge more than 25 years later" because of the two police officers behind Harris.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; NSPCC chief executive officer [[Peter Wanless]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Rolf Harris Guilty: Abuse Victim Wrote to the Queen to Warn Her as the Presenter Painted Monarch's Portrait|first=Jenn|last=Selby|date=1 July 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rolf-harris-guilty-victim-wrote-to-the-queen-to-warn-her-as-the-presenter-painted-her-portrait-9575140.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the same time that he was abusing girls was "one of the most sickening examples [of] hiding in plain sight".&lt;ref name=Bracchi/&gt; In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to [[Child grooming|groom children]] because it encouraged trust by parents.&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt;

The Kutumb Foundation is a New Delhi based NGO. It was founded in 2002. The NGO works in Khan Market, Ali Vihar, Nizamuddin Sunder Nursery Slum and Savda-Ghevra Jhuggi Jhopri Resettlement Colony.  Kutumb works in the field of education through its Indradhanush programme, an initiative to use peer teachers and in-house curriculum to teach English, Hindi and Maths.  They also have two Qissagadh Active Libraries and run a Library Outreach programme.  Another initiative of the organisation is their Dhamaa Chaukdi workshop series; these workshops use drama in education strategies to share Kutumb’s best practices with teachers from government schools and other non-profits.  The organisation also runs a football and life skills programme called Goal of Life.  Overall Kutumb works with over 350 disadvantaged youth per year.  Since 2006, Kutumb has also held an annual theatre event, Hilley-ley.

{{Academic ranks worldwide}}
This '''list of academic ranks''' identifies the hierarchical ranking structure found amongst [[scholars]] in [[academia]]. The lists below refer specifically to [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] throughout the world, although other institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] may follow a similar schema.

==Afghanistan==
According to Article 34 of Afghanistan's Civil Higher Education Law,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/102061/123254/F822509299/AFG102061%20Farsi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; academic ranks for the lecturers of higher learning institutions are as follows:

A: Assistants

1. Junior teaching Assistant پوهيالی

2. Teaching Assistant - پوهنیار

3. Senior Teaching Assistant - پوهنمل

B: Lecturers

1. Assistant Professor - پوهندوی

2. Associate Professor - پوهنوال

3. Professor - پوهاند

==Algeria==

In Algeria, university teachers are initially recruited – on the basis of a competition – at the rank of ''Maître Assistant'' (Assistant Professor), only if they are holding a Doctoral degree from either local public universities or UNESCO officially accredited and internationally recognized foreign institutions of higher education. Not all foreign PhD's or academic titles are accepted or automatically given local equivalencies. Degree granting Universities and their doctoral programs (i.e.;courses &amp; dissertation) are first evaluated by the National Ministry of higher education equivalency committee before an official equivalency decision to the Algerian Doctorate is granted. After a minimum of three years and – on the basis of a competition based on teaching and scholarly work – assistant professors are allowed to apply to compete for promotion to the rank of ''Maître de Conférences'' (Associate Professor). After a minimum of five years, they can similarly – on the basis of a competition based on teaching and scholarly work – apply for promotion to the rank of ''Professeur de l'Enseignement Superieur'' (Full Professor). All applications for the competition to promotion competitions are first evaluated and ranked by the university scientific committees at faculty and university levels, then by the Ministry of higher education promotion committee before an official promotion decision is to be granted. The whole process (French system legacy) is quite long and extremely competitive, and does not allow for automatic rank equivalency for professors transferring from overseas universities, the lengthy process repeat from assistant professor upwards to professor is inevitable, exceptions made to officially invited visiting professors who are well-known experts in their fields of expertise.

==Finland==
{{main|Academic ranks in Finland}}
In Finland, there's no "graduate" or "undergraduate" system; university students may be employed as a research assistant (''tutkimusapulainen'') before they graduate with a master's degree. A doctoral student must already hold a master's degree, and are typically employed by the university, or enjoy a similar grant, and will be called ''tohtorikoulutettava'' (doctoral candidate), ''tutkija'' (researcher) or ''assistentti'' (teaching assistant). Besides post-doctoral researchers (''tutkijatohtori'') and senior teaching assistants (''yliassistentti''), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions such as teaching researcher (''opettava tutkija''). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as e.g. ''erikoistutkija'' ("special researcher") or ''yliopistotutkija'' (university researcher). Docent (''dosentti'') is a non-professiorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (''professori'') are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there's no direct equivalent of an assistant / associate / full professor career path, although [[Aalto University]] is introducing these. Qualifications for a professor's position are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (''laitosjohtaja'' or ''osastonjohtaja'') and deans (head of faculty, ''dekaani''). The leader of a university is called a rector (''rehtori''), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (''vararehtori''). Vice-rectors may retain their professor's positions or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (''kansleri''), which works more with outreach and public relations than daily management.

==Hong Kong==

In the past, [[Hong Kong]] followed the British system (4 levels). In recent years it is moving towards the North American counterpart, with the titles renamed to their corresponding equivalence (professor, associate professor, and assistant professor). Institutions established in the 1980s and 1990s almost entirely follows the North American system, while older ones, notably the [[University of Hong Kong]] is in the process of transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~cstafrep/wnews/wisenews7.html hkbu.edu.hk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821141037/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~cstafrep/wnews/wisenews7.html |date=2006-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on institutions, the title of "professor" is assumed by chair professors and professors, or assistant professors and above.

==Iceland==
In Icelandic universities, especially [[The University of Iceland]], ''prófessor'' is the most senior ranking teaching position. Below ''prófessor'' is ''dósent'', then ''lektor''. This three step hierarchy is akin to the US-scale, of full-, associate- and assistant-professors. Until the early 1990s no upward mobility was available in the Icelandic system. Most university teachers were hired as "prófessor." A "dósent" or a "lektor" wishing to ascend to a higher rank had to apply for a new position when it became available. Currently (since the 1990s) much more university teachers are hired as junior rank "lektor" and are promoted to "dósent" and "prófessor" if their work proves worthy of it.

* ''Prófessor''

* ''Lektor'' (assistant-professors)

==India==
{{main|Academic ranks in India}}

'''Regular Academic ranks''' (Hierarchy from top): Academic institutions in India have the mandate of teaching, training and research. This also includes research universities.
# Professor
# Associate Professor
# Assistant Professor
# In addition to these, there are government sponsored fellowships such as '''Ramanujan &amp; Ramalingaswami'''. The fellowship is awarded to able candidates for a 5-year contract period during which they are hosted by an academic or research organisation. Their primary function is to carry out high quality original research. They may become a regular faculty as an assistant professor or associate professor during this period subject to their performance.
# Assistant Professor (on contract) / Adhoc faculty – They are primarily involved in teaching for a limited contract period typically 6 months – 1 year. 
'''Research ranks''' (Hierarchy from top): Research institutions such as national labs have a different kind of hierarchy and are primarily concerned with basic and applied research. They guide Ph.D. students in their research thesis but do not grant degrees. In most cases the Ph.D. candidates are registered with another University which grants the degree. Awarding of degree is subjected to meeting the same criteria as Ph.D. guided by university professors.

==Japan==
Tenured or non-tenured faculty&lt;ref group="note" name="Japan"&gt;Japan has been taking steps to make its academic rankings similar to that of the United States. But whereas only PhDs can acquire the rank of "assistant professor" in the US, in the past many Japanese "assistant professors" and "associate professors" have only masters degrees and do not advance beyond that.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:教員の職階]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}
* Professor emeritus, {{nihongo|''Meiyo Kyōju''|名誉教授}}
* Professor, {{nihongo|''Kyōju''|教授}}
* Associate professor, {{nihongo|''Junkyōju''|准教授}} (previously, {{nihongo|''Jokyōju''|助教授}})
* Lecturer / Junior associate professor / Instructor / Assistant professor, {{nihongo|''Kōshi''|講師}}
* Assistant professor / Research Associate, {{nihongo|''Jokyō''|助教}} (previously, {{nihongo|''Joshu''|助手}})

The Japanese system includes non-tenure, term-limited, {{nihongo|''tokunin''|特任}} positions at all ranks, including professor. These are referred to as {{nihongo|''ninki tsuki''|任期付き}} positions and officially include ''tokunin'' in the title. Limited tenure track positions (similar to the United States) have recently been introduced ({{cite web|url=http://www.jst.go.jp/tenure/|website=国立研究開発法人 科学技術振興機構|accessdate=15 June 2015|title=tenure}}). In this system {{nihongo|''Jokyō''|助教}} corresponds to assistant professor. A major difference between the United States system and Japan is that granting of tenure and promotion to associate professor are not linked; one may be tenured yet remain an assistant professor. Advancing upward typically requires a higher-level post to be vacated, even in the new tenure-track system{{Citation needed|reason=Not true at my school|date=January 2017}}.

==Mexico==
The ranking system in most Mexican public universities is as follows
* Profesor Asociado A (early assistant professor or senior postdoc)
* Profesor Asociado B (early assistant professor or senior postdoc)
* Profesor Asociado C (early assistant professor or senior postdoc)
* Profesor Titular A (equivalent to assistant professor or lecturer)
* Profesor Titular B (equivalent to associate professor or reader)
* Profesor Titular C (equivalent to full professor or professor)
* Profesor Emerito (equivalent to distinguished professor, not to be confused with emeritus professor)
Usually Mexican academics are also fellows of the [[Sistema Nacional de Investigadores]] (SNI) that has four levels (candidate, I, II and III) that more or less correlate (but are not equivalent) to the Asociado and Titular A, B, and C professorships. The rank as professor is determined by the individual's institution while the SNI level is determined by an independent committee that evaluates the researchers nationwide.

Many universities and research institutions make a distinction between "Profesores" -Professors- and "Investigadores" -Researchers- (Asociado A, B, C, Titular A, B, C), the main difference is that "Profesores" have a higher load of teaching, while "Investigadores" have a higher load of research, but normally all of them take part in both activities and are considered equivalent.

Research rankings are awarded by the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores which depends on the national research council (Conacyt):
* SNI emeritus researcher (not necessarily higher rank but lifetime, requires 15 continuous years as SNI III)
* SNI III researcher (about 7% of the researcers in SNI)
* SNI II researcher (about 16% of the researchers in SNI)
* SNI I researcher (about 59% of researchers in SNI)
* SNI candidate researcher (C) (about 18% of researchers in SNI)

All titles, both professors and researchers, can be given in a:
* Full-time, or
* Part-time basis

Administrative academic positions:
* Rector
* Director of Faculty or College
* Coordinator

==Pakistan==
The hiring of academic positions in public universities throughout Pakistan is managed by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, the requirement for all positions vary with respect to the field of studies e.g. Engineering, IT, Medical, Law, and Arts and Design.

There are four faculty ranks lecturer, assistant professor, associate professor, and professor.

In engineering public universities, a lecturer requires a M.Sc. or B.Sc. degree and high academic standing in the field (e.g. gold medallist, among top 15 students of graduating class).
An assistant professor position requires a Ph.D. in relevant field and at least two years of teaching/research/professional experience.
An associate professorship can be conducted in the fourth year of employment, although, it is becoming more common for promotion and tenure to be awarded in the sixth year of employment. The review requires a certain number 5/8/10 research publications (with at least 1/2/4{{technical statement|date=August 2013}} publications in the last 5 years) by the calendar years 2007/2008/2012 respectively, in HEC/PEC recognized journals.

A professor requires ten years post-PhD teaching/research experience in an HEC recognized university or a post-graduate institution or professional experience in the relevant field in a national or international organization. It requires a minimum of 8/12/15 research publications (with at least 2/3/5 publications in the last 5 years) by the calendar years 2007/2008/2012 respectively,  in HEC/PEC recognized journals

==Peru==

The Peruvian public universities consider these ranks:

* Emeritus professor (Profesor Emérito)

After some recent reforms in the University Law &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lamolina.edu.pe/rectorado/secgeneral/pdf/ley_23733.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, the following full time positions require the following degrees: 

* Full professor (Profesor Principal) - MSc required
* Associate professor (Profesor Asociado) - MSc required
* Assistant professor (Profesor Auxiliar) - MSc required
* Full-time Instructor (Jefe de Práctica) - BSc required.

For these positions any other paid work is not allowed. However, due to the low income (which in 2014 was $400 per month for the initial position), some professors need to seek for part-time jobs at private universities. As a consequence, it is difficult for a professor to do research in a public university.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">The Rev. Dr. Marc R. Nikkel (1950–2000) was an American Episcopal priest, artist, author, teacher, missionary to the Sudan, and advocate for the Dinka ("Jieng") people of South Sudan.

Marc Nikkel was born to Mennonite parents in Reedley, California, and studied at the California State University School for the Visual Arts and at Fuller Theological Seminary before becoming an Anglican.

In 1981, Nikkel began teaching at Bishop Gwynne College in [[Mundri]], Sudan.  From 1984–1985, he studied at the [[General Theological Seminary]] of the Episcopal Church in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea, New York]], being ordained to the diaconate by the Bishop of Southwestern Virginia and to the priesthood on his return to the Sudan.

Nikkel was kidnapped by the Sudanese Liberation Army in July 1987 along with several other Americans. He was later released in northern [[Kenya]]. From 1987-1988, he taught at [[Saint Paul's United Theological College]] in [[Limuru]], [[Kenya]]. He then left Africa to begin doctoral studies at the [[Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World]] in Edinburgh, Scotland. 

After completing his doctoral work, Nikkel served as an advisor to several Sudanese Anglican dioceses, working in partnership with the Church Missionary Society of England and the Episcopal Church in the U.S.A. His primary work was in theological education among the Dinka people of the Nile basin in South Sudan.

In Kenya, Marc Nikkel also co-founded Kakuma Refugee Camp with Bishop Nathanael Garang of Bor Diocese, South Sudan.  There at Kakuma, Marc Nikkel named the young Dinka survivors "the Lost Boys."

Marc Nikkel was diagnosed with cancer in 1998, and died in California in 2000.

The '''National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine''' (also known as '''NASEM''' or '''the National Academies''') is the collective scientific [[national academy]] of the [[United States]]. The name is used interchangeably in two senses: (1) as an umbrella term for its three quasi-independent honorific member organizations (the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), the [[National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE), and the [[National Academy of Medicine]] (NAM)).  And (2) as the brand for studies and reports issued by the operating arm of the three academies, the National Research Council (NRC).  The NRC was first formed in 1916 as an activity of the NAS.  Now jointly governed by all three academies, it produces some 200 publications annually which are published by the [[National Academies Press]].

== History ==
The US National Academy of Sciences was created by an Act of Incorporation dated March 3, 1863, which was signed by then [[President of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]&lt;ref name="NAS1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rexmond|first=Cochrane|title=The National Academy of Sciences: The First Hundred Years, 1863-1963|date=1978|publisher=NAP|isbn=0-309-02518-4|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act stated that " ... the Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art .... "&lt;ref name="NAS1978"/&gt; With the American civil war raging, the new Academy was presented with few problems to solve, but it did address matters of "... coinage, weights and measures, iron ship hulls, and the purity of whiskey..."&lt;ref name="NAS1978"/&gt;
All subsequently affiliated organizations have been created under this same overall [[congressional charter]], including the two younger academies, [[National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE) (created in 1964) and NAM (created as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 and rechartered as NAM in 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Global/News%20Announcements/IOM-to-become-NAM-Press-Release|website=The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|title=Institute of Medicine to Become National Academy of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Under this same charter, the National Research Council was created in 1916. On June 19 of that year, then US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] requested that the National Academy of Sciences organize a "National Research Council". The purpose of the Council (at first called the National Research Foundation) was in part to foster and encourage "the increased use of scientific research in the development of American industries ... the employment of scientific methods in strengthening the national defense ... and such other applications of science as will promote the national security and welfare."&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{cite book|last=Rexmond|first=Cochrane|title=The National Academy of Sciences: The First Hundred Years, 1863-1963|date=1978|publisher=NAP|isbn=0-309-02518-4|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the Academy's effort to support national defense readiness, the Committee on Nitric Acid Supply, was approved by Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]]. [[Nitric acid]] was the substance basic in the making of propellants such as [[cordite]], high explosives, dyes, [[fertilizer]]s, and other products but availability was limited due to [[World War I]]. The NRC, through its committee, recommended importing Chilean [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] and the construction of four new ordinance plants. These recommendations were accepted by the [[War Department (US)#World War I|War Department]] in June 1917, although the plants were not completed prior to the end of the war.&lt;ref name=NAP/&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
In 1918, Wilson formalized the NRC's existence under [[List of United States federal executive orders|Executive Order]] 2859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/02859.html Executive Order 2859]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chronicle of Public Laws Calling for Action by the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, &amp;#91;and&amp;#93; National Research Council|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=22 March 2014|year=1985|publisher=National Academies|location=Washington, DC|page=xiii|id=NAP:11820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/history/highlights/william-henry-welch.html William Henry Welch] NAS.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's order declared the function of the NRC to be in general:
:''"(T)o stimulate research in the mathematical. physical, and biological sciences. and in the application of these sciences to engineering, agriculture. medicine. and other useful arts. with the object of increasing knowledge, of strengthening the national defense, and of contributing in other ways to the public welfare."''&lt;ref name="NAS1978"/&gt;
During World War I, the United States was at war, the NRC operated as the Department of Science and Research of the [[Council of National Defense]] as well as the Science and Research Division of the [[United States Army Signal Corps]].&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1919"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.)|title=Organization and Members|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aha5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PP3|year=1919|publisher=The National Research Council.|page=3}} Accessed at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; When war was first declared, the Council had organized committees on [[Antisubmarine warfare#World War I|antisubmarine]] and [[Gas warfare#World War I|gas warfare]].&lt;ref name="NAS1978"/&gt;

On June 1, 1917, the council convened a meeting of scientific representatives of the United Kingdom and France with interested parties from the U.S. on the subject of submarine detection.&lt;ref name="ReidyKroll2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael S. Reidy|author2=Gary R. Kroll|author3=Erik M. Conway|title=Exploration and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNSQDU5yqkAC&amp;pg=PA176|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-985-0|pages=176–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Howeth |first=Linwood S. |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcommuni00howe |title= History of communications-electronics in the United States Navy|year=1963}}Page 528&lt;/ref&gt; Another meeting with the British and French was held in Paris in October 1918, at which more details of their work was disclosed. As a result of these meetings, the NRC recommended that scientists be brought together to work on the problems associated with submarine detection. Due to the success of council-directed research in producing a [[Sonar|sound-based method]] of detecting [[submarine]]s, as well as other military innovations, the NRC was retained at the end of the war, though it was gradually decoupled from the military.

NRC's Articles of Organization have been changed only three times: in 1956, January 1993, and July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/na_070358.html Articles of Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519172226/http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/na_070358.html |date=2016-05-19 }}, June 1, 2015, MRC website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honorific societies ==
{{main|National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Engineering|National Academy of Medicine}}

The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Medicine are honorary membership organizations, each of which has its own governing Council, and each of which elects its own new members.  The membership
of the three academies totals more than 6,300 scientists, engineers, and health professionals. New members for each organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.  By the terms of
the original 1863 Congressional charter, the three academies serve ''[[pro bono]]'' as "advisers to the nation on [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[medicine]]."

==Operation of the National Research Council==
The National Research Council is the operating arm of the three academies for the purpose of providing objective policy advice.  Although separately chartered (see above), it falls legally under the overall charter of the National Academy of Sciences, whose ultimate fiduciary body is the NAS Council.  In actual practice, the NAS Council delegates governing authority to a Governing Board of the National Research Council that is chaired jointly by the presidents of the three academies, with additional members chosen by them or specified in the charters of the academies.

Under this three-academy umbrella, the National Research Council produces reports that shape policies, inform public opinion, and advance the pursuit of science, engineering, and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/na_070358.html |title=Articles of Organization {{!}} National-Academies.org {{!}} National Research Council {{!}} Where the Nation Turns for Independent, Expert Advice |date=2016-05-19 |access-date=2016-09-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519172226/http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/na_070358.html |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The study process==
The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our Study Process|url = http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Study-Process.aspx|publisher = National Academy of Medicine|accessdate = 2015-11-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091016094950/http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Study-Process.aspx|archivedate = 2009-10-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts (not limited to those in academies membership) are enlisted to address the scientific and technical aspects of some of society's problems. These experts are volunteers who serve on study committees that are convened to answer specific sets of questions. All committee members serve without pay. NASEM itself does not perform original research; rather it provides independent advice. Federal agencies are the primary financial sponsors of the Academies' work; additional studies are funded by state agencies, foundations, other private sponsors, and the National Academies endowment. The external sponsors have no control over the conduct or results of a study, once the statement of task and budget are finalized. Study committees gather information from many sources in public meetings but deliberate in private in order to avoid political, special interest, and sponsor influence.

All NRC reports go through an extensive external review facilitated by the NRC internal Report Review Committee (also consisting of members from the NAS, NAE, and NAM).&lt;ref name="nationalacademies1"&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/about/whoweare/index.html Who We Are | National-Academies.org | Where the Nation Turns for Independent, Expert Advice]. National-Academies.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this study process, the National Academies produce around 200 reports each year. Recent reports cover such topics as addressing the obesity epidemic, the use of forensics in the courtroom, invasive plants, pollinator collapse, underage drinking, the Hubble Telescope, vaccine safety, the [[hydrogen economy]], transportation safety, [[climate change]], and [[homeland security]]. Many reports influence policy decisions; some are instrumental in enabling new research programs; others provide independent program reviews. The [[National Academies Press]] is the publisher for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and makes its publications available for free online reading, and the full book PDFs have been available for free download since 2011.

==Operating divisions==
The National Research Council performs its studies and workshops through seven major divisions; Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Division of Earth and Life Studies, [[Engineering and Physical Sciences|Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences]], Health and Medicine Division, Policy and Global Affairs Division, [[Transportation Research Board]], and the Gulf Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Research Council|url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.html|publisher=National Research Council|accessdate=22 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328152332/http://www.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.html|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==
The Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellowship is an annual program for current or recent graduate students to spend three months working in the National Academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christine Mirzayan Science &amp; Technology Policy Graduate Fellowship Program|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/policyfellows/|publisher=U.S. National Academies|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academies also administer the [[Marian Koshland Science Museum]].

In 2001, the NRC published the report ''Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions,'' which emphasized the fact that national policy decisions made now and in the long-term future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this century. The report endorsed findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) as representing the views of the scientific community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. [[Anthropogenic global warming|Human-induced warming]] and associated [[sea level rise]] are expected to continue through the 21st century... The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10139/climate-change-science-an-analysis-of-some-key-questions|title=Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions. National Academies Press.|doi=10.17226/10139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, the NRC published the report ''Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises,'' which provided an updated look at the issue of abrupt climate change and its potential impacts. This study differed from previous treatments of abrupt changes by focusing on abrupt climate changes and also abrupt climate impacts that have the potential to severely affect the physical climate system, natural systems, or human systems, often affecting multiple interconnected areas of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18373/abrupt-impacts-of-climate-change-anticipating-surprises|title=Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises|last=Council|first=National Research|doi=10.17226/18373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report on sexual assault===
In 2013, the NRC published the report ''Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18605/estimating-the-incidence-of-rape-and-sexual-assault|title=Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault|last=Council|first=National Research|doi=10.17226/18605}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pointed out that approximately 80 percent of [[sexual assault]]s go unreported to law enforcement. The report recommends that the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] adopt new approaches to interviews of rape victims, including changing the wording of questions.

In an article about the report, Amber Stevenson, clinical supervisor and therapist at the Nashville Sexual Assault Center, said that [[Victim blaming|victim-blaming]] was the main issue preventing victims from coming forward: &lt;blockquote&gt;As long as we as a community continue to make victim-blaming statements, such as, "She put herself in this situation," … "She didn't fight back, she must have wanted it," we will continue to see rapes go unreported ... We have to stop blaming the victim. The conversation needs to shift to the person who chose to rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/19/study-sexual-assaults-greatly-underreported-/3648197/|title=Study: Sexual assaults greatly underreported|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Report on integrity in research===
The 1992 report, ''Responsible Science: Ensuring the Integrity of the Research Process'' was updated in 2017 by the report, ''Fostering Integrity in Research:'' 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...as experience has accumulated with various forms of research misconduct, detrimental research practices, and other forms of misconduct, as subsequent empirical research has revealed more about the nature of scientific misconduct, and because technological and social changes have altered the environment in which science is conducted, it is clear that the framework established more than two decades ago needs to be updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fostering Integrity in Research |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21896/fostering-integrity-in-research |website=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine |publisher=The National Academies Press |accessdate=15 September 2018 |doi=10.17226/21896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the report's main concerns is that a growing percentage of recently published research turns out to be not reproducible due in part to inadequate support of standards of transparency in many fields as well as to various other detrimental research practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Academies Report Urges Bolstered Efforts to Protect Integrity of Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amish schoolhouse.jpg|thumb|235x235px|[[Amish]] schoolhouse in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], in 1941.]]

'''One-room schools''' were commonplace throughout [[rural]] portions of various [[countries]], including [[Prussia]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Spain]]. In most rural (country) and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single [[teacher]] taught academic basics to several grade levels of [[primary education|elementary-age]] boys and girls. While in many areas one-room schools are no longer used, it is not uncommon for them to remain in [[developing nation]]s and rural or remote areas. Examples include remote parts of the [[Western United States|American West]], the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]], and the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]].

==Prussia==

[[File:Schulmuseum Reckahn 085.jpg|thumb|The one-room school in Reckahn, [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], was founded 1773 and quotes Mark 10:14 at the entrance. It is now used as a local history museum.]]
Prussia (compare [[Prussian education system]]) was among the first countries in the world to introduce a tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education for either boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;James van Horn Melton, ''Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, compulsory schooling in France or Great Britain was not successfully enacted until the 1880s.&lt;ref name =says&gt;Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal and David Strang, Sociology of Education, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 277-288 Published by: American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt; The state sponsored system was introduced in the late 18th century and has had widespread influences since. The first Prussian schools were simple one-room schools, however already as of 1773 Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow set up a model school with primary education in two age related [[Form (education)|classes]].

==Ireland==

In [[Ireland]], free primary education was mandated in 1931, prompting the establishment of many single-teacher [[National school (Ireland)|National School]]s across rural areas, most initially using a room in an existing building.  By the 1890s there was a school in every [[parish]].  Most extant one- and two-room school buildings date from the decades after 1891 when primary education became compulsory.  Most of those still in use today have been extended following merger with neighbouring schools.  Since 2002, any state-funded school with at least 10 pupils is entitled to at least 2 teachers; the 21 schools which fell below this threshold are located on [[List of islands of Ireland|offshore islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?pcategory=17241&amp;ecategory=17241&amp;language=EN |title=Key Statistics about the Department's Customers |work=Department of Education and Skills |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, an increasing number of schools have been founded for parents not content with the National School system.  These include ''[[Gaelscoil]]eanna'' (which teach through [[Irish language|Irish]] rather than [[English language|English]]) and multi-denominational schools (most Irish schools are controlled by one or other of the [[Culture of Ireland#Religion|main Christian churches]]). Although such schools eventually become eligible for state funding, they usually begin with a single teacher in a room or [[prefabricated building|prefabricated]] building.

==United States==

[[File:Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse.jpg|thumb|Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse. Owned by [[Columbia County Historical Society]], New York is open to the public and operates as a museum.]]

Many schools also served as the local chapel on Sundays, and evening/Saturday meeting places for local people and activities. Being mostly rural, many schools had no water or sanitation and this was often provided by converting wells into toilets{{fact|date=June 2015}}, melting snow for water in the winter and relying on the help of nearby farms in the summer. 

Teaching standards often varied from school to school as the teacher was compelled to coach children of all ages/grades within one room and regardless of their area of main competence.

The quality of facilities at one-room schools varied with local economic conditions, but generally, the number of children at each grade level would vary with local populations. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, some with the school bell on a [[cupola]]. In the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[sod]] construction was also used, as well as stone and [[adobe]] in areas like the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] where trees were scarce. In some locations, the schoolhouse was painted red, but most seem to have been white. 
[[File:One-room School Waverly Historic District Waverly PA Oct 09.jpg|thumb|A historic one-room school in [[Waverly, Pennsylvania]].]]
Mission Ridge School was one of the early schools in [[Mason County, West Virginia]]. It has since been moved to the West Virginia State Farm Museum complex near [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]]. Examination of the materials in this building indicates that boards and timbers were hand-sawed and also hand-planed. Square nails were used throughout the building. Except for the roof and a few boards in the floor, all of the material in this building is original. The [[Chalkboard|blackboard]] is painted black. It was not until much later that slate was used for chalkboards, although students often had individual slates for writing practice.

Teachers in one-room schools were often former students themselves. Their role is well-described by a student from [[Kentucky]] in the 1940s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The teachers that taught in the one room, rural schools were very special people. During the winter months they would get to the school early to get a fire started in the [[potbelly stove]], so the building would be warm for the students. On many occasions they would prepare a hot, noon meal on top of the stove, usually consisting of soup or stew of some kind. They took care of their students like a new mother hen would care for her newly hatched chicks; always looking out for their health and welfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A typical school day was 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with morning and afternoon [[recess (break)|recesses]] of 15 minutes each and an hour period for lunch. "The older students were given the responsibility of bringing in water, carrying in coal or wood for the stove. The younger students would be given responsibilities according to their size and gender such as cleaning the black board (chalkboard), taking the erasers outside for dusting plus other duties that they were capable of doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snowkentucky.com/one_room_school.htm |work=snowkentucky.com |title=One Room School |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003174603/http://www.snowkentucky.com/one_room_school.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation for children who lived too far to walk was often provided by [[horse]]-drawn [[kid hack]] or [[sulky]], which could only travel a limited distance in a reasonable amount of time each morning and evening, or students might ride a [[horse]], these being put out to pasture in an adjoining paddock during the day. In more recent times, students rode [[bicycle]]s.

The school house was the center and focus for thousands of rural communities, hamlets, and small towns. Often, town meetings and picnics were also held there. 

The vast majority of one-room schools in the United States are no longer used as schools and have either been torn down or converted for other purposes.  However, in some rural communities, including among the [[Amish]], one-room or two-room schools are still used, primarily for [[elementary education]], with students graduating to local or regional middle and high schools.

There are several historic one-room schoolhouses in the United States that were built in the shape of an [[octagon]], instead of the more traditional rectangular style. Most are located in the northeastern part of the country and some have been restored and placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="Cissell, pg. 293"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cissell|first=Mary Helen|authorlink=|title=More than eight sides to the story: oral histories from students and teachers of Illinois' octagonal Charter Oak School, 1873-1953|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=0557437660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following octagonal schoolhouses still stand:&lt;!--Listed in alphabetical order by state--&gt;

===Teacher's residence===
[[File:Tubac, Arizona schoolhouse 2.JPG|thumb|The one-room adobe schoolhouse in [[Tubac, Arizona]], with a teacherage attached to the back.]]
The teacher's residence, or teacherage, was often attached to the school, or very close by, so that a male teacher's wife and family were an integral part of the management and support system for the school. Single, female teachers were more often billeted or boarded with a local family to provide for social norms requiring social supervision of single females.

===Consolidation===
Motorized [[school bus]]es in the 1920s made longer distances possible, and one-room schools were soon consolidated in most portions of the United States into multiple classroom schools where classes could be held separately for various grade levels. Gradually, one-room school houses were replaced. Most one-room schools had been replaced by larger schools by [[World War II]] except in the most rural areas. However, they are still common in rural parts of Australia and Alaska.

===Preservation: buildings and cultural===
[[File:Agenda school 1.JPG|thumb|Some of the historical one-room schools that survive today remain unrestored, and in disrepair. The one pictured is located on private land in [[Price County, Wisconsin]], and remains unrestored, despite community interest in preserving it.]]

In [[Calvert County, Maryland]], Port Republic School Number 7 closed its doors in 1932 and sat unused for over 40 years. Then, in 1976 the Calvert Retired Teachers Association, looking for a Bicentennial Year project, decided to restore the one-room schoolhouse. On July 24, 1977, after months of hard work by teachers and community volunteers, the old school bell rang out once more, and the little one-room school house, filled with its memories and memorabilia, was ready for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calvert-county.com/school.htm |title=One-Room Schoolhouse |work=Calvert County Living |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now one of the county's tourist attractions. A similar project was done in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]], by retired Teachers and Community Volunteers.  The restored schoolhouse is located in front of [[Queen Anne's County High School]]. In [[Iowa]], over 125 small one-room school houses have been turned into local museums. The buildings in some places found new purpose as homes.   

In [[Harrisburg, Nebraska]], Flowerfield School serves as a living museum, and fourth-graders within the Nebraska panhandle spend a day at Flowerfield going through an average school day in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schools.esu13.org/flowerfield/Default.htm |title=Flowerfield School |publisher=Flowerfield School |year=2005 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students have the opportunity to experience both log and sod versions of the house, writing with quill pens, and a trip to the nearby museum, where they learn about other aspects of life in 1888.

In [[Vandalia, Indiana]], the Vandalia District # 2 one-room schoolhouse served Owen County’s Lafayette Township students in grades 1 – 8 from the time it was completed in 1868 until it closed in 1951. The building, restored by a group of volunteers in 1976, is presently maintained and preserved by the Vandalia Community Preservation Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vandaliacpa.org/index.shtml | title=Vandalia Community Preservation Association | publisher=Organization Founded 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The One Room School House Project of [[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]], includes listings and information on some 880 schools throughout the state and nation. The information, pictures, and stories included in this site have been collected and sent to the project by researchers and historians from across America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''IMUSE''' is a [[non-profit organization]] run by students at [[Harvard]], [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], and [[Peking University]] that aims to foster mutual curiosity, respect, and understanding between people in [[China]] and [[North America]] by providing them with opportunities for personal reflection and social interaction about issues pertaining to both regions today.

IMUSE has three primary goals:
* Socially intimate and intellectually meaningful face-to-face interactions among a small group of promising North American and Chinese college and university students to increase mutual curiosity, trust, and understanding among them;
* Development and maintenance of an alumni network to effect high-impact, positive social change through the continued collaboration of former participants of IMUSE events;
* Maintenance of a strong partnership among its satellites at Harvard, Tsinghua, and Peking Universities to maximize fruitful international exchange among members of our staff.

==Past Programs==
Project IMUSE was first conceived by three Harvard undergraduates William Cong, Alvin Huang, and MJ Tang, against the backdrop of global anticipation of the Beijing Olympics. Since its inception in 2007, IMUSE has hosted several programs to this aim.

In 2008, IMUSE held three primary events. The first was the North American campus tour program, in which fourteen outstanding and competitively selected delegates from Tsinghua and Peking Universities traveled to Harvard, [[MIT]], [[Tufts]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Princeton University]], [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Yale]], [[McGill University|McGill]], [[Stanford]], and [[Washington University]] to hold public panel discussions with local students on topics in modern China. In concert with these panel discussions, IMUSE also sponsored speaker events with such invited guests as McKinsey Global Institute fellow Dr. Janamitra Devan, [[Dartmouth College]] professor David Kang, international celebrity [[Jet Li]], and more.

IMUSE's second endeavor, the China in my Eyes essay and photography competition, was a creative work competition open to all postsecondary school students in North America. The only prompt, "Through an essay or a photograph, tell us about China in your eyes," was left purposely open-ended in order to encourage deep reflection and creative thought. From several hundred entries, six grand-prize winners and twenty runners-up were chosen to receive a free two-week trip to the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]/a new [[Lenovo]] laptop or a limited-edition Beijing 2008 collectible coin set, respectively.

The conclusion of this competition brought IMUSE to its third program, the Lenovo IMUSE 2008 Beijing Olympics Fellowship Program, in which four of the six grand-prize "China in my Eyes" winners traveled to Beijing for two weeks in the beginning of August to have as personal and intimate of an experience of life in China as possible. In addition to touring historical sites, attending Olympic events, and socializing with host families and assigned Chinese student liaisons, the four fellows also gave a public panel discussion at Peking University analogous to those hosted by IMUSE in North America.

The IMUSE 2009 Beijing Summer Fellowship Program will brought thirty outstanding postsecondary students from Chinese and American colleges and graduate schools together from August 9 to August 21, 2009 to share their opinions, experience Chinese culture, and learn from one another. During the fellowship, Chinese and American delegates participated alongside one another in a variety of activities designed to be both academically and personally enriching. Delegates engaged in panel discussion events with a student audience, where they discussed the pertinent issues facing Chinese-American relations today. They interacted with and learned from distinguished guest speakers, which in past IMUSE events have included distinguished academics and celebrities from both America and China. As IMUSE is strongly committed to improving the quality of life for individuals in both countries, the fellowship included a short period of public service within an underprivileged community. Other activities and workshops covered a variety of topics from politics to pop culture to food. All events are carried out in English, and no knowledge of Chinese is necessary.

In an effort to help students become familiar with Beijing and all that it has to offer, IMUSE facilitated tours to sites of cultural interest as well as major businesses and government offices within the city. In addition, two days of the fellowship were spent visiting a village outside Beijing, granting delegates a rare opportunity to glimpse the rural China so often overlooked by Western visitors. In order to help document their experiences, delegates each kept a blog during the two weeks that was temporarily uploaded onto the IMUSE website.

Students stayed the two weeks in a hotel and had all necessary living expenses paid for, including accommodations, food, ground transportation, and $500 toward transportation to and from Beijing.

In 2009, in addition to being a national nonprofit organization, IMUSE became a registered [[Harvard College]] student organization. Since then, it has held annual student conferences across China and North America. 

According to the mission statement of IMUSE, it is hoped that the dynamic, multidisciplinary, and challenging events that it facilitates will expose both American and Chinese delegates to a better understanding of each other, and foster friendships and relationships that last long after the events themselves have ended.

==Current activities==
The most recent IMUSE project is the IMUSE 2017 Beijing Summer Fellowship Program.

The program will include delegates from North American schools and 15 delegates from Chinese schools. All students in an American postsecondary school (including two- and four-year colleges, graduate schools, and vocational, technical, and trade schools) are eligible to apply. Students need not be American citizens to apply. Applications may be made through the foundation website: https://projectimuse.github.io/

[[File:Schulmuseum Reckahn 085.jpg|thumb|School Museum in Reckahn, [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] quoting Mark 10:14 at the entrance. Founded by [[Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow]] in 1773, Reckahn was the first [[one-room school]] with two age-related [[Form (education)|classes]] in Prussia.]]

The '''Prussian education system''' refers to the system of education established in [[Prussia]] as a result of educational reforms in the late 18th and early 19th century, which has had widespread influence since. The Prussian education system was introduced as a basic concept in the late 18th century and was significantly enhanced after Prussia's defeat in the early stages of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The Prussian educational reforms inspired other countries and remains important as a [[biopower]] in the [[Michel Foucault|Foucaultian]] sense for nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001/acprof-9780198206606 European Universities from the Enlightenment to 1914] R. D. Anderson 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-19-820660-6}} DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term itself is not used in German literature, which refers to the primary aspects of the [[Humboldtian education ideal]] respectively as the [[Prussian reforms]]; however, the basic concept remains fruitful and has led to various debates and controversies. Twenty-first century primary and secondary [[education in Germany]] and beyond still embodies the legacy of the Prussian education system.

== Origin ==
[[File:Reckahn Bruns memorial.jpg|thumb|Bruns-Memorial in Reckahn, "He was a teacher"]]
The basic foundations of a generic Prussian primary education system were laid out by [[Frederick the Great]] with his Generallandschulreglement, a decree of 1763, authored by [[Johann Julius Hecker]]. Hecker had already before (in 1748) founded the first teacher's seminary in Prussia. His concept of providing teachers with the means to cultivate mulberries for homespun silk, which was one of Frederick's favorite projects, found the King's favour.&lt;ref name=VM /&gt; It expanded the existing schooling system significantly and required that all young citizens, both girls and boys, be educated by mainly municipality-funded schools from the age of 5 to 13 or 14. Prussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education.&lt;ref&gt;James van Horn Melton, ''Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, in France and Great Britain, compulsory schooling was not successfully enacted until the 1880s.&lt;ref name=says /&gt;

The Prussian system consisted of an eight-year course of primary education, called ''[[Volksschule]]''. It provided not only basic technical skills needed in a modernizing world (such as reading and writing), but also music (singing) and religious (Christian) education in close cooperation with the churches and tried to impose a strict ethos of duty, sobriety and discipline. Mathematics and [[calculus]] were not compulsory at the start and taking such courses required additional payment by parents. Frederick the Great also formalized further educational stages, the [[Realschule]] and as the highest stage the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (state-funded secondary school), which served as a [[university-preparatory school]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947'' (2008) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of schools received some state support, but they were often built on private initiative.  [[Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow]], a member of the local gentry and former cavalry officer in Reckahn, Brandenburg, installed such a school. Von Rochow cooperated with [[Heinrich Julius Bruns]] (1746–1794), a talented teacher of modest background. The two installed a model school for rural education that attracted more than 1,200 notable visitors between 1777 and 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Tosch (Ed.): "'Er war ein Lehrer.' Heinrich Julius Bruns (1746–1794). Beiträge des Reckahner Kolloquiums anlässlich seines 200. Todestages." In: Hanno Schmitt und Frank Tosch (Ed.): ''Quellen und Studien zur Berlin-Brandenburgischen Bildungsgeschichte'', Vol. 2, Potsdam 1995. ISSN 0946-8897 (Studies about the Prussian educational history, Colloquium in Reckahn on the bicentenary of Bruns 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian system, after its modest beginnings, succeeded in reaching compulsory attendance, specific training for teachers, national testing for all students (of both genders), a prescribed national [[Curriculum#Curriculum in formal schooling|curriculum]] for each [[educational stages|grade]] and mandatory [[kindergarten]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood Cubberley, ''The History of Education: Educational Practice and Progress Considered as a Phase of the Development and Spread of Western Civilization'' (1920) [https://www.questia.com/read/98979708/readings-in-the-history-of-education-a-collection online]&lt;/ref&gt; Training of teachers was increasingly organized via private [[seminary|seminaries]]. Hecker had already in 1748 founded the first "Lehrerseminar", but the density and impact of the seminary system improving significantly until the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Absolutistischer Staat und Schulwirklichkeit in Brandenburg-Preussen Wolfgang Neugebauer Walter de Gruyter, 1 January 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Prussia introduced state certification requirements for teachers, which significantly raised the standard of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Franklin Brown|title=The Training of Teachers for Secondary Schools in Germany and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pu8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21|year=1911|publisher=Macmillan|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final examination, ''[[Abitur]]'', was introduced in 1788, implemented in all Prussian secondary schools by 1812 and extended to all of Germany in 1871. Passing the Abitur was a prerequisite to entering the learned professions and higher echelons of the civil service. The state-controlled Abitur remains in place in modern Germany.

The Prussian system had by the 1830s attained the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;An Economic History of the United States: From 1607 to the Present, Ronald Seavoy, Routledge, 18 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Free primary schooling, at least for poor citizens
* Professional teachers trained in specialized colleges
* A basic salary for teachers and recognition of teaching as a profession
* An extended school year to better involve children of farmers
* Funding to build schools
* Supervision at national and classroom level to ensure quality instruction
* Curriculum inculcating a strong national identity, involvement of science and technology
* Secular instruction (but with religion as a topic included in the curriculum)

== Outreach ==
The overall system was soon widely admired for its efficiency and reduction of illiteracy, and inspired education leaders in other German states and a number of other countries, including [[Education in Japan|Japan]] and [[Education in the United States|the United States]].&lt;ref name="Jeismann, Karl-Ernst 2006 pp. 21"&gt;Jeismann, Karl-Ernst. "American observations concerning the Prussian educational system in the nineteenth century." in Henry Geitz and Jürgen Heideking, eds. ''German influences on education in the United States to 1917'' (2006) pp. 21–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying [[Humboldtian science|Humboldtian educational ideal]] of brothers [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] was about much more than primary education; it strived for academic freedom and the education of both cosmopolitan-minded and loyal citizens from the earliest levels. The Prussian system had strong backing in the traditional German admiration and respect for ''Bildung'' as an individual's drive to cultivate oneself from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan and Germany under the U.S. Occupation: A Comparative Analysis of Post-War Education Reform'', Masako Shibata, Lexington Books, 20 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drivers and hindrances ===
[[File:ID003743 B175 FriedrichsCollegium.jpg|thumb|[[Collegium Fridericianum]] in Königsberg]]
Major drivers for improved education in Prussia since the 18th century had a background in the middle and upper middle strata of society and were pioneered by the ''[[Bildungsbürgertum]]''. The concept as such faced strong resistance both from the top, as major players in the ruling nobility feared increasing literacy among peasants and workers would raise unrest, and from the very poor, who preferred to use their children as early as possible for rural or industrial labor.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;[http://www.europa.clio-online.de/site/lang__de/ItemID__263/mid__12205/40208771/Default.aspx Volkmar Wittmütz Die preussische Elementarschule im 19. Jahrhundert] Clio-online&lt;/ref&gt;

The system's proponents overcame such resistance with the help of foreign pressure and internal failures, after the defeat of Prussia in the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars. After the military blunder of Prussian drill and [[line formation]] against the [[levée en masse]] of the French revolutionary army in the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]] in 1806, reformers and German nationalists urged for major improvements in education. In 1809 [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], having been appointed minister of education, promoted his idea of a generic education based on a neohumanist ideal of broad [[general knowledge]], in full [[academic freedom]] without any determination or restriction by status, profession or wealth. Humboldt's [[:de:Königsberger Schulplan]] was one of the earliest [[white papers]] to lay out a reform of a country's educational system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Spranger]]: ''Wilhelm von Humboldt und die Reform des Bildungswesens'', Reuther u. Reichard, Berlin 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's concept still forms the foundation of the contemporary German education system.&lt;ref&gt;Cubberley, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian system provided compulsory and basic schooling for everyone, but the significantly higher fees for attending ''gymnasium'' or a university imposed a high barrier between upper social strata and middle and lower social strata.&lt;ref&gt;Sagarra, p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interaction with the German national movement ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Grimm]] (left) and [[Jacob Grimm]] (right) in an 1855 painting]]
In 1807 [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] had urged a new form of education in his ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]''. While Prussian (military) drill in the times before had been about obedience to orders without any leeway, Fichte asked for shaping of the personality of students: ""&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychquotes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens should be made able and willing to use their own minds to achieve higher goals in the framework of a future unified German nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Addresses to the German Nation, 1807. Second Address: "The General Nature of the New Education". Chicago and London, The Open Court Publishing Company, 1922, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Sourcelink is broken, quote is dubious and likely out of context --&gt; Fichte and other philosophers, such as the [[Brothers Grimm]], tried to circumvent the nobility's resistance to a common German nation state via proposing the concept of a ''[[:de:Kulturnation|Kulturnation]]'', nationhood without needing a state but based on a common language, musical compositions and songs, shared fairy tales and legends and a common ethos and [[canon (basic principle)|educational canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Wieland: [http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E6AD637B7AC7E4D72A670A97B72565C86~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html ''Katalonien – Kulturnation ohne Staat'']. ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung''. 10. Oktober 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Various German national movement leaders engaged themselves in educational reform. For example, [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (1778–1852), dubbed the ''Turnvater'', was the father of German [[gymnastics]] and a student fraternity leader and nationalist but failed in his nationalist efforts; between 1820 and 1842 Jahn's gymnastics movement was forbidden because of his proto-Nazi politics.&lt;ref&gt;Sport and Physical Education in Germany Ken Hardman, Roland Naul Routledge, 26 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Jahn and others were successful in integrating physical education and sports into Prussian and overall German curricula and popular culture.&lt;ref name=Goodbody&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodbody |first=John |title=The Illustrated History of Gymnastics |publisher=Stanley Paul &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1982 |isbn=0-09-143350-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1870, the Prussian system began to privilege [[High German]] as an official language against various ethnic groups (such as Poles, [[Sorbs]] and Danes) living in Prussia and other German states. Previous attempts to establish "Utraquism" schools ([[bilingual education]]) in the east of Prussia had been identified with high illiteracy rates there.&lt;ref&gt;Sprachliche Minderheiten und nationale Schule in Preußen zwischen 1871 und 1933 (Language minorities in Prussia between 1871 and 1933) [[Ferdinand Knabe]] Waxmann Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interaction with religion ===
[[Pietism]], a reformist group within [[Lutheranism]], forged a political alliance with the King of Prussia based on a mutual interest in breaking the dominance of the Lutheran state church. The Prussian Kings, [[Calvinist]]s among Lutherans, feared the influence of the Lutheran state church and its close connections with the provincial nobility, while Pietists suffered from persecution by the Lutheran orthodoxy. Bolstered by royal patronage, Pietism replaced the Lutheran church as the effective state religion by the 1760s. Pietist theology stressed the need for "inner spirituality" ([[:de:Innerlichkeit]]), to be found through the reading of Scripture. Consequently, Pietists helped form the principles of the modern public school system, including the stress on literacy, while more Calvinism-based educational reformers (English and Swiss) asked for externally oriented, utilitarian approaches and were critical of internally soul searching idealism.&lt;ref name= the /&gt;

Prussia was able to leverage the Protestant Church as a partner and ally in the setup of its educational system. Prussian ministers, particularly [[Karl Abraham Freiherr von Zedlitz]], sought to introduce a more centralized, uniform system administered by the state during the 18th century. The implementation of the Prussian General Land Law of 1794 was a major step toward this goal. However, there remains in Germany to the present a complicated system of burden sharing between municipalities and [[States of Germany|state]] administration for primary and secondary education. The various [[Christian denomination|confessions]] still have a strong say, contribute religious instruction as a regular topic in schools and receive state funding to allow them to provide preschool education and [[kindergarten]]. In comparison, the French and Austrian education systems faced major setbacks due to ongoing conflicts with the [[Catholic Church]] and its educational role.&lt;ref name =says&gt;Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal and David Strang, "Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe" ''Sociology of Education'', Vol. 62, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 277-288 Published by: American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of compulsory schooling in France was delayed till the 1880s.

=== Political and cultural role of teachers ===
Generations of Prussian and also German teachers, who in the 18th century often had no formal education and in the very beginning often were untrained former petty officers, tried to gain more academic recognition, training and better pay and played an important role in various protest and reform movements throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. Namely the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]] and the [[protests of 1968]] saw a strong involvement of (future) teachers.&lt;ref name=VM /&gt; There is a long tradition of parody and ridicule, where teachers were being depicted in a [[janus]]-faced manner as either, authoritarian drill masters or, on the other hand, poor wretches which were suffering the constant spite of pranking pupils, negligent parents and spiteful local authorities.&lt;ref name=fut&gt;Deutschland, deine Lehrer: Warum sich die Zukunft unserer Kinder im Klassenzimmer entscheidet (Germany, your teachers; why the future of our children is being decided in the classroom) Christine Eichel Karl Blessing Verlag, 31 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 book title like "Germany, your teachers; why the future of our children is being decided in the classroom" shows the 18th and 19th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of teachers&lt;ref name=fut /&gt; educating the nation about its most sacred and important issues.&lt;ref name=lohr&gt;[http://www.lohr.de/sites/gensite.asp?SID=cms301020121109123341485&amp;Art=4633 Das Schulmeisterlein – Aus dem Leben des Volksschullehrers im 19. Jahrhundert], Exhibition on 19thcentury teaching in [[Lohr a. Main#Museums|Lohr am Main school museum]], May 20th 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[Biedermeier]], a petty bourgeous image of the age between 1830 and 1848er was coined on [[Samuel Friedrich Sauter]], a school master and poet which had written the famous German song "Das arme Dorfschulmeisterlein" (The poor little schoolmaster).&lt;ref name=fut /&gt; Actually the 18th primary teachers income was a third of a parish priest&lt;ref name=fut /&gt; and teachers were being described as being as uppity as proverbially poor. However German notion of homeschooling was less than favorable, Germans deemed the school system as being necessary. E.g. [[Heinrich Spoerl]]s 1933 "escapist masterpiece"&lt;ref name="Seesslen"&gt;Georg Seeßlen, 1994: [http://www.filmzentrale.com/rezis/feuerzangenbowlegs.htm ''Die Feuerzangenbowle''] In: ''epd Film'' 3/94.&lt;/ref&gt; novel (and movie) [[Die Feuerzangenbowle]] tells the (till the present) popular story of a writer going undercover as a student at a small town school after his friends in Berlin tell him that he missed out on the best part of growing up by being homeschooled.

== Spread to other countries ==
State-oriented mass educational systems were instituted in the 19th century in the rest of Europe. They have become an indispensable component of modern nation-states.{{Citation needed|reason=A bold statement. That implies that modern nations would not be possible with any other kind of education. Proof is needed.|date=August 2016}} Public education was widely institutionalized throughout the world and its development has a close link with nation-building, which often occurred in parallel. Such systems were put in place when the idea of mass education was not yet taken for granted.&lt;ref name=ced&gt;Citizenship, Education and the Modern State, Kerry J. Kennedy, Psychology Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In Austria, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] had already made use of Prussian pedagogical methods in 1774 as a means to strengthen her hold over Austria.&lt;ref name=k&amp;G&gt;Körper und Geist von Format – Über die Heranbildung eines nützlichen und gelehrigen Gesellschaftskörpers: Seit der Implementierung des staatlich organisierten Schulunterrichts 1774 in der monarchia austriaca Verena Lesnik-Schobesberger, Austrian Diploma thesis published BoD 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of compulsory primary schooling in Austria based on the Prussian model had a powerful role, a [[biopower]] in the sense of [[Michel Foucault]] sense in establishing this and others modern nation states shape and formation.&lt;ref name=k&amp;G /&gt;

The Prussian reforms in education spread quickly through Europe, particularly after the [[French Revolution]]. The Napoleonic Wars first allowed the system to be enhanced after the 1806 crushing defeat of Prussia itself and then to spread in parallel with the rise and territorial gains of Prussia after the Vienna Congress. [[Heinrich Spoerl]]'s son [[Alexander Spoerl]] "[[:de:Memoiren eines mittelmäßigen Schülers"]] (''Memories of a Mediocre Student'')  describes and satirises the role of the formational systems in the Prussian [[Rhine Province]] during the early 20th century, in a famous novel of 1950, dedicated to [[Libertas Schulze-Boysen]].

While the [[Russian Empire]] was among the most reactionary regimes with regard to common education, the [[Baltic German|German ruling class]] in [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] managed to  introduce the system there under Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cubberley,  1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal, and David Strang, "Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe," ''Sociology of Education'' (1989) 62#4 pp. 277–288 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2112831 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian principles were adopted by the governments in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] to create the basis of the primary (''grundskola'') and secondary (''gymnasium'') schools across Scandinavia. Unlike in Prussia, the Swedish system aimed to expand even secondary schooling to the peasants and workers. As well in Finland, then a Russian grand duchy with a strong Swedish elite, the system was adopted. Education and the propagation of the [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', was crucial for the Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist]] [[Fennoman]] movement. The Finnish language achieved equal legal status with Swedish in 1892. France and the UK failed until the 1880s to introduce compulsory education, France due to conflicts between a radical secular state and the Catholic Church. In Scotland, local church-controlled schools were replaced by a state system in 1872. In England and Wales, the government started to subsidise schooling in 1833, various measures followed till a local School Boards were set up under the Forster Act of 1870, local School Boards providing free (taxpayer financed) and compulsory schooling were made universal in England and Wales by the Act of 1891, schooling having been made compulsory by the Act of 1880. However, unlike Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, both private schools and education by means other than schooling remained legal in the United Kingdom.

=== United States ===
Early 19th-century American educators were also fascinated by German educational trends. In 1818, [[John Griscom]] gave a favorable report of Prussian education. English translations were made of French philosopher [[Victor Cousin]]'s work, ''Report on the State of Public Education in Prussia''. [[Calvin E. Stowe]], [[Henry Barnard]], [[Horace Mann]], [[George Bancroft]] and [[Joseph Cogswell]] all had a vigorous interest in German education. The Prussian approach was used for example in the [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1835, which fully embraced the Prussian system by introducing a range of primary schools, secondary schools, and the [[University of Michigan]] itself, all administered by the state and supported with tax-based funding. However, the concepts in the Prussian reforms of primordial education, ''Bildung'' and its close interaction of education, society and nation-building are in conflict with some aspects of American state-sceptical libertarian thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm von Humboldt, Franz-Michael Konrad UTB, 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked. Upon his return to the United States, he incorporated his experiences in his advocacy for the [[common school]] movement in [[Massachusetts]]. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states. New York state soon set up the same method in 12 different schools on a trial basis. Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for "[[normal school]]s" to train professional teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Groen, "The Whig Party and the Rise of Common Schools, 1837–1854," ''American Educational History Journal'' Spring/Summer 2008, Vol. 35 Issue 1/2, pp 251–260&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy borrowing and exchange ==
The basic concept of a state-oriented and administered mass educational system is still not granted in the English-speaking world, where either the role of the state as such or the role of state control specifically in education faces still (respectively again) considerable skepticism.&lt;ref name="ced" /&gt; The actual process of "policy borrowing" between different educational systems has been rather complex and differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Researching policy borrowing: Some methodological challenges in comparative education|last1=Phillips|first1=David|last2=Ochs|first2=Kimberly|doi=10.1080/0141192042000279495 | journal=British Educational Research Journal|volume=30|issue=6|pages=773–784|date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann himself had stressed in 1844 that the US should copy the positive aspects of the Prussian system but not adopt Prussia's obedience to the authorities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Democratizing Education and Educating Democratic Citizens: International and Historical Perspectives Leslie J. Limage Routledge, 8 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One of the important differences is that in the German tradition, there is stronger reference to the state as an important principle, as introduced for example by [[Hegelianism|Hegel's philosophy of the state]], which is in opposition to the Anglo-American contract-based idea of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel/ Hegel at Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drill and serfdom ===
Early Prussian reformers took major steps to abandon both serfdom and the [[line formation]] as early as 1807 and introduced [[mission-type tactics]] in the Prussian military in the same year. The latter enlarged freedom in execution of overall military strategies and had a major influence in the German and Prussian industrial culture, which profited from the Prussian reformers' introduction of greater [[economic freedom]]. The mission-type concept, which was kept by later German armed forces, required a high level of understanding, literacy (and intense training and education) at all levels and actively invited involvement and independent decision making by the lower ranks. Its intense interaction with the Prussian education system has led to the proverbial statement, "The battles of [[battle of Königgrätz|Königgrätz]] (1866) and [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan (1870)]] have been decided by the Prussian primary teacher".&lt;ref name= nipp&gt;See Thomas Nipperdey, ''Deutsche Geschichte 1866–1918'', Volume ''Arbeitswelt und Bürgergeist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy of the Prussian system after the end of the monarchy ===
In 1918, the Kingdom of Prussia became a republic. Socialist [[Konrad Haenisch]], the first education minister (''Kultusminister''), denounced what he called the "demons of morbid subservience, mistrust, and lies" in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Donsion, "The Teenagers' Revolution: Schülerräte in the Democratization and Right-Wing Radicalization of Germany, 1918–1923," ''Central European History'' (2011) 44#3 pp 420–446.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haenisch's and other radical left approaches were rather short-lived. They failed to introduce an ''Einheitsschule'', a one-size-fits-all unified secular [[comprehensive school]], throughout Germany.&lt;ref name=pb&gt;Peter Braune: Die gescheiterte Einheitsschule. Heinrich Schulz. Parteisoldat zwischen Rosa Luxemburg und Friedrich Ebert. Karl-Dietz-Verlag, Berlin 2004, {{ISBN|3-320-02056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[:de:Weimarer Schulkompromiss]] (Weimar educational compromise) of 1919 confirmed the tripartite Prussian system, ongoing church influence on education, and religion as a regular topic, and it allowed for peculiarities and individual influence of the German states, widely frustrating the ambitions of radical leftist educational reformers.&lt;ref name=pb /&gt; Still, Prussian educational expert [[:de:Erich Hylla]] (1887–1976) provided various studies (with titles such as "School of Democracy") of the US education system for the Prussian government in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Nazi government's 1933 [[Gleichschaltung]] did away with state's rights, church influence and democracy and tried to impose a unified totalitarian education system and a Nazi version of the ''Einheitsschule'', with strong premilitary and antisemitic aspects.

=== Legacy of the Prussian System after 1945 ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F014934-0005, Alois Hundhammer.jpg|thumb|[[Alois Hundhammer]], a Bavarian defender of the educational legacy of Prussia, photographed in 1963]]
After 1945, the Weimar educational compromise again set the tone for the reconstruction of the state-specific educational system as laid out in the Prussian model. In 1946 the US occupation forces failed completely in their attempt to install comprehensive and secular schooling in the US Occupation Zone. This approach had been endorsed by High Commissioner [[John J. McCloy]] and was led by the high-ranking [[progressive education]] reformer [[Richard Thomas Alexander]],&lt;ref name=tent&gt;James F. Tent, "American Influences on the German Educational System", in ''The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945–1968'', edited by Detlef Junker, vol. 1 (Cambridge: Publications of the German Historical Institute, 2004), pp. 394-400.&lt;/ref&gt; but it faced determined German resistance.&lt;ref name=tent /&gt; The fiercest defender of the originally Prussian tripartite concept and humanist educational tradition was archconservative [[Alois Hundhammer]], a former Bavarian monarchist, devout Catholic enemy of the Nazis and (with regard to the individual statehood of Bavaria) firebrand anti-Prussian coauthor of the 1946 [[Constitution of Bavaria]]. Hundhammer, as soon as he was appointed Bavarian minister of Culture and Education, was quick to use the newly granted freedoms, attacking Alexander in radio speeches and raising rumors about Alexander's secularism, which led to parents' and teachers' associations expressing fears about a reduction in the quality of education.&lt;ref name=HUnd /&gt; Hundhammer involved [[Michael von Faulhaber]], [[Archbishop of Munich]], to contact New York Cardinal [[Francis J. Spellman]], who intervened with the US forces; the reform attempts were abolished as soon as 1948.&lt;ref name=HUnd&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14020639.html Zeitgeschichte Opfer der Umstände], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article from 1983 referring to [[:de:James F. Tent]], ''Mission on the Rhine: reeducation and denazification in American-occupied Germany''. Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current debates referring to the Prussian legacy ===
The Prussian legacy of a mainly tripartite system of education with less comprehensive schooling and selection of children as early as the fourth grade has led to controversies that persist to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoHome/B-politik/05stp/_stp?item_link=stp073.htm |title=CESifo Group Munich – Home |publisher=Cesifo-group.de |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been deemed to reflect 19th-century thinking along class lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/Germany/Forums/Education/German-school-system-reflects-nineteenth-century |title=German school system reflects nineteenth century |publisher=Justlanded.com |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the basic tenets of the specific Prussian system is expressed in the fact that education in Germany is, against the aim of the 19th-century national movement, not directed by the federal government. The individual states maintain ''Kulturhoheit'' (cultural predominance) on educational matters.

The Humboldt approach, a central pillar of the Prussian system and of German education to the present day, is still influential and being used in various discussions. The present German universities charge no or moderate [[tuition fee]]s. They therefore lack the more lavish funds available for example to [[Ivy League]] universities in the US, which make possible a quality of education and research that enable academics and students to fully realize Humboldt's ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Citation Needed&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived lack of universities on the cutting edge in both research and education has been recently countered via the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]], which is mainly driven and funded at the federal level.

Germany still focuses on a broad ''Allgemeinbildung'' (both 'generic knowledge' and 'knowledge for the common people') and provides an internationally recognized in-depth [[dual education system|dual-track]] [[vocational education]] system, but leaves educational responsibility to individual states. The country faces ongoing controversies about the Prussian legacy of a stratified tripartite educational system versus [[Comprehensive school#Germany|Comprehensive schooling]] and with regard to the interpretation of the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA studies]].&lt;ref&gt;PISA Under Examination: Changing Knowledge, Changing Tests, and Changing Schools, Miguel A. Pereyra, Hans-Georg Kotthoff, Robert Cowen Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some German PISA critics opposed its utilitarian "value-for-money" competence approach, as being in conflict with teaching freedom, while German proponents of the PISA assessment referred to the practical usability of Humboldt's approach and the Prussian educational system derived from it.&lt;ref name= the&gt;Was gehen uns »die anderen« an?: Schule und Religion in der Säkularität (Why care about the others, School systems in secular-minded societies) Henning Schluß, Michael Domsgen, Matthias Spenn, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School Year Abroad''' (SYA)  places American [[high school]] juniors and seniors in one of four independently operated schools in [[China]], [[Italy]], [[France]] or [[Spain]] for a full academic year. Students intensively learn the respective language of their country and live with a carefully selected host family. The program includes extensive cultural immersion, select courses taught in the native language and requisite subjects such as math and English taught in English.  The program provides academic advisors, college counseling services, and administers the [[Advanced Placement|AP]], [[SAT]], [[SAT subject tests|SAT II]], and [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] tests at each school. Students earn U.S. high school credits while attending SYA and preparing for selective U.S. colleges and universities. SYA guides students through a challenging curriculum focused on developing skills for an increasingly interdependent world. Central to the SYA experience is the adventure of fully engaging with different languages, cultures and peoples.

Spanish teacher Clark Vaughan conceived the idea, which was founded at [[Phillips Academy]] (Andover, Massachusetts) and its founding charter member schools are [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] (Exeter, New Hampshire), and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, NH)|St. Paul's School]] (Concord, New Hampshire), although it operates independently of these, and its 41 member schools. SYA's home office is located in [[North Andover, Massachusetts]].

SYA celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015, and SYA France celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017.

The current president of School Year Abroad is [[Thomas Hassan]], former President of Phillips Exeter Academy and former [[first gentleman]] of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sya.org/about/leadership|title=Leadership - School Year Abroad|website=www.sya.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
The program in [[Spain]] is SYA's oldest. The original incarnation was "Schoolboys Abroad" and consisted of 11 students accompanied by founder Clark Vaughan and his wife Polly, plus two more teachers, who in 1964, traveled by ship on the ''MS Aurelia'' to study in Barcelona, Spain. Polly Vaughan chose the symbol that continues to serve as the logo for the program. Their son Christopher was in the fourth Andover class to participate in SYA.

Though founded in [[Barcelona]], the program relocated to [[Zaragoza]] in 1999. The move took place in order to facilitate the ease with which students learned and heard Castilian Spanish spoke around them. As the program grew in [[Barcelona]], it became clear that the proliferation of Catalan, as well as the number of tourists, detracted from the immersion of the students. The move to [[Zaragoza]], the fifth largest city in Spain, provided students with a city environment with less tourist attraction, making it necessary for Castilian Spanish to be spoken throughout the city.

SYA Spain students attend classes on the sprawling, 425-square-meter second floor of a Neoclassical building in Zaragoza's city center on Paseo de Pamplona.

'''School-to-School Exchanges'''
SYA students here are able to participate in various school-to-school exchanges all over the country, providing excellent opportunities to become friends with Spanish students their own age. These range from exchanges lasting one to five days to evening seminars organized once a week.

Through "One Day Here, One Day There", an SYA student spends a day at a high school in Zaragoza,  hosted by a counterpart their age; that same Spanish student attends classes at SYA the next day.

The program “Five days in . . .” Burgos, Madrid, Toledo or Sevilla enables an SYA student to go to one of these cities to attend classes and live with a local host family for five full days.

==France==
SYA France is located in [[Rennes]], the capital of [[Brittany]]. Founded in 1967, it is SYA's second oldest program. SYA France is open to students who are currently enrolled in at least level II of French. The majority of students take seven credits, including English and math. All but the English and math courses are taught in French.

Students are required to take English, math, French language, French literature, art history, history and French society and culture.

Based on language proficiency tests administered in September and language-study previous records, students are placed in one of four groups (Arthur, Morgane, Lancelot, or Viviane which are named after characters from the fabled Knights of the Round Table which is thought to have taken place in Brittany) for the courses taught in French. Adjustments in the groups are generally made early in the year if appropriate. Math placement is based on prior experience and a placement test. Courses meet for a minimum of four 45-minute periods per week. All courses except for Advanced Algebra with Functions and Precalculus and Advanced Topics in Mathematics are taught at the honors or AP level.

SYA France school trips are scheduled in accordance with the French academic calendar; during French school vacations, students travel all over France.

==China==
In 1994, the Chinese government allowed School Year Abroad to begin a program in [[Beijing]]. It was the first of its kind at either a high school or college level, with students being placed in host families for the full school year. The program operates out of the [[Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University]]. SYA China is open to both beginners and students who have already studied Mandarin. All students take Mandarin Chinese Language, Chinese History and Chinese Society and Culture along with English and math, for a total of six credits. These courses meet four or five periods each week with the exception of Chinese Culture and Society, which meets two periods each week in addition to guest lectures and field trips. All courses except for Advanced Algebra with Functions, Precalculus and Advanced Topics in Mathematics, and Chinese Society and Culture are taught at the honors or AP level.
 
Martial arts, traditional Chinese brush painting, calligraphy and music are offered as noncredit courses, pass/fail. Each course meets once per week. Home schools may accept these courses for credit if deemed appropriate. School Year Abroad does not distinguish between eleventh- and twelfth-grade students in the organization of classes.

Students are placed in class according to their proficiency in Chinese, which is assessed by a diagnostic exam administered at the beginning of the school year.

==Italy==
Since it opened in 2001, SYA's Italian program has been housed in a 16th- century [[palazzo]] in the city of [[Viterbo]] in [[Lazio]].

'''Sheryl "Mac" McCollum''' ({{née|Powell}}) is a crime analyst, college professor, and founder and director of the non-profit Cold Case Investigative Research Institute based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-cold-case-media-st-1015-20161014-story.html|title=Lake Station brings in cameras to crack cold case|first=Becky|last=Jacobs|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
McCollum graduated high school from [[Woodward Academy]], a preparatory school in Atlanta. She received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from [[Georgia State University]] and a master's in criminal justice from [[Kaplan University]].

== Career ==

McCollum's law-enforcement career began in 1982 at the Rape Crisis Center at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref name="crimecon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crimecon.com/blog/2017/2/23/csi-sheryl-mccollum-dishes-about-wine-crime-at-crimecon|title=CSI Sheryl McCollum Dishes about Wine &amp; Crime at CrimeCon|author=|date=|website=crimecon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there,she was director of the Metro Atlanta Cold Case Crime Analysis Squad. During the 1996 Olympic Games, she was the coordinator for the Crisis Response Team that planned and trained for four years and responded to the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], providing victim services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenincrimeink.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-cathy-scott-sheryl-mccollum.html|title=Introducing Cathy Scott &amp; Sheryl McCollum|first=Women In Crime|last=Ink|date=15 July 2009|website=Women in Crime Ink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also served as the Georgia state director of [[Mothers Against Drunk Drivers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/27/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|author=|date=|website=transcripts.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, McCollum founded Cold Case Investigative Research Institute (CCIRI), a collaboration between [[Auburn University Montgomery]], [[Faulkner University]] and Bauder College. CCIRI unites researchers, practitioners, students and the criminal justice community to work collectively to advance research, training and techniques in solving cold cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/batavia-geneva-st-charles/community/chi-ugc-article-cold-case-investigative-research-institute-co-2018-02-05-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimewire.blogspot.com/search?q=sheryl+mccollum|title=Crime Wire|author=|date=|website=crimewire.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCIRI has since worked with 27 colleges and universities, more than 8,000 students and 600 experts, who have volunteered their time and talents to solve cold cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the-line-up.com/cold-case-investigative-research-institute-interview/|title=Cold Case Sleuths: An Interview with the CCIRI
|first=|last=|date=|website=The Lineup}}&lt;/ref&gt;a nationwide volunteer network made up of 27 colleges and universities, 600 forensic professionals and 5,000 students that assist victims' families and law enforcement by working on unsolved homicides, missing persons and kidnapping cases.

Beginning in 2008, [[CNN]] followed four [[Bauder College]] students as they built case files in the [[Chandra Levy]] and [[Natalee Holloway]] cold-case investigations, led by McCollum and her Cold Case Investigative Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/11/ccc.directors.log/index.html?iref=nextin|title=Director's log: Sheryl McCollum - CNN.com|first=By  Sheryl McCollum Special to|last=CNN|date=|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, McCollum's students, after pursuing the Levy investigation for more than a year, narrowed the suspect list to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/27/levy.campus.crime.club/index.html|title=Students narrow suspects in Levy case to one - CNN.com|first=|last=CNN|date=|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, McCollum held workshops at CrimeCon, a conference advertised as a "true-crime theme park" for amateur sleuths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theringer.com/crimecon-true-crime-nancy-grace-making-a-murderer-67136cc7ac3a|title=Scenes From the Inaugural CrimeCon: Where True Crime Meets Its Fans|first=The Ringer|last=Staff|date=28 June 2017|website=The Ringer}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCollum's workshops included Wine &amp; Crime sessions, which she described for CrimeCon's blog: "I’m giving you exactly what we know about a case that we’re working on. I’m holding nothing back. You’ll get the autopsy reports, the crime scene photographs, witness statements-- anything that we have, you will have. Then you go to work."&lt;ref name="crimecon.com"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
McCollum lives in the Atlanta area with her husband and two children.

'''Thales Training &amp; Simulation Ltd.''' is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] company which manufactures simulators, including full [[flight simulator]]s and military simulators, and provides related training and support services. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Thales Group]].&lt;ref name=BizWk&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5547764 Thales Training &amp; Simulation Ltd: Company Overview], ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of the company date back to the incorporation of '''Redifon''' in the United Kingdom in 1946.&lt;ref name=BizWk/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATW&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Karen|title=L-3 buys Thales’ civil simulation business|url=http://atwonline.com/operations-maintenance/news/l-3-buys-thales-civil-simulation-business-0411|publisher=Air Transport World|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948, the company moved to the then new town of [[Crawley]] in West Sussex. In 1981, the parent company [[British Electric Traction]] changed the company name to '''Rediffusion Simulation Limited''' (RSL) to take advantage of the then familiar [[Rediffusion]] brand name.

In 1988, the company was bought by [[Hughes Aircraft]] and renamed '''Hughes Rediffusion Simulation''' (HRSL).

In 1994, the company was taken over by [[Thomson-CSF]], who merged it with Link Miles (acquired by Thomson-CSF in 1990) and renamed the company '''Thomson Training &amp; Simulation''' (TTSL).  The merged companies were based at the [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] site at [[Crawley]].

In 1998, the simulation business of Wormald Technology of Australia was bought and renamed Thales Training &amp; Simulation Pty Ltd (TTSP).

In the United States, Burtek, bought in 1979 by [[Thomson-CSF]], was renamed Thomson Training &amp; Simulation Inc.

At the end of 2000, the company was renamed '''Thales Training &amp; Simulation''' (TTS) when the parent company re-branded using the Thales name.

Thales sold its civilian fixed-wing simulation business to [[L-3 Link Simulation &amp; Training UK]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name=ATW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L-3 Completes Purchase of Thales' Civil Aircraft Simulation And Training Business|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/l-3-completes-purchaseof-thales-civil-aircraft-simulation-and-training-business-20120807-01159|publisher=NASDAQ|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase included part of the TTS Crawley plant, but not Thales' military rotary-wing (helicopter) simulation business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thales Sells Civil Fixed-Wing Sim Business to L-3|url=http://www.twpltd.com/news-events/Thales+Sells+Civil+Fixed-Wing+Sim+Business+to+L-3/1648|publisher=Military Training &amp; Simulation News|accessdate=4 August 2012}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
Thales Training &amp; Simulation has four main manufacturing plants:

* United Kingdom ([[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]]) producing military aircraft simulators and provides training and support services for military customers. 
* France ([[Cergy-Pontoise]]) responsible for the military aircraft, military helicopter and land vehicle (tanks, trucks) simulation product ranges;
* Germany ([[Koblenz]]) where the small arms trainers are manufactured;
* Australia ([[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]) which addresses [[Australasia]] requirements.

In addition, the company has joint ventures and/or customer support hubs in the United States, [[Saudi Arabia]], China, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Products and services==
Thales have built and now operate numerous types of aircraft simulators, including:

* Fixed based — No [[Stewart platform|motion platform]], normally housed in a dome, commonly military application.  Full flight simulators can also be fixed based, these are generally basic training devices that have no visual and are control trainers only.
* Full flight simulators — A fully immersed simulation that has a motion platform, can be either hydraulic or electric (Reality H helicopter simulator).
* Military simulators — These can simulate parts of aircraft (fuselage), water based vehicles or ground systems, they are designed to simulate the look and/or feel of the environment.
* The range of services offered in support of military simulators now extends to both [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] and [[Public Private Partnership|PPP]] contracts.  Thales Training &amp; Simulation provides the Synthetic training service for Tornado GR4 Royal Air Force Pilots and Navigators. A similar service is provided to train [[British Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] [[Westland Lynx|Lynx Mk 7 &amp; Mk 9]] Pilots.  A further Thales training service took over the operation of several existing Royal Air Force Simulator training centres, Nimrod MR Mk2, C130K, VC10, Tristar, Tucano, Jaguar, Tornado F3 and SeaKing Mk3, under a PPP arrangement. As the PFI model has been adopted outside the UK, Thales is also part of a consortium to supply NH90 helicopter synthetic training to the German airforce under a PFI framework. Thales Training &amp; Simulation has a joint venture with Eurocopter running a synthetic helicopter training facility, Helisim.
* Thales also manufactures driver simulators for trucks (heavy goods vehicles), busses and military vehicles including tanks.
* The range of simulators extends to nuclear power plant simulators (for operator training) and small arms simulators for training army, police, etc.

==World War II==
Like many African Americans and Americans, Adair participated in the [[World War II]] efforts at home and abroad. She worked in a war plant. She inspected radar tubes. She was also a young mother at the time. She described her experience:
{{block quote|This was a period of perhaps the greatest number of lynchings. Everything was separate. Total restrictions. And at every moment you could be humiliated just because of color.&lt;p&gt;Despite the denial, despite the tragedy, despite the suffering, black folks, colored folks, Negro, Afro-Americans, claim America. This was your country, and so the loyalty, and this is the mystery of it all, was so strong that you never, even as we worked in war plants, even as we brought our crippled back, even as we buried our dead and got flags – we were not fighting for someone else. We too were America, and we only wanted the chance and the opportunity that we could have to sit at the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/jim_crow/transcript.html|title=Radio Fights Jim Crow|last=Smith|first=Stephen|accessdate= July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
Adair was an organizer for West Harlem Head Start Programs. In 1944 she was an organizer for Mt. Morris UPC's Project Uplift, a precursor to. the Arthur Eugene and Thelma Adair Community Life Center Head Start.   The center services more than 250 children throughout various locations in Harlem.  Adair has published and written numerous articles on early childhood education. Her publications are authoritative guides for early childhood educators throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED089836.pdf |format=PDF |title=Document Resume |website=Files.eric.ed.gov |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">[[File:Tokyo School for Blind and Deaf 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The Tokyo School for the Blind and Deaf, circa 1900]]

The {{nihongo|'''Tokyo School for the Deaf'''|東京都立ろう学校|Tokyo ro-a gakko}}, now called the Central School for the Deaf, was the first Deaf educational program to be established in the eastern capital during the [[Meiji period]].

==History==
The Tokyo School for the Deaf was established in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, Michiko. (1994). {{Google books|bqJxAcmA9yEC| "The Deaf Japanese and Their Self-Identity," in ''The Deaf Way: Perspectives from the International Conference on Deaf Culture,'' p. 66.|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the school adopted a manual teaching method, despite international trends towards oralism.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, {{Google books|bqJxAcmA9yEC|p. 66-67.|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, alumni of the Tokyo School for the Deaf founded the Japanese Association of the Deaf.  This organization was the precursor of the [[Japanese Federation of the Deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Karen. [http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/17.full.pdf+html  "Resistance and Co-optation: the Japanese Federation of the Deaf and its Relations with State Power,"] ''Social Science Japan Journal,'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (April 2002), pp 17-35, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the institution had grown to include an elementary school, a middle school, and a training department.  The training department was intended for the training of those who planned to be teaching the Deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Monbushō. (1935). ''Annual report of the Minister of State for Education,'' p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UKA''' is the largest [[cultural festival]] in [[Norway]] and is arranged biennially by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[students]] from [[Trondheim]]. In 2017, the festival is set to be held for the 49th time. In 2015, 1700 students did volunteer work, while 90,000 event tickets were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/2016/05/17/Uka-fikk-73-mill-i-overskudd-12741271.ece|title=Uka fikk 7,3 mill i overskudd|last=Ellingsen|first=Lajla|date=2016-05-17|work=adressa.no|access-date=2017-06-08|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "UKA" translates to "the week", although it now lasts for the better part of a month, with events including concerts, theatre, seminars and more.

==History==
[[File:Festivallende, UKA 2015.jpg|thumbnail|Festival area of UKA 2015]]
UKA was established in 1917 by students studying at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (NTH, now part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]]) in an attempt to improve the [[Finance|financial]] situation within the [[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem|students' community]] in
[[Trondheim]]. In 1917 the festival mainly consisted of a [[revue]], which was arranged every other year except the mid-[[Second World War|war]]
years. Starting with scarce resources UKA has been in constant growth and is today the largest Norwegian cultural festival with more concerts and entertainment than ever before. Although the festival now features big name artists, the organizers still consider revue, [[UKErevyen]], as the "heart" of the festival.

==Volunteer work==
It may seem hard to believe, but Norway's largest cultural festival is run entirely by volunteers, from top to bottom. Trondheim's tradition for volunteer work is well known, and a trademark for UKA. In 2009, 1400 volunteers made sure everything ran smoothly. 6500 spectators jumped up and down in Death Valley, 90 000 litres of beer were sold during the festival, activities spanning from juggling courses to crime night to wrestling were held in Death Valley and The [[Student Society in Trondheim]], and commercial partners contributed with events like “UKA robot challenge”, where the contesters competed in building and programming Lego robots. The festival itself is a celebration of intellectual prowess and passionate commitment shown by the students. Consisting mainly of students recruited from Trondheim, the main audience is young people within the proximity of the city. There are events and lectures however, that targets a more mature audience, such as [[UKErevyen]].

==Names==
Every [[UKErevyen]] revue is given a name, which also becomes the name of the entire festival. The name is decided by the writers and is a well-kept secret all the way up to the opening of the festival and the play, and only a handful people outside of the writers' collegium knows it before it's officially revealed. This is a big event where the name is physically uncovered at midnight in front of the student society, with several thousand attendants.

The writers aren't entirely free in choosing the name either. A more or less strict set of rules applies, never written down, but followed from one festival to the next. The most important ones are that the name should consist of three syllables, and that it should have several meanings, either in splitting up the word(s) or rearranging the letters. The rules aren't always followed, as seen with the name of UKA-03; Glasur, that had only two syllables. It did, however, supply different interpretations, first of all with the word itself, meaning [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]], then "Gla' sur" which means "happy sad", and "gla'rus" (a rush of happiness). UKA-05 restored the rule of three syllables with the name Origo.

The '''US-China Education Trust''' ('''USCET''', {{zh|s=中美教育基金|t=中美教育基金|p=Zhōng-Měi Jiàoyù Jījīn}} ) is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington D.C.]] Founded in 1998 by Ambassador [[Julia Chang Bloch]], the first [[Chinese-American]] U.S. Ambassador, USCET seeks to promote [[China–United States relations]] through a series of education and exchange programs. The organization sponsors a variety of fellowships, conferences, workshops and exchanges, focused primarily on strengthening Chinese academic institutions related to the fields of [[American Studies]], Media and [[Journalism]], American Governance, and [[International Relations]]. 

The organization's expressed mission is "to promote US-China relations through education and exchange for next-generation leaders."

== Programs ==

USCET's activities currently fall within eight main program areas:

=== The American Studies Network ===
Conceived to strengthen American Studies programs in China, this consortium of academic institutions, now numbering more than 50, provides opportunities for members to collaborate, share resources, and develop their capacity to teach about American society and culture. One of the primary goals of the ASN is to promote a more comprehensive understanding of the United States in China by sponsoring academic research in fields that go beyond politics and US-China relations, which tend to dominate Chinese research about America. As such, the ASN encourages scholarly collaboration and research on topics such as American culture and religion. ASN activities include an annual conference for all member universities; an American Studies Fellows program which places young Chinese scholars at American universities for a mentored semester-long fellowship; and delegations of American Studies scholars from China to the annual meeting of the American Studies Association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6762112.html|title=The 6th American Studies Network Annual Conference opens in Beijing today|publisher=''People's Daily Online,'' September 19, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=193|title=American Studies |publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media Education Consortium ===
Similar to the ASN, the Media Education Consortium (MEC) is a network of schools of journalism and communication at over 30  Chinese universities. Through annual conferences and short-term workshops, USCET seeks to use the MEC to expand the capacity of Chinese universities to train professionally skilled journalists and broadcasters. MEC programs work to build practical investigative and reporting skills for Chinese journalism students, and to strengthen the role of professionalism and media ethics within Chinese media and communication curricula.

Annual MEC Programs Include: 

*'''Financial Media Institute '''
:A 5-day certificate program in financial and business journalism for Chinese fourth-year and graduate journalism and communications students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=176|title=Financial Media Institute|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Journalist in Residence'''
:An exchange program which brings prominent American journalists to Chinese journalism and communications colleges for lectures and workshops. Past fellows have included Deborah Nelson, who received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her investigation of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and other abuses by the American military during the [[Vietnam War]], and who is now a professor of journalism at the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=161|title=Journalist In Residence|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Media Education Consortium Annual Conference '''
:An annual conference at one of the MEC partner schools allows scholars from different Consortium members to meet and share resources, ideas, and curriculum development strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=161|title=MEC Annual Conferences|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Governance ===
USCET's earliest initiative in China, the Congressional Practicum, has expanded to include elections seminars, training sessions, and annual lectures that build knowledge among Chinese professionals, officials, and students about the workings of the US legislative and political process. Past programs have included case studies, hands-on training, and interactive exchanges among US and Chinese experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=194|title=American Governance|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USCET Student Leaders Exchange ===
This program was the first in the United States to be launched under President [[Barack Obama]]'s "100,000 Strong" Initiative to increase the number of American students studying in China. The program provides grants to American universities to encourage students to study abroad in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eap/regional/100000_strong/index.htm|title=100,000 Strong Initiative|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities will use the funds to award travel grants to students enrolled in summer, semester, and academic year study abroad programs. Current partner universities include [[Boston University]], [[San Francisco State University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of North Alabama]].

===Summer Institutes ===
Summer Institutes are short term academic sessions for Asian students and scholars in the United States. The 2010 Summer Institute, entitled "U.S. Foreign Policy for East Asian Student Leaders," brought 20 undergraduate students from China, Korea, and Japan to Washington, DC for a four-week academic program about American politics and society. The 2010 Institute combined classroom discussions, guest lectures, field trips, and a study tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=219|title=Summer Institute 2010|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenberg/Starr Scholarships ===
Named in honor of American businessman and philanthropist [[Maurice Greenberg]], this program supports the studies of 10 Chinese students from low-income families each year, covering the cost of their full tuition at [[Yunnan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=196|title=GSS Scholarships|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121121614/http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=196|archivedate=2011-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USCET-TFAS Fellowships ===
USCET sponsors the participation of several Chinese university students at summer institutes organized each year by [[The Fund for American Studies]] (TFAS) at [[Georgetown University]]. Summer institutes cover a variety of topics including political journalism, [[philanthropy]] and voluntary service, business and government affairs, and comparative political and economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=147|title=USCET-TFAS Fellowships|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law programs ===
USCET is the programs arm of the FY Chang Foundation, a fund endowed by Ambassador Julia Chang Bloch and her husband Stuart Marshall Bloch at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1988.   The foundation was established in memory of Bloch's father, Chang Fuyun, the first Chinese national to graduate from Harvard Law School, and offers scholarships to Chinese students to study at Harvard Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2006/summer/feature_1.php|title=Why China|publisher=''Harvard Law Bulletin,'' Summer 2006|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the fund sponsors an annual FY Chang Lecture, which brings together eminent legal scholars and jurists from China, the US, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] to speak at the [[Peking University]] Law School. The 2010 FY Chang Lecture was given by former US Trade Representative [[Charlene Barshefsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=8|title=F.Y. Chang Foundation|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ambassador Bloch first laid initial groundwork for the US-China Education Trust while serving as a Visiting Professor at the Institute for International Relations at Peking University during the 1998-1999 academic year. That year she lectured on American politics and US-China relations at the university and organized an international conference on the Asian financial crisis. She established a survey course at the university in American Civilization, a class which remains very popular on the campus today. 

In 2001, USCET launched its first official project, a Congressional Studies program held at [[Fudan University]]'s Center for American Studies. The organization formed a longstanding partnership with The Fund for American Studies (TFAS) in 2001, launching its first American Studies Summer Institute for Chinese undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=103|title=USCET: A History|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the organization pioneered the foundation of the American Studies Network (ASN), a network of Chinese universities with American studies programs which currently includes more than 50 members. USCET's inaugural Financial Media Institute opened at Fudan University's School of Journalism in 2006. Directed by Terry Smith of [[PBS]] and Al Kamen of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the program brought together 22 journalism students from across China to complete an intensive certificate program. 2006 also saw USCET cooperating with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in delivering its first legislative training program with the People's Congresses of [[Shanghai]] and [[Chongqing]] on Mine Safety. The program, designed to help China develop and implement laws to prevent mine accidents and deaths, addressed a high priority area of Chinese policymaking. Subsequent  FMI's have been held alternately at Fudan University and [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/news/m_press_200904_fmi_e.htm|title=HKBU School of Communication to Launch "Financial Media Institute" in May|publisher=''Hong Kong Baptist University School of Communication''|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the Financial Media Institute led USCET to expand its activities within media education. In 2008 the organization successfully co-sponsored a Symposium on Global Journalism Education Reform with [[UNESCO]] at [[Tsinghua University]].  This predated the formal launch of the Media Education Consortium in 2009. In its two years of operation the MEC has become a vehicle to expose Chinese media educators to Western journalism philosophy and practices and improve the quality of training to China's next-generation broadcasters and journalists. MEC activities now include an annual conference, short-term academic workshops for Chinese graduate students, and a Journalist-In-Residence Program.

In 2010, USCET became the first organization to launch a program under President Barack Obama's  100,000 Strong Initiative  to increase American academic exchange with China. The program, called the USCET Student Leader Exchange Program, will offer competitive travel grants to sponsor universities who demonstrate considerable effort to expand the number of undergraduates they send to study abroad in China. USCET first unveiled the program in a joint announcement at USCET's 7th American Studies Network (ASN) conference with Carola McGiffert, [[US State Department]] Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific.

== Additional activities ==
'''Resources:''' USCET's website includes a comprehensive database of online resources related to American Studies, US-China relations, and academic exchange institutions between the US and China.  A 2010 article by Terry Lautz in The Chronicle of Higher Education applauded this database as a good model for expanding American academic presence in China.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Lautz, {{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chinas-Deficit-in-American/123884/|title=China's Deficit in American Studies|publisher=''The Chronicle of Higher Education,'' August 12, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Awards programs: '''In 2010 USCET held the first annual Congressional Visionary Award, presented to honor "courage, foresight, and pioneering leadership in advancing US-China relations." The first annual awards luncheon honored Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] who, as the mayor of [[San Francisco]], launched the first ever "[[sister cities]]" relationship between an American city and a Chinese city, with the city of [[Shanghai]]. At the organization's 20th anniversary gala in 2009, it honored former Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]] with an Executive Leadership Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=210|title=USCET honors Senator Dianne Feinstein with the Congressional Visionary Award|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12329">'''Underwater basket weaving''' is an [[idiom]] referring in a negative way to supposedly useless or absurd [[college]] or [[university]] courses and often generally to refer to a perceived decline in educational standards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Tuckett|Tuckett, Alan]]: [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/may/13/furthereducation.uk4 Underwater basket weaving]. ''The Guardian'', 13 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New (Olde) Reed Almanac|url=http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/december2011/articles/features/almanac/almanac6.html|website=reed.edu|publisher=Reed Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 bizarre college courses|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/photos/15-bizarre-college-courses/underwater-basket-weaving|website=mnn.com|publisher=mnn holding|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The term also serves as an intentionally [[humor]]ous generic answer to questions about an [[academic degree]].  It is also used to humorously refer to any non-academic elective course, specifically one that does not count towards any graduation requirements.

==Possible origin of the phrase==

[[File:Soaking reeds for basket weaving.gif|thumb|right|A woman soaking weaving material in water]]

In [[Basket weaving|weaving]] [[willow]] baskets, a trough of water is needed in which to soak the dried willow rods. They are then left to stand until [[pliable]] and ready to be used in weaving. The weaving is, however, not done under water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/ksheets/willows.html#baskets Basket-making materials: Rattans and Willows]. [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], Information Sheet C6&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of ''[[The American Philatelist]]'' from 1956 refers to an Alaskan village where "Underwater basket weaving is the principal industry of the employables among the 94 Eskimos here. By way of explanation – the native reeds used in this form of basketry are soaked in water and the weavers create their handiwork with their hands and raw materials completely submerged in water throughout the process of manufacture".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sxodAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 The American Philatelist v.70], American Philatelic Association, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early use==

The phrase in its [[pejorative]] sense has been used since at least the mid-1950s. According to a 1953 article in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' on "[[Hepster]] Lingo," "Any snap course in school is 'underwater basket weaving.{{'"}} In a letter to the editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1956, a correspondent bemoaned an alleged decline in academic standards among [[college football]] programs and mentioned "majoring in underwater basket weaving, or the preparation and serving of [[smorgasbord]], or, particularly at [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], the combined course of [[anatomy]] and [[panty raid|panty-raiding]]".&lt;ref&gt;JUNIUS, South Pasadena [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/445734022.html?dids=445734022:445734022&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Jun+04%2C+1956&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=College+%27Pro%27+Football+Hit&amp;pqatl=google College Pro Football Hit]. ''Los Angeles Times'', June 4, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, an article in the ''[[National Review]]'' mentioned that "the bored students in the educationists' courses call those dreary subjects 'underwater basket-weaving courses{{'"}},&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirk: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1jcQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 A Stranglehold on Education]. ''National Review'' 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and another year on a newspaper column noted that "One seaside university is bowing to the stern educational demands of the times by eliminating its popular course in underwater basket weaving".&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher Knebel: [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0312A&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=R4008 'Potomac Fever' column]. ''Appleton Post Crescent'', May 14, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|Daily Collegian]]'' at [[Penn State University]] in 1961 refers to a [[parody]] in which "a typical Miami coed majoring in underwater basket weaving was interviewed".&lt;ref&gt;Rabe, Diane. [http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;AppName=2&amp;enter=true&amp;BaseHref=DCG/1961/09/28&amp;EntityId=Ar00103 Sunshine Scholars Mimed at Pep Rally]. ''Daily Collegian''. September 28, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; An article from 1976 refers to football players so dumb that they had to take underwater basket weaving,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Darrell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jsn3_VEvBsC Brawn, and brain]''Rome News-Tribune'', January 21, 1976, Rome, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt; and another 1976 article refers to underwater basket-weaving as "an old old family joke".&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Geissler. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G-ULAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jlgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=underwater-basket%20weaving&amp;pg=6773%2C89774 Prints Framed, Draperies Hung] ''Evening Independent'', St. Petersburg, Florida, March 16, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
In recent years, many subjects in the humanities have attempted to adopt scientific methodologies under the category of [[social sciences]]. Some of the courses offered in these subjects have drawn criticism; for instance, an op-ed expressed concern over the lack of rigor and scientific relevancy in coursework at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Root: [http://www.startribune.com/no-hard-sciences-then-no-job-offer/255837021/ No hard sciences? Then no job offer]. ''Star Tribune'' April 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticism has been accused of stereotyping the social sciences as underwater basket weaving subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndaily.com/opinion/editorials/2014/04/23/underwater-basket-weaving-isnt-worthless Underwater basket weaving isn't worthless]. ''Minnesota Daily'' April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dave Ramsey]], American personal finance writer and radio host, has used the self-invented term "German Polka History" to describe university degree programs that are unlikely to result in a career and which he thus advises people against pursuing. He uses the term along with a degree in "Left-Handed Puppetry" as an umbrella description to avoid singling any specific degree for ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Dave and Rachel Cruze (2014). ''Smart Money, Smart Kids: Raising the Next Generation to Win with Money''. Ramsey Press, {{ISBN|1937077632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dave Ramsey Show, "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMweO8PSmts What College Degree Should I Get?]" Published on Dec 12, 2015; accessed April 08, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==

{{quote|Some of the boys she knew from college were trying to dodge the draft by taking graduate courses, "underwater basket weaving and things like that," as Vonda contemptuously put it.|[[Rick Atkinson]], ''The Long Gray Line''}}

The phrase was used during the [[Vietnam War]] era to describe the sort of [[academic major|major]] that many young men who would otherwise not have entered college undertook to escape the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]].&lt;ref&gt;Rick Atkinson: [https://books.google.com/books?id=hqFOat4s96sC&amp;dq The Long Gray Line: The American Journey of West Point's Class of 1966]. Published by Henry Holt and Co., 1999. {{ISBN|0-8050-6291-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6291-5}}. 608 pages&lt;/ref&gt; US Senator [[Gordon L. Allott]] referred in 1968 to "the situation that we were in after World War II where we had universities setting up courses in underwater basket weaving, and all this sort of thing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bRA4AAAAIAAJ Hearings, Reports and Prints of the Senate Committee on Appropriations]. United States Congress, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Published by U.S. G.P.O., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Byrd]] used the phrase in 1969 when questioning the use of funds to offer professional training to [[Cuban exile|Cuban refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UAZtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1 Second Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1969] United States Congress, Senate Committee on Appropriations&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Portsmouth]], UK, has a joke [[syllabus]] for underwater basket weaving on the Technology faculty pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706054529/http://techfaculty.port.ac.uk/tud/db/UnivPort/level_3/1SSHLS3UBW.htm | title=Underwater Basket Weaving}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another joke syllabus proposal was posted by a [[University of Central Arkansas]] student magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Shinnie, Ferri: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071103014910/http://www.uca.edu/divisions/academic/honors/pub/vino/0203/vino21_4.1/newDegree.htm New degree to be offered] ''The Vino'' 2003 Volume 21 - Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

US punk band [[NOFX]] referred to an underwater basket weaving course in their song "[[The War on Errorism#Track listing|Anarchy Camp]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NOFX - Anarchy Camp Lyrics |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/anarchy-camp-lyrics-nofx.html |website=MetroLyrics |accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linkedin]] adopted "skill endorsement" in 2012, and in response to the arbitrary nature of those skill attributions, some [[LinkedIn]] participants began to list "Advanced Underwater Basket Weaving" as a skill, thereby exercising some control over their online profile.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==As a taught course==
Since 1980, [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], has offered an underwater basket weaving class during [[Reed College#Paideia|Paideia]], its festival of learning that offers informal, non-credit courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reed.edu/orientation/pdfs/2008_Obook_Small.pdf Reed Orientation August 22–September 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student Resource Center at the [[University of Arizona]] offered a submerged [[snorkeling]] basket-weaving course in spring 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle J. Jones: [https://web.archive.org/web/19991008092827/http://wildcat.arizona.edu/papers/91/64/08_1_m.html Build your own basket... underwater] ''Arizona Daily Wildcat'', November 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watery Weaving 101 - Frustration turns pupil into basket case. ''Arizona Daily Star'', April 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, a [[Rutgers University]] [[scuba diving]] instructor offered a one-off course.&lt;ref&gt;Sacharow, Fredda: [http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-02-02.4357742289/article.2009-02-03.1326955700 Recession buster: A Rutgers course for $1] ''Focus'', February 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.recreation.rutgers.edu/CourseCatalog/classView.asp?id=1438 Underwater Basket Weaving, Dollar Menu, Rutgers Recreation]&lt;/ref&gt; Underwater Basket Weaving is a [[trademark]] of the US Scuba Center Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=75217070 United States Patent and Trademark Office Serial No. 75217070]&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a specialty class designed to improve or more fully enjoy diving skills from which participants can "take home a memorable souvenir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usscuba.com/SpecialtyClasses.html#Underwater%20Basket%20Weaving US Scuba Center Inc.: Specialty Classes]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an April Fools joke, [[Coursera]] offered an [[online course]] on underwater basket weaving as of April 1, 2013. The class was supposed to "consist of short lecture and demonstration videos, between 8 and 10 minutes in length, short quizzes, and practical weaving exercises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.coursera.org/course/basketweave | title=Underwater Basketweaving with Phineas Dunne}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the joke is seen by some as being disrespectful of indigenous cultures, and the joke designer issued an apology which was posted on the Coursera class page for "Aboriginal Worldviews and Education." The apology read, in part, "By posting the course and video, we were not intending to be disrespectful to indigenous cultures, and we sincerely apologize to anyone we offended by the content of our video."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/aboriginal-education | title=Aboriginal Worldviews and Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uni in the USA''''' is a guide to [[university|universities]] around the world aimed at prospective students in the [[United Kingdom]]. The guide is a subsidiary of [[The Good Schools Guide]], and is published in paperback by Galore Park.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120626144830/http://www.galorepark.co.uk/product/parents/2763/uni-in-the-usa-and-beyond.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available as an [[ebook]] and as a subscription on the guide's website.

The guide was first published in 2004 with only 25 university reviews, all written by British [[Harvard]] student Alice Fishburn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130630131022/http://www.usapplicants.com/resources/books/7-uni-in-the-usa ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishpond.co.uk/Books/Uni-the-USA-Alice-Fishburn-Anthony-Nemecek/9780953265978 |title=Uni in the USA, Alice Fishburn Anthony Nemecek - Shop Online for Books in the United Kingdom |website=Fishpond.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has grown to include about 65 [[United States of America|US]] universities and about 30 in other countries. The expanded edition was first published in paperback in 2012 as ''Uni in the USA... and Beyond'', and contains forwards by the [[Fulbright Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/why-the-usa/602/why-study-in-the-us |title=Why Study In The US &amp;#124; Scholarships For Studying Abroad &amp;#124; University In The USA |publisher=Uniintheusa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="educationviews1"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130704004537/http://educationviews.org/why-study-in-the-us-could-be-a-bright-idea/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the headmaster of [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]],&lt;ref name="educationviews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniintheusa.com/how-why/why-the-usa/1432/encouragement-from-a-uk-headmaster |title=Why Study In The US &amp;#124; Scholarships For Studying Abroad &amp;#124; University In The USA |publisher=Uniintheusa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose comments were noted by the ''Daily Telegraph'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paton |first=Graeme |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9306485/British-university-malaise-forcing-bright-students-to-US.html |title=British university 'malaise' forcing bright students to US |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Uni in the USA'' consists of reviews of universities. It also includes information on how to choose and apply to universities as a UK resident. The reviews are written by UK students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uni-USA-Definitive-Universities-Schools/dp/1905735847 |title=Uni in the USA: The Definitive UK Guide to the Universities in the USA (Good Schools Guide) |author1=Harriet Plyler |author2=Alice Fishburn |author3=Anthony Nemecek |author4=John Wallis |isbn=9781905735846 |website=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guide also presents reference material for applying and paying for university in the United States from a British perspective. Unlike other guides to university, ''Uni in the USA'' is aimed at British students. Like the ''Good Schools Guide'', ''Uni in the USA'' does not accept payment from any of the universities it reviews.

The '''Academic Decathlon''' (also called '''AcaDec''', '''AcaDeca''' or '''AcDec''') is the only annual high school academic competition organized by the non-profit United States Academic Decathlon Association (USAD). The competition consists of seven multiple choice tests, two performance events, and an essay. Academic Decathlon was created by Robert Peterson in 1968 for local schools in [[Orange County, California]] and expanded nationwide in 1981 by Robert Peterson, William Patton, first President of the new USAD Board and Phillip Bardos, Chairman of the new USAD Board. That year, 17 [[List of states and territories of the United States|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]] participated, a number that has grown to include most of the United States and some international schools. Mr. Patton and Mr. Bardos served on the board in these two executive positions for the first 10 years of the USAD and not only personally contributed significantly both financially and in personal effort to the organization in those early day when there were no corporate sponsors they, along with Robert Peterson, were the major three factors in bringing corporate sponsors to the program during these challenging growth years eventually resulting in a financially self sustaining organization. In 2015 Academic Decathlon held its first ever International competition in Shanghai, China.  Once known as United States Academic Decathlon, on March 1, 2013, it began operating as the Academic Decathlon. 

Academic Decathlon is designed to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on [[Grade (education)#United States|grade point average]]: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students in his or her division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the [[United States Academic Decathlon National Championship|national competition]] in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.

The ten events require knowledge in many academic disciplines. Students must take seven multiple choice tests in art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science. These topics, with the exception of math, are thematically linked each year. One of the multiple choice events, alternating between science and social science, is chosen for the [[United States Academic Decathlon#Super Quiz|Super Quiz]]. In addition to the seven [[#Objective events|objective events]], there are three [[#Subjective events|subjective events]] graded by judges: essay, interview and speech.

Over the years, there have been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal involving the [[Charles P. Steinmetz Academic Centre|Steinmetz High School]] team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 [[Illinois]] state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film ''[[Cheaters (film)|Cheaters]]''.&lt;ref name="Highbeam Cheaters" /&gt; Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the amount of time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school.&lt;ref name="Bruising Super Bowls" /&gt; Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden ''Resource Guides'' rather than provide topics for students to research.&lt;ref name="LATApril232000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATApril122000" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Robert Dea Peterson.png|thumb|right|Dr. Robert Dea Peterson, left, receives an award from the Orange County Department of Education for the "originality" of the Academic Decathlon concept.]]

Academic Decathlon was founded in 1968 by Robert Peterson, the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of schools in [[Orange County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Tanya|title=L.A. High Wins State Decathlon Super Quiz|page=B3|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Cobb, the executive director of the California Academic Decathlon in 2003, said after Peterson's death that Peterson intended the competition to encourage not only the highest-level students who already competed in academic competitions ("[adding] a little glory," as President of the Orange County Academic Decathlon Association put it in 1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huntington Tops Decathlon Test|newspaper=Independent Press-Telegram |location=Long Beach, California |date=November 22, 1970 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also to "change C students' lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Claire|last=Luna|title=Robert Peterson, 82; Educator Founded Academic Decathlon|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/07/local/me-peterson7|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 7, 2003|accessdate=May 16, 2009|quote= Peterson, who retired as county superintendent in 1990, profoundly affected students when he created the Academic Decathlon in 1968, educators said. He envisioned a new kind of competition that would give students of different achievement levels a chance to shine. Other academic contests, he said, rewarded only top-level students who didn't need the motivation. Peterson's remedy was to require decathlon teams to include B and C students along with A students for the 10-event contest, which includes math, art and speech. The program gives A students the chance to show their strengths and B students the chance to improve, but most important, it has the power to change C students' lives, said Marvin Cobb, executive director of the California Academic Decathlon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural competition, held in December 1968, hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students Compete for Orange County Academic Honors|last=Geivet|first=Bob|date=November 28, 1968|page=38|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=103 Participate in pioneer project|page=D2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 6, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first only regional contests were held, organized by the Orange County Academic Decathlon Corporation (OCAD)&lt;ref name="2nd AD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Academic Decathlon|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Press-Telegram]]|page=80|date=November 5, 1969|location=Long Beach, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Howard|title=Statewide Academic Decathlon Urged|page=E7|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 11, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the assistance of the Orange County Department of Education.&lt;ref name="Bye OCDoE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Geivet|first=Bob|title=Education department not needed, says Orange Co. jury.|newspaper=Independent|date=December 27, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, when the grand jury recommended that the Orange County Department of Education should no longer play a part in the competition, full control was handed over to the OCAD.&lt;ref name="Bye OCDoE" /&gt;

In 1979, the first statewide competition was held,&lt;ref name="tad"&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Academic Decathlon|publisher=Texas Academic Decathlon|url=http://www.txacadec.org/html/about_tad.php|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.txacadec.org%2Fhtml%2Fabout_tad.php&amp;date=2009-04-29|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=September 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just over two years later, the newly formed United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at [[Loyola Marymount University]] in California—200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed for the chance to attend.&lt;ref name="WashPos1991"&gt;{{cite news|title=Area Students Make Showing in Academic Decathlon and Win Honors|last=Mathews|first=Jay|date=April 23, 1991|newspaper=The Washington Post|pages=B1|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scholarship is smart business|page= 29|work= Industry Week|date= April 19, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson, inspired by the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Move over Olympics; the thinkers are here|work=Industry Week|date= June 15, 1981|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Singer|first= Amy|title= The Schools; Academia's Bruising Super Bowls|pages= 12, 19|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= April 14, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] competed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foster|first=Catherine|title=Decathlon for Mental Gymnasts|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date= April 26, 1989|page=13 (Ideas)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of schools not from states of the United States of America that have competed in the National Championship, see the following link:[http://acadecscores.gilslotd.com/wiki/State]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 1986 trial competition, Dr. Peterson founded a "International Decathlon for Academics" in 1990. Competitions were held in 1990, 1991 and 1992, but for a number of reasons the competition did not continue.&lt;ref name="Official History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/downloads/USADHistoryWeb.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=United States Academic Decathlon |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |title=A History of the United States Academic Decathlon |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMexleJQ?url=http://usad.org/downloads/USADHistoryWeb.pdf |archivedate=May  1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, USAD announced that it would be regularly hosting an online international competition, the International Academic Decathlon, after a successful trial event in 2008; however, all 2009 participants but Southbank opted out, leading USAD to issue Southbank an invitation to attend the 2009 U.S. National Competition instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Champion Team in International Academic Decathlon at Pacific American School in Hsinchu, Taiwan (亞太美國學校):|url=http://pacificamerican.org/pas/news/2008/05/champion-team-in-international-academic-decathlon/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpacificamerican.org%2Fpas%2Fnews%2F2008%2F05%2Fchampion-team-in-international-academic-decathlon%2F&amp;date=2009-04-29|publisher=Pacific American School|date=May 22, 2008|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2009|quote=On May 1st, PAS put 9 students to the test to compete with other International Schools worldwide.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Academic Decathlon : International Academic Decathlon:|url=http://usad.org/competition/international.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2Fcompetition%2Finternational.asp&amp;date=2009-04-29|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic Decathlon was originally organized differently than the current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, physical science, social science, current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading.&lt;ref name="2nd AD" /&gt; Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music.&lt;ref name=1998_curriculum&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 Curriculum|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|url= http://usad.org/1998curriculum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111000902/http://usad.org/1998curriculum.html|archivedate= January 11, 1998|accessdate= July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place of one of the other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012.&lt;ref name=fresno&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn |first=Jessica |title=Super Quiz |publisher=Fresno County Academic Decathlon |url=http://www.fcoe.k12.ca.us/spc_proj/acadec/topics.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910115633/http://www.fcoe.k12.ca.us/spc_proj/acadec/topics.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2004 |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's Science, Language and Literature, Music, Social Science, Art, and Economics curriculum.&lt;ref name=theme2012&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65r1Ca4pu?url=http://usad.org/Curriculum/theme2012_2013.asp |url=http://usad.org/curriculum/theme2012_2013.asp |title=United States Academic Decathlon: Curriculum Topics and Theme |accessdate=2012-03-01 |publisher=United States Academic Decathlon |archivedate=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than just the events were changed during the 1998–99 season—the style of study required of students changed. Prior to that season, students had performed their own research for each event, and test writers did not have to base their questions on material USAD published. However, after a policy change at the beginning of the 1999–2000 competition year, test writers were required to base the tests on official USAD materials. After the change in policy, scores vastly increased across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Wolcott|first= Holly J.|title=Simi High Advances to State Contest in Academic Decathlon; Education: Defending national champion Moorpark High places second at county level, but may compete further as a wild-card selection.|page=B9|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= February 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetzner|first=Amy|title=Waukesha's Catholic Memorial makes it a four-peat in Academic Decathlon, School sets state record for points, looks forward to national competition|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date= March 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State_Records|publisher=Wisconsin Academic Decathlon|url= http://www.cesa7.k12.wi.us/newweb/content/acadec/State_Records.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923012458/http://www.cesa7.k12.wi.us/newweb/content/acadec/State_Records.asp|archivedate= September 23, 2006|accessdate= July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year at Nationals, [[James E.

A number of curriculum changes were [[United States Academic Decathlon topics#2001–2002|reversed]].

Though the events finally stabilized during the 2000–01 season, the USAD administration changed dramatically that year when the program's executive director, James Alvino, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Alvino to Leave Decathlon|publisher= United States Academic Decathlon|url= http://usad.org/alvino.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010110153900/http://usad.org/alvino.html|archivedate= January 10, 2001|accessdate= August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year's ''Super Quiz Resource Guide''. His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest, as the material was a [[Persuasive writing|persuasive essay]] that heavily pushed Alvino's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raisin |first=Amy |title=Academic Resignation Decathlon Head Leaves Amid Dispute Over Article |work=Daily News |date=September 20, 2000 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACADEMIC_RESIGNATION_DECATHLON_HEAD_LEAVES_AMID_DISPUTE_OVER_ARTICLE.-a083400546 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oJD2VxkA?url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACADEMIC%20RESIGNATION%20DECATHLON%20HEAD%20LEAVES%20AMID%20DISPUTE%20OVER%20ARTICLE.-a083400546 |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The season was also significant in that it was the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAD 2002 National Competition Results|publisher= United States Academic Decathlon|url= http://usad.org/competitions/nationals_results0203.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021014141025/http://usad.org/competitions/nationals_results0203.html|archivedate=October 14, 2002|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students.)&lt;ref name=small_school /&gt; However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season.

In 2009, USAD announced the launch of an "Online Middle School Pentathlon Program", a competition similar to Academic Decathlon, with only essay, language and literature, mathematics, geography or social science, and science as events.

==Participation==

===Team makeup and eligibility===
The USAD requires a diversity of achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by [[Grade (education)#United States|GPA]]. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an [[Advanced Placement Program|advanced placement]], honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.&lt;ref name="eligibility"&gt;{{cite book|title=USAD Study Guide 2003–2004|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|year=2003|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team typically consists of nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since only the top two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally it is to the students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.&lt;ref name="eligibility"/&gt;

===Levels of competition===
There are four official levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). With the exception of Round 1, only the top finishers in each round advance to the next level.&lt;ref name=CAD1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Kansas Academic Decathlon Challenges Outstanding Students From Two States|publisher=United Student Aid Funds|date=February 26, 2008|url=http://www.usafunds.org/news/26feb2008/upd022608b.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usafunds.org%2Fnews%2F26feb2008%2Fupd022608b.htm&amp;date=2009-04-20|archivedate=April 20, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local [[Exhibition game|scrimmage]]s using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests.&lt;ref name=CAD1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academicdecathlon.org/what.htm|title=California Academic Decathlon Website|publisher=California Academic Decathlon|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academicdecathlon.org%2Fwhat.htm&amp;date=2009-04-29|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons,&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite book|title=Academic Decathlon Study Guide 2008–2009| publisher=United States Academic Decathlon| year=2008|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; though only 35 and an [[Southbank International School|international school]] participated in the national competition.&lt;ref name="2009 Competition Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=2009 Academic Decathlon Competition Handbook: 2009 National Finals|year=2009|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|location=Memphis, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 Awards Program"&gt;{{cite book|title=2009 Academic Decathlon Awards Program: 2009 National Finals|year=2009|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|location=Memphis, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like an athletic [[decathlon]], the Academic Decathlon has ten events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Erwin|first=Erica|title=Erie Team Snares Silver|page=1|work=[[Erie Times-News]]|date=April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2013, the [[United States Academic Decathlon#Super Quiz|Super Quiz]] replaced one of the seven [[United States Academic Decathlon#Objective events|objective events]] each year; from 2003-2012, it alternated between replacing science and social science.&lt;ref name="fresno" /&gt; USAD releases the topics and theme of the following year's competition in early March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/Curriculum/theme.asp|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Curriculum Topics and Theme|accessdate=April 7, 2009|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCurriculum%2Ftheme.asp&amp;date=2009-04-03|archivedate=April 3, 2009|quote=The new curriculum information will be posted the first week of March every year.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from November to April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Decathlon|url=http://www.cesa7.k12.wi.us/content/acadec/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cesa7.k12.wi.us%2Fcontent%2Facadec%2F&amp;date=2009-04-07|publisher=Wisconsin Academic Decathlon|archivedate=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is developed by a ten-member panel of former USAD coaches known as the USAD Curriculum Advisory Group. The group contracts with "curriculum developers", who must have at least a bachelor's degree in their respective subject, to create the subject area outlines, ''Resource Guides'', and Notebook Dividers. The ''Super Quiz Resource Guide'' was formed mostly from articles from [[peer review]]ed journals, but also includes non-peer reviewed articles, which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Curriculum Development Process:|url=http://usad.org/Curriculum/Development.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCurriculum%2FDevelopment.asp&amp;date=2009-04-04|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|archivedate=April 4, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of this format was continued for the Science packet in the 2012-2013 season.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt;

The events are split up into two groups: the seven objective tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science) the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, there is a SuperQuiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, with the exception of math, which has 35 questions.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essential_info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/Directors/Essential.asp |title=United States Academic Decathlon : Essential Information |accessdate=June 7, 2008 |publisher=United States Academic Decathlon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603135108/http://usad.org/Directors/Essential.asp |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, the SuperQuiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, and social science.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt;

===Objective events===
In general, the objective events follow a set organizational outline from year to year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections which tend to be poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information.&lt;ref name="Art 2008-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Music 2008-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usad.org/terry/outlines_2008_2009/music_outline.asp|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usad.org%2Fterry%2Foutlines_2008_2009%2Fmusic_outline.asp&amp;date=2009-03-02|title= United States Academic Decathlon : Music Curriculum Outline:|accessdate= March 2, 2009|publisher= United States Academic Decathlon|archivedate= March 2, 2009|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics&lt;ref name="Econ 2008-2998"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Economics Curriculum Outline|url=http://usad.org/terry/outlines_2008_2009/econ_outline.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2Fterry%2Foutlines_2008_2009%2Fecon_outline.asp&amp;date=2009-04-29|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2008|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Science and social science reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over.&lt;ref name="Theme 2007-2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Decathlon : The Premier Scholastic Competition for High School Students|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|url= http://www.usad.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430033839/http://www.usad.org/|archivedate= April 30, 2007|accessdate= August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social Science 2008-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usad.org/terry/outlines_2008_2009/science_outline.asp|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usad.org%2Fterry%2Foutlines_2008_2009%2Fscience_outline.asp&amp;date=2009-03-02|title= United States Academic Decathlon : Science Curriculum Outline:|accessdate= March 2, 2009|publisher= United States Academic Decathlon|archivedate= March 2, 2009|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.

====Super Quiz====
The format of the Super Quiz differs from that of the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a culminating championship event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luo|first=Michael|title=Academic Decathlon Returns to Its Orange County Roots; Education: High school competition started there in 1968. Now, 35,000 students nationwide participate.|page=Metro–3|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= March 11, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt; Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator.&lt;ref name=essential_info /&gt; These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SQ Proctor Orientation|url=http://www.academicdecathlon.org/Forms_PDF/SQ%20Proctor%20Orientation.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academicdecathlon.org%2FForms_PDF%2FSQ%2520Proctor%2520Orientation.pdf&amp;date=2009-04-19|publisher=California Academic Decathlon|format=PDF|date=January 12, 2009|archivedate=April 19, 2009|accessdate=April 19, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjective events===
The subjective events allow students more creativity than the objective events. The speech event is divided into prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Academic Decathlon Study Guide 2008–2009| publisher=United States Academic Decathlon| year=2008|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example prompts have included: "It has been said about our modern times that, 'Necessity is the mother of invention' Please discuss.", "Math has been described as the universal language.

The United States Academic Decathlon publishes a variety of study materials for the objective events, the profits from which support the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Copyright Information|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|url=http://usad.org/About/Copyright.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FAbout%2FCopyright.asp&amp;date=2009-04-29|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=August 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Resource Guides'' and the ''Basic Guides'' constitute the majority of the USAD corpus. An art reproduction booklet and music [[Compact Disc|CD]] contain a particular year's relevant pieces and are issued separately from the ''Resource Guides''. Study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject. These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the ''Resource Guides''.&lt;ref name=essential_info /&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 Brochure"&gt;{{cite web|title=USAD brochure 2009|url=http://usad.org/downloads/USAD_brochure_2009.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2Fdownloads%2FUSAD_brochure_2009.pdf&amp;date=2009-04-29|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|format=PDF|year=2009|archivedate=April 29, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; USAD also offered ''Research Guides'' until 2010, which outlined the basics of what students ought to research.&lt;ref name="2009 Brochure" /&gt; However, in the 2010–2011 competition season, USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research-based questions from the competitions.&lt;ref name="Fall2010 Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usad.org/coaches/newsletter/FallNewsletter2010.htm |title=USAD Coaches' Fall Newsletter |last=Brezina |first=Bob |publisher=United States Academic Decathlon |date=Fall 2010 |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xJYuBzLA?url=http://www.usad.org/coaches/newsletter/FallNewsletter2010.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Resource Guides'' are offered for the art, economics, language and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The ''Super Quiz Resource Guide'' is a compendium of previously published articles, whereas the other ''Resource Guides'' are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD.&lt;ref name=essential_info /&gt; The aim of the ''Resource Guide'' is to assist students in their study of the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was [[Romantic music]]. Subsequently the ''Music Resource Guide'' focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]] on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]], [[Rossini]], [[Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Verdi]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Wagner]], [[Bizet]], [[Brahms]], [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Music Resource 2002–2003|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|year=2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the art topic assigned was [[Romanticism|Romantic art]] in the European tradition. The ''Art Resource Guide'' included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], and [[Camille Pissarro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Art Resource 2002–2003| publisher=United States Academic Decathlon| year=2002| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, several coaches who had led their teams to Nationals during the 1990s resigned in protest over Academic Decathlon's decision to sell nearly $1,000 of study materials rather than simply providing topics for students to independently research. Teams felt obligated to buy the guides because USAD based the official tests on them. Teams also denounced the hundreds of errors they found in the official guides; coaches were sometimes forced to instruct their students to deliberately give the wrong answer in the official competition.&lt;ref name="LATApril232000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Jones|title=Credibility Gap for Academic Decathlon|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/23/local/me-22633|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=B17|date=April 23, 2000|accessdate=April 11, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Farticles.latimes.com%2F2000%2Fapr%2F23%2Flocal%2Fme-22633&amp;date=2009-04-11|archivedate=April 11, 2009|quote=Coaches and students found literally hundreds of errors.

Frank Dobie High School]] team that won the national competition, said that the decision to market guides shifted Academic Decathlon's emphasis to memorization over critical thinking. Coach Jim Hatem of Los Angeles and Coach Mark Johnson of [[El Camino Real High School|El Camino's]] 1998 winning team fumed over esoteric "[[Loaded question|trick]]" questions that USAD had begun asking. James Alvino, USAD's executive director at that time, argued that the expensive study materials were necessary to continue funding nearly 75% of the program's $1,750,000 operating budget and to provide a fairer playing field for less wealthy schools, but did acknowledge that USAD would attempt to reduce prices, remove the more trivial questions, and base smaller portions of the tests on the official ''Resource Guide''.&lt;ref name="DumbQBrightKids"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cray|first=Dan|date=June 19, 2000|title=Dumb Questions for Bright Kids?|volume=155|issue=25|page=38|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Anna| last = Gorman| title = Academic Decathlon to Revamp Curriculum, Cut Price of Materials| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/16/local/me-20198| work = [[Los Angeles Times]]| date = April 16, 2000| accessdate = April 9, 2009| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Farticles.latimes.com%2F2000%2Fapr%2F16%2Flocal%2Fme-20198&amp;date=2009-04-09| archivedate = April 9, 2009| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Basic Guides'' were formerly issued for students which, unlike the ''Resource Guides'', remained the same from year to year. The ''Art Basic Guide'' focuses on art fundamentals, such as the [[elements of art]], [[composition (visual arts)|principles of composition]], and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to [[art history]] is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Art Basic Guide| publisher=United States Academic Decathlon| year=2003| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Economics Basic Guide'' reviews fundamental economic concepts in addition to the basics of [[macroeconomics]] and [[microeconomics]]. The ''Language and Literature Basic Guide'' provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as [[synecdoche]], [[metonymy]], [[assonance]], and [[aphorism]]. The ''Math Basic Guide'' offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The ''Music Basic Guide'' begins by introducing the student to topics in [[music theory]] such as [[harmonics]], [[rhythm]], [[tempo]], and the [[circle of fifths]]. It also includes information on a wide variety of instruments and a brief history of [[Classical music|Western music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Music Basic Guide| publisher=United States Academic Decathlon| year=2003| pages=7, 11, 16, 23, 28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the ''Basic Guides'' were incorporated into the year's ''Resource Guides''.&lt;ref name="Fall2010 Newsletter" /&gt;

The National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) has criticized the intense amount of studying required by students as "excess fact-mongering". In the 1980s, the Association did not endorse Academic Decathlon, citing what it believes was an excessive amount of time involved with the studying necessary to win. It stated that while it is not opposed to the academic portion of the competition, it disliked the "national dimension" of it.&lt;ref name="Bruising Super Bowls"&gt;{{cite news| first = Amy| last = Singer| title = The Schools; Academia's Bruising Super Bowls| newspaper = New York Times| page = A19| date = April 14, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning in 2008, the Association placed USAD on their "National Advisory List of Student Contests and Activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Decathlon: The Premier Scholastic Competition for High School Students: |url=http://www.usad.org |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fmuP2A0F?url=http://www.usad.org/ |publisher=United States Academic Decathlon |archivedate=April  4, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2009 |quote=The National Association of Secondary School Principals has placed this program on the NASSP National Advisory List of Contests and Activities for 2008–2009. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list consists of programs that a NASSP committee believes meets their requisite quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Guidelines |url=http://www.nasc.us/tabid/2259/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5soO0yt8q?url=http://www.nasc.us/tabid/2259/default.aspx |publisher=National Association of Secondary School Principals |year=2010 |archivedate=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 17, 2010 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and winning==
[[File:USAD medals.JPG|thumb|right|Bronze, silver, and gold medals from the e-Nationals competition, which are the same as those of the National competition]]

Each of the ten events is worth 1,000 points, for a possible 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two scores from the Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only counts for the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt; With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 questions respectively.&lt;ref name=theme2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essential_info /&gt; The written test was sometimes omitted at the state level even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHS wins academic decathlon|url= http://www.pittsfieldgazette.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=1630&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1593&amp;hn=pittsfieldgazette&amp;he=.com|work=The Pittsfield Gazette|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 3 Individuals&amp;nbsp;— Mathematics|publisher=California Academic Decathlon|url= http://www.stan-co.k12.ca.us/scoe/admin/cad03/pdf/19-TOP%203%20-%20Math.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030822123702/http://www.stan-co.k12.ca.us/scoe/admin/cad03/pdf/19-TOP%203%20-%20Math.pdf|archivedate= August 22, 2003|accessdate= July 24, 2008|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity).

The interview and speech events are graded by two to three judges. The scores from the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If the difference between the judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay.

Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|title=Chicago's 'Cinderella Team' Scholars Are Suspected of Cheating|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date= March 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student: High School Accused of Cheating This Year Did it Last Year|publisher=''The Associated Press''|date= March 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its coach eventually resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Monifa|title=Whitney Young tops battle of brains again|work=Chicago Sun-Times|page=A18|date= February 17, 2008|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11EE067DA68B6A98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|format=fee required|accessdate= October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was dramatized in the movie ''[[Cheaters (film)|Cheaters]]''.&lt;ref name="Highbeam Cheaters"&gt;{{cite web|title=HBO Takes a Look at 'Cheaters'|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-526484.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highbeam.com%2Fdoc%2F1P2-526484.html&amp;date=2009-05-01|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 14, 2000|archivedate=May 1, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Memorial High School (Waukesha, Wisconsin)|Catholic Memorial High School]] coach John Burke was at the center of a dispute over the results of the 2003 Wisconsin state final. Confusion arose over a Catholic Memorial student's essay after the results of the competition were released. The essay had only received 390 points out of a possible 1000, and Burke contended that it had been scored improperly. He was well within his rights to contest the score; however, Gerhard Fischer, President of Wisconsin Academic Decathlon, said that the way Burke handled the appeal was "highly questionable" and inflammatory.&lt;ref name=coach_at_center&gt;{{cite news|last= Hetzner|first= Amy|title= Academic Decathlon investigated: Catholic Memorial coach at center of controversy|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date= March 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Burke was reprimanded, parents of Catholic Memorial students believed the punishment, a three-year suspension for Burke and a one-year suspension for Catholic Memorial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Seibel|first= Jacqueline|title= Coach vows to defy 3-year ban|work= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date= May 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; was due to personality differences between Burke and Wisconsin Academic Decathlon officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Sink|first= Lisa|title= State Academic Decathlon disciplines school coach|work= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date= March 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy eventually led to a more thorough investigation of previous issues involving Burke.&lt;ref name=coach_at_center /&gt; The Wisconsin Academic Decathlon Board discovered that Burke had previously been accused of "[m]ore than a year of repeated 'attacks' on another school's pupils, including allegations of cheating on tests and ineligibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hetzner|first=Amy|title=Decathlon board speaks out on coach's discipline|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=May 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Championship pits the winning school from each state against all the others for an overall title. Occasionally, a number of international schools compete as well. Schools compete based on size and are divided into three divisions (I, II, and III). However, this separation is limited to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic and Varsity in each division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Academic Decathlon : 2008 Nationals Champs!|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|url=http://usad.org/Competition/Winners.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCompetition%2FWinners.asp&amp;date=2009-04-11|accessdate=October 8, 2008|archivedate=April 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top prepared speeches are honored at the Speech Showcase, while the rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, or silver in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons during the awards banquet regardless of division. Other awards given out include the Kristin Caperton Award for overcoming personal or physical challenges, among others.&lt;ref name="Official History" /&gt; Certain awards occasionally come with monetary prizes; these often vary from year to year. Since the first national event in 1982, all National Championship winners have come from three states: California, Texas and Wisconsin. As of 2017, [[Granada Hills Charter High School]] has won six national titles in the past seven years.

===Virtual competition===
In 2006, the small school virtual competition was created for schools with 650 or fewer students.&lt;ref name=small_school&gt;{{cite web|title= United States Academic Decathlon : Small Schools Competitions|publisher= United States Academic Decathlon|url= http://usad.org/Competition/Small_Schools.asp|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCompetition%2FSmall_Schools.asp&amp;date=2009-04-29|archivedate= April 29, 2009|accessdate= October 8, 2008|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the medium school virtual competition was added to accommodate schools with a student population between 650 and 1,300.&lt;ref name=medium_school&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usad.org/Competition/Medium_Schools.asp|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusad.org%2FCompetition%2FMedium_Schools.asp&amp;date=2009-04-11|archivedate=April 11, 2009|title=United States Academic Decathlon : Medium Schools Competitions|accessdate=June 20, 2008|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two separate contests are held via the Internet and, as such, the interview and speech events are excluded. The remaining eight tests are completed on the computer and results are submitted electronically to USAD for scoring. Because only the seven multiple choice tests and essay are used, team scores are out of 48,000&amp;nbsp;points instead of 60,000. Although it is only a virtual competition, winning schools are awarded trophies and medals for their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vance|first=Christina|title=University High wins U.S. contest: Fresno students take Academic Decathlon in small schools category|work=The Fresno Bee|date=May 5, 2007|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30694557_ITM|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessmylibrary.com%2Fcoms2%2Fsummary_0286-30694557_ITM&amp;date=2009-04-11|archivedate=April 11, 2009|location=[[Fresno, California]]|accessdate=July 23, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; University High School, from Fresno, California, has won 6 of 7 Small School National Championships. Coached by Sean Canfield, the team has won both the California and National Small School titles for the past 6 years. UHS has a current enrollment of 465 students, yet placed 8th overall at the 2013 California State, competing against schools several times its size. According to USAD, the goal of the small and medium school competitions is to "enhance learning, growth and recognition".&lt;ref name=small_school /&gt;&lt;ref name=medium_school /&gt; In 2010, the United States Academic Decathlon announced the beginning of a large school e-Nationals for the second-highest performing large school in each state.&lt;ref name="CAD announces Large e-Nationals" /&gt;

A depiction of the Academic Decathlon event is featured in the 2017 film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''.

'''William Leonard Pereira''' (April 25, 1909 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1985) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry&lt;ref name=wpereira&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Portuguese-Americans.html William L Pereira at (www.everyculture.com/) Portuguese Americans]&lt;/ref&gt; who was noted for his [[Futurist architecture#Post-modern futurism|futuristic]] designs of landmark buildings such as the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Remarkably prolific, he worked out of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and was known for his love of [[science fiction]] and expensive cars, but mostly for his unmistakable style of [[architecture]], which helped define the look of mid-20th century [[United States|America]].

==Personal life==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Pereira graduated from the [[University of Illinois School of Architecture|School of Architecture, University of Illinois]] and began his [[career]] in his home city. He had some of his earliest architectural experience helping to draft the master plan for the 1933 "[[Century of Progress|A Century of Progress]]" [[World's Fair|Chicago World's Fair]]. With his brother, [[Hal Pereira]], he designed the Esquire Theater at 58 East Oak Street, considered one of Chicago's best examples of [[Art Deco]] style. 
[[Image:SanFrancisco DownTown.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco, 1972]]
He had two wives, former model and actress Margaret McConnell (married June 24, 1934) and Bronya Galef; the latter marriage ending with his death. He has two children, William Pereira, Jr., and a  daughter, Monica Pereira, a Spanish teacher.

William Pereira died of cancer at age 76 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles. At his request, no funeral services were planned.

==Career==

In the 1930s, he and Hal moved to Los Angeles. After working as a solo architect, Pereira was hired by the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]] and designed the first buildings for the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]], which was dedicated September 27, 1942.

Pereira also had a brief stint as a [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] art director. He shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]] for the action/adventure film ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]'' (1942).&lt;ref name="Oscars1943"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1943 |title=The 15th Academy Awards (1943) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-06-22 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the art director for "[[This Gun for Hire]]", Alan Ladd's first film.  He was production designer of the drama ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' ([[1943 in film|1943]]), and of the war drama ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) . Pereira was also the [[film producer|producer]] of the [[film noir|noir]] crime/drama ''[[Johnny Angel]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]), and of the Joan Fontaine drama ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]).

Though his buildings were often quite stark and sterile in their appearance (owing largely to the science fiction of the era), they were noted for their functional style with a certain flair that made them unmistakable. He took pride in the concept of designing for the future.

In 1949, Pereira became a professor of architecture at the [[University of Southern California]]. He then formed a partnership with fellow architect and classmate, [[Charles Luckman]], in the early 1950s. The firm, [[Pereira &amp; Luckman]], grew into one of the nation's busiest. The duo designed some of Los Angeles's most well-known buildings, including the famed "[[Theme Building]]" at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (in collaboration with [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]] and [[Welton Becket]]).

[[Image:UCILibrary.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The library at [[University of California, Irvine]], illustrating Pereira's paneled facade system]]
He parted with Luckman in 1959. Afterward, he formed the third and final company of his career, "William L. Pereira &amp; Associates." In the 1960s and 1970s, he and his team completed over 250 projects, including drawing up the master plans for the Los Angeles International Airport expansion and developing the master plan for the 93,000 acre (376&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) city of [[Irvine, California]], which put his photograph on the cover of ''Time Magazine'' in September 1963. He later worked with [[Ian McHarg]] on the plan for the [[new town]] of [[The Woodlands, Texas]].

Pereira's buildings were easily identified by their unmistakable style, often taking unusual forms such as [[pyramid]]s and [[ziggurat]]s. They usually projected a grand presence, heavyset in appearance and often sitting atop "pedestals" that were themselves an integral part of the building. Many of his buildings were complemented by water features and some were almost entirely surrounded by water. The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], for instance, was a complex of three [[Googie]]-esque buildings rising up out of a lake and interconnected by a series of causeways and bridges.

Pereira designed the campus plans of the [[University of Southern California]], the [[University of California, Irvine]], and [[Pepperdine University]].

His material of choice in creating his unique geometric forms was pre-cast [[concrete]]. Working in this medium, he could create his impressive facades by simply attaching them as panels on to the steel frame of the building.

==Legacy==
By the time of his death, Pereira had over 400 projects to his name. Among the structures he designed throughout [[Southern California]] were [[CBS Television City]], [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]], the Los Angeles County Art Museum, the Howard Johnson Hotel and Water Playground in Anaheim, and the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. He is also responsible for creating the monumental Spanish-inspired facades that defined [[J. W. Robinson's|Robinson's]] department stores for nearly 20 years, and he was the architect of [[Pepperdine University]] at Malibu, named by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' as the most beautiful college campus in America. Out of his immense body of work, three have really stood out in the public mind: the master-planned cities of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

His most praised and criticized work was probably the Transamerica building, which was completed in 1972. It was first panned as an intrusion on the city's skyline, but has been accepted as having more character than the buildings around it and as being an oddly creative city symbol.

Perhaps his greatest lasting legacy besides his buildings are the numerous respected architects of today who came out of both Pereira's firm and the classes he taught at [[University of Southern California|USC]], including [[Gin D. Wong|Gin Wong]], [[William Blurock]], and [[Frank Gehry]]. Pereira's firm was taken over upon his death by his two primary cohorts, Scott Johnson and Bill Fain.

'''Young-ja Lee''' (born 4 June 1931) is a [[South Korea]]n music educator and composer. She is considered the most important Korean woman composer of our time.&lt;ref name = Cho&gt;{{citation |title=Korean women's voice: The vocal music of Young-Ja Lee|author=Cho, Kyoungwha|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in [[Wonju]], she studied at [[Ewha Womans University]], the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], and the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. She continued her education at the [[Manhattan School of Music]]. Lee endured hardships during the Japanese occupation and Korean War, but emerged to become one of the dominant forces in Korean music in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Celebrating women composers|author=University of South Florida|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of the six founding members of the Korean Society of Women Composers and served as the first president for the organization. She is often called the "Face and Mother of Korean Modern Music."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Young-Ja Lee’s Lyric Songs on Poems by Nam-Jo Kim (Life of Korean Women Artists)|author=Cho, Kyoung|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her works have been performed internationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Piano Music by Women Composers: Women born after 1900|author=Dees, Pamela Youngdahl|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International who's who in classical music|publisher=Europa Publications Limited|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are available as recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Composers on Record: An Index to Biographical Information on 14,000 Composers Who Have Been Recorded|author=Green, Frank|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">'''Zeno''' (after [[pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Zeno of Elea]]) is an [[imperative (programming)|imperative]] [[procedural (programming)|procedural]] [[programming language]] designed to be easy to learn and user friendly. Zeno is generic in the sense that it contains most of the essential elements used in other languages to develop real applications.

The Zeno Interpreter was designed for use in [[Windows 95]] and later [[Microsoft]] operating systems. The interpreter comes with built-in debugging tools, a source code text editor, and an on-line language reference. 

Zeno was created by Stephen R. Schmitt and is maintained by Abecedarical Systems.

==Example: [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]]==

 const N : int := 5000
 var a : array[N] of boolean
  
 program
  
    var i, j : int 
  
    init_a                          % initialize array
  
    for i := 2...floor ( N/2 ) do
        for j := 2...floor ( N/i ) do
            a[i*j] := false         % mark as not prime
        end for
    end for
    j := 0
    for i := 2...N do               % output results
        if a[i] then                % is prime
            put i : 6 ...
            incr j
            if (j mod 5) = 0 then   % start new line
                put ""
            end if
        end if
    end for
  
 end program
  
 % initialize the array
 procedure init_a
  
    var i : int
    for i := 1...N do
        a[i] := true
    end for
  
 end procedure
