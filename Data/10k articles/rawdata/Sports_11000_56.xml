The stadium was built on the site of Termist stadium in 2011 and has a capacity of 5,300&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keshlafc.az/inter-arena/about]&lt;/ref&gt; spectators. The stadium surrounded by practice fields, administration buildings and four-star hotel.

==Background==
ASK Arena was built by [[Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan|AFFA]] in 2001. The first match played was a [[2001–02 UEFA Cup]] first qualifying round between [[Shafa Baku]] and [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911)|Olimija Ljubljana]] where the match ended 0-4. First goal scored by [[Dušan Kosič]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shafa - Olimpija Ljubljana|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2001/matches/round=1550/match=67845/index.html|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was one of the venues for the group stages of the [[2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]]. A Group A match were played there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France end Asian domination|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17womensworldcup/azerbaijan2012/index.html|work=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was announced that stadium will change its name to Inter-Arena after [[Keşla FK]] (whose former name was "Inter Baku") loaned stadium for long-term from AFFA.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;

As the stadium changed its owner, in July 2018 it was renamed again into ASK Arena (which means ''Azerbaijan Industrial Corporation'') for sponsorship reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="İnter Arena" stadionunun adı dəyişdirildi|url=http://fanat.az/inter-arena-stadionunun-adi-deyisdirildi/|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al Masry Club Stadium''' ({{Lang-arz|ستاد النادي المصري}}), formerly known as '''Port Said Stadium''' ({{Lang-arz|ستاد بور سعيد}}), is a multi-use all-seated [[stadium]] in Al Manakh, [[Port Said]], Egypt, which opened in 1955 and inaugurated by [[Hussein el-Shafei|Hussein El Shafei]], the Egyptian minister of social affairs on behalf of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|President Gamal Abdel Nasser]].

Al Masry Club Stadium is owned by [[Al-Masry SC|Al Masry Sporting Club]], and has a capacity of 18,000. The stadium was banned from all activities on 1 February 2012 after the incidents of [[Port Said Stadium riot]] occurred following a [[2011–12 Egyptian Premier League|league match]] between Al Masry and [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] which resulted in the death 72 Al Ahly fans, 1 Al Masry fan and 1 police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/in-pictures-jubilation-in-cairo-riots-in-port-said-8468133.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4|title=In pictures: Jubilation in Cairo, riots in Port Said|date=26 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2095046/Egypt-riots-Fans-dead-Al-Ahly-lose.html|title=At least 74 fans killed as riots break out in Egypt following shock result|date=2 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egyptian Football Association]] suspended all football related activities immediately following that disaster. On 10 February 2018, after more than 6 years since the disaster, [[Association football|football]] activities returned to the stadium as Al Masry played against [[Zambia]]n team [[Green Buffaloes F.C.|Green Buffaloes]] in the [[2018 CAF Confederation Cup qualifying rounds|preliminary qualifying round]] of the [[2018 CAF Confederation Cup]].

The stadium also hosted some matches in [[1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship]], [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]], [[Football at the 2007 Pan Arab Games|2007 Pan Arab Games Football Tournament]] and [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

'''Albertsons Stadium''' is an outdoor athletic stadium in the western United States, located on the campus of [[Boise State University]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]. It is the home field of the [[Boise State Broncos football|Boise State Broncos]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]].  Known as '''Bronco Stadium''' for its first 44 seasons, it was renamed in May [[2014 Boise State Broncos football team|2014]] when [[Albertsons]], a chain of grocery stores founded by Boise area resident [[Joe Albertson]], purchased the naming rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boise State's Bronco Stadium is now Albertsons Stadium |first=Chadd |last=Cripe |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/05/21/3195133/its-albertsons-stadium.html?sp=/99/104/125/124/ |newspaper=[[Idaho Statesman]] |location=Boise |date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened {{Time ago|1970}} in [[1970 Boise State Broncos football team|1970]], it was also a [[Track and field athletics|track &amp; field]] stadium and hosted the [[NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships|NCAA track &amp; field championships]] twice, in [[1994 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships|1994]] and 1999.&lt;ref name="broncosports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broncosports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9900&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=530470 |title=Bronco Stadium "The Blue" |publisher=Boise State University Athletics |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204021552/http://www.broncosports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9900&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=530470 |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was used extensively for local [[high school football]] for decades until August [[2012 Boise State Broncos football team|2012]], when games were transferred a few blocks northeast to the new Dona Larsen Park, which is also the new home venue of Boise State's track &amp; field team.

Albertsons Stadium is widely known for its unusual blue playing surface, installed in [[1986 Boise State Broncos football team|1986]], while Boise State was in the [[Big Sky Conference]]. It was the first non-green playing surface (outside of painted end zones) in football history and remained the only one among [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] schools for almost 20 years. &lt;!-- BSU joined FBS in 1996 --&gt;

Since [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]], it has hosted the [[Famous Idaho Potato Bowl]] (also called the Humanitarian Bowl from 1997 to January 2004 &amp; 2007 to 2010; as well as the MPC Computers Bowl from 2004 to 2006), which is  the longest-running outdoor [[bowl game]] in a cold-weather venue.

==Location==
Albertsons Stadium is located at the east end of the BSU campus, bordered by Broadway Avenue to the east, University Drive to the south, and the [[Boise River]] to the north. The [[elevation]] of its playing field is {{convert|2695|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/EarthExplorer/ |title=Earth Explorer: 43 36 21 N 116 11 50 W |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228110713/http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/EarthExplorer/ |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Albertsons Stadium is the first venue to hold its name. However, when it was Bronco Stadium, it was the fourth venue and second of the same name at Boise State; the three on-campus stadiums were built in 1940, 1950, and 1970, respectively.&lt;ref name=stadfoto&gt;[http://www.broncosports.com/fls/9900/mediaguides/football/2011/Pages%20114-176_Record%20Section_Part%202.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=9900 Bronco Sports.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304170745/http://www.broncosports.com/fls/9900/mediaguides/football/2011/Pages%20114-176_Record%20Section_Part%202.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=9900 |date=March 4, 2012 }} –  football – 2011 media guide (p.114-176) – p. 176 – accessed 2011-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public School Field===
During its first years at its original campus, BJC football was played at "Public School Field", located three blocks north-northeast of today's Albertsons Stadium.  The site was the home of East Junior High School from 1953 to 2009 until it was demolished and rebuilt further down Warm Springs Ave., and the previous area became Dona Larsen Park in 2012.

===College Field===
After the college moved to its present campus in 1940, "College Field" opened in September 1940 with lights and a seating capacity of 1,000. Also called "Chaffee Field", it was used through 1949 for [[junior college]] football [http://digital.boisestate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/archives&amp;CISOPTR=308&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1 (photo - 1940s)]. In the 1950s, it became the [[Boise State Broncos#Baseball|baseball]] field, aligned southeast, until right field was displaced by the construction of the Student Union Building, which opened in 1967. The baseball field migrated slightly east, then north, with a new northeast alignment and home plate at ({{coord|43.60317|-116.20043}}). It was eliminated in 1980 by the construction of the [[BSU Pavilion]] and the relocation of the tennis courts. (Baseball was dropped by both BSU and [[Idaho Vandals baseball|Idaho]] following the 1980 season;&lt;ref name=bsubsdrp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yJNfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FDEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2023%2C1956440 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=Associated Press |title=Boise State drops baseball program |date=May 6, 1980 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boutaid&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CFZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Re4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5702,6845869&amp; |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington|title=Baseball's 'out' at Idaho |last=Goodwin |first=Dale |date=May 13, 1980 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Broncos played home games at [[Borah High School|Borah Field]] during their final season.)

===Bronco Stadium (I)===
The first "Bronco Stadium" was built in three months in [[1950 college football season|1950]] at the east end of campus, with wooden grandstands, a natural grass playing field, lights, and a cinder running track; seating capacity was 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://boisestate.scout.com/2/991108.html| publisher=Bronco Country.com| title=Lyle's House: 1950-1969| date=August 12, 2010| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in approximately the same location as the present stadium, but aligned northwest to southeast.

===Bronco Stadium (II)===
Boise State began NCAA competition in [[1970 Boise State Broncos football team|1970]] in the College Division (became [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] in [[1973 NCAA Division II football season|1973]]) in a brand new venue.&lt;ref name=scholar/&gt; The first game at the new Bronco Stadium was on September 11, a 49–14 victory over [[Chico State Wildcats|Chico State]]. The $2.2 million concrete stadium opened with a [[seating capacity]] of 14,500 and a green [[AstroTurf]] playing field, configured in the traditional north-south direction, and an all-weather running track. For its first five seasons, the stadium consisted of two sideline grandstands, the west side having an upper deck and the press box. [http://digital.boisestate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/archives&amp;CISOPTR=473&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2 (photo - 1971)] Boise State became a charter member of Division II when the NCAA reorganized the former College Division in [[1973 Boise State Broncos football team|1973]].

Following the [[1974 Boise State Broncos football team|1974]] season, the school's first as Boise State University, an upper deck was added to the east side [http://www.idahostatesman.com/2009/10/13/934974_a934981/boise-state-vs-idaho-rivalry-over.html (photo - 1971)] – [http://digital.boisestate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/archives&amp;CISOPTR=286&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=6 (photo -1975)], adding 5,500 seats as well as symmetry to the stadium.&lt;ref name=wopfaddn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c3ZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hS8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2455%2C133010 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=Associated Press |title=BSC wants $1.4 million for stadium addition |date=December 1, 1973 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The permanent seating capacity grew to 20,000 for its Bronco Stadium's sixth season in [[1975 Boise State Broncos football team|1975]], with up to 2,600 temporary seats available in the north end zone seating for bigger games.

====Lyle Smith Field====
During its 11th season, the playing field at Bronco Stadium was named '''Lyle Smith Field''' during the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|I-AA national championship]] season of [[1980 Boise State Broncos football team|1980]]. Ceremonies during halftime of the 14–3 victory over [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada]] on November 8 marked the event. It honors [[Lyle Smith|Lyle H. Smith]], the [[head coach]] from 1947 to 1967 and athletic director from 1968 to 1981, overseeing BSU's rise from the junior college ranks to Division I-AA champions in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;BSU gameday program – Boise State vs. Nevada, Reno – November 8, 1980 – A Tribute to Lyle Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith led Boise, as BJC, to multiple post-season bowls, including the 1958 [[NJCAA National Football Championship|national junior college championship]], and compiled an overall record of {{nowrap|156–26–8}} ({{winning percentage|156|26|8}}), which included five undefeated seasons and 16 conference titles. He was also the [[baseball]] coach for 17 seasons and served as [[basketball]] coach for a season at the school.

To accommodate the game, a natural grass surface was laid on top of the famous blue turf to conform to La Liga rules. It was the first time since [[1985 Boise State Broncos football team|1985]] that the stadium featured a green surface for any sporting event. Before a crowd of 21,948, Athletic Bilbao won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Athletic Bilbao wins Basque Soccer Friendly| url=http://kboi2.com/sports/athletic-bilbao-wins-basque-soccer-friendly| last=Levin| first=Bryan| date=July 19, 2015| work=[[KBOI-TV]] News| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue artificial turf==
[[Image:Bronco Stadium Blue Turf August 2010.png|500px|right|thumb|The fifth overall and second blue [[FieldTurf]] in August 2010; installed a month earlier.]]
Albertsons Stadium is best known for its distinctive blue playing surface, which was the only non-green football playing surface among Division I FBS programs from Boise State's entry into what is now FBS in [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996]] until [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan]] installed a gray surface at [[Rynearson Stadium]] in [[2014 Eastern Michigan Eagles football team|2014]].

[[Chris Berman]] of [[ESPN]] has also called Boise's turf "The Blue Plastic Tundra", a joking reference to "the frozen tundra" of [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]].  Another nickname for the surface is "[[Smurf]] Turf."  Players refer to it simply as "The Blue."

After sixteen seasons of playing on standard green [[AstroTurf]], athletic director [[Gene Bleymaier]] came up with the idea to install the blue turf.  He decided that, if BSU was going to spend $750,000 on a new surface, he didn't want to see BSU install yet another green field, and that a blue field might provide some national notoriety for the school, then a member of the [[Big Sky Conference]].  Bleymaier gained the support of BSU President John Keiser, and on September 13, 1986, Bronco Stadium introduced its unique playing surface to the world with a 74-0 victory over Division II [[Humboldt State Lumberjacks|Humboldt State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/091406abt.html| title=Boise's Blue Field Turns 20| date=September 14, 2006| accessdate=September 25, 2009| work=[[CBS Sports Network]]| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BSU was 4–2 at home in [[1986 Boise State Broncos football team|1986]], but managed just one road victory&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/boise_state/yearly_results.php?year=1985 CFB data warehouse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019060558/http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/boise_state/yearly_results.php?year=1985 |date=October 19, 2011 }} – Boise State – 1985–89 – accessed 2011-11-09&lt;/ref&gt; and posted its first losing record in four decades, resulting in the resignation of fourth-year head coach [[Lyle Setencich]].)

BSU replaced the first blue AstroTurf with the same in [[1995 Boise State Broncos football team|1995]], then with blue [[Astroplay]] (a grass-like synthetic surface that is more forgiving than traditional AstroTurf) in [[2002 Boise State Broncos football team|2002]]. The AstroPlay field lasted just six seasons and was replaced in the summer of [[2008 Boise State Broncos football team|2008]] with blue [[FieldTurf]] surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Boise State Broncos Choose FieldTurf to Replace Current Blue Turf At Bronco Stadium| url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2008/05/23/378878/143409/en/Boise-State-Broncos-Choose-FieldTurf-to-Replace-Current-Blue-Turf-At-Bronco-Stadium.html| publisher=[[GlobeNewswire]]| date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to complaints by fans that the reflection and glare off the field gave the new field a dull and uneven shade of blue, FieldTurf agreed to replace the field free of charge. The fifth blue turf was installed in the summer of [[2010 Boise State Broncos football team|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=New Boise State turf to reduce glare| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5110598| date=April 20, 2010| publisher=[[ESPN]]| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique blue turf has spawned several myths.  The most prevalent is that the NCAA subsequently banned playing surface colors other than green, but allowed Albertsons Stadium's field to remain blue under a [[grandfather clause]].  In reality, the NCAA has never adopted such a rule. Any school may color its playing surface (or any part of the surface, such as the end zones) any color it wishes. Indeed, since 1986 other schools have non-green football fields including the [[New Haven Chargers|University of New Haven]] (blue)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newhaven.edu/news-events/4426/ |title=Fast Facts |publisher=University of New Haven |accessdate=September 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906042626/http://www.newhaven.edu/news-events/4426/ |archivedate=September 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Washington Eagles football|Eastern Washington University]] ([[Roos Field|red]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Eastern Washington literally seeing red over new turf| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/Eastern-Washington-literally-seeing-red-over-new?urn=ncaaf,216240 |first=Matt |last=Hinton |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2010 |work=[[Yahoo!

The blue turf at Boise State remained the only non-traditionally colored field used by a Division I FBS program until June 2014, when [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan]] announced it would install a gray FieldTurf surface at [[Rynearson Stadium]] in time for the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=EMU Installing Gray FieldTurf Surface at Rynearson Stadium |url=http://www.emueagles.com/news/2014/6/17/FB_0617141758.aspx?path=football |publisher=[[Eastern Michigan Eagles|Eastern Michigan University Athletics]] |date=June 17, 2014 |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another myth is that, mistaking the blue field for a large body of water, birds have flown into the blue turf and to their deaths.  Although Bronco head coach [[Chris Petersen]] claimed to have found a dead duck on the field in [[2007 Boise State Broncos football team|2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-venue.info/NCAAF/Bronco_Stadium_BSU.html |title=Bronco Stadium BSU |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218184750/http://www.sports-venue.info/NCAAF/Bronco_Stadium_BSU.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the origin of the duck on the field has never been confirmed.

BSU's blue turf has become such a highly visible icon for the Broncos that BSU obtained a U.S. trademark registration for a blue athletics field in November 2009. In 2010, this trademark was extended to any non-green field.&lt;ref name="techdirt-blueturftm"&gt;{{cite web| title=Boise State Somehow Got A Trademark On Non-Green Athletic Fields| url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160913/09221335507/boise-state-somehow-got-trademark-non-green-football-athletic-fields.shtml| website=[[Techdirt]]| accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|2011}}, the [[National Football League|NFL]] banned any playing surface color other than green, naming the rule the "Boise Rule" in reference to the university, though this was more a reaction to sponsor influence as no team had ever proposed a different turf color for its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=There will be no blue NFL fields| url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/22/there-will-be-no-blue-nfl-fields/| first=Gregg| last=Rosenthal| date=March 22, 2011| work=[[NBC Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2011, the Mountain West Conference banned Boise from wearing its all-blue uniforms during home conference games, after complaints from other Mountain West coaches that it was an unfair advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/boise-state-banned-blue-uniforms-smurf-turf_n_910913.html| work=[[The Huffington Post]]| first=Daniel| last=Treadway| title=Boise State Banned From Wearing Blue Uniforms On Smurf Turf| date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the uniform restriction was removed from the [[2013 Boise State Broncos football team|2013]] season forward, as part of the deal that [[2010–13 Mountain West Conference realignment#Boise State remains in MW|kept Boise State in the MW]] after it had originally planned to leave the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20121231/boise-state-mountain-west.ap/?sct=hp_t2_a9| title=Boise State to stay in Mountain West| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| date=December 31, 2012| accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Boise State's blue field topped USA Today's Fan Index list of top 10 best fields in college football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Siegel| first1=Alan| title=The 10 best fields in college football of 2014| url=http://fanindex.usatoday.com/2014/10/13/the-10-best-fields-in-college-football/| work=[[USA Today]]| date=October 13, 2014| accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Boise State football program rose to national prominence in the early 2000s, Albertsons Stadium became increasingly insufficient. The school completed a three-story complex on the stadium's west side called the Stueckle Sky Club (pronounced ''Stickle''). Construction began on February 11, 2007, and the facility officially opened on August 27, [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008]] with a gala for ticket holders prior to the first game on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Boise State Football: Bronco Stadium Upgrades Benefit the Program and the Fans| url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1641404-boise-state-football-bronco-stadium-upgrades-benefit-the-program-and-the-fans| first=Martin| last=Sondermann| date=May 16, 2013| work=[[Bleacher Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features levels for a new press box, luxury suites, loge boxes, and club seating and increased seating capacity to 32,000.

The practice facility, named the Caven-Williams Sports Complex, officially opened in February [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]], and is located immediately northwest of Albertsons Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Caven-Williams Sports Complex| url=http://www.broncosports.com/facilities/bosu-caven-williams.html| publisher=Boise State University| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university added additional temporary seating for 1,500 prior to the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]] season. The removable bleachers increased capacity to 33,500. It also added permanent bleachers to the north and south end zones prior to the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2012]] season, raising Albertsons Stadium's capacity to a total of 37,000.

In late August 2010, the athletic department revealed expansion plans for Albertsons Stadium. The first stages were to include adding a new facility to the north end zone to house the football offices, weight room, training room, equipment room and locker room. Plans also included a 13,200 seat grandstand. The later stages of the expansion plan included removal of the track, lowering of the field, and adding 3,300 seats in front of the first deck of the stadium, completion of the south end zone horseshoe, building of an east side skybox, and renovation of the east side concourse. The total cost for all planned expansions was around $100 million. The total seating capacity for a fully expanded Albertsons Stadium was estimated to be around 53,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=Longtime Boise State Donors Williams, Caven Pledge $5 Million to Bronco Stadium Expansion| url=https://news.boisestate.edu/update/2010/11/10/longtime-boise-state-donors-williams-caven-pledge-5-million-to-bronco-stadium-expansion/| date=November 20, 2010| publisher=Boise State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, the university broke ground on a revised expansion which it hoped to complete by June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=Boise State Breaks Ground on New Football Complex| url=https://news.boisestate.edu/update/2012/04/12/boise-state-breaks-ground-on-new-football-complex/| date=April 12, 2012| publisher=Boise State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home dominance==
During Boise State's recent streak of conference championships, Albertsons Stadium has proven to be a tough place for opponents. As of November 24, 2018, the Broncos are 121–9 ({{winning percentage|121|9}}) at home since the [[1999 Boise State Broncos football team|1999]] season. The Broncos won 47 straight home conference games from 1999 to 2011 and were undefeated in conference during their 10 years in the [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] (40–0). The Broncos are 116–8 ({{winning percentage|116|8}}) in regular season home games since 1999, and had a winning streak of 65 regular season games from 2001 to 2011. Their current home winning streak stands at 0 following their loss to [[2018 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State]] in the [[Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game|2018 Mountain West Championship Game]]

The '''Babe Ruth League''' is an international youth baseball and softball league based in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]], [[New Jersey]], named after [[Babe Ruth|George Herman "Babe" Ruth]].

The parent program, Babe Ruth League, Incorporated, is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization.&lt;ref name="vabr"&gt;[http://vababeruth.com/organization/history.php "History of Babe Ruth Leagues of Virginia"]. ''vababeruth.com''.  Accessed August 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babe Ruth League has increased steadily from its first 10-team league in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, to its present combined size of well over one million players on some 60,000+ teams in more than 11,000 leagues and over 1.9 million volunteers. The Babe Ruth League consists of five divisions: Cal Ripken Baseball (ages 4–12), Babe Ruth Baseball (ages 13–18), Babe Ruth Softball (ages 4–18), Bambino Buddy Ball (ages 5–20), and Xtreme Fastpitch (ages 6–18).&lt;ref name="About Babe Ruth League"&gt;Babe Ruth League, Inc.  [http://www.baberuthleague.org/about-babe-ruth-league.aspx "About Babe Ruth League"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductees who played Babe Ruth League include [[Carl Yastrzemski]], [[Joe Morgan]], [[Jim Palmer]], [[Rod Carew]], [[George Brett]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]], [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], [[Randy Johnson]], [[John Smoltz]], and [[Mike Piazza]].&lt;ref name="2010kit"&gt;Babe Ruth League, Inc.

==History==
In 1951, ten men, who believed that the future of their community depended upon the proper development of the young people, met at the historic Yardville Hotel in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]], [[New Jersey]], for the purpose of developing a baseball program for young men between 13 and 15 years of age. Babe Ruth League, Inc. recognizes Marius D. Bonacci as the Founding Father of the program, along with the contribution of the following nine men, Samuel M. Welch, Ferdinand J. Wagner, Ed Jones, Ted Jasek, Cliff Fovour, Boots Snyder, William Dombrowski, Maskill Paxson and Willard Carson, Jr.&lt;ref name="About Babe Ruth League"/&gt; Originally organized under the name Little Bigger League, [[Claire Merritt Ruth]], the widow of [[Babe Ruth]], met with the league's organizers in 1954 and authorized them to rename the league in Ruth's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Gary. [http://www.t-g.com/story/1111887.html "All-star team heading south for regional"]. Shelbyville (TN) ''Times-Gazette'', July 29, 2005,  Retrieved August 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the 13-Year-Old Prep League was added. The Prep League allows 13-year-old players to make the transition to the regulation size diamond, while competing with peers their own age.

In 1982, Babe Ruth Baseball added yet another division to its program, the Bambino division for players ages 4–12.

In 1984, Babe Ruth League, Inc. added another dimension to its program — Babe Ruth Softball. The Softball Division encompasses players 4 to 18 years of age. The program was organized because Babe Ruth League, Inc. saw a need for a quality national softball program. The softball program was designed to focus on all ability levels of young female athletes, providing them with the same enriching athletic experience as the baseball divisions.

July 6, 1999 was the beginning of a new era for Babe Ruth League, Inc. The Bambino Division was renamed “Cal Ripken Baseball, a Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.” [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]’s visions and philosophies, molded by his father, [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]], directly parallel those of Babe Ruth League, Inc. Now, two of the most prolific legends and heroes in baseball, inspire in our youth participants their knowledge, spirit and pure passion for the game.

In 2000 the Buddy-Ball Division for players ages 5-20 who are physically and/or mentally challenged was renamed the Bambino BuddyBall Division. A “buddy” helps the player swing a bat, round the bases, catch a ball.

2013 saw the addition of Xtreme Fastpitch to accommodate all softball participants—those who wish to play on a recreational level to those who seek a higher degree of competition to hone their skills with the goal of continuing play into high school and beyond.

== Divisions ==

=== Cal Ripken Baseball (Formerly Known As Bambino Division) ===
[[File:Cal Ripken Baseball logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Cal Ripken BAseball - A Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.]]

==== Major/70 ====

Features a 50' pitching distance and 70' base paths, this division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series in [[Branson, Missouri]] featuring eight International Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cal Ripken Baseball - A Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/cal-ripken-baseball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Major/60 ====
Features a 46' pitching distance and 60' base paths. Special base running rules are also in effect. This division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series.

==== Minors ====
Recommended for ballplayers ages 9–10. Players build and refine their fundamental skills while beginning to understand game strategy and teamwork. In most regions, participants first experience post-season tournament competition in this level, leading to the 10 Year-Old World Series.

==== Rookie ====
Designed primarily for ballplayers ages 7–8, this division makes use of a pitching machine to allow for more hittable balls at the plate and more action in the field. Fear of actually being hit by a pitched ball is diminished. It makes the game safer and improves the playing confidence and ability of all participants.

==== T-Ball ====
Ballplayers ages 4–6 learn hitting and fielding fundamentals in a supportive team environment. Young athletes hit the ball from a batting tee which is height-adjusted for a level swing, batting in order through the line-up for the entire game. The primary goal is to begin to instruct young players in the fundamentals of baseball in a supportive team environment.

=== Babe Ruth Baseball ===
==== 13-15 ====
Babe Ruth Baseball was created for ballplayers ages 13–15 who wished to continue their baseball playing experience beyond the age of 12. This is where players get their baseball cleats muddy for the first time on standard 90' diamonds under Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball. In this division, teams are eligible to enter tournament competition and move along the tournament trail, culminating in a World Series. Three World Series are held in this division: one for 13 Year-Old players, one for 13 and 14 Year-Old Players, and the renowned 13-15 World Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Babe Ruth Baseball|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/babe-ruth-baseball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 13 Year-Old Prep ====
Players often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.

==== 16-18 ====
The highest and most accomplished level in Babe Ruth Baseball. A favorite among high school players and coaches, this division prepares players for collegiate recruiting and the professional draft. This division allows players a chance to compete through a tournament trail to reach the 16-18 Year-Old World Series.

==== 16 Year-Old Prep ====
[[File:Babe Ruth Softball logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Babe Ruth Softball]]The primary objective of the 16-Year-Old Prep program is to provide players the opportunity to stay involved in organized baseball while sharpening their skills against competition in their own age group. Any league franchised in 16-18 Babe Ruth Baseball may also choose to register a 16-Year-Old Prep League.

Designed for girls ages 4–18, age divisions offered include: 6 &amp; Under, 8 &amp; Under, 10 &amp; Under, 12 &amp; Under, 14 &amp; Under, 16 &amp; Under and 18 &amp; Under. The primary emphasis of Babe Ruth Softball is on education, skill development, participation for all levels of ability and of course, having fun.

A special highlight of Babe Ruth Softball is its annual tournament trail. Tournament teams from each local league are eligible to participate in District competition with winners advancing to the State and Regional levels. Entry to the official Babe Ruth Softball tournament trail is free. 12 &amp; Under and 16 &amp; Under Divisions advance to a World Series. Babe Ruth Softball also offers an invitational World Series for the 8 &amp; Under, 10 &amp; Under, and 14 &amp; Under divisions.[[File:Bambino Buddy-Ball logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo for Bambino Buddy Ball]]

=== Bambino Buddy-Ball===
The Bambino Buddy-Ball Division was established for organizations who wish to charter a league that encompasses players ages 5–20 who are either physically and/or mentally challenged. This division makes allowance for a “buddy” to help the player swing a bat, round the bases, catch a ball, etc.  There are no restrictions to the age of the “buddy”. A Bambino Buddy-Ball team may be composed of players ages 5–20 and sometimes older. The Bambino Buddy-Ball division is designed so that everyone has the opportunity to have fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bambino Buddy-Ball|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/bambino-buddy-ball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Xtreme Fastpitch logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Xtreme Fastpitch]]

The Bambino Buddy-Ball Division allows our challenged or special needs  athletes to develop confidence  and positive self-esteem.  It allows them to be part of organized  sports and assists with physical fitness as well as their social skills.  The joy and emotion you experience when you put on that first baseball uniform or cap on a challenged child’s head is like no other.  As you can see, the Bambino Buddy-Ball Division is an emotionally rewarding  experience for everyone as it also allows the “buddies” to feel good about helping their challenged friends, while at the same time making it a fun and memorable time for all.

=== Xtreme Fastpitch ===
There are no geographical boundaries limiting where the players who sign up for an Xtreme team come from. Participating leagues can sign up a group of players from any geographical make-up and form a team to play other Xtreme teams in special games or tournaments throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Xtreme Fastpitch|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/xtreme-fastpitch.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xtreme teams are eligible to play at their own facility or in local tournaments. Playing rules match High School and College playing rules to better prepare players for the next level of competition.

The '''Cardiff International Sports Stadium''' ({{lang-cy|Stadiwm Chwaraeon Rhyngwladol Caerdydd}}), is an [[track and field|athletics]]  stadium in the [[Leckwith, Cardiff|Leckwith]] area of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].

The stadium opened in 2009 as part of the major [[Leckwith Development]], which included a new football and rugby stadium, the [[Cardiff City Stadium]], and a retail park.

In July 2015, Cardiff Council let the stadium and its grounds to [[Cardiff and Vale College]], who further sublet the sports facilities to the House of Sport Limited.&lt;ref name="Details of CISS subletting"&gt;[https://cardiff.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s3227/Item%204%20Cabinet%2019%20March%20International%20Stadium.pdf Report to the Council, 15 March 2015], Cardiff Council.  Retrieved 22 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This lease runs for 30 years as a result of which the stadium is no longer open to the public during the day, although evening opening is unaffected.

==Development==
The original completion date of the main stadium building and floodlighting of the running track was moved back from May 2008 to early September 2008.&lt;ref name="Council blurb"&gt;[http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2868,2967,3001,4662,4664&amp;id=3299&amp;Positioning_Article_ID=&amp;Language=&amp;parent_directory_id=2865&amp;d1p1=1 Cardiff Athletics Stadium]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609000000/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2868%2C2967%2C3001%2C4662%2C4664&amp;id=3299&amp;Positioning_Article_ID=&amp;Language=&amp;parent_directory_id=2865&amp;d1p1=1 |date=June 9, 2011 }}, Cardiff Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has replaced the older [[Cardiff Athletics Stadium]], which has been demolished as part of the overall [[Leckwith development]], which includes the [[Cardiff City Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2866,3386,4858,5136&amp;parent_directory_id=2865&amp;Positioning_Article_ID=&amp;language=&amp;sortkey= The Leckwith Development]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609170106/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2866%2C3386%2C4858%2C5136&amp;parent_directory_id=2865&amp;Positioning_Article_ID=&amp;language=&amp;sortkey= |date=June 9, 2011 }}, Cardiff Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cattle Market Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Islington]], [[London]] (formerly [[Middlesex]]).  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1863, when Middlesex Clubs played a United England Eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/550_misc.html Other matches played on Cattle Market Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, the ground held its first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] played [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]].  From 1864 to 1868, the ground played host to 16 first-class matches involving Middlesex, the last of which saw them play [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].  The ground also held first-class matches for the [[South of England cricket team|South]] in 1864,  Gentlemen of Middlesex in 1865 and the [[Gentlemen of the South]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/550_f.html First-Class Matches played on Cattle Market Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last recorded match held on the ground came in September 1868 when the Gentlemen of Middlesex played the Australian Aboriginals during [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|their tour of England]].  The ground closed when the owner of the hotel whose pitch it was decided to sell the land for development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57070.html#Profile Ground profile]&lt;/ref&gt;  The hotel itself was situated next to the [[Metropolitan Cattle Market]], although its exact placing is unknown.

'''Compadre Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] located in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. It was the spring training home of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] from 1986 to 1997 and the home field of the Arizona Fall League Chandler Diamondbacks. The ballpark was privately financed by local developers and built at a cost of $1.6&amp;nbsp;million in 1985.

==History==

In 1982, Chandler mayor Jim Patterson first approached the Brewers about moving their spring training facility from [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]] to Chandler. Patterson was aware that the owners of the Brewers' minor league ballpark in Sun City had sold the facility to private developers and the Brewers would soon need a new spring home. After leaving office, Patterson built a {{convert|2700|acre|km2|adj=on}} development he named Ocotillo, in which he placed the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boom town pitches in to greet Brewers|first=Tom|last=Haudricourt|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel |date=1986-04-18|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=amoWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ghIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2321,5926543&amp;dq=compadre+stadium&amp;hl=en|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1985, the Brewers agreed to move their spring training camp from Sun City, Arizona, to Chandler where local authorities planned to build a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} complex in exchange for the Brewers signing a 10-year lease. The Brewers moved into Compadre Stadium for the 1986 Cactus League spring training. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brewers agree to move camp|first= |last= |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=April 18, 1985|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wmcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VSoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3594,7274014&amp;dq=milwaukee+brewers+chandler&amp;hl=en|at=Part 3, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gas explosion inside the Brewers' locker room at Compadre Stadium during the 1986 spring training seriously burned several of the Brewer coaches. There was some speculation that hasty construction on the stadium had led to the explosion. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19860227&amp;id=sgkhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TXIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2071,2409464] 

The Brewers departed Compadre after the 1997 season, and began [[Cactus League]] play the following year at the newly built [[Maryvale Baseball Park]] on the west side of the city of Phoenix, where the team holds spring training to this day.

==Abandonment and Demolition==

The stadium structure and field went unused and fell into a state of disrepair after only being used for twelve seasons. After the Brewers departed, some of the minor league practice fields on the site were taken over by the city of Chandler to create a local park, the Snedigar Recreation Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_93e5caee-e184-5203-b26e-7733b38448b0.html "Abandoned Chandler field going to seed", East Valley Tribune, February 27, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The seats were removed from the grandstand and animals were allowed to graze in the outfield area, but otherwise the facility was left intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://onmilwaukee.com/sports/articles/compadrestadium.html?page=2 |title=There used to be a ballpark... | first=Doug | last=Russell |publisher=[[OnMilwaukee.com]] |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Standard Pacific Homes (now [[CalAtlantic Homes]]) purchased the property and three months later submitted a proposal to tear down the ballpark and redevelop the lot as a new residential community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler/2014/04/08/chandlers-compadre-stadium-may-replaced-homes/7463179/ | title=Chandler's Compadre Stadium may be replaced by homes | first=Michelle | last=Mitchell | newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the remaining complex began in late July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/12-news/2014/08/04/12-news-landmark-baseball-diamond-being-demolished/13582671/   | title=Chandler stadium demolition to make way for new homes |first=Chris | last=Williams | publisher=[[KPNX]] | date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elmer, the Great''''' is a 1933 American [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] comedy film directed by Mervyn LeRoy, starring [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] and [[Patricia Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=5917 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:''Elmer, the Great'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Elmer Kane ([[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]) is a rookie ballplayer with the [[Chicago Cubs]] whose ego is matched only by his appetite. Because he is not only vain but naive, Elmer's teammates take great delight in pulling practical jokes on him. Still, he is so valuable a player that the Cubs management hides the letters from his hometown sweetheart Nellie ([[Patricia Ellis]]), so that Elmer won't bolt the team and head for home. When Nellie comes to visit Elmer, she finds him in an innocent but compromising situation with a glamorous actress ([[Claire Dodd]]). She turns her back on him, and disconsolate Elmer tries to forget his troubles at a crooked gambling house. Elmer incurs an enormous gambling debt, which the casino's owner is willing to forget if Elmer will only throw the deciding World Series game (which he refers to as the World Serious).

Elmer brawls with the gambler and lands in jail, where he learns of a particularly cruel practical joke that had previously been played on him. Out of spite, he refuses to play in the Big Game, and thanks to a jailhouse visit by the gamblers, it looks as though Elmer has taken a bribe, but when he shows up to play (after patching things up with Nellie), Elmer proves that he's been true-blue all along. Based on the Broadway play by [[Ring Lardner]] and [[George M. Cohan]], Elmer the Great betrays its stage origins in its static early scenes, but builds confidently to a terrific climax during a rain-soaked ball game.

The Madrilenian Fiesta Alegre fronton was designed by the architect [[Francisco Andrés Octavio Palacios]] and opened to the public in 1892. Originally, it had a 70-meters track and capacity to host 3,500 spectators, an important volume for the time.

The stadium is the home stadium for the [[Vålerenga Fotball]], currently playing in the [[Eliteserien  (football)|Eliteserien]], and it has a seating capacity of 16,555 people.&lt;ref name=Capacity/&gt;

The stadium plans were accepted by the city council of Oslo in 2014 and by [[European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority|EEA]] in June 2015. Construction started in August 2015, and the stadium opened in September 2017.&lt;ref name=oslobsta&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Valerenga-far-gront-lys_-starter-stadionbygging-til-hosten-8052387.html |language=Norwegian |title=Vålerenga får grønt lys, starter stadionbygging til høsten |publisher=Osloby.no |first=Christian |last=Sørgjerd|date=10 Jun 2015 |accessdate=10 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From the 1960s till the 1980s and a short period in the end of the 1990s [[Bislett Stadion]] was Vålerenga's home ground. Bislet Stadion also hosted speed skating and track and field events in addition to football, and hosted the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. Poor conditions and maintenance of Bislett forced Vålerenga to move to [[Ullevaal Stadion|Ullevaal]] and a [[groundshare]] with [[FK Lyn]].

After Vålerenga moved from [[Bislett Stadion]] plans for building their own ground were conceived, but poor results on the field combined with financial problems kept those plans at bay for a few years. After the second place in [[2004 Norwegian Premier League|2004]] and the league title in [[2005 Norwegian Premier League|2005]] as well as business man [[John Fredriksen]]'s deletion of the club's debt in 2003, the talks of building a ground for Vålerenga resurfaced.

Following a press statement made on 15 May 2008, Vålerenga announced that they will be moving home to Valle Hovin after purchasing the area of the proposed stadium for the symbolic sum of 1 Norwegian Krone. In late 2014, the plans were accepted by the city council of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ensjo.org/det-naermer-seg-byggestart-for-valerenga-stadion-pa-valle-hovin-men-stadion-blir-enklere-enn-tidligere-vist-pa-bilder/ |language=Norwegian |title=Det nærmer seg byggestart for Vålerenga Stadion på Valle Hovin men stadion blir enklere enn tidligere vist på bilder. |publisher=Ensjo.org |first=Per Øivind |last=Eriksen |date=11 Feb 2015 |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2014, the [[European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority]] accepted the plans for the stadium.&lt;ref name=oslobsta /&gt;

Construction started in the summer of 2015.&lt;ref name=oslobsta /&gt;

Vålerenga's opening match in the stadium, on 10 September 2017 against Sarpsborg 08, ended in a 1–3 defeat.

In October 2017, Norwegian technology company Intility reached an agreement with Vålerenga to change the stadium name to Intility Arena.

==Transport==
The stadium will be served by several stations on the [[Oslo Metro]]. [[Helsfyr (station)|Helsfyr Station]] is the closest station, approximately 500 metres away from Valle Hovin. [[Ensjø (station)|Ensjø Station]] and [[Hasle (station)|Hasle Station]] are both approximately one kilometre away.

'''Islamic Republic of Iran Cricket Association''' is the governing body for [[cricket]] in [[Iran]].

==Administration==
===Pre-2010===

The {{nihongo|'''Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum'''|野球体育博物館|Yakyū Taiiku Hakubutsukan}} is a museum which includes a library, reference rooms and {{nihongo|Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame|野球殿堂|Yakyū Dendō}}.

It first opened in 1959 next door to [[Korakuen Stadium]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. In 1988, the museum moved to a new site within the [[Tokyo Dome]].

The Hall of Fame and Museum was created as a means to contribute to the development of baseball in Japan through dedication of baseball greats—players, executives, and [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]]—as Hall of Famers. In addition, the facility houses many memorable baseball materials including various kinds of baseball literature.

From 1998 until 2002 it was known as the '''Viceroy Cup''' and in 2003 changed again to the '''Prime Cup''', but has always been known locally as the Elite Cup of which is the current name of the competition.

'''{{Audio|Letzigrund.ogg|Letzigrund}}''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], and the home of the athletics club LC Zürich, and the [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs [[FC Zürich]] and [[Grasshopper Club Zürich]]. LC Zürich is a spin-off of FC Zürich whose members constructed the stadium in 1925. Grasshopper-Club is using it as their home stadium since 2007. The annual [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] meet [[Weltklasse Zürich]]—part of the [[IAAF Diamond League]]—takes place at the Letzigrund since 1928, as well as frequent open-air concerts. On the Letzigrund track on 21 June 1960, [[Armin Hary]] was the first human being to run the 100 metres in 10,0 seconds.&lt;ref name="The 100 meters - World's First 10 Seconds Flat Race"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://speedendurance.com/2009/03/04/the-100-meters-worlds-first-10-seconds-flat-race/ |title= 10 Seconds Flat Race |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |publisher=Speed Endurance }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened November 22, 1925 owned by the FC Zürich [[football (soccer)|football]] club.  During the [[Great Depression]], ownership changed to the city of Zurich in 1937 which has operated it since.  It underwent extensive remodeling in 1947, 1958, 1973, and 1984.  Lighting was added in 1973. The first open-air concert was in 1996.

The capacity was 25,000 and the main pitch was 105 by 68 meters with athletics facilities.  There were also three other playing fields: 2 lawns, 1 artificial turf and a small packed sand field.  The old Letzigrund also contained a bar and a restaurant within the stadium.

The old stadium hit its highest capacity of 75,000 during [[Celine Dion]]'s [[Falling Into You Tour]].  Notably, [[Tina Turner]] performed 2 sold-out performances at the old stadium during her highly successful [[Twenty Four Seven Tour]].

[[AC/DC]] were scheduled to perform during their [[Razors Edge World Tour]] on September 6, 1991, but the show was cancelled.

Rock band [[Bon Jovi]] performed 4 concerts at the stadium, but the most notable was their [[The Crush Tour]], with the August 30, 2000 show being recorded and released on VHS/DVD as [[The Crush Tour (album)]]

==New stadium==
In the Nineties, the athletics club Zürich was pushing for a modernisation of the facilities at Letzigrund in order to even better accommodate the athletes of Weltklasse Zürich. In 1997, the city parliament decided favourably on an upgrade of the stadium whereas simultaneously, the city administration was working on a reconstruction plan.&lt;ref name="Letzigrund Reconstruction Timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadionletzigrund.ch/en/reconstruction/ |title=Reconstruction |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |publisher=City of Zurich administration, stadium management |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150215015529/http://www.stadionletzigrund.ch/en/reconstruction/ |archivedate=February 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the owners of the [[Hardturm]] football stadium were also planning to reconstruct their stadium.

In 2003, the new Hardturm stadium was approved by the city population in a public vote, but subsequently, legal objections by neighbourhood and environmental groups put the timely realisation for the [[2008 European Football Championship|EURO 2008]] tournament, for which it was chosen by [[UEFA]] in 2002 as one of eight venues, in jeopardy. As a result, the planning process for the new Letzigrund stadium was accelerated. In 2005, the city population approved in a vote the reconstruction of the public stadium, plus in a separate vote, the costs of temporarily adjusting the stadium to the requirements of EURO 2008.

Originally planned for 2009, the new Letzigrund stadium was opened on August 30, 2007.&lt;ref name="Swissinfo-Matthew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-letzigrund-opening-ends-euro-2008-saga/970002 |last=Matthew |first=Allen |title= Letzigrund opening |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |publisher=Swissinfo }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sports event there was the annual [[Weltklasse Zürich]] on September 7 with 26,500 spectators. The first football game was [[FC Zürich]] vs. [[Grasshopper Club Zürich]] on September 23. It hosted three games during the 2008 European championships, with a capacity of up to 30,000. The current capacity is 25,000 for football events, 26,000 for athletics and 50,000 for concerts.&lt;ref name="Swissinfo-Matthew" /&gt;

'''Mercedes-Benz Arena''' ({{IPA-de|mɛʁˌtseːdəsˈbɛnts ʔaˌʁeːnaː|-|}}) is a stadium located in [[Stuttgart]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]] and home to German [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfB Stuttgart]].

Before 1993 it was called '''Neckarstadion''' {{IPA-de|ˈnɛkaɐ̯ˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn||}}, named after the nearby river [[Neckar]] and between 1993 and July 2008 it was called '''Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion''' {{IPA-de|ˌɡɔtliːpˈdaɪmlɐˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn||}}. From the 2008–09 season, the stadium was renamed the '''Mercedes-Benz Arena''', starting with a pre-season friendly against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 30 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/friendly-against-vfb-stuttgart-announced Arsenal: Friendly against VfB Stuttgart announced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118045059/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/friendly-against-vfb-stuttgart-announced |date=18 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was originally built in 1933 after designs by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]]. After It was built, it was named "Adolf-Hitler-Kampfbahn". From 1945 to 1949 it was called Century Stadium and later Kampfbahn and was used by US Troops to play baseball.The name Neckarstadion was used since 1949.  It is home to [[VfB Stuttgart]] in the [[Bundesliga]] (and to the [[Stuttgarter Kickers]] when they played in the Bundesliga).

After a major refurbishment in the late 1980s and early 1990s partly financed by [[Daimler-Benz]], the Stuttgart town council dedicated the stadium to [[Gottlieb Daimler]]. The inventor had tested both the first [[internal combustion]] motorcycle and the first 4-wheel automobile there in the 1880s, on the road from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim (now called Mercedesstraße).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614781-1-1341630-1-0-0-0-0-0-11700-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Mercedes-Benz Classic: November 1885: Daimler riding car travels from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim|publisher=Daimler|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new museum, the headquarters and a factory of [[Mercedes-Benz]] are nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz-classic.com/content/media_library/hq/hq_mpc_reference_site/passenger_cars_ng/passengercars_world/visit_mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz_museum/information/passengercars_passengercars_world_information_museum_info_en_pdf.object-Single-MEDIA.download.tmp/MBMUS_Infopdf_EN.pdf|title=Mercedes-Benz Museum – how to find us|publisher=Mercedes-Benz|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium capacity is currently around 41,000, after one stand (''Untertürkheimer Kurve'') has been demolished during summer 2009 in the process of converting it to a pure football arena. The rebuilt arena will be finished in December 2011 with a new capacity of 60,000, including terracing. Due to UEFA regulations, which only allows seating, the capacity is reduced to 54,906 during international football matches.
[[File:Cannstatter Kurve 2013.JPG|thumbnail|lef|"Cannstatter Kurve" is the area for the fans of [[VfB Stuttgart]]]]
It is divided into four sections,
* the ''Haupttribüne'' (main stands), adjacent to Mercedesstraße, housing VIP-lounges and press seats
* the ''[[Kärcher]]-Tribüne'' (formerly ''Gegentribüne'', lit: opposite stands), currently named after one of VfB Stuttgart's major [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] [[Kärcher]]
* the ''Cannstatter Kurve'' ([[Cannstatt]] Curve), to the left of the ''Haupttribüne'', before rebuilding it housed legendary Blocks A and B, which occupied by the most devoted home fans, and one of two video walls. Now die hard home fans stand in the new "heart of Cannstatter Kurve" in Bloks 34 and 35 in center of the curve directly behind the goal.
* the ''Untertürkheimer Kurve'' ([[Untertürkheim]] Curve), to the right of the ''Haupttribüne'', housing the guest team's fans (C and D-Block) and the second video wall

The Mercedes-Benz Arena features a unique [[fabric structure|fabric roof]] construction, making it easily recognizable. Made of precision-tailored membranes of PVC-coated polyester, the roof tissue is durable enough to withstand 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of weight per square [[decimeter]]. It is suspended from an aesthetic steel frame that runs around the entire stadium weighing approximately 2,700 [[metric tons]]. The steel cables connecting the roof to the frame alone weigh about 420 tons. The roof was added during the refurbishment preceding the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|1993 World Athletics Championships]].

{{wide image|Neckarstadion 2011.jpg|600px|align-cap=center|A panorama view of [[VfB Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in October 2011}}

==International matches==
The Mercedes-Benz Arena hosted four matches of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], two matches of the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship]] (a 1st Round match and a semi-final) and six games of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], including a Round of 16 game and the third-place playoff match (see below for details).

The stadium also hosted the finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] (now known as UEFA Champions League) in [[European Cup 1958-59|1959]] ([[Real Madrid]] vs. [[Stade de Reims]]) and [[European Cup 1987-88|1988]] ([[PSV Eindhoven]] vs. [[S.L. Benfica]]).

==Trivia==
[[File:Mercedes-Benz-Arena Name 2013.JPG|thumbnail|Name logo of Mercedes-Benz-Arena]]
* As Stuttgart is located relatively close to Germany's southern neighbors [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], it has hosted a total of seven international football matches versus the Swiss since 1911.
* [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s first international football match after [[World War II]] in 1950 (against Switzerland) was played at the stadium. The match attendance of 103,000 is the stadium record. The first match after the [[German reunification]] in 1990 (also versus Switzerland) took place at Neckarstadion Stadium as well.
* [[Klaus Fischer]] scored Germany's "[[ARD Goal of the Century]]" here against the Swiss in 1977, with a [[bicycle kick]] ("Fallrückzieher"), his trademark move with which he also scored the important 3:3 equalizer in extra time (108th minute) at the 1982 FIFA World Cup vs France, but this was not among the Top 10 of the [[WC Goal of the Century]].
* With 115 m² each, the stadium's two video walls before rebuilding were the largest in Europe, now it has the two video walls with the highest resolution in Europe.
* The Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion was one of the four stadiums hosting games during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] whose name were ''not'' changed to ''FIFA World Cup Stadium XYZ'', as the dedication to Gottlieb Daimler was not interpreted as advertisement (i.e. for [[DaimlerChrysler]]). All others, such as the [[Allianz-Arena]] in [[Munich]] or the [[AOL-Arena]] in [[Hamburg]] were obliged to remove all visual references to their stadiums' [[Allianz|name]] [[AOL|sponsors]].

==Sports other than football==
The 1986 [[European Athletics Championships]] in which the hammer throw world record by [[Yuriy Sedykh]] was set, and the 1993 [[World Athletics Championships]] were held there, and the Daimler-Stadium was the host the [[IAAF]] World Athletics final from 2006 to 2008. The arena has also been the venue of several [[Eurobowl]] finals of [[American Football]] in the 1990s. The last athletics event took place in September 2008, after which the stadium underwent redevelopment in order to build a football-only arena.

==Redevelopment==
[[File:Gottlieb-daimler-stadion.jpg|thumb|300px]]
The redevelopment was announced along with the stadium's name change in late March 2008. The first computer images of the new arena were released at the same time, also showing a large cube with four video scoreboards above the centre circle, similar to the one in the [[Commerzbank-Arena]] in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfb.de/archiv/en/aktuell/news/2007/19911.php Groundwork set for stadium re-construction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105805/http://www.vfb.de/archiv/en/aktuell/news/2007/19911.php |date=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2009, the Mercedes-Benz Arena has been redeveloped into a football-specific stadium. New stands were constructed during the summer of 2011, with pitch level being lowered by 1.30 metres in time for the beginning of the 2009–10 season. After the interior redevelopment finished, the roof was expanded to cover all the new rows of the seats. The entire construction was completed by the end of 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}

Within the first couple of weeks of the redevelopment, 18 undetonated bombs left over from [[Bombing of Stuttgart in World War II|the air raids on Stuttgart]] during the [[Second World War]] were found on the construction site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltfussball.de/entry/_20396_deutschland-deine-stadien/ Deutschland deine Stadien] {{de icon}} Weltfussball.de - Article on the redevelopment of football stadiums in Germany, accessed: 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Brompton Cricket Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Brompton, Medway|New Brompton]] in [[Chatham, Kent]]. The first recorded match on the ground was in 1862 when [[Kent County Cricket Club]] played [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]] in the ground's only [[first-class cricket]] match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/389_f.html First-Class Matches played on New Brompton Cricket Ground], CricketArchive. Retrieved 2016-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other match recorded as taking place on the ground was a non-first-class match in 1894 when [[Chatham Cricket Club]] played the [[South African cricket team in England in 1894|touring South African side]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/389_misc.html Other matches played on New Brompton Cricket Ground], CricketArchive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6088">'''Orthopedic Sports Medicine''' is a subspecialty of [[orthopedic medicine]] and [[sports medicine]].  The word orthopaedic derives from “ortho” which is the [[Greek language|Greek]] root for “straight” and “pais” which is the [[Greek language|Greek]] root for child. During the early history of orthopaedic medicine, orthopaedists used braces, among other things, to make a child “straight.” &lt;ref&gt;“About the AAOS.” American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. http://www.aaos.org/about/about.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Today, orthopaedists are making people of all ages “straight,” including athletes from all different kinds of sports.

==Subspecialty: Orthopaedic Sports Medicine==
The phrase “sports medicine” is not specific to one career/profession. It instead, encompasses a group of professionals from various disciplines whose focus is the health of an athlete. Athletes can be all ages and play on all different levels (youth, high school, [[College athletics|collegiate]], recreational, and professional). &lt;ref&gt;“Career Pathway to Sports Medicine.” 1 Jan 2008. American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine. 28 Aug 2008. http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/resources/career.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Orthopaedic sports medicine is the investigation, preservation, and restoration by [[medical]], [[surgical]], and [[Physical therapy|rehabilitative]] means to all structures of the [[musculoskeletal system]] affected by [[Sport|athletic]] activity. &lt;ref&gt;“Subspecialty Questions.” American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine. http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/education/subspecialtyquestions.aspx#1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Specialist==
Any [[Accredited Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) residency trained orthopaedist can practice orthopaedic sports medicine. Their training specifically provides them with the skills to care for athletes’ [[musculoskeletal]] needs. 

===What They Do===
Orthopaedic sports medicine [[speciality (medicine)|specialists]]…
:* Condition and [[train]] athletes.
:* Provide fitness advice relating to athletic performance.
:* Give advice on athletic performance and the impact of [[dietary supplements]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[nutrition]] on athletes’ short- and long-term health and performance.
:* Coordinate medical care within athletic team settings, including other health care professionals, such as athletic trainers, physical therapists, and non-orthopaedic physicians.
:* Conduct on-the-field evaluation and management of illnesses and injuries.

===What they Know===
Orthopaedic sports medicine specialists have a knowledge of…
:* Soft tissue biomechanics, injury healing, and repair.
:* Treatment options, both surgical and non-surgical, as they relate to sports-specific injuries and competition.
:* Principles and techniques of rehabilitation that enable the athlete to return to competition as quickly and safely as possible.

==Schooling==
A person interested in becoming an orthopaedic sports medicine specialist must complete four years of [[medical school]]. After their [[undergraduate]] schooling is completed, training continues with a five year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in orthopaedics. In order to sub-specialize, which is the case with an orthopaedic sports medicine, a one-year fellowship is required, although some programs extend two to four years. &lt;ref&gt;“Orthopaedic Training.” Healthcare-Training.com. 28 Aug 2008. Health http://www.healthcare-trainingcenter.com/programs-orthopaedics.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

After they have finished their training and have graduated from an accredited residency, orthopaedic surgeons are eligible to become certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS). Certification by the Board is required in order to practice. In addition, the orthopaedist who plans on specializing in sports medicine must complete certification in the sports medicine sub-specialty which is administered by the ABOS. &lt;ref&gt;“Subspecialty Certification.” 1 Jan 2008. American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine. 27 Aug 2008. http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/education/certification.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
Education does not stop there; orthopaedists are required to take continuing education classes to maintain their license.

==Careers==
Orthopaedist specializing in sports medicine have various options of employment: from serving as a team’s physician (high school, college, and professional), to running a private practice, to working in the academic setting. 

According to a salary.com, the data they collected from HR reported data in August 2008 showed that an orthopaedic surgeon, on average, made about $606,307 a year not including bonuses and benefits. &lt;ref&gt;http://swz.salary.com/salarywizard/layoutscripts/swzl_salaryresults.asp?op=salswz_psr&amp;hdOmniNarrowDesc=Healthcare%20--%20Practitioners&amp;hdOmniTotalJobsFound=11&amp;pagefrom=selectjob&amp;hdZipCode=&amp;geometrocode=&amp;hdLocationOption=0&amp;countertype=1&amp;jobcounter=3&amp;hdJobCode=HC07000311&amp;hdJobTitle=Surgeon%20-%20Orthopedic&amp;hdJobCategory=HC03&amp;hdNarrowDesc=Healthcare%20--%20Practitioners&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paddle-ball''' is a sport that can be played on a court half the size of a tennis court, using paddle racquets amongst two players (singles game) or in doubles with two teams consisting of two players.  The Paddle-ball racquet or paddle is plastic, smaller than a softball and has holes for less air friction. Below are the instructions for single games.
[[File:Paddles.JPG|thumb|330px|Standard Paddles]]

==Necessary Equipment==
To play Paddle-ball, it is necessary to have a paddle (resembling a [[racquet ball]] paddle) that is no longer than 17-1/2 inches and no wider than 9 inches, weighing about 0.78&amp;nbsp;lbs. The Paddle-ball is played with a plastic paddleball, the size of a softball. Air hole in the ball give less friction. Paddleballs come in yellow and light green.

==Court==
Paddle-ball is normally played on a court preferably about 20 feet wide and 37 feet long with a wall that is 16 feet in height.  The court has a short line, a set of service markers, 2 side lines and a long line. The service zone is the area between the short line and the service markers.  At the start of the play, one person must stand inside the service zone and strike the ball against the wall.  The server must stay within the service zone until the ball crosses the short line.

==Fault, Short, Long==
The ball must cross the short line on each serve. Server must stay within the serving box. Once the serve is made, the opponent must hit the ball, hitting it off the wall. If the ball bounces before it crosses the short line, a Short is called.  However, if the ball bounces beyond the long line, a Long out is called.  Any service where the server is not within the service zone upon service is called a Fault. The server has a second chance to serve the ball.  Failure to successfully serve the ball into the court beyond the short line twice results in the receiver winning the play.  The server and the receiver then switch spots. The game is played until one side wins with 15, 21, 25 or 30 points.

If the serve is good, the receiver must hit the ball before it bounces twice.  If the receiver fails to successfully hit the ball back to the wall before its second bounce and have it bounce within the court, then the play stops and the server receives the point.
If the receiver hits the ball, but it hits the server, the play restarts again if it looked like the ball could have hit the wall.  Otherwise, Fault goes to the receiver and the server wins the point.
After the receiver successfully returns the ball, the server can leave the box and must hit the ball before it bounces twice.  The server and receiver then alternate until either the ball bounces twice or the ball falls out of bounds.
If the server wins the round they gain a point.  If the receiver wins, they switch spots and then it is the opponent’s turn to serve.
If for instance, one player blocks the other in striking the ball, a block can be called and the play is restarted.  If the striker feels that hitting the ball will risk injuring another player, then a Safety can be called and the play starts again. If the server blocks the receiver deliberately it’s out on server.

==Technicalities==
SERVING
* Stepping on or over short line, sideline or service marker is a fault.
* Ball is short on serve if the ball does not carry across the short line before bouncing. This is a fault.
* Ball is long on serve if ball carries past the long line without on court bounce or being received. This is a fault.
* Serving between the legs is an automatic fault.
* Server is allowed (1) fault per service point. A second fault means server forfeits serve. This resets every new service point attempt.
* If any serve is wide, the server forfeits the serve.
* If server swings and fails to contact ball, the server forfeits the serve.
* If served ball hits the ground before hitting the wall, server forfeits the serve.
* Server’s partner must remain outside sideline in between service line and short line until the served ball crosses the short line.
RECEIVING SERVE
* Receiver must hit the ball before it bounces twice.
* Receiver must wait until ball crosses service line before returning serve.
* Receiver may hit ball before it bounces.
* If the server crosses their body with a serve, or if the served ball bounces within one foot of the server, a block may be called by receiver, and point is replayed.
GAME PLAY
* If struck ball hits the striker or partner, they forfeit the point.
* Until the ball is struck or bounces twice, player(s) can swing any number of times.
* After hit, ball must hit the wall before it hits the floor.
* Off wall, ball may be returned without bouncing.
* Opponent(s) MAY NOT hinder striker by moving during the strikers swing if they are between striker and wall. If they do, opponents forfeit point to striking team. They may move if they are behind striker, and not impairing the striker's ability to return the ball.
* If striking player lets the ball touch any part of their body, it’s out against them.
* If struck ball will hit wall before bouncing, but hits opponent first, play is stopped and point is replayed.
* If struck ball WILL NOT hit wall before bouncing, but hits opponent, striker forfeits point.
* If strikers paddle contacts opponent on forward motion, striker forfeits point.
* If strikers paddle contacts opponent on backswing, point is replayed.
* The ball is in play until it bounces twice.
* If paddle is dropped during play, that player forfeits point.
* Player can call Safety out of fear or injuring opponent with ball or paddle. To call safety, you MUST be able to return ball, and immediately call out "block" or "safety". Any needless Safety is a penalty.
* If the ball breaks, play stops and the point is played over again.  Ball’s played over if it hits either a foreign object or if a foreign object enters court.

A referee is not necessary in this particular game. It can be played liked gentlemen, with mutual or compromised agreements amongst the players.

==Additional Rules for Single Play==
Server can serve anywhere within service box and must serve to major area of the court
Major Area:  Where the server begins serve. If the ball lands anywhere outside the major area, it’s out.
Serving from middle, server must declare with side of court being served into.
Serving into a minor area must be declared or it’s a fault.

'''Plant City Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Plant City, Florida]] with a capacity of about 6,000. It was built in 1988 as the new [[spring training]] home of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], who had previously trained at [[Al Lopez Field]] in nearby [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] for many years. In 1998, the Reds left Plant City for [[Ed Smith Stadium]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. After the departure of the Reds, Plant City Stadium mainly hosted local amateur baseball and softball games.

In 2012, the stadium became the home pitch for several VisionPro Institute developmental soccer teams, including [[VSI Tampa Bay FC]] of [[USL Pro]], [[VSI Tampa Bay FC (PDL)|VSI Tampa Bay FC]] of the [[USL Premier Development League]], and [[VSI Tampa Bay FC (W-League)|VSI Tampa Bay FC]] of the [[USL W-League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2013/03/brn_soccer032913_10532812_8col.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Propel Water''' is a brand of flavored [[bottled water]] that is advertised for having [[antioxidant]]s and [[vitamin]]s. It is a beverage product of [[Gatorade]] and is marketed by [[PepsiCo]].

==Ingredients==
The water often contains, along with water, citric acid, sodium hexametaphosphate, natural flavor, potassium sorbate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), sucralose, sodium citrate, potassium citrate, acesulfame potassium, niacinamide (vitamin B3), calcium disodium edta, vitamin E acetate, calcium pantothenate (vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/Home/Product?formula=93503%2A01%2A08-01&amp;form=RTD&amp;size=20|title=Official Site for PepsiCo Beverage Information&amp;nbsp;— Product|work=pepsicobeveragefacts.com|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Propel Fitness Water was introduced in 2000 by the company Pepsico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/dining/15water.html|title=Must Be Something In the Water|first=Julia|last=Moskin|date=15 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, [[Gatorade]] introduced Propel Calcium to market. In summer of 2006, Gatorade introduced Propel powder packets, a dry powder mix of Propel, where the contents of a powder packet are added to a 500 mL (16.9&amp;nbsp;oz) bottle of water.  Propel powder with Calcium launched in January 2010.
In early 2009, Gatorade changed the bottle design. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The packaging claims that the bottles contain 20% less plastic than their predecessors.  Propel's logo remains the same, but the words "Fitness Water" have been removed from the packaging,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} leaving the only description as "Vitamin Enhanced Water Beverage".

In early 2011, Gatorade announced it was discontinuing production of regular Propel (Sucrose &amp; artificial sweeteners base) in favor of an artificially sweetened variety: "Propel Zero".{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Current flavors==
Propel is available in 12 ready-to-drink, 9 powdered, and 3 calcium branded flavors.

The '''St. Moritz Ice Rink''' was a popular ice rink housed in a grand venue on The Esplanade, [[St. Kilda, Victoria]], which operated between 1939–1981. As one of only two ice rinks in Melbourne in the 40s and 50s, it played a central role to the sport of [[ice hockey]] in Australia. Closed in 1982, it soon suffered a major fire and was then demolished, an event later seen as a major blow to the heritage of St Kilda.

== History ==
The St. Moritz was first built as the '''Wattle Path Palais de Danse''' in 1922, one of the world's largest [[dance hall]]s, designed by architects [[Isidor Beaver|Beaver]] &amp; [[Arthur Purnell|Purnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article244026751 |title=NEW DANCING PALAIS FOR ST.

In 1933, the building became a [[film studio]], '''Efftee Studios''', for [[Frank W. Thring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11724953 |title=Making Films at St. Kilda. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1933 |accessdate=15 December 2015 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made some half-dozen movies in the cavernous building before abandoning the project in 1937.

In 1939, businessman Henry Hans "Harry" Kleiner and his wife &lt;!-- not Josephine, she died 24 September 1932--&gt; transformed the "Wattle Path" to an ice rink, and the St. Moritz was born. 

The grand opening of the '''St. Moritz Ice-skating Palais''' (its original name) was on Friday 10 March, 1939. The arrival of celebrities to the opening was announced on the radio station [[Magic 1278|3XY]] and commentary about the interior and events was provided by '''Norman Banks''' of the radio station [[Gold 104.3|3KZ]]. The cost of entry to the official opening of the St. Moritz Ice Rink was 5 shillings, which was inclusive of tax as well as skate hire for the night for over 2000 people that attended.&lt;ref name="Opening"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page612402?zoomLevel=1|title=It Opens To-night the Worlds Most Beautiful Ice Rink – the "St. Moritz"|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |date=10 March 1939 |accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Kilda mayor, Councillor E. C. Mitty, formally opened the new ice skating rink.&lt;ref name="DayAfterOpening"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page612421?zoomLevel=3|title=Ice Skating at St. Kilda. St. Moritz Opened|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |date=11 March 1939 |accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kleiners were sole proprietors until 1953, when they sold the business to J. Gordon and T. Molony, both champion skaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205714412 |title=Skating Rink Changes Hands. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |date=4 March 1953 |accessdate=15 December 2015 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The St. Moritz rink operated for over forty years, but in the 1970s trade declined in the face of competition from newer venues in the suburbs as well as roller skating and discotheques. In 1980 it was sold to developers Hudson Conway and trucking magnate [[Lindsay Fox]] (who had grown up in St Kilda and played ice hockey in the venue), but continued to operate, closing suddenly in early 1982, amid fears for its future. It was then nominated to the Historic Buildings Preservation Council, but a majority of City of St Kilda councillors voted to oppose this action and uphold a demolition permit already issued. The building infamously suffered a fire later that year, leaving only the facades, which were demolished soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longmire|first1=Anne|title=St. Kilda : The Show Goes On : The History of St. Kilda|date=1989|publisher=City of St Kilda|isbn=0949873268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site remained vacant until about 1990, when a hotel was constructed. Two neon signs of skating girls were rescued from the facade by local identity Tom Ingram, one of which was re-erected within the cafe of the hotel, then covered over, rediscovered in 2005, and then donated to the St Kilda Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=She lit up lives, but Skating Girl was all ice|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;kw=st+moritz+and+st+kilda&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=AGE090327E01US6P4S4O|accessdate=21 July 2017|publisher=The Age|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That hotel was mooted to be itself replaced by apartments in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh plans for St Kilda Novotel site|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/fresh-plans-for-st-kilda-novotel-hotel-site-20170127-gtzsfd.html|accessdate=21 July 2017|publisher=The Age|date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Ice Hockey==
The Australian prime minister at the time, [[Robert Menzies]] advised that, despite the [[Military history of Australia during World War II|declaration of war]], sport should go on, and the Victorian Ice Hockey Association made the decision to continue ice hockey with inter-rink competitions between the [[Melbourne Glaciarium]] and St. Moritz Ice Rink teams. The '''St. Moritz Bombers''' won the first 3 games. There was also inter-team competition between the Rhodes Motor Co. '''Topliners''' and Foy's '''Gibsonia Fliers'''.&lt;ref name="1940KeepHockeyGoing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article188807935 |title=Ice Hockey Games |newspaper=Sporting Globe|date=19 June 1940 |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 1946===
A highlight moment for inter-state [[ice hockey]] happened during the annual tournament, where Victoria and New South Wales faced each other for the [[Goodall Cup]] in a best-of-three style tournament. The series ended with a tie, making this the second time that the [[Goodall Cup]] was not awarded to a winning team, rather it was retained by the previous years champion team. This series also saw a record attendance of 5000 spectators for the final game of the series.&lt;ref name="Game2in1946Goals"&gt;{{cite news|url=

5 August 1946 was the second game in the inter state series between New South Wales and Victoria, where Victoria defeated New South Wales 2-1&lt;ref name="Game2in1946"&gt;{{cite news|url=

&lt;br&gt; 
The goals were scored by&lt;ref name="Game2in1946Goals"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

7 August 1946 was the third game of the interstate ice hockey series for the [[Goodall Cup]] between Victoria and New South Wales held at the St. Moritz Ice Rink. The night saw a record crowd of 5000 spectators fill the venue to watch the thrilling final end in a 2-2 tie.&lt;ref name="Game2in1946Goals"/&gt;

The goals were scored by&lt;ref name="Game2in1946Goals"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
'''New South Wales''' – Jim Brown, F. Terger ; '''Victoria''' – Nichol (2)

The proprietors of the St. Moritz rink granted ice time to the [[Victorian Ice Hockey Association]], free of charge to run a Lightning premiership for 8 B grade teams on 9 July 1954. All proceeds for the matches would go to the hockey association for the betterment and growth of the sport in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="FreeIceTime1954"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23423532|title=Lightning Title |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|date=5 July 1954 |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stafford Speedway is a [[NASCAR]] [[Whelen All-American Series]] sanctioned track with NASCAR weekly racing every Friday night May through September. This track is known as the home of the SK Modifieds and drivers such as [[Ryan Preece]] and [[Ted Christopher]].

Notable events include the NAPA Auto Parts Spring Sizzler (April 29th &amp; 30th), NAPA SK 5K (June 29th), and NAPA Fall Final (September 29th &amp; 30th). 

==History==
	
Originally known as the Stafford Springs Agricultural Park, the facility was used as a half-mile horse racing facility up to the end of World War II when it switched to automobile racing.  The facility became a [[NASCAR]] track in 1959 as a dirt track, under the ownership of Rockville auto dealer Mal Barlow.  It was purchased by the Arute brothers, Chuck and Jack Arute in 1967, and later paved.  Jack's son Mark Arute continues to own and manage the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://localracing.nascar.com/nwmt_advance_092512_Analyzing%20The_CARQUEST_Fall_Final_At_Stafford|title=Whelen Modified Tour Stat Advance: Stafford - NASCAR Home Tracks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tiger Town''''' is a 1983 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[sports film|sports]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] and is the first television film produced for the [[Disney Channel]]. It was awarded a [[CableACE Award]] in 1984 for Best Dramatic Film. The film stars [[Roy Scheider]] as Billy Young, an ageing [[baseball]] player for the [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Justin Henry]] as Alex, a young fan who believes in him. ''Tiger Town'' originally aired October 9, 1983 on the [[Disney Channel]].

The film was written and directed by Detroit native [[Alan Shapiro (director)|Alan Shapiro]] and executive produced by [[Susan B. Landau]].&lt;ref name=dline&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Evans |title=Susan B. Landau Dies: ‘Cool Runnings’ Producer Was 65 |url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/susan-landau-dies-cool-runnings-producer-obituary-1202109258/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher= |date=2017-06-07 |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#1980s|Disney Sunday Movie]]'', and had a limited theatrical release in the Detroit area in June 1984, the same year the Tigers won the World Series at home against the [[San Diego Padres]].

Most of the film was shot on location at Tiger Stadium and in the city of [[Detroit]]. One notable goof in the film shows Alex racing his bicycle across a bridge over the [[Detroit River]] on the way to the stadium.  The bridge is the one leading from the Detroit mainland to [[Belle Isle Park]], an island park where there is no residential area.

==Plot description==
Alex (Henry) and his father ([[Ron McLarty]]) are devoted Detroit Tigers fans, even now as they are struggling.  Alex's favorite player is aging star Billy Young (Scheider), who is having a sub-par season, his last before retiring.

Alex's father dies unexpectedly, but not before he tells Alex that he should always believe.  Consequently, Alex decides to visit every Tiger home game.  Every time Young comes to the plate, Alex closes his eyes and wishes hard, and Young ends up hitting a home run.  Thanks to Young's rejuvenated play, the Tigers start winning again.

But there is a price.  Alex, who now believes that if he doesn't go to the games, the team will lose (explaining the Tigers' pitiful road trips); finds himself the subject of ridicule by classmates, since he often sneaks out of school early to watch the Tigers play.  Nevertheless, thanks to Billy Young, the Tigers claw their way back into the pennant race.  The final game of the season, against the [[Baltimore Orioles]], would decide the pennant.

Alex has his ticket and school lets out early so kids can watch the game, but as Alex leaves school, he is detained by  a gang of bullies who take his ticket and his money.  Only when Alex gets his principal's attention is he released and forced to run all the way to [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].  Bribing a little girl for her bike and hanging onto the back of a city bus gets Alex to the stadium in time for the ninth inning, where Young is up and the Tigers are trailing.  Young makes contact with the ball just as Alex gets to the front of the stadium aisle, and Young ends up clearing the bases, giving the Tigers the pennant.

==Cameos==
Several Detroit broadcasters and celebrities appear as themselves in the movie.  Tiger manager [[Sparky Anderson]], who was managing the team in real life, appears frequently in the movie. [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], a former [[The Supremes|Supreme]], sings the national anthem before the final game. Also appearing are [[Ernie Harwell]], the legendary play-by-play radio voice of the Tigers; [[Ray Lane (sportsman)|Ray Lane]], as Ernie's partner; and [[Al Ackerman]] as a TV sportscaster. Harwell and Lane were paired in the radio booth calling games on [[WJR]] radio from 1967 to 1972. Ackerman was a sports anchor for Detroit's [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WDIV-TV]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">Produced by [[Fuego y Agua Events LLC]], '''Ultramaratón Fuego y Agua''' is an extremely challenging set of foot races on [[Isla de Ometepe]] in [[Nicaragua]]. The race is composed of four different event options, the 25k, 50k  [[ultramarathon]] 100k [[ultramarathon]] and the Application only 70k obstacle course. The 100k course is a single loop encompassing most of the island and involves the ascent and descent of both volcanoes. The 25k and 50k courses cover part of the 100k course. The course changes every year and is a surprise. Because of the volcanoes, the island holds several [[microclimate]]s of jungle, dry tropics, tropical beach, and [[cloud forest]]. The race course winds through singletrack, dirt road and sand as it passes towns, villages, coffee, [[cocoa bean]] and [[banana plantation]]s, cloud forest, volcanic trail and white sand beaches. The race begins with a pre-race meal the night before and ends with a post-race awards banquet.

==Mission statement==

The mission of Ultramaratón Fuego y Agua is to bring responsible [[ecotourism]] to [[Isla de Ometepe]] in the form of challenging and exciting jungle races. Our purpose for the race is to bring an event that gives back to the island without taking anything more than beautiful memories and experiences.

The word [[ecotourism]] is a form of tourism that appeals to the ecologically and socially conscious individuals. Generally speaking, ecotourism focuses on volunteering, personal growth, and learning new ways to live on the planet; typically involving travel to destinations where flora, fauna, and cultural heritage are the primary attractions.

By using local guides, local food preparation, locally owned hotels and businesses, to name just a few, Ultramaratón Fuego y Agua hopes to boost the local economy and promote sustainable events on the island. Finishers trophies and winners prizes are locally crafted and produced by island artisans.

Runners and volunteers are encouraged to participate in the annual Isla Limpia Pre-Race Trash Pickup. This organized effort promotes local awareness of the island as a natural resource that must be preserved and maintained.

Portions of race entry costs and donations are used to host Calzado Kids Run, a children’s race for local islanders. The children’s race promotes running, fitness, healthy eating and awareness of the island as an endangered environment that must be cared for. All participants of Calzado Kids Run receive a pair of running shoes donated by supporters and participants of Ultramaratón Fuego y Agua.

The '''Vine Cricket Ground''', also known as '''Sevenoaks Vine''', is one of the oldest [[cricket]] venues in England. It was given to the town of [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]] in 1773 by [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] (1745 – 1799) and owner of nearby [[Knole House]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://svcc1734.org/info/history/brief-history/ A Brief History of SVCC and Cricket on Sevenoaks Vine], Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club.

==Cricket history==
The Vine is one of the oldest cricket venues in the world.&lt;ref name=times8aug55 /&gt; Its earliest known use was for a match between a [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent team]] organised by [[Lord John Sackville]] against [[Sussex county cricket teams|one from Sussex]] on Friday 6 September 1734, a game which Kent won.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[H T Waghorn|Waghorn HT]], ''Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730-1773)'', Blackwood, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; A fixture was played to mark the bicentenary of the occasion in 1934.&lt;ref name=times23jul34&gt;Sevenoaks Vine Festival, ''[[The Times]]'', issue 46813, 1934-07-23, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sevenoaks Vine was a venue for [[First-class cricket|top class cricket matches]] in the 18th century and is notable for being the first place in England where cricket was played with three stumps rather than two.  A total of 24 matches which were given retrospective first-class cricket status were played on the ground between 1773 and 1829. These include nine matches between [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire sides]] and England and 11 matches featuring Kent sides as the home team.&lt;ref name=cafc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/726_f.html First-class matches played on The Vine, Sevenoaks], CricketArhive. Retrieved 2017-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded century in any form of cricket was scored on the ground in 1769, [[John Minshull]] scoring 107 runs for a Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham.&lt;ref name=ci12may04&gt;Liverman D, Griffiths P (2004) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/138524.html From Minshull to Collins], [[CricInfo]], 2004-05-12.

Retrieved 2017-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minshull, a professional employed as a gardener by John Sackville, went on to be the first player known to be given out [[hit wicket]], again at The Vine, in 1773.&lt;ref name=ci4apr09 /&gt; 

The world record for the highest known individual score in a top-class match was twice established at the Vine. First [[Joseph Miller (cricketer)|Joseph Miller]], playing for a Kent team against one from Hampshire in August 1774, made 95 runs out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs.&lt;ref name=ci /&gt;&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth|Haygarth A]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826, Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in June 1777, came one of the most significant innings of cricket's early history when [[James Aylward (cricketer)|James Aylward]] scored a record 167 for a Hampshire side against an England XI.&lt;ref name=ci /&gt; In a contemporary report, it is stated that: "Aylward went in at 5 o’clock on Wednesday afternoon, and was not out till after three on Friday".&lt;ref name=quote&gt;Quoted by [[Arthur Haygarth|Haygarth]] from a notice concerning the match, noted at [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/35.html England v Hampshire], CricketArchive.

The last use of the Vine for a top-class match was in 1829.&lt;ref name=times8aug55 /&gt; The Vine was used by [[Kent County Cricket Club]]'s Second XI for three [[Minor Counties Championship]] matches between 1952 and 1958 and by [[Kent Women cricket team|Kent Women]] between 1949 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/726_minc.html Minor Counties Championship matches played on The Vine, Sevenoaks], CricketArchive.
