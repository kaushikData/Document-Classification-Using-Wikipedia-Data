The arc converter used an [[electric arc]] to convert [[direct current]] electricity into [[radio frequency]] [[alternating current]]. It was used as a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]] from 1903 until the 1920s when it was replaced by [[vacuum tube]] transmitters. One of the first transmitters that could generate [[continuous wave|continuous sinusoidal waves]], it was one of the first technologies used to transmit sound ([[amplitude modulation]]) by radio. It is on the [[list of IEEE Milestones]] as a historic achievement in [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Poulsen-Arc_Radio_Transmitter,_1902 |title=Milestones:Poulsen-Arc Radio Transmitter, 1902 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Poulsen's first arc converter.jpg|thumb|Poulsen's first arc converter, from 1903]]
[[Elihu Thomson]] discovered that a carbon arc shunted with a series tuned circuit would "sing". This "singing arc" was probably limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name="Little 1921 125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Little|1921|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this ref partially contradicts statements below. Some Google sources say Duddell patented the "singing arc" --&gt; Bureau of Standards credits William Duddell with the shunt resonant circuit around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English engineer [[William Duddell]] discovered how to make a [[resonant circuit]] using a [[carbon arc lamp]]. Duddell's "musical arc" operated at [[audio frequencies]], and Duddell himself concluded that it was impossible to make the arc oscillate at [[radio frequencies]].

[[Valdemar Poulsen]] succeeded in raising the efficiency and [[frequency]] to the desired level. Poulsen's arc could generate frequencies of up to 200&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|kilohertz]] and was patented in 1903.

After a few years of development the arc [[technology]] was transferred to [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]] in 1906 by Poulsen, his collaborator [[Peder Oluf Pedersen]] and their financial backers. In 1909 the American patents as well as a few arc converters were bought by [[Cyril Frank Elwell]]. The subsequent development in Europe and the [[United States]] was rather different, since in [[Europe]] there were severe difficulties for many years implementing the Poulsen technology, whereas in the United States an extended commercial [[Telegraphy|radiotelegraph]] system was soon established with the [[Federal Telegraph Company]]. Later the [[US Navy]] also adopted the Poulsen system. Only the arc converter with passive frequency conversion was suitable for portable and maritime use. This made it the most important [[mobile radio]] system for about a decade until it was superseded by [[vacuum tube]] systems.

In 1922, the [[NIST|Bureau of Standards]] stated, "the arc is the most widely used transmitting apparatus for high-power, long-distance work. It is estimated that the arc is now responsible for 80 per cent of all the energy actually radiated into space for radio purposes during a given time, leaving amateur stations out of consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This new, more-refined method for generating continuous-wave radio signals was initially developed by Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. The [[spark-gap transmitter]]s in use at that time produced [[damped wave]] which wasted a large portion of their radiated power transmitting strong harmonics on multiple frequencies that filled the RF spectrum with interference. [[Valdemar Poulsen|Poulsen’s]] arc converter produced undamped or [[continuous wave]]s (CW) on a single frequency.

There are three types for an arc oscillator:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|pp=404–405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Duddell arc (and other early types): In the first type of arc oscillator, the AC current in the condenser {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is much smaller than the DC supply current {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the arc is never extinguished during an output cycle. The Duddell arc is an example of the first type, but the first type is not practical for RF transmitters.

;Poulsen arc: In the second type of arc oscillator, the condenser AC discharge current is large enough to extinguish the arc but not large enough to restart the arc in the opposite direction. This second type is the Poulsen arc.

;Quenched spark gap: In the third type of arc oscillator, the arc extinguishes but may reignite when the condenser current reverses. The third case is a quenched spark gap and produces damped oscillations.

[[continuous wave|Continuous]] or ‘undamped’ waves (CW) were an important feature, since the use of [[damped wave]]s from [[spark-gap transmitter]]s resulted in lower transmitter efficiency and communications effectiveness, while polluting the RF spectrum with interference.

[[Image:Poulsen arc converter circuit.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Circuit of basic arc converter, from Poulsen's 1904 paper (labels added).]]
The Poulsen arc converter had a [[tuned circuit]] connected across the arc. The arc converter consisted of a chamber in which the arc burned in [[hydrogen]] gas between a [[carbon]] [[cathode]] and a water-cooled [[copper]] [[anode]]. Above and below this chamber there were two series [[field coil]]s surrounding and energizing the two poles of the magnetic circuit. These poles projected into the chamber, one on each side of the arc to provide a [[magnetic field]].

It was most successful when operated in the frequency range of a few [[kilohertz]] to a few tens of kilohertz. The [[Antenna tuner|antenna tuning]] had to be selective enough to suppress the arc converter's [[harmonic]]s.

==Keying==

Since the arc took some time to strike and operate in a stable fashion, normal [[on-off keying]] could not be used. Instead, a form of [[frequency shift keying]] was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|pp=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ''compensation-wave method'', the arc operated continuously, and the key altered the frequency of the arc by one to five percent. The signal at the unwanted frequency was called the ''compensation-wave''. In arc transmitters up to 70&amp;nbsp;kW, the key typically shorted out a few turns in the antenna coil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|loc=figure 228}}. The series resonant tuned circuit would be the antenna coil in series with the antenna.&lt;/ref&gt; For larger arcs, the arc output would be transformer coupled to the antenna inductor, and the key would short out a few bottom turns of the grounded secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|loc=figure 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the "mark" (key closed) was sent at one frequency, and the "space" (key open) at another frequency. If these frequencies were far enough apart, and the receiving station's [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] had adequate [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], the receiving station would hear standard CW when tuned to the "mark" frequency.

The compensation wave method used a lot of spectrum bandwidth. It not only transmitted on the two intended frequencies, but also the harmonics of those frequencies. Arc converters are rich in harmonics. Sometime around 1921, the Preliminary International Communications Conference&lt;ref&gt;Possibly the Preliminary International Conference on Electrical Communications, 1920; see https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/043.html at 43.2.11&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited the compensation wave method because it caused too much interference.&lt;ref name="Little 1921 125"/&gt;

The need for the emission of signals at two different frequencies was eliminated by the development of ''uniwave methods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|pp=416–419}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one uniwave method, called the ''ignition method'', keying would start and stop the arc. The arc chamber would have a ''striker'' rod that shorted out the two electrodes through a resistor and extinguished the arc. The key would energize an electromagnet that would move the striker and reignite the arc. For this method to work, the arc chamber had to be hot. The method was feasible for arc converters up to about 5&amp;nbsp;kW.

The second uniwave method is the ''absorption method'', and it involves two tuned circuits and a [[Contact terminology|single-pole, double-throw]], make-before-break key. When the key is down, the arc is connected to the tuned antenna coil and antenna. When the key is up, the arc is connected to a tuned [[dummy antenna]] called the ''back shunt''. The back shunt was a second tuned circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor, and load resistor in series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|loc=figure 229-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eaton|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second circuit is tuned to roughly the same frequency as the transmitted frequency; it keeps the arc running, and it absorbs the transmitter power. The absorption method is apparently due to W. A. Eaton.&lt;ref name="Little 1921 125"/&gt;

The design of switching circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts must have some form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each relay contact was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but there was a lot of attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eaton|1921|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Arrastra''' (or Arastra) is a primitive [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver [[ore]]. The simplest form of the arrastra is two or more flat-bottomed drag stones placed in a circular pit paved with flat stones, and connected to a center post by a long arm. With a horse, mule or human providing power at the other end of the arm, the stones were dragged slowly around in a circle, crushing the ore.&lt;ref name=JSIA&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Van Bueren |first=Thad M. |date=2004 |title=The 'Poor Man's Mill': A Rich Vernacular Legacy |journal=[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=5–23 |jstor=40968663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrastra&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.grovelandmuseum.org/Arrastra.html |title=Gentry Gulch Arrastra |publisher=Groveland Yosemite Gateway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some arrastras were  powered by a [[water wheel]]; a few were powered by steam or gasoline engines, and even electricity.&lt;ref name=JSIA/&gt;

Arrastras were widely used throughout the [[Mediterranean region]] since [[Phoenicia]]n times.&lt;ref name=JSIA/&gt; The [[Spain|Spanish]] introduced the arrastra to the [[New World]] in the 16th century. The word "arrastra" comes from the [[Spanish language]] ''arrastre,'' meaning to drag along the ground.&lt;ref name=Arrastra/&gt; Arrastras were suitable for use in small or remote mines, since they could be built from local materials and required little [[investment capital]].&lt;ref name=Arrastra/&gt;&lt;ref name=What&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/~rcooke/rastra.html |title=What is an Arrastra? |last=Cooke |first=Ron |website=Plumas County Adventures |publisher=California State University-Chico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For gold ore, the gold was typically recovered by [[Amalgam (chemistry)#Use in mining|amalgamation]] with quicksilver. The miner would add clean [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to the ground ore, continue grinding, rinse out the fines, then add more ore and repeat the process. At cleanup, the gold amalgam was carefully recovered from the low places and crevices in the arrastra floor. The amalgam was then heated in a [[Amalgam (chemistry)#Gold extraction (retorting)|distillation retort]] to recover the [[gold]], and the mercury was saved for reuse.&lt;ref name=What/&gt;

For silver ore, the [[patio process]], invented in Mexico in 1554, was generally used to recover the [[silver]] from ore ground in the arrastra.

==AskWiki==
AskMeNow signed a partnership agreement with the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to bring natural language processing to [[English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="AskMeNow-Nov-2007-10QSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/971/0001144204-07-062666.pdf |title=AskMeNow, Form 10QSB, Filing Date Nov 16, 2007 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The beta product, AskWiki, integrated some of the semantic web and natural language features of AskMeNow into English Wikipedia searches. The AskWiki engine was able to parse natural language statements and return specific answers rather than just relevant articles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webmonkey.com/2007/11/askwiki_wikipedia_knows_what_you_re_thinking/&lt;/ref&gt;  The contract between AskMeNow and Wikimedia was rescinded after [[Jimmy Wales]] announced his own for profit search engine named [[Wikia]].

In [[pyrotechnics]], '''black match''' is a type of crude [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]], constructed of [[cotton]] string fibers intimately coated with a dried [[black powder]] slurry.

When black match is [[wikt:confinement|confined]] in a paper tube, called '''quick match''' or '''piped match''', the flame front propagates much more quickly, many feet per second.

Quick match is often used in [[model rocket]]s in the United Kingdom to ignite multiple engines/motors; it is however largely unavailable in the USA due to ambiguous explosives laws.

'''Canadian Patents and Development Limited (CPDL)''' was a Canadian agency tasked with promoting the commercialization of inventions and discoveries arising from government departments and agencies, as well as those disclosed to it by universities and others publicly funded organizations. [[National Research Council (Canada)|The National Research Council of Canada (NRC)]] founded CPDL on October 24, 1947, as a subsidiary [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown Corporation]] under part 1 of the Canadian Companies Act (now Canadian Corporations Act). As a subsidiary of the NRC, CPDL was charged with handling the assessment, patenting, development, and licensing of the intellectual property developed by the scientific workers of the NRC. Soon after its incorporation, CPDL began making its services available to Canadian universities and other publicly financed organizations. The number of Canadian agencies and departments reporting inventions to CPDL increased substantially in 1954 with the enactment of the Public Servants' Inventions Act, which made CPDL eligible to accept and manage the inventions arising from all federal departments and agencies. Despite its broad mandate and many agreements, CPDL was noted by university administrators as possessing inadequate resources to effectively manage inventions for all of Canada's universities,&lt;ref&gt;Patent Committee Meeting Minutes, December 11, 1975, University of Toronto Archives and Records Management Services, A2004-007, box 010, file Polanyi.&lt;/ref&gt; while the industry consensus "was that CPDL's work was under-publicized, under-supported, undersold and under-followed-up."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew H. Wilson, "Background to Invention : A Summary of Views On the Canadian Patent System and On Industrial Research and Development Activities in Canada," Background Study for the Science Council of Canada, Special Study No. 11. (Ottawa : Science Council of Canada, 1973), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 20, 1990, the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] announced the planned dissolution of CPDL as part of a larger government commitment to reducing the size of government and improving the efficiency of public services. A few months later, the Crown Corporation Dissolution or Transfer Authorization Bill (Bill C-73) was introduced to parliament to facilitate the closure of several crown corporations and the transfer of their responsibilities. The bill authorized the [[Minister of Industry, Science and Technology (Canada)|Minister of Industry, Science, and Technology]] to dissolve CPDL, and made government departments and agencies responsible for managing their own intellectual property. Following the Crown Corporation Dissolution or Transfer Authorization Bill, all CPDL agreements with Canadian universities were terminated, and all patented faculty inventions held by CPDL were transferred back to each respective university. On August 1, 1993 CPDL ceased all operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">An ideal '''constant-force spring''' is a [[spring (device)|spring]] for which the [[force]] it exerts over its range of motion is a constant, that is, it does not obey [[Hooke's law]]. In reality, "constant-force springs" do not provide a truly constant force and are constructed from materials which do obey Hooke's law.
Generally constant-force springs are constructed as a rolled ribbon of [[spring steel]] such that the spring is in a rolled up form when relaxed.

The approximation of "constant force" comes from a long travel and a pre-loaded rest position, so that the initial force does not start from zero but a finite value. For relatively small variations around this initial position the force is approximately constant.

==Research and writing==
Fleisher's academic research primarily focuses on two distinct areas of business activity, business and competitive intelligence, and corporate public affairs. Fleisher's dissertation was in the area of measuring public affairs performance,&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, Craig (1991). "''Modeling the Role of Evaluation and Measurement in the Achievement of Corporate Public Affairs Management Effectiveness''" (OCLC: 28924435), 1991, Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and his research on public affairs benchmarking, performance measurement, and management is among the most cited according to [[Google Scholar]] in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Dishman, Fleisher, &amp; Knip, 2003; Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007; Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003; Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; His two books on these topics, published in 1995 and 1998 by the [[Public Affairs Council]] which is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]] were recognized as the Council's best-sellers at their time. His other major contributions in the field of corporate and public affairs are the two scholarly handbooks "The SAGE Handbook of International Corporate and Public Affairs" in 2017 and the ''Handbook of Public Affairs'' ([[SAGE Publications|Sage]], 2005) with his colleague Dr. Phil Harris from [[University of Chester]], [[United Kingdom]].

Since 2000, Fleisher is well known for his work in the area of business insights and [[competitive intelligence]], particularly in pushing for the professionalization of the field.&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He published 3 edited volumes with his [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] [[Marketing]] professorial colleague David Blenkhorn, those being ''Managing Frontiers in Competitive Intelligence'' in 2001 (Quorum Books, an imprint of the [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]),  ''Controversies in Competitive Intelligence'' published in 2003 and ''Global Business and Competitive Intelligence'' in 2005 by [[Praeger Publishers]].

The only [[Canadians|Canadian]] Winner of the international [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] Meritorious Award for his lifetime contributions to the field of competitive intelligence, he may be best known for his two books looking at analysis methods used by consultants and practitioners in applied strategy. This included ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis'' with his colleague and fellow SCIP Meritorious Award winner [[Babette Bensoussan]] [[(Prentice Hall]], 2003) and ''Business and Competitive Analysis'' also with Bensoussan, (2Ed., [[Pearson PLC]], 2015, and [[FT Press]], 2007), and "Analysis without Paralysis" (w/Bensoussan, 2nd Ed., [[FT Press]], 2015). These books provided background and application information for over 50 separate methods of understanding business phenomena and competition,&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2003; Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from popular methods like [[SWOT analysis]], financial ratio &amp; statement analysis, [[critical success factor]] analysis, issue analysis, and S-curves to less popular but no less important methods including business model analysis, linchpin analysis, and alternative competing hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;(Booknews, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; These books also address [[competitor analysis]].

==Other professional experience==
In addition to his work in academia, Fleisher has served as President of the [[Board of Directors]] of the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] ([[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA), inaugural chair of the Competitive Intelligence Foundation (Washington, DC) - an organization that he also founded and helped launch with then SCIP Executive Director Alexander Graham, President of the Canadian Council for Public Affairs Advancement, Editor of the ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', Associate Editor of the ''Journal of Public Affairs'' published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], and on the editorial boards of the ''International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning'' (Inderscience Publishers), ''Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal'', ''South African Journal of Information Management'', ''Competitive Intelligence Review'', ''Public Affairs'', and SCIP Online. He is also a long-time contributor to the Academy of Management's Social Issues in Management division, a founding member of the International Association of Business and Society, a life member of the [[International Association of Business Communicators]], an academic board member of the European Centre for Public Affairs, and a 2007 Canadian award-winning faculty advisor for the [[Golden Key International Honour Society]].

Fleisher also speaks globally on his research, having been to over two score different countries in a variety of roles ranging from key-noting conferences and meetings to serving as an authoritative panel member. He regularly shares his research and expertise to corporate groups, executive audiences, professional and trade associations, as well as government departments and officials.&lt;ref&gt;(www.uwindsor.ca/business)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About||other uses|Digital distribution}}
In the [[video game industry]], '''digital distribution''' is the process of delivering [[video game]] content as digital information, without the exchange or purchase of new physical media. This process has existed since the early 1980s, but it was only with network advancements in bandwidth capabilities in the early 2000s that digital distribution became more prominent as a method of selling games. Currently, the process is dominated by [[Digital distribution|online distribution]] over [[Internet access|broadband internet]].

To facilitate the sale of games, various video game publishers and console manufacturers have created their own platforms for digital distribution. These platforms, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], provide centralized services to purchase and download digital content for either specific [[video game console]]s or PCs. Some platforms may also serve as [[digital rights management]] systems, limiting the use of purchased items to one account.

Digital distribution of video games is becoming increasingly common, with major publishers and retailers paying more attention to digital sales, including [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[PlayStation Store]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Game (retailer)|GAME]], [[GameStop]], and others. According to study conducted by SuperData Research, the volume of digital distribution of video games worldwide was $6.2 billion per month in February 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Dave|title=Digital Games Worth $6.2 Billion a Month|url=https://wholesgame.com/news/digital-games-worth-6-2-billion-month/|website=WholesGame|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached $7.7 billion per month in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Alex|title=Digital games revenue grew by 9% worldwide|url=https://wholesgame.com/news/digital-games-revenue-grew-by-9-worldwide/|website=WholesGame|accessdate=May 31, 2017|date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1980s===
Before internet connections became widespread, there were few services for digital distribution of games, and physical media was the dominant method of delivering video games. One of the first examples of digital distribution in video games was [[GameLine]], which operated during the early 1980s. The service allowed [[Atari 2600]] owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a [[Telephone line|phone line]] to a central server and rent a video game for 5–10 days. The GameLine service was terminated during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]].

===1990s===
Only a few digital distribution services for consoles would appear in the 90s. Among them were [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Meganet]] and [[Sega Channel]], released in 1990 and 1994 respectively, providing [[Sega Genesis]] owners with access to games on demand and other services. Similar peripherals and services would be released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] ([[Satellaview]]) and the [[Nintendo 64]] ([[Nintendo 64DD#Randnet|Randnet]]) in Japan.

On PCs, digital distribution was more prevalent. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, prior to the widespread adoption of the internet, it was common for software developers to upload demos and [[shareware]] to [[Bulletin Board Systems]]. In most cases, demos or shareware releases would contain an advertisement for the full game with ordering instructions for a physical copy of the full game or software. Some developers instead used a licensing system where 'full versions' could be unlocked from the downloaded software with the purchase of a key, thereby making this method the first true digital distribution method for PC Software. Notable examples include the [[Software Creations BBS]] and [[ExecPC BBS]], both of which continue to exist today - albeit in a very different form. Bulletin Board systems however were not interconnected, and developers would have to upload their software to each site. Additionally, BBSs required users to place a telephone call with a [[modem]] to reach their system. For many users this meant incurring long distance charges. These factors contributed to a sharp decline in BBS usage in the early 1990s, coinciding with the rise of inexpensive internet providers.

In the mid 1990s, with the rise of the internet, early individual examples for digital distribution under usage of this new medium emerged, although there were no significant services for it. For instance, in 1997 the video game producer [[Cavedog]] distributed regularly additional content for the [[Real-time strategy]] [[computer game]] [[Total Annihilation]] as internet downloads via their website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010330073657/http://www.cavedog.com/totala/dwnlds_frame.html TA downloadable units] on cavedog.com (archived in the [[Internet Archive]] on March 30, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, users used the internet to distribute their own content. Without access to the [[retail]] infrastructure that would allow them to distribute this content through physical media, [[Fan labor|user-created]] content such as game [[Mods (computer gaming)|modifications]], maps or [[fan patch]]es could only be distributed online.

===2000s===
By this time, internet connections were fast and numerous enough such that digital distribution of games and other related content became viable.&lt;ref name="newell2007"/&gt;

====Consoles====
The proliferation of internet-enabled consoles allowed also additional buyable content that could be added onto full retail games, such as maps, in-game clothing, and gameplay. This type of content, called DLC ([[Downloadable content]]), become prevalent for consoles in the 2000s.

====PC====
An early innovator of the digital distribution idea on the [[Personal computer|PC]] was [[Stardock]]. In 2001 Stardock released the [[Stardock Central]] to digitally distribute and sell its own [[Personal computer|PC]] titles, followed by a service called ''Drengin.net'' with a yearly subscription pay model in summer 2003. In 2004, the subscription model was substituted by ''TotalGaming.net'' which allowed individual purchases or pay an upfront fee for tokens which allowed them to purchase games at a discount. In 2008, Stardock announced [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]] a third-generation digital distribution platform, which included independent third-party games and major publisher titles.&lt;ref name="ImpulseGoal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/38570|title=Impulse Details at Gamers with Jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was sold to [[GameStop]] in May 2011.&lt;ref name="GameStopAcquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1544860 |title=GameStop Announces Acquisition of Spawn Labs and Agreement to Acquire Impulse, Inc. |publisher=GameStop|date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JoystiqAcquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/31/gamestop-indulges-in-some-impulse-buying-no-seriously-it-bo/|title=GameStop indulges in some Impulse buying ... no seriously, it bought Impulse (and Spawn Labs) |author=Christopher Grant |work=[[Joystiq]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between 2004 and now saw the rise of many digital distribution services on PC, such as [[Amazon.com#Amazon Publishing|Amazon Digital Services]], [[GameStop]], [[Games for Windows – Live]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], [[Direct2Drive]], [[GOG.com]],  [[GamersGate]] and several more. The offered properties and policies differs significantly between the digital distribution services: e.g. while most of the digital distributors don't allow reselling of bought games, ''[[Green Man Gaming]]'' allows this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Dave|title=Green Man Gaming Causes ‘Grey Market’ Game Keys Controversy|url=https://wholesgame.com/news/green-man-gaming-causes-grey-market-game-keys-controversy/|website=WholesGame|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[Valve Corporation]] released the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform for Windows computers (later expanded to [[Mac OS]] and [[Linux]]) as a means to distribute Valve-developed video games. Steam has the speciality that customers don't buy games but instead get the right to use games, which might be revoked when a violation of the [[End-user license agreement]] is seen by Valve&lt;ref name="ownsteamgames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/01/thought-do-we-own-our-steam-games/|title=Thought: Do We Own Our Steam Games? |first=John |last=Walker |date=February 1, 2012|accessdate=July 1, 2013 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when a customer doesn't accept changes in the End-user license agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/93717-verbraucherzentrale-abmahnung-valve-steam.html | title = Verbraucherzentrale: Abmahnung für Valve und Steam | first = Annika |last=Demgen |language=german | work = [[netzwelt]] | date = September 17, 2012 | accessdate = September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/valve-accept-steam-subscriber-agreement-disable-account |title=Valve: Accept New Steam Subscriber Agreement Or Disable Your Account|date=August 5, 2012 |first=Justin |last=Alderman |accessdate=March 22, 2014 |publisher=wegotthiscovered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam began later to sell titles from independent developers and major distributors and has since become the largest PC digital distributor. By 2011, Steam has approximately 50-70% of the market for downloadable PC games, with a userbase of about 40 million accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master of Online Mayhem |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0228/technology-gabe-newell-videogames-valve-online-mayhem.html/|publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaming Bolt"&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Million Active Gamers on Steam Mark |url=http://gamingbolt.com/valve-releases-pr-steam-userbase-doubles-in-2011-big-picture-mode-coming-soon|publisher=Gaming Bolt |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26158 |title=Stardock Reveals Impulse, Steam Market Share Estimates |last=Graft |first=Kris|publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=November 21, 2009 |date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the website ''[[gog.com]]'' (formerly called ''Good Old Games'') was started, specialized in the distribution of older, classical PC games. While all the other DD services allow various forms of DRM (or even have them embedded) ''gog.com'' has a strict [[Digital rights management|non-DRM]] policy.&lt;ref name="arspreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age.ars |title=First look: GOG revives classic PC games for download age |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |first=Frank|last=Caron |date=September 9, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |quote=''[...] [Good Old Games] focuses on bringing old, time-tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desura]] was launched in 2010. The service was notable for having a strong support of the [[Mod (gaming)|modding]] community and also has an [[Open-source software|open source]] client, called ''Desurium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTA0NjI | title = Desura Game Client Is Now Open-Source | first = Michael | last = Larabel | date = January 21, 2012 | accessdate = January 21, 2012 | publisher = [[Phoronix]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], a new version of the [[Electronic Arts]] online store, was released in 2011 in order to compete with Steam and other digital distribution platforms on the PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.ea.com/common/download/download.cfm?companyid=ERTS&amp;fileid=475188&amp;filekey=6d4ea4b7-0389-4c68-964f-af21a86c5a7d&amp;filename=E3_2011_IR_Breakfast_-_6-8_-_small_file_size.pdf |title=PDF E3 2011 Investor Presentation |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===

====Mobile gaming====
{{See also| Mobile game}}
Digital distribution is the dominant method of delivering content on mobile platforms such as [[iOS]] devices and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones. Lower barriers to entry has allowed more developers to create and distribute games on these platforms, with the mobile gaming industry growing considerably as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of mobile gaming surprises big video-game developers |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/75215--rise-of-mobile-gaming-surprises-big-video-game-developers|publisher=Canadian Business |accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Console gaming====
Today, each of the current main consoles ([[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]], and [[PlayStation 4]]) has its own digital distribution platform to sell games exclusive to digital formats and digital versions of retail games. These are the [[Nintendo eShop]], [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], and [[PlayStation Store]], respectively. Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], Nintendo's [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]], and Sony's [[PlayStation Store]] all sell full retail games, along with other products, such as DLC.

== Implications ==
The main advantages of digital distribution over the previously dominant [[Video game retailer|retail]] distribution of video games include significantly reduced production, deployment, and storage costs.

Digital distribution also offers new structural possibilities for the whole [[video game industry]], which, prior to the emergence of digital media as a relevant means of distribution, was usually built around the relationship of the [[video game developer]], who produced the game, and the [[video game publisher]], who financed and organized the distribution and sale. The heightened production costs in the early 2000s made many video game publishers avoid risks and led to the rejection of many smaller-scale game development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/0,,SB110243451698593254,00#|title=Videogame Publishers Place Big Bets on Big-Budget Games|author=MARCELO PRINCE, PETER ROTH|date=December 21, 2004|accessdate=July 1, 2013|publisher=[[Wallstreet journal]] Online|quote=''The jump in development and marketing costs has made the videogame industry "enormously risk averse,[...]Publishers have largely focused on making sequels to successful titles or games based on movie or comic book characters, which are seen as less risky.

Since the 2000s, when digital distribution saw its first meaningful surge in popularity, an increasing number of [[niche market]] titles have been made available and become commercially successful, including (but not limited to) [[Remake (software)|remakes]] of classic games.&lt;ref name="monkeyislandrerelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/iphone/adventure/thesecretofmonkeyislandspecialedition/tech_info.html |title=The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition Tech Info |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/990/990254p1.html |title=E3 2009: The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition Preview |date=June 2, 2009 |first=Charles |last=Onyett |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527144404/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/990/990254p1.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new possibilities of digital distribution stimulated the creation of game titles from small video game producers like [[independent game developer]]s&lt;ref name=garr11&gt;{{cite web|title=Download distribution opening new doors for independent game developers|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|publisher=Statesman.com|date=April 17, 2011|last=Garr|first=Brian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074810/http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|archivedate=April 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuart10&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Keith|title=Back to the bedroom: how indie gaming is reviving the Britsoft spirit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/jan/26/casual-gaming-indiegames|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 8, 2012|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mod (video gaming)|modders]] (e.g. [[Garry's Mod]]&lt;ref name="garrysmod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/03/16/garrys-mod-has-sold-1-4-million-copies-garry-releases-sales-history-to-prove-it/|title=Garry’s Mod has sold 1.4 million copies, Garry releases sales history to prove it |first=Tom|last=Senior|date=March 16, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2013 |publisher=[[PCGamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which before were not commercially feasible.

===Independent game development===
{{See also| Independent video game development}}
The increasing prevalence of digital distribution has allowed independent game developers to sell and distribute their games without having to negotiate deals with publishers. No longer required to rely on conventional physical retail sales, independent developers have seen success through the sale of games that normally would not be accepted by publishers for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Download distribution opening new doors for independent game developers|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|publisher=Statesman.com|accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=April 17, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074810/http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|archivedate=April 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC and mobile platforms are the most prominent in regards to independent game distribution, with services such as [[GOG.com]], [[GamersGate]], [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] providing ways to sell games with minimal to no distribution costs. Some digital distribution platforms exist specifically for [[indie game]] distribution, such as the [[Xbox Live Indie Games]].

== Buyer advantages and disadvantages ==
Compared to physically distributed games, digital games like those offered on the Steam digital distribution service cannot be lost or destroyed, and can be redownloaded at any time. Services like Steam, [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]], and [[Xbox Live]] do not offer  ways to sell used games once they are no longer desired, even though some services like Steam do have family sharing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steam family sharing|url=http://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing|publisher=steampowered.com |accessdate=March 13, 2015|date=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also somewhat countered by frequent sales offered by these digital distributors, often allowing major savings by selling at prices below what a retailer is able to offer.

In contrast to physically distributed games, digital games can be easily purchased immediately, without leaving home. This way, gamers have immediate access to the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 reasons why players prefer digital games rather than hardcopy|url=https://codeswholesale.com/blog/4-reasons-why-players-prefer-digital-games-rather-than-hardcopy/|publisher=CodesWholesale.com |accessdate=August 4, 2016|date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dundee Cell Products''' ('''DCP''') is a biotechnology company headquartered in Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom.
The company is a bioreagents and life sciences services company which commercialises research tools for [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]] and [[cell biology]] research, and provides services in these areas to the life sciences community. The company’s key business activities include research and development of new innovative products and services, commercialization of products in-licensed from academic institutions, distribution of life sciences research products from commercial partners and supply of contract research services to both academic and pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies customers.

== History ==
Dundee Cell Products Ltd was founded in 2006 as a spinout of the internationally renowned School of Life Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/ |title=School of Life Sciences |publisher=Lifesci.dundee.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Dundee]] by Dr Paul Ajuh [https://www.geminibioscience.com/about-us] (now with [https://www.geminibioscience.com/ Gemini Biosciences] [https://www.geminibioscience.com/]) and Prof. Angus Lamond [http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/people/angus-lamond (Lamond Lab)]. Since spinout the company has maintained close interactions with researchers at the institution and a strong relationship with the University. In 2007 the company secured equity investment funding from a syndicate of [[angel investors]] to finance and expand its activities with follow up investment secured in 2009 from angel investors and the Scottish Co-investment Fund (SCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/fund-your-business/scottish-investment-bank/scif.aspx |accessdate=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106205706/https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/fund-your-business/scottish-investment-bank/scif.aspx |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The investment was secured to support the business’s growth plans. Over the last four years DCP has enjoyed significant growth in its products portfolio and turnover.

== Research and innovation ==
In the past three years, the company has developed and commercialized several new products e.g. SILAC ready to use media and has been involved in proteomics research collaborations with scientists in both academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies.  Some of these projects have been designed to investigate the effects of virus infections on cellular proteomes in order to elucidate the mechanisms and cellular pathways involved in virus–host factor interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Emmott E., Rodgers M.A., Macdonald A., McCrory S., Ajuh P., Hiscox J.A. (2010) Mol. Cell. Proteomics, 9, 1920-1936&lt;/ref&gt;  DCP has also collaborated in a [[phosphoproteomics]] project&lt;ref&gt;Wagner W., Ajuh P., Löwer J., Wessler S. (2010) Cell. Commun. Signal. 8, 28&lt;/ref&gt; designed to study the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or [[prion]] disease. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal diseases associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein to an abnormal prion protein leading to damage of brain and neural tissue. Examples of prion diseases include [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, also known as "mad cow disease") in cattle and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (CJD) in humans. There is currently no treatment for prion diseases, which are usually fatal to the host. 

Current R&amp;D projects within the company have been focused on developing applications for SILAC quantitative proteomics in predictive toxicology. These projects are designed to provide data that will be used in developing predictive models for drug toxicity early on during the drug discovery and development process.

== Portfolio ==
DCP initially developed [[antibodies]], mammalian cell fractions for [[precursor mRNA splicing]] research and tissue culture media specifically formulated for [[SILAC]] quantitative proteomics. The first products commercialized by the company came from the research interests of the founding scientists who saw an opportunity in the market for developing and commercializing high quality research products and services in the research area to other colleagues. The company has subsequently expanded its products and services portfolio into many other areas of life sciences research to better cover the needs of its customers.

=== Product lines ===
Dundee Cell Products commercializes a broad range of life sciences research products (many of which have been developed in-house) including [[cell culture]] media for quantitative proteomics, mammalian cell fractions e.g. nuclei, nucleoli, mitochondria and cell fractions for quantitative proteomics, [[antibodies]], recombinant proteins, fluorescent cell markers and primary mammalian cells. The company’s SILAC ready to use media have been specially formulated to facilitate the use of SILAC technology by non-specialists in proteomics and scientists who are interested in the application of unbiased high throughput quantitative proteomics approaches in their R&amp;D activities.

=== Research services ===
As well as offering research products, the company’s portfolio has grown to include research services designed to accelerate the research activities of scientists in both the academic and biotech/pharmaceutical industry sectors. Some of the research services that DCP offers include [[gene synthesis]], [[DNA cloning]], [[recombinant protein expression and purification]], stable cell line development, custom [[monoclonal]] and [[polyclonal antibody]] development and various proteomics services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeecellproteomics.com/ |title=Dundee Cell Proteomics |publisher=Dundee Cell Proteomics |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. both quantitative (e.g. SILAQ&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Tandem Mass Tags]], [[iTRAQ]], [[Isotope-coded affinity tag]] (ICAT), [[label-free]]) and qualitative. 
In collaboration with scientists at the University of Dundee, the company is developing novel and innovative products and services in the areas of proteomics, molecular biology and cell biology focused on the needs of research scientists in academic institutions as well as those in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.

'''Edith Clarke''' (February 10, 1883 – October 29, 1959) was the first female [[electrical engineer]] and the first female professor of electrical engineering at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite web|last=Durbin|first=John|title=In Memoriam: Edith Clarke|url=http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2000-2001/memorials/AMR/Clarke/clarke.html|work=Index of Memorial Resolutions and Biographical Sketches|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She specialized in electrical power system analysis &lt;ref name="Scanning the Past: Edith Clarke and Power System Stability"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brittain|first=James|title=Scanning the Past: Edith Clarke and Power System Stability|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=00476030|work=Proceedings of the IEEE|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote ''Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Edith|title=Circuit analysis of A-C power systems|year=1943|publisher=J. Wiley &amp; sons, inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zR4hAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Edith Clarke was born February 10, 1883, in Howard County, Maryland to John Ridgely Clarke and Susan Dorsey Owings, one of nine children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle|first=Larry|title=Edith Clarke|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/clarke.htm|work=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|publisher=[[Agnes Scott College]]|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being orphaned at age 12, she was raised by her older sister. She used her inheritance to study [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]] at [[Vassar College]], where she graduated in 1908.

After college, Clarke taught mathematics and physics at a private school in [[San Francisco]] and at [[Marshall University|Marshall College]]. She then spent some time studying [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], but left to become a "[[human computer|computer]]" at [[AT&amp;T (1885-2005)|AT&amp;T]] in 1912. She computed for [[George Ashley Campbell|George Campbell]], who applied mathematical methods to the problems of long-distance electrical transmissions. While at AT&amp;T, she studied electrical engineering at [[Columbia University]] by night.

In 1918, Clarke enrolled at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and the following year she became the first woman to earn an M.S. in electrical engineering from MIT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Charles Jr.|title=Edith Clarke|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-00295.html|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Unable to find work as an engineer, she went to work for [[General Electric]] as a supervisor of computers in the [[Turbine]] Engineering Department. During this time, she invented the Clarke calculator,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US1552113?dq=%22clarke+calculator%22+%22edith+clarke%22 Calculator, US patent 1552113 A, 1924]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1921, a simple graphical device that solved equations involving [[electric current]], [[voltage]] and [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] in [[power transmission]] lines. The device could solve line equations involving [[hyperbolic function]]s ten times faster than previous methods. She filed a patent for the calculator in 1921 and it was granted in 1925.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 1552113 | status = patent | title = Calculator |  gdate = 1925-09-01 | fdate = 1921-06-08 | pridate = 1921-06-08 | inventor = Edith Clarke | invent1 = Clarke, Edith | assign1 = Clarke, Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
In 1921, still unable to obtain a position as an engineer, she left GE to teach physics at the [[Constantinople Women's College]] in Turkey. The next year, she was re-hired by GE as an electrical engineer in the Central Station Engineering Department. Clarke retired from General Electric in 1945.

Her background in mathematics helped her achieve fame in her field. On February 8, 1926, as the first woman to deliver a paper at the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]]' annual meeting, she showed the use of hyperbolic functions for calculating the maximum power that a line could carry without instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WOMAN ADDRESSES ELECTRICAL INSTITUTE; Miss Edith Clarke the Only One of Her Sex to Read a Paper at Engineers' Meeting.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/02/09/archives/woman-addresses-electrical-institute-miss-edith-clarke-the-only-one.html|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 February 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her later papers won awards from the AIEE: the Best Regional Paper Prize in 1932 and the Best National Paper Prize in 1941.&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt;

In 1943, Edith Clarke wrote an influential textbook in the field of [[power engineering]], ''Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems'', based on her notes for lectures to GE engineers.

In 1947, she joined the faculty of the Electrical Engineering Department at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], making her the first female professor of Electrical Engineering in the country. She taught for ten years and retired in 1957.&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt;

In an interview with the Daily Texan on March 14, 1948, Clarke observed: "There is no demand for women engineers, as such, as there are for women doctors; but there's always a demand for anyone who can do a good piece of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/ |title=Pioneering Women in Computing Technology |publisher=The Ada Project|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Edith Clarke was the first female engineer to achieve professional standing in [[Tau Beta Pi]].&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt;
In 1948, Clarke was the first female Fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt; 
In 1954, she received the [[Society of Women Engineers]] Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbs|first=Amy|title=Edith Clarke|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014000/014065/html/14065bio.html|work=Biographical Series|publisher=Archives of Maryland|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Clarke was posthumously inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=NIHoF&gt;{{cite news|title=Edith Clarke |url=http://www.invent.org/media/nihf/docs/Clarke.pdf |accessdate=4 February 2015 |publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204065119/http://www.invent.org/media/nihf/docs/Clarke.pdf |archivedate=February 4, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''examination table''' (or '''exam table''') is used to support patients during [[medical examination]]s. During these exams, doctors in [[Doctor's office|offices]] ([[British English|UK]]: surgeries), [[clinic]]s and [[hospital]]s use an adjusting mechanism to manipulate and position the table to allow patient support, closer examination of a portion or the entire patient, and the ability to move the patient on and off the table safely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/physical-examination Physical Examination | Definition and Patient Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Examination tables often have rolls of paper in which patients sit on, protecting the table. The paper is normally discarded after each patient uses the table.

Examination tables have included electric motors since the 1970s. These are fitted underneath the tabletop and power cables generally detach to prevent a tripping hazard. The ability to transfer power forward and backwards using a reversible electric motor means greater mobility of the examination table.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 4057240 | y = 1977 | m = 11 | d = 08 | inventor = Damico, Frank M. and Raymond D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1657">'''GOPPAR''' is the abbreviation for '''gross operating profit per available room''', a key [[performance indicator]] for the [[hotel industry]].

It gives greater insight in the actual performance of a hotel than the most commonly used [[RevPAR]] as it not only considers [[revenue]]s generated, but also factors in operational costs related with such revenues.&lt;ref&gt;"Refining the anomalies out of RevPAR". by  Younes, E., Kett, R. : ''Hospitality Review''  8 May 2003 [http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4015061.search?query=revpar+hotel link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurements of performance and benchmarking: REVPAR, TREVPAR and GOP PAR|url=http://www.hospitalityandcateringnews.com/2012/09/measurements-of-performance-and-benchmarking-revpar-trevpar-and-gop-par/|website=Hospitality &amp; Catering News|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOPPAR is the total revenue of the hotel less expenses incurred earning that revenue, divided by the available rooms.

GOPPAR does not take into consideration the revenue mix of the hotel, so while it does not allow an accurate evaluation of the room revenue generated it demonstrates the profitability and value of the property as a whole.

==Calculation==
:&lt;math&gt;GOPPAR = Gross Operating Profit/Rooms Available \,&lt;/math&gt;
* ''GOPPAR'' is the gross operating profit per available room
* ''[[Gross Profit|Gross Operating Profit]]'' is the net revenue from the hotel after expenses
* ''Rooms Available'' are the rooms available for sale during the time period

==Biography==
Shwed was born in Jerusalem in 1968. He started programming at the age of 13, and two years later began studying computer sciences at [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem, while he was still in high-school.&lt;ref name="A Fortune In Firewalls"/&gt;

During his military service he was part of the Intelligence Corps' [[Unit 8200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/israel-military-unit-ventures-biz-cx_gk_0208israel.html |title=The Unit |publisher=Forbes |date= February 8, 2007|author= |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military service had ended, Shwed joined the Israeli startup company Optrotech (currently [[Orbotech]]), where he worked as a Software Developer.

In 1993, Shwed founded [[Check Point]] together with [[Shlomo Kramer]], Shwed’s friend from the military unit, and [[Marius Nacht]] with whom he worked at Optrotech.&lt;ref name="A Fortune In Firewalls"/&gt; 

That year, Shwed invented and patented [[stateful inspection]],&lt;ref name='scmaguk'&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Fisher |url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/sc-magazine-interviews-gil-shwed-co-founder-of-check-point/article/149389/ |title=SC Magazine interviews Gil Shwed, co-founder of Check Point |publisher=SC Magazine UK |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as the basis for the first version of the company’s renowned FireWall-1, released in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sARs520GCkC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=%22gil+shwed%22+firewall-1&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KJRQTsiLJorq0gG10KDsBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ |title=Cultural mythology and global leadership |publisher= |date= |author= |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateful Inspection is still widely used in network firewalls today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/stateful-inspection |title=What is stateful inspection? |author= |publisher=Searchnetworking.techtarget.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shwed is the chief executive officer and director of Check Point. He previously served as president of Check Point and chairman of the board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=212204&amp;privcapId=26399|title=Bloomberg Executive Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, Shwed is the leading shareholder in Checkpoint, owning 19.1% of the company, with an estimated worth of $3.4 billion USD. The second largest shareholder in Check Point is US investment company Massachusetts Financial Services Company with a 7.7% stake worth $1.3 billion at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-check-point-to-give-shwed-options-worth-$144m-1001246880|title=Check Point to give Shwed options worth $144m}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Shwed and Check Point emphasize the "fifth generation" of cybersecurity, addressing the underlying issues behind such vulnerabilities as the [[WannaCry]] and [[NotPetya]] security breaches in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="It's imperative to develop innovative, sixth-generation defenses": Check Point Founder and CEO Gil Shwed said at the opening plenary of Cybertech Tel Aviv 2018 that "fifth-generation cyber-attacks excel in identification theft, as well as in targeting cloud services and mobile systems" | first=Dan | last=Arkin | date=January 30, 2018 | work=Israel Defense | url=http://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/32863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Check Point warns of mega attacks |first=Ian | last=Murphy | date=January 25, 2018 | work=Enterprise Times| url=https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2018/01/25/check-point-warns-mega-attacks/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that enterprise businesses are "two generations behind" in their security thinking, and describes the industry as being at an "inflection point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Check Point CEO: Enterprises 'two generations behind' in cybersecurity: The average enterprise hasn't made it past app security, Gil Shwed tells conference | first=Scharon | last=Harding | date=February 9, 2018 | work=ChannelNomics | url=https://www.channelnomics.eu/channelnomics-eu/news/3026359/check-point-ceo-enterprises-two-generations-behind-in-cybersecurity }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Check Point Software CEO Gil Shwed Addresses Fifth Generation Cyber Attacks |first=Joe | last=Panettieri | date=February 7, 2018 | work=MSSP Alert | url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-news/live-blog-check-point-software-cpx-360-2018/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of [[Tel Aviv University]] and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Youth University of Tel Aviv University. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Yeholot Association Founded by the Rashi Foundation whose charter is, among other things, to reduce dropout rates in high schools.

A '''headphone amplifier''' is a low-powered [[audio amplifier]] designed particularly to drive [[headphones]] worn on or in the ears, instead of [[loudspeakers]] in [[speaker enclosure]]s. Most commonly, headphone amplifiers are found embedded in electronic devices that have a headphone jack, such as [[integrated amplifier]]s, portable music players (e.g., iPods), and televisions. However, standalone units are used, especially in audiophile markets and in professional audio applications, such as music studios. Headphone amplifiers are available in consumer-grade models used by [[hi-fi]] enthusiasts and audiophiles and professional audio models, which are used in [[recording studio]]s.

==Consumer models==
[[File:Headphone amp 6922.jpg|right|thumb|The electronics of a Musical Fidelity X-Cans, using two [[6DJ8|6922]] vacuum tubes (electronic valves)]]
Consumer '''headphone amplifiers''' are commercially available separate devices, sold to a niche [[audiophile]] market of [[hi-fi]] enthusiasts.  These devices allow for higher possible volumes and superior current capacity compared to the smaller, less expensive headphone amplifiers that are used in most audio players. In the case of the extremely high-end [[electrostatic headphones]], such as the [[Stax Earspeakers|Stax]] SR-007, a specialized electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer step-up box and power amplifier is required to use the headphones, as only a dedicated electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer can provide the voltage levels necessary to drive the headphones. Most headphone amplifiers provide [[power (physics)|power]] between 10&amp;nbsp;mW and 2 W depending on the specific [[headphone]] being used and the design of the amplifier. Certain high power designs can provide up to 6W of power into low impedance loads, although the benefit of such power output with headphones is unclear, as the few [[Headphones#Orthodynamic|orthodynamic]] headphones that have sufficiently low sensitivities to function with such power levels will reach dangerously high volume levels with such amplifiers.

Effectively, a headphone amplifier is a small [[power amplifier]] that can be connected to a standard headphone jack or the [[Line out (signal)#Line out|line output]] of an audio source.  Electrically, a headphone amplifier can be thought of as an amplifier that presents a very high [[input impedance]] (ideally infinite) and presents a lower [[output impedance]] (ideally zero) and larger range of output voltages (ideally infinite).  This allows headphones of a low sensitivity to be driven louder as a result of the extra voltage provided by the amplifier.  There are potential fidelity gains if headphones are driven with lower distortion than using a headphone amplifier integrated into a general purpose audio product.  In practice, this most often occurs when using low impedance headphones with consumer electronics with insufficiently low output impedance (see impedance discussion below).

=== Volume ===
[[Image:Hybrid-headphone-amplifier-Vincent-KHV111.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A hybrid headphone amplifier with the chassis cover removed.]]
Most headphone amplifiers support a higher voltage output and therefore higher power (volume) levels.  Whereas most portable electronics are powered by a 1.8, 2.5 or 3.3 [[Amplitude#Peak-to-peak amplitude|Vpp]] supply, many headphone amplifiers use 10, 18 or 24 Vpp supplies, allowing 5-20&amp;nbsp;dB higher volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Op Amp Measurements|url=http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/08/op-amp-measurements.html|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a pair of headphones is too quiet, adding an amplifier that can output higher voltage/power will increase its volume.

=== Output impedance ===
Many headphone amplifiers have an [[output impedance]] in the range of 0.5 - 50 Ohms.  The 1996 IEC 61938 standard recommended an output impedance of 120 Ohms, but in practice this is rarely used and not recommended with modern headphones.  High output impedance can result in frequency response fluctuations, due to varying load impedance at different frequencies.  In 2008 [[Stereophile|Stereophile Magazine]] published an article that showed that a 120-Ohm output impedance could cause a 5-dB error in frequency response with certain types of headphones. However, the author of the article also states: "The ramifications for subjective assessment of headphones are more troublesome because it is usually unclear what assumptions the manufacturer has made regarding source impedance." &lt;ref&gt;Howard 2008, p. 4. http://www.stereophile.com/features/808head/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, low output impedance can reduce distortion by improving the control that the source has over the transducer. This is often expressed as [[damping factor]], with higher damping factors greatly reducing distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasini|first=Filippo|title=What Does It Take To Turn The PC Into A Hi-Fi Audio Platform?|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/high-end-pc-audio,3733-17.html|publisher=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One company shows a 45&amp;nbsp;dB improvement in [[THD+N]] at 30&amp;nbsp;Hz for their low-impedance amplifier compared to a 30-ohm amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siau|first=John|title=The "0-Ohm" Headphone Amplifier|url=https://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/11653109-the-0-ohm-headphone-amplifier|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 32 Ω headphone driven by a headphone amp with a &lt;1 Ω output impedance would have a damping factor of &gt;32, whereas the same headphone driven with an iPod touch 3G (7 Ω output impedance) &lt;ref name=nwav_clip&gt;{{cite web|title=Sansa Clip+ Measured|url=http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/02/sansa-clip-measured.html|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would have a damping factor of just 4.6. If the 120 ohms recommendation is applied, the damping factor would be an unacceptably low 0.26 and consequently distortion would be significantly higher.  Conversely, the same iPod touch driving a pair of 120 ohm headphones would have a respectable damping factor of 17.1, and would most likely not benefit from the addition of a lower impedance headphone amplifier.

In addition to output impedance, other specifications are relevant to choosing a headphone amplifier — [[total harmonic distortion|THD]], [[frequency response]], [[Intermodulation distortion|IMD]], [[audio power|output power]], minimum load impedance, and other measurements are also significant.  However, most of these will be improved by lowering output impedance and hence improving damping factor.

=== DIY approach ===

For those who are electronically inclined, the low-power and fairly simple nature of the headphone amplifier has made it a popular [[DIY]] project. There are many designs for headphone amplifiers posted on the Internet varying considerably in complexity and cost. A key example is the simple opamp-based [[CMoy]] design, one of the most popular headphone amplifier designs available. The simplicity of the CMoy makes it an easy build, while it can be made small enough to fit inside a tin of breath mints (including batteries).  On the other hand, it is often built using op-amps that are not designed to drive loads as low as headphones, leading to poor performance and audible differences between op-amps that would not exist in a good design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/08/op-amps-myths-facts.html Op Amps: Myths &amp; Facts]- "Some op amps have been judged in the wrong applications. The Cmoy headphone amp is just such an example..."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crossfeed and other audio processing ===

[[Crossfeed]]ing blends the left and right stereo channels slightly, reducing the extreme channel separation which is characteristic of headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in a small fraction of listeners. Crossfeed also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by crossfeed, many prefer amplifiers without it.  The introduction of [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with crossfeed, the illusion of sound directionality is created.

==Professional audio models==
[[Image:Heaphone amp pro front.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Distribution headphone amp - front panel]]
[[Image:Heaphone amp pro back.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Distribution headphone amp - back panel]]
In pro-audio terminology, a headphone amplifier is a device that allows multiple headsets to be connected to one or more audio sources (typically [[balanced audio]] sources) at the same time to monitor sounds during a recording session, either singing or playing from the "live room" or recorded tracks. Headphone amps enable singers and musicians to be able to hear other musicians who are playing in isolation booths. They also enable [[audio engineer]]s and [[record producer]]s to monitor a live performance or live tracking.

'''Headphone amps with sub-mixing capabilities''' allow the listener to adjust, mix and monitor  audio signals coming from multiple sources at the same time. This kind of headphone amp is often utilized during recording sessions to sub-mix playback of individual stem-mixes or instruments coming from a mixing board or a playback device. In many cases the listeners have their own sets of controls allowing them to adjust various aspects of the mix and individual and global parameters such as channel level, global loudness, bass and treble.

'''Distribution headphone amplifiers''' are specialized headphone amps allowing a single signal to be fed to multiple headsets or multiple groups of multiple headsets at the same time. Many distribution headphone amps, like the one shown here, can be cascaded by connecting the audio input of one of the amps to the cascading output, marked "THRU", of another amp.

There are also various other combinations of pro-audio headphone amps with simultaneous sub-mixing and distribution capabilities.

'''Henry Doetsch''' (31 January 1839 - 25 May 1894) was a German born [[industrialist]] who lived in London.

He was born '''Heinrich Moritz Doetsch''' the 31 January 1839 at the "[[Burghof]]", the 17th century manor of his family in Kärlich  ([[Mülheim-Kärlich]], [[Weißenthurm]], Rheinland). Because of a lung weakness, Henry (Enrique) Doetsch went (after a short time in Liverpool) as a young man of 23 years to [[Sevilla]] in Spain, where he entered with the help of his cousin, Moritz Willmar-Doetsch from Frankfurt/Main, as volunteer a British company. A few years later he was founder of the »Firma Sundheim y Doetsch« in [[Huelva]] (1865) with his compagnon [[Guillermo Sundheim]] (1840 - 1903). In 1873 Doetsch was the director of the [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Company Limited]], (RTCL), ([[Minas de Río Tinto]]), in London and Huelva. Together with [[Hugh Matheson (industrialist)|Hugh Matheson]], chairman of the Rio Tinto Company, and Guillermo (Wilhelm) Sundheim he built up a railway line in Andalucia: The »Compañía del Ferrocarril de Zafra a Huelva«. Doetsch held a patent in Canada for an extraction process to remove copper from its ores, registered in September 1879, so he was involved in mining and production of copper in Río Tinto by the so-called »Doetsch process«. But the use of Teladas poisoned the air and many residents became ill or died. Henry Doetsch fell out with Hugh Matheson on the issue of supply of the Miners (Sundheim had left the RTCL in 1876). During an uprising of the miners in 1888 more than 100 civilians were killed by Spanish soldiers.
Doetsch left Spain in autumn 1884, after he had invited his old friend »Fred« Burnaby to spend a month at Huelva. A few weeks later Burnaby gave up all his engagements, and fared forth for the Soudan. 
The three times offered title of a »Marqués de Río Tinto« by the Spanish King [[Alfonso XII]] refused Enrique Doetsch. He was awarded the grand cross of the [[Orden de Isabel la Católica]]. For many summertimes, Doetsch has been a traveling companion of the [[Infanta Maria de la Paz]] and the [[Infanta Eulalia of Spain]]. 
Henry Doetsch was succeeded at the [[Rio Tinto Group]] by his nephew Carlos Doetsch (1870 - 1951), who married in 1902 Justita Sundheim de la Cueva, daughter of Guillermo Sundheim and Justa de la Cueva y Camporedondo. The couple with the children Mercedes and Jorge lived in Huelva and Madrid.

In London Henry Doetsch lived as a respected financier at 7 New Burlington Street. A generous host and notorious bachelor, Doetsch opened his home and Art Gallery to an interested audience. Still in Spain Henry Doetsch started to collect pictures by old masters. Staying in contact with [[Bernard Berenson]], masterpieces by great painters were gathered in the collection: Titian, Veronese, Guido Reni, Dolci, Lorenzo Lotto, Palma Vecchio, Pontormo, Bronzino, Andrea del Sarto, van Dyck, Rubens, Breughel, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Wouwerman, Clouet and Holbein. Some of the paintings came from important galleries: Orléans-Galliera, Palazzo Vendramin (Henri Duc de Bordeaux), The Collection King Charles I, Pinacotece Lochis, or from privat collections as those of the Duke of Roxburghe, the Marquis of Donegall or Conte Alborghetti. 
Doetsch's evenings at New Burlington Street were famous: Among his guests the Prince of Wales ([[Edward VII]]), [[Lord Rosebery]] and his friend [[Colonel Burnaby]]. Doetsch was a lover of black Havana cigars; he died of pneumonia on 25 May 1894 in London.

After Doetsch's death in 1894, on 22nd, 24th and 25 June 1895, his pictures of Old Masters were auctioned by [[Christie's]] (Messrs. Christie, Manson and Woods), at their offices and sale rooms at 8 King Street, [[St. James's Square]], and the sale appears to have been an enormous success. Some fine examples of paintings are now owned by H. M. the Queen and the House of Hesse at [[Kronberg]]. Henry Doetsch's career appears to have mirrored that of his countryman, [[Ludwig Mond]], but Dr. Mond is remembered through the company that bears his name (Brunner-Mond) and the Mond Room at the National Gallery in London; Doetsch is largely forgotten. An Illustrated Catalogue of the Doetsch-Collection was prepared for [[Victoria, Empress Frederick]] (1895).

A '''high-occupancy vehicle lane''' (also known as an '''HOV lane''', '''carpool lane''', '''diamond lane''', '''2+ lane''', and '''transit lane''' or '''T2 or T3 lanes''') is a restricted [[traffic lane]] reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including [[carpool]]s, [[vanpool]]s, and [[public transit|transit]] buses. These restrictions may be only imposed during at [[rush hour|peak travel times]] or may apply at all times. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other [[green vehicle]]s, and/or [[high-occupancy toll lane|single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll]].

For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Slugging|Slugging lines]] are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the HOV lane.

Effects of Changing HOV Lane occupancy requirements: El Monte Busway Case Study|author=[[Texas Transportation Institute]]|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|date=September 2002|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently being converted into a [[high-occupancy toll lane]] operation to allow low-occupancy vehicles to bid for excess capacity on the lane in the [[Metro ExpressLanes]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/expresslanes/|title=Metro Express Lanes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, the [[Urban Mass Transit Administration]] recognized the advantages of exclusive bus lanes and encouraged their funding. In the 1970s the FHWA began to allow state highway agencies to spend federal funds on HOV lanes.&lt;ref name=HistUS1/&gt; As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab Oil Embargo]], interest in [[Carpool|ridesharing]] picked up, and states began experimenting with HOV lanes. In order to reduce [[crude oil]] consumption, the 1974 [[Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act]] mandated maximum speed limits of {{convert|55|mph|abbr=on}} on public highways and became the first instance when the U.S. federal government provided funding for ridesharing and states were allowed to spend their highway funds on rideshare demonstration projects. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act made funding for rideshare initiatives permanent.&lt;ref name=HistUS2/&gt;

Also during the early 1970s, ridesharing was recommended for the first time as a tool to mitigate air quality problems. The 1970 [[Clean Air Act Amendments]] established the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] and gave the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) substantial authority to regulate air quality attainment. A final control plan for the [[Los Angeles Basin]] was issued in 1973, and one of its main provisions was a two-phase conversion of {{convert|184|mi|abbr=on}} of freeway and arterial roadway lanes to bus/carpool lanes and the development of a regional computerized carpool matching system. However, it took until 1985 before any HOV project was constructed in [[Los Angeles County]], and by 1993 there were only {{convert|58|mi|abbr=on}} of HOV lanes countywide.&lt;ref name=HistUS2/&gt;

A significant policy shift took place in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that "''FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV preferential facilities and encourages the proper application of HOV technology.''" Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities.&lt;ref name=HistUS1/&gt; Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] included HOV lanes as one of the transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state's failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds.&lt;ref name=HistUS1/&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA) of 1991 encouraged the construction of HOV lanes, which were made eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds in regions not attaining federal air quality standards. CMAQ funds may be spent on new HOV lane construction, even if the HOV designation holds only at peak travel times or in the peak direction. ISTEA also provided that under the Interstate Maintenance Program, only HOV projects would receive the 90% federal matching ratio formerly available for the addition of general purpose lanes. And ISTEA permitted state authorities to define a high occupancy vehicle as having a minimum of two occupants (HOV 2+).&lt;ref name=HistUS1/&gt;

As of 2009, California was the state with the most HOV facilities in the country, with 88, followed by [[Minnesota]] with 83 facilities, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] with 41, [[Texas]] with 35, and [[Virginia]] with 21. The only active U.S. facility with two HOV lanes in each direction is [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|I-110]] between Adams Boulevard and [[California State Route 91|SR 91]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=FHWA2/&gt; By 2006, HOV lanes in California were operating at two-thirds of their capacity, and these HOV facilities carried on average 2,518 persons per hour during peak hours, substantially more people than the congested general-traffic lanes.&lt;ref name=DefCAN/&gt;[[File:HOT Capital Beltway Panorama 5.jpg|thumb|337x337px|left|The [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495 Capital Beltway]] in the [[Washington D.C.

As of 2012, there are some 126 HOV facilities on freeways in 27 metropolitan areas in the United States, which includes over 1,000 corridor miles (1,600&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=HOVFHWA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked HOV Questions |author=Freeway Management Program, FHWA|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=2012-01-12|accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:404HOV lane.png|thumb|The HOV lanes in [[Ontario Highway 404]] in [[Southern Ontario]] are separated by a striped buffer zone that breaks occasionally to allow vehicles to enter and exit the HOV lane.]]
The first HOV facilities in Canada were opened in [[Greater Vancouver]] and [[Toronto]] in the early 1990s, followed shortly by facilities in [[Ottawa]], [[Gatineau]], [[Montreal]], and later [[Calgary]]. As of 2010 there were about {{Convert|150|km|abbr=on}} of highway HOV lanes in 11 locations in [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]], and over {{Convert|130|km|abbr=on}} of arterial HOV lanes in 24 locations in Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Gatineau.&lt;ref name="DefCAN" /&gt; The [[Ontario Ministry of Transportation]] (MTO) estimated in 2006 that commuters in Toronto using the HOV facilities on [[Ontario Highway 403|Highways 403]] and [[Ontario Highway 404|404]] were saving 14–17 minutes per trip compared to their travel time before the HOV lanes opened. The MTO also estimated that almost 40% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 eastbound in the morning peak hour, compared to 14% in 2003, and 37% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 westbound in the afternoon peak hour, compared to 22% in 2003. The average rush hour speed on the HOV lanes is {{Convert|100|kph|abbr=on}}, compared to {{Convert|60|kph|abbr=on}} in general-traffic lanes on Highway 403.&lt;ref name=DefCAN/&gt;
Temporary HOV lanes were added to selections of 400-series highways in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and [[2015 Parapan American Games]].

===Europe===
As of 2012, there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe. The main reason for this is that, in general, European cities have better [[public transport]] services and fewer high-capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada. However, at around 1.3 persons per vehicle, average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities.&lt;ref name=HOVUK&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etcproceedings.org/paper/britain-s-first-high-occupancy-vehicle-lane-the-a647-leeds|title=Britain's first high occupancy vehicle lane – the A647, Leeds|vauthors=Quinn DJ, Gilson DR, Dixon MT |publisher=ETC Proceedings|year=1998|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on-street bus priority measures.&lt;ref name=HOVEurope/&gt; The first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the [[Netherlands]] in October 1993 and operated until August 1994. Its facility was a {{Convert|7|km|abbr=on}} barrier-separated HOV 3+ on the [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]] near [[Amsterdam]]. The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a [[test case (law)|legal test case]] ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a [[car pool]] and thus that the principle of equality was violated.&lt;ref name=HOVEurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormickrankin.com/pdf/UrbanTrans2006.pdf|title=High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes – Worldwide Lessons for European Practitioners|author=S.

[[Spain]] was the next European country to introduce HOV lanes, when median reversible HOV lanes were opened in [[Madrid]]'s [[Carretera Nacional N-VI|N-VI National Highway]] in 1995. This facility is Europe's oldest HOV facility that is still in operation.&lt;ref name=HOVEurope/&gt; The first HOV facility in the [[United Kingdom]] opened in [[Leeds]] in 1998.

===Indonesia===
In Jakarta, HOV 3+ is known as "Three in One" (''Tiga dalam satu'') and was first implemented by governor [[Sutiyoso]]. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangraja Road (fast and slow lane), [[Jenderal Sudirman Road]] (fast and slow lane), MH. Thamrin Road (fast and slow lane), Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of [[TransJakarta|Jakarta's bus rapid transit]] in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am – 10:00 am and 4:00 pm – 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm – 7:00 pm.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===China===
In [[Shenzhen]], HOV 2+ has been implemented on Binhai Avenue since 25 April 2016. The policy was then extended to 7:30 am – 9:30 am and 5:30 pm – 9:30 pm.

In [[Chengdu]], from January 23, 2017, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Kehua Road South, Kehua Road Middle, and Tianfu Avenue Section 1 and 2, during 7:00 am-9: 00 am and 5:00 pm-7: 00 pm.

In [[Dalian]], an expressway (Northeast Expressway, or Dongbei Expressway) linking old town and new town had one lane in both outbound and inbound directions set to HOV 2+. Starting from September 20, 2017, commuters can opt to drive in HOV lane on Northeast Expressway during the morning peak hours of 06:30-08:30, and evening peak hours of 16:30-19:00. A fine of  CNY100 (about USD15) will be enforced for first violators. For a second violation, the fine will double.

==Design and operations==
[[File:I-24 Nashville.JPG|thumb|A "semi-HOV" lane on [[I-24]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. These lanes function as HOV lanes only on weekdays during rush hour, and as regular lanes the rest of the time. ]]
HOV lanes may be either a single [[traffic lane]] within the main [[roadway]] with distinctive markings or a separate [[roadway]] with one or more traffic lanes either parallel to the general lanes or [[grade-separated]], above or below the general lanes. For example, [[Interstate 110 (California)|Interstate 110]] in California has four HOV lanes on an upper deck.

HOV bypass lanes to allow carpool traffic to bypass areas of regular congestion in many places and an HOV lane may operate as a [[reversible lane]], working in the direction of the dominant traffic flow in both the morning and the afternoon. All lanes of a {{convert|10|mi}} section of the [[Interstate 66]] in the suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]], are treated as an HOV during the [[rush hour]] in the primary direction of flow.&lt;ref name=VDOTHOV/&gt;

The traffic speed differential between HOV and general-purpose lanes creates a potentially dangerous situation if the HOV lanes are not separated by a barrier. A [[Texas Transportation Institute]] study found that HOV lanes lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tti.tamu.edu/publications/catalog/record/?id=25946|title=CRASH ANALYSIS OF SELECTED HIGH-OCCUPANCY VEHICLE FACILITIES IN TEXAS: METHODOLOGY, FINDINGS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS|publisher=Texas Transportation Institute|date=September 2004|quote=Dallas corridors with buffer-separated concurrent flow HOV lanes did show a change in crash occurrence with an increase in injury crash rate. The IH-35E North corridor experienced a 56 per cent increase in the injury crash rate. The IH-635 corridor experienced a 41 per cent increase in the injury crash rate. A closer look at the crash data indicates that the higher injury crash rates were primarily due to the crashes occurring on the HOV lane and on the inside general-purpose lane which is adjacent to the HOV lane.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Business access and transit lane===

A business access and transit (BAT) lane is a type of HOV lane that allows for all traffic to enter the lane for a short distance in order to access other streets and business entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murakami |first=Kery |date=October 17, 2008 |title=Answers to BAT lane questions |url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2008/10/17/answers-to-bat-lane-questions/ |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-occupancy toll lane===
{{Main|High-occupancy toll lane}}
Because some HOV lanes were not utilized to their full capacity, users of low- or single-occupancy vehicles may be permitted to use an HOV lane if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as [[high-occupancy toll lane]] (or HOT lanes), and it has been introduced mainly in the United States. The first practical implementation was [[California]]'s formerly private toll [[91 Express Lanes]], in [[Orange County, California]], in 1995, followed in 1996 by [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]] north of [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Dave Downey | date= 2007-01-07|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/01/08/news/top_stories/1707192359.txt|title = The HOT lane hype |publisher= The North County Times| accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Metropolitan Transportation Commission |url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/planning/hov/faq.htm |title=High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) and High-Occupancy/Toll (HOT) Lanes: Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603081534/http://www.mtc.ca.gov/planning/hov/faq.htm |archivedate=2008-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]] Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uli.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/When-the-Road-Price-is-Right_web_F.pdf|title=When the Road Price Is Right – Land Use, Tolls, and Congestion Pricing|author=[[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) |publisher=Urban Land Institute|year=2013|accessdate=2013-04-09}} See Figure 2, pp.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FasTrak Orange County.jpg|thumb|FasTrak RFID station in Orange County, California]]

Solo drivers are permitted to use the HOV lanes upon payment of a [[fee]] that varies based on demand. Tolls change throughout the day according to real-time traffic conditions, which is intended to manage the number of cars in the lanes to maintain good journey times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvta.org/content.asp?sl=459&amp;contentid=468|title=Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003220739/http://www.nvta.org/content.asp?sl=459&amp;contentid=468|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/29851|title=Golden Gate Bridge for variable toll|last = Dawid|first = Irwin|date= 26 February 2008|website = Planetizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents claim that all motorists benefit from HOT lanes, even those who choose not to use them. This argument applies only to projects that increase the total number of lanes.&lt;ref name=i495&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vamegaprojects.com/about-megaprojects/i495-hot-lanes/|title=About I-495 HOT Lanes|accessdate=31 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101805/http://www.vamegaprojects.com/about-megaprojects/i495-hot-lanes/|archivedate=13 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also claim that HOT lanes provide an incentive to use transit and ridesharing.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called "[[Lexus]]" lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk for the rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 2007-04-08|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/06/AR2007040601602.html|title=Not Such a HOT Idea: 'Lexus Lanes' Could Ruin Virginia's Highly Successful HOV System|author=Bob Hugman|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HOT tolls are collected by manned [[Toll house|toll booth]]s, [[automatic number plate recognition]], or [[electronic toll collection]] systems. Some systems use [[RFID]] transmitters to monitor entry and exiting of the lane and charge drivers depending on demand. Typically, tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increase, a policy known as [[congestion pricing]]. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.expresslanes.com/faqs|website = 495-95 Express Lanes |title = FAQs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brook.edu/views/op-ed/downs/20020510.htm|title=Brookings Institution economic study on HOT Lanes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828202556/http://www.brook.edu/views/op-ed/downs/20020510.htm|archivedate=2008-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying vehicles==
[[File:Slug Line.gif|thumb|A [[slugging]] area, where solo drivers find a passenger to use the HOV]]  
Qualification for HOV status varies by scheme, but the following vehicles may be included:
* Private cars and taxis with a minimum number of human occupants (often two or three), including babies of any age (but only after birth)&lt;ref name=viginiarules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiadot.org/travel/hov-rulesfaq.asp|title=High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes – Rules and FAQs|quote=I'm pregnant. Do I count as one person or two? In the HOV world, you're one person. Babies of any age, however, count as a person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Single-occupant [[green vehicle]]s, such as [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s, and [[battery electric vehicle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/local-incentives/carpool-hov-lanes.html|title=Carpool (HOV) Lanes|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2010-07-08|accessdate=2012-02-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228152136/http://www.hybridcars.com/local-incentives/carpool-hov-lanes.html|archivedate=2012-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm|title=Eligible Vehicles – Single Occupant Carpool Lane Use Stickers|publisher=California Air Resources Board|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Single-occupancy vehicles upon payment of a variable fee ([[high-occupancy toll lane]] only)
* Motorcycles&lt;ref name=bike/&gt; - motorcycles are allowed via federal [[United States]] HOV lane law (Title 23, Section 166).&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/local-biker-stands-ride-hov-lane-article-1.286236&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot use HOV lanes in [[Ontario]] unless they have 2 passengers.&lt;ref name="mto.gov.on.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/ontario-511/hov-lanes.shtml|title = High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes|website = Ministry of Transportation|publisher = Government of Ontario|date = 18 October 2016|accessdate = 10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bus]]es designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the driver&lt;ref name=viginiarules/&gt;
* Public utility vehicles when responding to emergency calls&lt;ref name=viginiarules/&gt;
* Bicycles&lt;ref name=bike&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/factsheets/hov.htm|title=Fact Sheets on Highway Provisions |accessdate=|website = SAFETEA-LU|publisher = US Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City]] HOV lane codes prior to 2008 did not allow motorcycles leading to ticketing of motorcycle drivers and complaints from the [[American Motorcyclist Association]], but have since been revised to comply with the federal regulations listed above.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dealernews.com/dealernews/article/ama-statement-motorcycles-hov-lanes-nyc |title=AMA Statement On Motorcycles in HOV Lanes in NYC |accessdate=|website = Dealernews |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502231634/http://www.dealernews.com/dealernews/article/ama-statement-motorcycles-hov-lanes-nyc |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/carpool.shtml|title = HOV Lanes|website = NYC DOT|publisher = The City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions such as [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], [[taxicab]]s and airport limousines are allowed to use HOV lanes even when no passenger is present because that vehicle "will be able return to duty faster after dropping off a fare or arrive sooner to pick up a fare, thereby moving more people to their destinations in fewer vehicles".&lt;ref name="mto.gov.on.ca"/&gt;

In Virginia, commuters form [[Slugging|sluglines]] where drivers pick up one or more passengers from a designated "slug lines" to drive on HOV lanes along interstate 95/395; the driver pulls over near the sluglines and shouts out his or her destination, and people in the line going to that destination enter the car on a first-come, first-served basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sluglines.com/|title=Sluglines assists the driver by reaching the two or three person HOV requirement, and the passenger in getting a free ride to their destination.|publisher=Sluglines.com |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance, enforcement, and avoidance==
[[File:Interstate 279.JPG|thumb|Dedicated [[reversible lanes|reversible]]  HOV lanes on [[Interstate 279]] outside [[Pittsburgh]].]]
[[fine (penalty)|Fine]]s are usually imposed on drivers of non-qualifying vehicles who use the lanes.&lt;ref name="NewsChannel 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kgw.com/news/Blow-up-doll-flunks-Seattle-HOV-lane-ploy-121329989.html |title=Blow-up doll flunks Seattle HOV lane ploy |publisher=NewsChannel 8 |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616015258/http://www.kgw.com/news/Blow-up-doll-flunks-Seattle-HOV-lane-ploy-121329989.html |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the introduction the HOVs, some drivers placed inflatable dolls in the passenger seat, a practice that persists today, even though it is now illegal.&lt;ref name="NewsChannel 8"/&gt; Cameras that can distinguish between humans and mannequins or dolls were tested in the United Kingdom in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/11/29/cyclops-cam-can-distinguish-between-humans-and-blow-up-dolls/ |title=Cyclops cam can distinguish between humans and blow-up dolls |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], law enforcement officials have documented a variety of methods used by drivers in attempts to circumvent HOV occupancy rules:
*Placing store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, or cardboard cut-outs in the passenger seat;
*Taping styrofoam wig stands with wigs or balloons with faces drawn on them to the passenger seat headrest; 
*Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat;
*Tinting the front windshield and/or lowering the passenger side visor in an effort to obstruct the view into the passenger seat;
*Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket and/or placing a doll in it;
*Strapping dogs, cats, or other pets into the passenger seat.&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/carpool.asp |title = Diamond Lanes Aren't a Pregnant Girl's Best Friend|website =  Snopes.com|last = Mikkelson|first = Barbara|date = 8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a motorist tried to use a cardboard cutout of actor [[Jonathan Goldsmith]] to access an HOV lane in Fife, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The officer noted that other drivers had used sleeping bags in earlier attempts to access the HOV lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Drivers-most-interesting-way-to-cheat-the-HOV-lane-fails-297446171.html|title=Driver's 'most interesting' way to cheat the HOV lane fails|author=KOMO Staff|publisher=KOMONews.com|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, a motorist tried to claim that the [[Articles of Incorporation]] of his business, which had been placed unbuckled on the passenger’s seat, constituted a person, citing the principle of [[corporate personhood]] and California's state Vehicle Code, which defines a person as "natural persons and corporations". This argument was rejected in traffic court, where the presiding judge commented, "Common sense says carrying a sheaf of papers in the front seat does not relieve traffic congestion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Kravets|title=Motorist Claims Corporation Papers Are Carpool Passengers|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/corporation-carpool-flap/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, a 61-year-old woman tried to pass off a life-sized mannequin as a passenger in order to use the HOV lane in New York State. A police officer on a routine HOV patrol became suspicious when he noticed that the so-called passenger was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. When the officer approached the vehicle, he discovered that the "passenger" was, in fact, a mannequin wearing lipstick, designer shades, a full-length wig, and a blue sweater. The driver was issued a traffic ticket for using the HOV lane without a human passenger, which carries a fine of $135 and two points on a driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-hov-mannequin-lie-020310,0,6854750.story Driver Busted Using HOV Lane With Mannequin Passenger]{{dead link|date=October 2015 }}, WPIX Newsroom (PIX 11), February 3, 2010.

In early 2006, an Arizona woman asserted that she had been improperly ticketed for using the HOV lane because the unborn child she was carrying in her womb justified her use of the lane, while noting that Arizona traffic laws do not define what constitutes a person. However, a judge subsequently ruled that to qualify as an "individual" under Arizona traffic laws, the individual must occupy a "separate and distinct" space in a vehicle.&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt; Likewise, in California, in order to use HOV lanes, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle, and an unborn child does not count towards this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/answers.html#04 Frequently Asked Questions of the Highway Patrol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411011850/http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/answers.html |date=2009-04-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010 it was found that non-compliance rates on HOV lanes in Brisbane, Australia, were approaching 90%. Enhanced enforcement led to increased compliance, average bus journey times dropped by up to 19%, and total person throughput increased by 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyndon, S. Marinelli, P.A.

==Effectiveness==
According to 2009 data from the U.S. census, 76% drive to work alone and only 10% rideshare; for suburban commuters working in a city, the solo driving rate is 82%.&lt;ref name=NYT022012&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/automobiles/hov-access-to-the-car-pool-lane-for-a-price.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;ref=automobiles|title=Access to the Car Pool Lane Can Be Yours, for a Price

Some underused HOV lanes in several states have been converted to [[high-occupancy toll lane]]s (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to HOV lanes after paying a toll.&lt;ref name=NYT022012/&gt;

HOV lanes are also an effective way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with fewer than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and tunnels entering the city except the George Washington Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan|first=Matt|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/nyc-restricts-manhattan-inbound-traffic-to-high-occupancy-vehicles|title=NYC Restricts Manhattan Inbound Traffic to High-Occupancy Vehicles|date = 3 March 2016|website = Fox Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have argued that HOV lanes are underused. It is unclear whether HOV lanes are sufficiently used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-02-17/news/1997048013_1_hov-lanes-occupancy-vehicle-lanes-high-occupancy|title=HOV lanes could be History|website = The Baltimore Sun|date = 17 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/2000/010700_hov/010700_hov_lanes.html|title=HOV Lanes in California: Are They Achieving Their Goals?|website = Legislative Analyst's Office|date = 7 January 2000|publisher = Government of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] has been considered a city where its HOV lanes (located on [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US-95]]) are considered useless and underused due to it being far from a "nine-to-five" city, but were built because federal funding was earmarked for the project, and further criticism was made during the 2009 recession in the building of the HOV flyover exit to and from [[Summerlin Parkway]], a freeway that still does not have HOV lanes.

The situations have caused social problems in Indonesia, where some people become "[[car jockey]]", people who make their living by offering drivers to fill their car in order to meet the occupancy limit. Reportedly the situation caused people stay in unemployment for doing so, increased congestion and let parents profit from their babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theworld.org/2011/09/poor-indonesians-make-money-in-jakartas-traffic-as-jockeys/|title = Poor Indonesians Make Money in Jakarta’s Traffic as Jockeys |publisher = PRI|work = The World|last1= Hausman|first1= Sandy|last2= Werman|first2= Marco|date = 8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/world/jakartas-jockeys-in-demand-as-gridlock-drives-city-to-despair-20120203-1qxpn.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/end-of-the-road-jakartas-passengers-for-hire-targeted-by-carpooling-crackdown End of the road: Jakarta's 'passengers for hire' targeted by carpooling crackdown April 4, 2016] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved July 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35975521 Passenger for hire: Dying profession of the Jakarta Jockey April 7, 2016] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved July 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/581613/pemberlakuan-ganjil-genap-pukul-1600-kawasan-sudirman-tersendat |title=Pemberlakuan ganjil-genap pukul 16.00, kawasan Sudirman tersendat |date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/jakarta/jockeys-and-ojeks-more-of-a-problem-than-a-solution/516499 Jockeys and Ojeks: More of a Problem Than a Solution | The Jakarta Globe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318023620/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/jakarta/jockeys-and-ojeks-more-of-a-problem-than-a-solution/516499 |date=March 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mg.co.za/article/2006-03-06-car-jockeys-cash-in-on-jakartas-traffic-snarl |title = 'Car jockeys' cash in on Jakarta's traffic snarl |website =  Mail &amp; Guardian|date = 6 March 2006| last = Tjahjadi |first = Victor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article delineates the relationship between [[infrastructure]] and various economic issues.

== Ownership and financing of infrastructure ==
{{Main|Public capital}}
Infrastructure may be owned and managed by [[government]]s or by private companies, such as sole [[public utility]] or [[rail transport|railway]] companies. Generally, most roads, major ports and airports, water distribution systems and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned. Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees. Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

Hence, [[government]] owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the [[private sector]] or in [[public-private partnership]]s, in addition to in the [[public sector]]. In the United States, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/19/business/economy/19leonhardt_graphic.ready.html "Money for Public Projects", The New York Times, November 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of financial institutions that invest in infrastructure|financial institutions invest in infrastructure]].

=== Infrastructure debt ===

[[Infrastructure debt]] is a complex investment category reserved for highly sophisticated [[institutional investor]]s who can gauge jurisdiction-specific risk parameters, assess a project’s long-term viability, understand transaction risks, conduct [[due diligence]], negotiate (multi)[[creditor]]s’ agreements, make timely decisions on [[consent]]s and [[waiver]]s, and analyze loan performance over time.

Research conducted by the [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] suggests that most UK and European pensions wishing to gain a degree of exposure to infrastructure debt have done so indirectly, through investments made in infrastructure funds managed by specialised Canadian, US and Australian funds.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas Firzli quoted by Myles Neligan and Sinead Cruise |title= British Infrastructure Finance Plan No Silver Bullet|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/28/britain-economy-pensionfunds-idUSL5E7MP21Z20111128| work=Reuters |date= November 28, 2011  |accessdate=28 November 2011| location=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2011, the British government unveiled an unprecedented plan to encourage large-scale pension investments in new roads, hospitals, airports, etc. across the UK. The plan is aimed at enticing 20 billion pounds ($30.97 billion) of investment in domestic infrastructure projects.

===Infrastructure as a new asset class for pension funds and SWFs===

Pension and sovereign wealth funds are major direct investors in infrastructure.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|author=WPC Conference Committee |title= Infrastructure As A New Asset Class for Pensions and SWFs|url= https://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/49720977.pdf| work= [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|2nd Annual World Pensions Forum]], Roundtable led by Arbejdsmarkedets TillægsPension (ATP), Denmark’s National Supplementary Pension |date= 9 February 2012  |accessdate= 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWFI Trend Report: Sovereign Wealth Fund Direct Infrastructure Investments, 2003-2014|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swf-article/swfi-trend-report-sovereign-wealth-fund-direct-infrastructure-investments-2013-2014/|accessdate=25 February 2015|work=Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pension funds have long-dated liabilities, with matching long-term investments. These large institutional investors need to protect the long-term value of their investments from inflationary debasement of currency and market fluctuations, and provide recurrent [[cash flow]]s to pay for retiree benefits in the short-medium term: from that perspective, think-tanks such as the [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] have argued that infrastructure is an ideal [[asset class]] that provides tangible advantages such as long duration (facilitating cash flow matching with long-term liabilities), protection against inflation and statistical [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] (low correlation with ‘traditional’ listed assets such as equity and fixed income investments), thus reducing overall portfolio volatility.&lt;ref name="Financial News "&gt;{{Cite news|author=M.

===Supranational and public co-investment with institutional asset owners===

The notion of [[supranational]] and public co-investment in infrastructure projects jointly with private institutional asset owners has gained traction amongst [[IMF]], [[World Bank]] and [[European Commission]] policy makers in recent years notably in the last months of 2014/early 2015: Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (October 2014) and adoption of the €315 bn [[European Commission Investment Plan for Europe]] (December 2014).&lt;ref&gt;M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [https://www.academia.edu/10053563/2014_LTI_Rome_Conference_Infrastructure-Driven_Development_to_Conjure_Away_the_EU_Malaise  ‘2014 LTI Rome Conference: Infrastructure-Driven Development to Conjure Away the EU Malaise?’, Revue Analyse Financière, Q1 2015 – Issue N°54]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign ownership of 'public assets' ===

Some experts have warned against the risk of "infrastructure nationalism", insisting that steady investment flows from foreign pension and sovereign funds were key for the long-term success of the asset class- notably in large European jurisdictions such as France and the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mark Cobley |title= Investors Warn against 'Infrastructure Nationalism'

=== Comparison of private versus public investment ===

An interesting comparison between [[privatisation]] versus government-sponsored [[public works]] involves [[high-speed rail]] (HSR) projects in [[East Asia]]. In 1998, the [[Taiwan]] government awarded the [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation]], a private organisation, to construct the 345&amp;nbsp;km line from [[Taipei]] to [[Kaohsiung]] in a 35-year concession contract. Conversely, in 2004 the [[South Korea]]n government charged the [[Korea Train Express|Korean High Speed Rail Construction Authority]], a public entity, to construct its high-speed rail line, 412&amp;nbsp;km from [[Seoul]] to [[Busan]], in two phases. While different implementation strategies, Taiwan successfully delivered the HSR project in terms of [[project management]] (time, cost, and quality), whereas South Korea successfully delivered its HSR project in terms of product success (meeting owners' and users' needs, particularly in ridership). Additionally, South Korea successfully created a [[technology transfer]] of high-speed rail technology from French engineers, essentially creating an industry of HSR manufacturing capable of exporting knowledge, equipment, and parts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Kao, T., Yung-Cheng, L, and Shih, M. (2010). Privatization Versus Public Works for High Speed Rail Projects. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board. Issue: 2159. Pp. 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning and management of infrastructure ==

=== Infrastructure asset management ===
{{Main|Infrastructure asset management}}
The method of ''infrastructure asset management'' is based upon the definition of a [[Standard of service|Standard of service (SoS)]] that describes how an asset will perform in objective and measurable terms. The SoS includes the definition of a [[Infrastructure asset management#Minimum condition grade|minimum condition grade]], which is established by considering the consequences of a failure of the infrastructure asset.

The key components of infrastructure asset management are:
*Definition of a standard of service
**Establishment of measurable specifications of how the asset should perform
**Establishment of a minimum condition grade
*Establishment of a [[whole-life cost]] approach to managing the asset
*Elaboration of an ''[[Asset Management Plan]]''

After completing asset management, official conclusions are made. The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] gave the United States a "D+" on its 2017 infrastructure report card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/infrastructure/|title=Infrastructure {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
{{Main|Architecture|Civil Engineering|Electrical engineering|Project management|Systems engineers}}
[[File:BBI 2010-07-23 5.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] under construction.]]

Most infrastructure is designed by [[civil engineers]] or [[architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Amekudzi, A. A., and S. McNeil. "Infrastructure reporting and asset management: Best practices and opportunities (Transportation &amp; Development Institute (American Society of Civil Engineers). Infrastructure Systems Committee., Trans.)." Reston, Va.: American Society of Civil Engineers (2008). page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Generally road and rail transport networks, as well as water and waste management infrastructure are designed by [[Civil engineering|civil engineers]], electrical power and lighting networks are designed by [[Power engineering|power engineers]] and [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], and telecommunications, computing and monitoring networks are designed by [[systems engineers]].

In the case of urban infrastructure, the general layout of roads, sidewalks and public places may sometimes be developed at a conceptual level by [[Urban planning|urban planners]] or [[Architecture|architects]], although the detailed design will still be performed by civil engineers. Depending upon the height of the building, it may be designed by an [[architect]] or for [[tall building]]s,a [[structural engineer]], and if an industrial or processing plant is required, the structures and foundation work will still be done by civil engineers, but the process equipment and piping may be designed by [[industrial engineer]] or a [[process engineer]].

In terms of engineering tasks, the design and construction management process usually follows these steps:

;Planning and Preliminary Engineering Studies 
In general, infrastructure is planned by [[urban planners]] or [[civil engineers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE), [https://www.asce.org/issues-and-advocacy/public-policy/policy-statement-131---growth-and-development/ Policy Statement 131] - Growth and Development-The Civil Engineer's role is to plan, design and implement the built environment in service to society.&lt;/ref&gt; at a high level for transportation, water/waste water, electrical, urban zones, parks and other public and private systems. These plans typically analyze policy decisions and impacts of trade offs for alternatives. In addition, planners may lead or assist with environmental review that are commonly required to construct infrastructure. Colloquially this process is referred to as [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Planning_and_management_of_infrastructure|Infrastructure Planning]]. These activities are usually performed in preparation for preliminary engineering or [[conceptual design]] that is led by [[civil engineers]] or [[architects]].

Preliminary studies may also be performed and may include steps such as:
*Determine existing and future traffic loads, determine existing capacity, and estimate the existing and future standards of service
*Conduct a preliminary survey and obtain information from existing air photos, maps, and plans
*Identify possible conflicts with other assets or topographical features
*Perform environmental impact studies:
**Evaluate the impact on the human environment ([[noise|noise pollution]], odors, electromagnetic interference, etc.)
**Evaluate the [[environmental impact assessment|impact]] on the [[natural environment]] (disturbance of natural ecosystems)
**Evaluate the possible presence of [[Soil contamination|contaminated soils]];
**Given various time horizons, [[standard of service|standards of service]], environmental impacts, and conflicts with existing structures or terrain, propose various preliminary designs
**Estimate the costs of the various designs, and make recommendations

;Detailed Survey
*Perform a detailed [[Surveying|survey]] of the construction site
*Obtain "as built" drawings of existing infrastructure
*Dig exploratory pits where required to survey underground infrastructure
*Perform a [[geotechnical]] survey to determine the bearing capacity of soils and rock
*Perform soil sampling and testing to estimate nature, degree and extent of [[soil contamination]]

;Detailed Engineering
*Prepare detailed [[Engineering drawing|plans]] and [[technical specifications]]
*Prepare a detailed [[bill of materials]]
*Prepare a detailed [[Cost| cost estimate]]
*Establish a general [[Schedule (project management)|work schedule]]

;Authorisation
*Obtain authorisation from environmental and other regulatory agencies
*Obtain authorisation from any owners or operators of assets affected by the work
*Inform [[emergency services]], and prepare contingency plans in case of emergencies

;Tendering
*Prepare administrative clauses and other tendering documents
*Organise and announce a [[Call for bids|call for tenders]]
*Answer contractor questions and issue addenda during the tendering process
*Receive and analyse tenders, and make a recommendation to the owner

;Construction Supervision
*Once the construction [[contract]] has been signed between the [[Ownership|owner]] and the [[general contractor]], all authorisations have been obtained, and all pre-construction [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]] have been received from the general contractor, the construction supervisor issues an "Order to begin construction"
*Regularly schedule meetings and obtain contact information for the general contractor (GC) and all interested parties
*Obtain a detailed [[Schedule (project management)|work schedule]] and list of subcontractors from the GC
*Obtain detailed traffic diversion and emergency plans from the GC
*Obtain proof of certification, insurance and bonds
*Examine [[shop drawings]] submitted by the GC
*Receive reports from the materials [[quality control]] lab
*When required, review [[Change request]]s from the GC, and issue construction directives and change orders
*Follow work progress and authorise partial payments
*When substantially completed, inspect the work and prepare a list of deficiencies
*Supervise testing and [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]]
*Verify that all operating and maintenance manuals, as well as [[Warranty|warranties]], are complete
*Prepare "as built" drawings
*Make a final inspection, issue a certificate of final completion, and authorise the final payment

== Economic, social and environmental impacts of infrastructure ==

=== Impact on economic development ===
{{Main|Economic development|Public capital}}
Investment in infrastructure is part of the [[infrastructural capital|capital accumulation]] required for economic development and may affect [[socioeconomic]] measures of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://54pesos.org/2010/09/28/how-lack-or-poor-infrastructure-shapes-inequality-and-poverty-in-supernations-a-lesson-from-india/ Luis Flores Ballesteros. "How Lack and Poor Infrastructure Shapes Inequality and Poverty" 54 Pesos Sep. 2010:54 Pesos 9 September 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003182025/http://54pesos.org/2010/09/28/how-lack-or-poor-infrastructure-shapes-inequality-and-poverty-in-supernations-a-lesson-from-india/ |date=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[causality]] of infrastructure and [[economic growth]] has always been in debate. Generally, infrastructure plays a critical role in expanding national production capacity, which leads to increase in a country's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan, pp.12-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing nations, expansions in [[electric grid]]s, [[roadways]], and [[railways]] show marked growth in economic development. However, the relationship does not remain in advanced nations who witness more and more lower [[rates of return]] on such infrastructure [[investments]].

Nevertheless, infrastructure yields indirect benefits through the supply chain, land values, small business growth, consumer sales, and social benefits of community development and access to opportunity. The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] cite the many transformative projects that have shaped the growth of the United States including the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] that connected major cities from the Atlantic to Pacific coast; the [[Panama Canal]] that revolutionised shipment in connected the two oceans in the Western hemisphere; the Interstate Highway System that spawned the mobility of the masses; and still others that include the [[Hoover Dam]], [[Alaska pipeline|Trans-Alaskan pipeline]], and many bridges (the [[Golden Gate]], [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]], and [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, F. E. (2003). Perspectives in Civil Engineering. 1852-2002: 150 Years in Civil Engineering in the United States. American Society of Civil Engineers. Edited by Jeffrey S. Russell. Pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; All these efforts are testimony to the infrastructure and economic development correlation.

European and Asian [[development economist]]s have also argued that the existence of modern rail infrastructure is a significant indicator of a country’s economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the [[Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index]] (known as BRTI Index) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.academia.edu/6494981/Transportation_Infrastructure_and_Country_Attractiveness| work= Revue Analyse Financière| location=Paris | title= Transportation Infrastructure and Country Attractiveness| first= M. Nicolas J.  | last= Firzli | date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use as economic stimulus ===
During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, many governments undertook public works projects in order to create jobs and stimulate the economy. The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] provided a theoretical justification for this policy in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John Maynard (2007) [1936]. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-230-00476-8}} {{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/keynes/keynescont.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316094655/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/keynes/keynescont.htm |archivedate=2009-03-16 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1936. Following the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]], some again proposed investing in infrastructure as a means of stimulating the economy (see the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]).

=== Environmental impacts ===
{{Main|Environmental impact assessment}}

While infrastructure development may initially be damaging to the [[natural environment]], justifying the need to assess environmental impacts, it may contribute in mitigating the "perfect storm" of environmental and energy [[sustainability]], particularly in the role transportation  plays in [[modern society]].&lt;ref&gt;Puentes, R. (2008). A Bridge to Somewhere: Rethinking American Transportation for the 21st Century. Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Report: Blueprint for American Prosperity series report.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Offshore wind power]] in [[Wind power in the United Kingdom|England]] and [[Wind power in Denmark|Denmark]] may cause issues to local ecosystems but are incubators to [[clean energy technology]] for the surrounding regions. [[Ethanol]] production may overuse available farmland in [[Brazil]] but have propelled the country to [[energy security|energy independence]]. [[High-speed rail]] may cause noise and wide swathes of rights-of-way through countrysides and urban communities but have helped China, Spain, France, Germany, Japan, and other nations deal with concurrent issues of economic [[competitiveness]], [[climate change]], [[energy use intensity|energy use]], and [[built environment]] [[sustainability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5107">'''LiquidHD''' technology was an architecture and a set of protocols for networking [[consumer electronics]] devices. It was designed to let consumers link their HDTVs, home theater components, PCs, gaming consoles, and mobile devices into local entertainment networks, where they could view [[High-definition television|high-definition]] digital content from any networked source device on any compliant display.
[[Silicon Image]] promoted LiquidHD in 2009 and sponsored a website for it that year.&lt;ref name="self"&gt;{{Cite web |title= LiquidHd - Digital Entertainment Unleashed |work= Promotional website |url= http://liquidhd.com/ |deadurl=yes |archivedate=January 25, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125151208/http://liquidhd.com/ |accessdate= December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The LiquidHD architecture allowed network connections to be made via [[Ethernet]], [[coaxial cable]] (i.e., [[Multimedia over Coax Alliance|MoCA]] or [[G.hn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= New standard for home entertainment networks |date= January 8, 2009 |work= Financial Times |author= Chris Nuttall |url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5a40d558-dd93-11dd-930e-000077b07658.html |accessdate= December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[802.11]] wireless, [[powerline communication]] (such as G.hn or other specifications such as [[HomePlug]], HD-PLC or [[Universal Powerline Association]]), phone lines ([[HomePNA]] or G.hn) or [[HDMI]], depending on the usage scenario and what connections were already available. Once devices were linked in a LiquidHD network, users could control them via a remote user interface, enabling sharing of source devices and facilitating activities such as pausing a program in one room and resuming it in another.

LiquidHD included protocols for:&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= LiquidHD Digital Entertainment Unleashed |work= Promotional brochure |date= January 22, 2009 |url= http://cn.siliconimage.com/docs/LiquidHD_Technology_Overview.pdf |accessdate= December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Automatic discovery and authentication of LiquidHD-enabled devices
* High-definition media streaming from live and stored sources across the network
* Remote access of any source device's user interface to any LiquidHD display device, and for a single remote control at each display to control all source devices on a network.
* Secure communication between connected devices
* Security and content protection, including [[digital rights management]] for consumers to play their legally-obtained content on any LiquidHD display, and protect the network from hostile attacks

It was announced January 8, 2009 at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Silicon Image Unveils LiquidHD |author= Wendy Sheehan Donnell |date= January 8, 2009 |work= PC Magazine |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2338367,00.asp |accessdate= December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microsoft XML Core Services''' ('''MSXML'''), now legacy{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, was a set of services that allowed applications written in [[JScript]], [[VBScript]], and Microsoft development tools to build Windows-native [[XML]]-based applications.  It supports XML 1.0, [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]], an [[XSL Transformations|XSLT]] 1.0 processor, [[XML schema]] support including [[XSD]] and [[XDR Schema|XDR]], as well as other XML-related technologies.

==Overview ==
All MSXML products are similar in that they are exposed programmatically as [[OLE Automation]] (a subset of [[Component Object Model|COM]]) components. Developers can program against MSXML components from [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] or from [[Active Scripting]] languages such as JScript and VBScript. Managed .NET Interop with MSXML COM components is not supported nor recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/815112 | title = The use of MSXML is not supported in .NET applications | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all COM components, an MSXML object is programmatically instantiated by CLSID or [[ProgID]]. Each version of MSXML exposes its own set of CLSID's and ProgIDs. For example, to create an MSXML 6.0 DOMDocument object, which exposes the &lt;code&gt;IXmlDomDocument&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms756987.aspx | title = IXMLDOMDocument/DOMDocument | publisher = [[MSDN]] | accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;code&gt;IXmlDomDocument2&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms761358.aspx | title = IXMLDOMDocument2 | accessdate = 2008-05-28 | publisher = [[MSDN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IXmlDomDocument3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms763789.aspx | title = IXMLDOMDocument3 | accessdate = 2008-05-28 | publisher = [[MSDN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; COM interfaces, the ProgID "MSXML2.DOMDocument.6.0" must be used.

MSXML also supports version-independent ProgIDs. Version-independent ProgIDs do not have a version number associated with them. For example, "Microsoft.XMLHTTP". These ProgIDs were first introduced in MSXML 1.0, however are currently mapped to MSXML 3.0 objects and the msxml3.dll.

Different versions of MSXML support slightly different sets of functionality. For example, while MSXML 3.0 supports only XDR schemas, it does not support XSD schemas. MSXML 4.0, MSXML 5.0, and MSXML 6.0 support XSD schemas. However, MSXML 6.0 does not support XDR schemas. Support for XML Digital Signatures is provided only by MSXML 5.0. For new XML-related software development, Microsoft recommends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2006/10/23/using-the-right-version-of-msxml-in-internet-explorer.aspx | title = Using MSXML in the browser | accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; using MSXML 6.0 or its lightweight cousin, ''XmlLite'', for [[native code]]-only projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752872.aspx | title = XmlLite Programmers' Guide and API Reference | publisher = [[MSDN]] | accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==
'''MSXML''' is a collection of distinct products, released and supported by Microsoft. The product versions can be enumerated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/269238 MSXML Version List] at Microsoft.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on each version is also available at [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/ Microsoft Downloads] website.

=== Current ===
* '''MSXML 6.0''' MSXML6 is the latest MSXML product from Microsoft, and (along with MSXML3) is shipped with [[Microsoft SQL Server 2005]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio 2005]], [[.NET Framework 3.0]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows XP Service Pack 3]]. It also has support for native [[64-bit]] environments.  It is an upgrade but not replacement for versions 3 and 4 as they still provide legacy features not supported in version 6.{{dubious|date=November 2014}}&lt;!-- Vendor says here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152146(v=vs.85).aspx that MsXml6 is a replacement for MsXml4--&gt; Version 6, 4, and 3 may all be installed and running concurrently. MSXML 6 is not supported on [[Windows 9x]]. Windows XP SP3 includes MSXML 6.0 SP2.
* '''MSXML 5.0''' MSXML5 is a binary developed specifically for [[Microsoft Office]]. It originally shipped with Office 2003 and also ships with [[Office 2007]]. Microsoft has not released documentation for this version because Microsoft considers MSXML 5 an internal/integrated component of Office 2003. MSXML 5 is not included in [[Microsoft Office 2010|Office 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc178954%28office.14%29.aspx#BKMK_WhatsRemoved Office 2010: What's removed: Office 2010 Resource Kit documentation on TechNet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MSXML 3.0''' MSXML3 is a current MSXML product, represented by msxml3.dll. MSXML 3.0 SP2 first shipped with [[Windows XP]], [[Internet Explorer]] 6.0 and [[Microsoft Data Access Components|MDAC]] 2.7. Windows XP SP2 includes MSXML 3.0 SP5 as part of MDAC 2.81. Windows 2000 SP4 also ships with MSXML 3.0. By default, Internet Explorer version [[Internet Explorer 6|6.0]], [[Internet Explorer 7.0|7.0]] and [[Internet Explorer 8|8.0]] use MSXML 3 to parse XML documents loaded in a window. MSXML 3.0 SP7 is the last supported version for [[Windows 95]]. Windows XP SP3 includes MSXML 3.0 SP9. [[Windows Vista]] also includes MSXML 3.0 (SP10).

=== Obsolete ===
* '''MSXML 4.0''' MSXML4 was shipped as an independent, downloadable SDK targeted at [[independent software vendor]]s and third parties. It is an upgrade for, but not a replacement to MSXML3 as version 3 still provides legacy features. There is no 64-bit version offered, although the 32-bit version was supported for 32-bit processes on 64-bit operating systems. Versions 4 and 3 may be run concurrently. MSXML 4.0 SP3 is the most recent version released in March 2009, SP2 support expired in April 2010,&lt;ref name="MSXML4SP3"&gt;{{Citation |title=MSXML 4.0 SP3 Release Notes |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2009-09-29 |url= http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/2/D/A2D8587D-0027-4217-9DAD-38AFDB0A177E/MSXML4%20SP3%20RTM%20Release%20Note.htm  |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MSXML 4.0 SP3 expired in April 2014.&lt;ref name="MSXML4SP3SupportLifeCycle"&gt;{{Citation |title=MSXML Roadmap |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2013-03-15 |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152146(v=vs.85).aspx|accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MSXML 2.6''' This is an early version of MSXML, and is represented by msxml2.dll. This product is no longer supported by Microsoft, and the CLSIDs and ProgIDs it exposes have been subsumed by MSXML 3.0. MSXML 2.6 shipped with [[Microsoft SQL Server]] 2000 and MDAC 2.6. The last version for all platforms was released as [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887606 KB887606].
* '''MSXML 2.5''' This is an early version of MSXML, and is represented by msxml.dll. This version is also no longer supported by Microsoft, and the CLSIDs and ProgIDs it exposes have been subsumed by MSXML 3.0. MSXML 2.5 shipped with [[Windows 2000]] as part of [[Internet Explorer]] 5.01 and [[Microsoft Data Access Components|MDAC]] 2.5.
* '''MSXML 2.0a''' This version shipped with [[Internet Explorer 5.0]]. No longer supported.
* '''MSXML 1.0''' This version shipped with [[Internet Explorer 4|Internet Explorer 4.0]]. No longer supported.

The '''Ministry of Information''' ('''MOI'''), headed by the Minister of Information, was a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|United Kingdom government department]] created briefly at the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and again during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="UK National Archives"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm UK National Archives – "Ministry of Information"]&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] at the [[University of London]] during the 1940s, it was the central government department responsible for publicity and [[propaganda]].

==First World War==
In the Great War, several different agencies had been responsible for propaganda, except for a brief period when there had been a [[Department of Information (United Kingdom)|Department of Information]] (1917) and a Ministry of Information (1918).

[[File:Keep-calm-and-carry-on-scan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Keep Calm and Carry On]]'', a poster produced by the MOI in 1939 which, although printed and distributed, was never posted.]]
The Ministry of Information (MOI) was formed on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain's declaration of war, and the first Minister was sworn into Office on 5 September 1939.

The Ministry's function was "To promote the national case to the public at home and abroad in time of war" by issuing "National Propaganda" and controlling news and information.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (TNA), CAB 16/127 MIC 7 "Report of the MOI Planning Subcommittee", 27 Jul 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially responsible for censorship, issuing official news, home publicity and overseas publicity in Allied and neutral countries. These functions were matched by a responsibility for monitoring public opinion through a network of Regional Information Offices. Responsibility for publicity in enemy territories was organised by [[Department EH]] (later part of the [[Special Operations Executive]]).

=== Pre-War planning, 1935–38 ===
Secret planning for a Ministry of Information (MOI) had started in October 1935 under the auspices of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] (CID).&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Taylor, "If War Should Come: Preparing the Fifth Arm for Total War 1935–39", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (1983), pp. 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Draft proposals were accepted on 27 July 1936 and Sir [[Stephen Tallents]] was appointed as Director General Designate.&lt;ref&gt;TNA, CAB 16/127 MIC 7 "Report of the MOI Planning Subcommittee", 27 Jul 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallents drew together a small group of planners from existing government departments, public bodies and specialist outside organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Mariel Grant, ''Propaganda and the Role of the State in Inter-war Britain'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1994), pp. 239–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOI's planners sought to combine experience gained during the First World War with new communications technology. Their work reflected an increasing concern that a future war would exert huge strain on the civilian population and a belief that government propaganda would be needed to maintain morale. However it was hindered by competing visions for the Ministry, a requirement for secrecy which disrupted the making of key appointments, and the reluctance of many government departments to give up their public relations divisions to central control.&lt;ref&gt;Mariel Grant, "Towards a Central Office of Information: Continuity and Change in British Government Information Policy", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 34:1 (1999), 49–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Ministry of Information and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, 1938–39 ===
The shadow Ministry of Information came into being briefly between 26 September and 3 October 1938 after the [[Nazi]] annexation of the Sudetenland ([[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]) heightened international tensions. The seventy one officials who were assembled in temporary accommodation had responsibility for censoring press reports surrounding the [[Munich Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stenton, "British Propaganda and Raision d’Etat", ''European Studies Review'', 10 (1980), p. 50; and Taylor, "If War Should Come: Preparing the Fifth Arm for Total War", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 16 (1981), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The week-long experiment was not regarded as a success. Instead it highlighted the extent to which questions over appointments, accommodation, links to the media and the relationship with other government departments had been left unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;TNA, CAB 16/127, MIC 16 "Report by Sir Stephen Tallents", 14 Nov 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion had been made worse by tensions between the shadow MOI and the Foreign Office News Department. This tension spilled over into the Committee for Imperial Defence which considered proposals to abandon plans for the Ministry of Information.&lt;ref&gt;TNA, CAB 16/127 MIC 5th, 14 Dec 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallents left his post as Director General Designate on 2 January 1939 (with responsibility for the MOI assumed by the [[Home Office]]). Planning efforts would increase again after Nazi troops moved into Prague on 15 March 1939  (German occupation of Czechoslovakia). The British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] publicly announced his government's intentions for the MOI in a parliamentary speech on 15 June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Temple Willcox, "Projection or Publicity? Rival Concepts in the Pre-War Planning of the British Ministry of Information", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 18 (1983), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Home Office officials were privately given until 31 December 1939 to complete their plans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Irving, "The Ministry's Launch", [http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/blog/ministrys-launch/ MOI Digital], 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Phoney War, 1939–40 ===
The Ministry of Information (MOI) was formed on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain's declaration of war, and [[Lord Macmillan]] was sworn in as its first Minister on 5 September 1939. The MOI's headquarters were housed within the [[University of London]]'s [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] and would remain in place until the end of the war.

The MOI was initially organised in four groups. A "Press Relations" group was responsible for both the issue of news and censorship. A "Publicity Users" group (split into "foreign" and "home" sections) was responsible for propaganda policy. A "Publicity Producers" group (split according to media) was responsible for design and production. These were overseen by a "Co-ordination and Intelligence" group responsible for administration.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Irving, "The Ministry at a Glance", [http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/blog/ministry-glance/ MOI Digital], 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure had only been finalised in May–June 1940 and senior officials were often unsure about their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''A Man of Law's Tale: The Reminiscences of the Rt Hon Lord Macmillan'' (London: Macmillan, 1952), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The press reacted negatively to the MOI. Initial confusion between the MOI and service departments led to accusations that the MOI was delaying access to the news, and a newspaper campaign against censorship was started.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McLaine, ''Ministry of Morale: Home Front Morale and the Ministry of Information in World War II'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1979), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other commentators pointed to the ministry's large staff and satirised it as ineffective and out of touch.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Riley, ''999 and All That'' (London: Gollancz, 1940).&lt;/ref&gt; The MOI's first publicity campaign also misfired with a poster bearing the message "Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution, Will Bring Us Victory" criticised for appearing class-bound.&lt;ref&gt;James Chapman, ''The British at War'' (London: I.B. Tauris, 1998), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors led to political scrutiny and resulted in the removal of the Press Relations Group on 9 October 1939 (which became an autonomous Press and Censorship Bureau) and an announcement on 25 October 1939 that the MOI's staff was to be cut by a third.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McLaine, ''Ministry of Morale: Home Front Morale and the Ministry of Information in World War II'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1979), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Macmillan was replaced as Minister by Sir [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] on 5 January 1940. Reith sought to improve the MOI's governance, expanded its network of Regional Information Offices and introduced a [[Home intelligence]]  division. He also sought to secure the reintegration of the Press and Censorship Division in the belief that the decision to separate this function had been "obviously and monstrously ridiculous and wrong".&lt;ref&gt;John  Reith, ''Into the Wind'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1949), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were announced by [[Neville Chamberlain]] on 24 April 1940 but were not fully operational until June 1940.

=== The Battle of Britain, 1940 ===
[[Neville Chamberlain]]'s resignation and replacement by [[Winston Churchill]] on 10 May 1940 resulted in Reith's sacking and the appointment of [[Duff Cooper]]. Cooper was closely allied to Churchill and had openly criticised the previous government's approach.&lt;ref&gt;Duff Cooper, ''Old Men Forget'' (London: Hart Davies, 1953), pp. 267 and 269 and Reith, ''Into the Wind'', p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi advances in Western Europe encouraged the Ministry of Information (MOI) to increasingly focus on domestic propaganda after May 1940. A Home Publicity Emergency Committee was set up to issue public instructions about air raids, parachute raids and what to do in the event of an invasion. Concurrent campaigns extolled the public to "Avoid Rumour" and join a "Silent Column" so that they would avoid passing information to spies. However, as the situation stabilised, these campaigns were increasingly criticised for treating the public with contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Fox, "Careless Talk: Tensions within British Domestic Propaganda during the Second World War", ''Journal of British Studies'', 51 (2012), 936–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOI was subject to further criticism in July 1940 when it was accused of using "Gestapo" tactics to spy on the British public. Popular newspapers seized on reports about MOI-sponsored opinion polling and denounced the department's staff as "Cooper's Snoopers". [[Home intelligence]] reports recorded complaints from those who felt that the British state was "becoming dangerously akin to the one we are fighting".&lt;ref&gt;TNA, INF 1/264, "Points from the Regions", 22 Jul 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of such activities was also queried in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''Parliamentary Debates (Commons)'', 5th Ser. Vol. 363, 31 Jul 1940, cc. 1215–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was forced to confront further questions regarding the news and was dogged by accusations that he wanted to enforce a system of compulsory censorship. His failed attempt to increase the MOI's control over public relations divisions in other departments also drew him into conflict with Churchill. After two months of internal wrangling, it was reported that Cooper was to be replaced as Minister by [[Brendan Bracken]] on 17 July 1941.&lt;ref&gt;John Colville, ''The Fringes of Power'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1985), p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later stages of the War, 1941–45 ===
The Ministry of Information (MOI) settled down during [[Brendan Bracken]]'s tenure. Supported by [[Winston Churchill]] and the press, Bracken remained in office until after [[Victory in Europe Day]].

One of Bracken's main achievements was to promote a closer working relationship with other government departments. Plans to increase control over public relations divisions in other departments were duly dropped and closer co-operation sought in their place.&lt;ref name="Michael Balfour 1979 p. 70"&gt;Michael Balfour, ''Propaganda in War'' (London: Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1979), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracken's experience as a newspaper proprietor encouraged a similar approach with regard to the press and he maintained that the MOI should not impinge upon the right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balfour, ''Propaganda in War'' (London: Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1979), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bracken was keen to promote a more limited role in the field of domestic propaganda. He insisted that the MOI should stop "lecturing" the public and publicly questioned its ability to "stimulate British Morale".&lt;ref name="Michael Balfour 1979 p. 70"/&gt;  The MOI was instead encouraged to provide background information to particular events whilst providing technical support to other departments. Bracken also insisted that the MOI should be dissolved at the end of the war with [[Germany]] and that its activities made it inappropriate to peacetime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mariel Grant, "Towards a Central Office of Information", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 34 (1999), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post War, 1945–46 ===
The MOI was dissolved in March 1946, with its residual functions passing to the [[Central Office of Information]] (COI), a central organisation providing common and specialist information services.

=== Campaigns ===
Campaigns carried out included themes such as the following:
*The Home Front&lt;ref name="The Home Front"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/prop/home_front/ The National Archives – The Home Front]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Production – Salvage&lt;ref name="Production - Salvage"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/prop/production_salvage/ The National Archives – Production – Salvage]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Allied Unity&lt;ref name="Allied Unity"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/prop/allied_unity/ The National Archives – Allied Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Fighting Forces&lt;ref name="The Fighting Forces"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/prop/the_fighting_forces/ The National Archives – The Fighting Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personalities&lt;ref name="Personalities"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/prop/personalities/ The National Archives – The Fighting Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working practices ===
For home publicity, the Ministry dealt with the planning of general government or interdepartmental information, and provided common services for public relations activities of other government departments. The Home Publicity division undertook three main types of campaigns: those requested by other government departments, specific regional campaigns, and those it initiated itself. Before undertaking a campaign, the MOI would ensure that propaganda was not being used as a substitute for other activities, including legislation.

The General Production Division (GPD), one of the few divisions to remain in place throughout the war, undertook technical work under [[Edwin Embleton]]. The GPD often produced work in as little as a week or a fortnight, when normal commercial practice was three months. Artists were not in a [[reserved occupation]] and were liable for call up for military service along with everyone else. Many were recalled from the services to work for the Ministry in 1942, a year in which £4 million was spent on publicity, approximately a third more than in 1941. £120,000 of this was spent on posters, art and exhibitions. Of the many officially employed [[war artists]], several, including [[Eric Kennington]],&lt;ref name="War artists"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1399&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate Gallery – War artists]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[William Rothenstein]], were war artists during both World Wars. Many extra designs were prepared to cope with short lead-times and the changing events of war. Through the [[Home intelligence]] Division, the MOI collected reactions to general wartime morale and, in some cases, specifically to publicity produced.

[[Dylan Thomas]], frustrated at being declared unfit to join the armed forces, contacted Sir [[Kenneth Clark]], director of the films division of the Ministry of Information, and offered his services. Although not directly employed by the MOI, he scripted at least five films in 1942 with titles such as ''This Is Colour'' (about dye); ''New Towns for Old''; ''These Are the Men''; ''Our Country'' (a sentimental tour of Britain), and ''The Art of Conversation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Lycett |title=The reluctant propagandist |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2286844,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
A major 4 year [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC) funded research project on the "Communications History of the Ministry of Information" began in January 2014. The project is led by Professor Simon Eliot of the [[School of Advanced Study]] at the [[University of London]] and Paul Vetch of the Department of Digital Humanities at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[Times Higher Education, "Softly-softly thought police brought to book at last", 26 September 2013 http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/official-history-of-blightys-propaganda-machine/2007602.article]&lt;/ref&gt; A project website called [http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/ MOI Digital] was launched on 24 June 2014.

Henry Irving and Judith Townend have drawn parallels between information censorship in Britain during [[World War II]] and contemporary restrictions in reporting trials that relate to terrorism offences, most notably the case of ''[[R v Incedal|R v Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/censorship-and-national-security-information-control|title=Censorship and National Security: Information Control in the Second World War and Present Day|last=Irving and Townend|first=Henry and Judith|date=10 February 2016|website=History and Policy|publisher=History and Policy|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But because the electron is in an [[anharmonic]] [[potential energy|potential]] (black curve), the electron motion is ''not'' sinusoidal. The three arrows show the [[Fourier series]] of the motion: The blue arrow corresponds to ordinary (linear) [[electric susceptibility|susceptibility]], the green arrow corresponds to second-harmonic generation, and the red arrow corresponds to optical rectification. (When there is no oscillating force, the electron sits at the potential minimum, but when there ''is'' an oscillating force, it is, on average, further to the right, by an amount shown by the red arrow.)]]
[[File:Optical rectification.svg|thumb|350px|A schematic of an [[ionic crystal]] with no applied [[electric field]] (top), and with a sinusoidal electric field caused by a light wave (bottom). The blurryness indicates the sinusoidal oscillation of the ions. The red arrow indicates '''optical rectification''': The oscillating electric field causes a shift of the ions' average positions, which in turn changes the crystal's DC [[polarization density|polarization]].]]
'''Electro-optic rectification''' (EOR), also referred to as '''optical rectification''', is a [[non-linear optics|non-linear optical process]] that consists of the generation of a quasi-DC [[Polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] in a non-linear medium at the passage of an intense optical beam. For typical intensities, optical rectification is a second-order phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;Rice ''et al.'', "Terahertz optical rectification from &lt;110&gt; zinc-blende crystals," ''Appl. Phys. Lett.'' '''64''', 1324 (1994), {{doi|10.1063/1.111922}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the inverse process of the [[electro-optic effect]]. It was reported for the first time in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Bass ''et al.'', "Optical rectification," ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''9''', 446 (1962), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.9.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; when radiation from a [[ruby laser]] was transmitted through [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]] (KDP) and [[potassium dideuterium phosphate]] (KD&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;P) crystals.

== Explanation ==
Optical rectification can be intuitively explained in terms of the symmetry properties of the non-linear medium: in the presence of a preferred internal direction, the polarization will not reverse its sign at the same time as the driving field. If the latter is represented by a sinusoidal wave, then an average DC polarization will be generated.

Optical rectification is analogous to the [[Rectifier|electric rectification effect]] produced by [[diode]]s, wherein an AC signal can be converted ("rectified") to DC. However, it is ''not'' the same thing. A diode can turn a sinusoidal electric field into a DC current, while optical rectification can turn a sinusoidal electric field into a DC polarization, but not a DC current. On the other hand, a ''changing'' polarization is a kind of current. Therefore, if the incident light is getting more and more intense, optical rectification causes a DC current, while if the light is getting less and less intense, optical rectification causes a DC current in the opposite direction. But again, if the light intensity is constant, optical rectification cannot cause a DC current.

When the applied electric field is delivered by a [[femtosecond]]-[[Pulsed_laser#Pulsed_operation|pulse-width]] [[laser]], the spectral bandwidth associated with such short pulses is very large. The mixing of different frequency components produces a beating polarization, which results in the emission of electromagnetic waves in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] region. The EOR effect is somewhat similar to a classical electrodynamic emission of radiation by an accelerating/decelerating charge, except that here the charges are in a bound dipole form and the THz generation depends on the second order susceptibility of the nonlinear optical medium. A popular material for generating radiation in the 0.5&amp;ndash;3 THz range (1&amp;nbsp;mm wavelength) is [[zinc telluride]].

Optical rectification also occurs on [[metal]] surfaces by similar effect as [[surface second harmonic generation]]. The effect is however influenced e. g. by nonequilibrium electron excitation and generally it manifests in a more complicated way.&lt;ref&gt;Kadlec, F., Kuzel, P., Coutaz, J. L., "Study of terahertz radiation generated by optical rectification on thin gold films," ''Optics Letters'', '''30''', 1402 (2005), {{doi|10.1364/OL.30.001402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other nonlinear optical processes, optical rectification is also reported to become enhanced when [[surface plasmons]] are excited on a metal surface.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ramakrishnan, N. Kumar, P. C. M. Planken, D. Tanaka, and K. Kajikawa, "Surface plasmon-enhanced terahertz emission from a hemicyanine self-assembled monolayer," ''Opt. Express'', '''20''', 4067-4073 (2012), {{doi|10.1364/OE.20.004067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Together with carrier acceleration in semiconductors and polymers, optical rectification is one of the main mechanisms for the generation of terahertz radiation using lasers.&lt;ref&gt;Tonouchi, M, "Cutting-edge terahertz technology," ''Nature Photonics'' '''1''', 97 (2007), {{doi|10.1038/nphoton.2007.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from other processes of terahertz generation such as [[polaritonics]] where a polar [[lattice vibration]] is thought to generate the [[terahertz radiation]].

The '''philosophy of computer science''' is concerned with the [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions that arise with the study of [[computer science]], which is understood to mean not just [[Computer programming|programming]] but the whole study of concepts and methods that assist in the development and maintenance of [[computer system]]s.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;Turner&lt;/ref&gt; There is still no common understanding of the content, aim, focus, or topic of the philosophy of computer science,&lt;ref name=Tedre2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Tedre |first=Matti |year=2014 |title=The Science of Computing: Shaping a Discipline |publisher=Chapman Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite some attempts to develop a philosophy of computer science like the [[philosophy of physics]] or the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

The philosophy of computer science as such deals with the meta-activity that is associated with the development of the concepts and methodologies that implement and analyze the computational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcs.essex.ac.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218022636/http://pcs.essex.ac.uk/ |archivedate=2009-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5965">The '''Professional Lighting Designers' Association''' (PLDA), formerly known as '''European Lighting Designers' Association''' (ELDA+), is an international association of lighting designers whose work primarily involves them in [[architectural lighting design]]. Based in [[Gütersloh]], [[Germany]], the organisation was originally created as a European entity. However, since its founding in 1994, the organisation has expanded beyond the boundaries of Europe and has many members outside of Europe in Asia and North America. In the year 2014, PLDA was liquidated as a result of insolvency.

==The Association==
The Professional Lighting Designers' Association PLDA was founded as the European Lighting Designers' Association ELDA+ in 1994 in [[Frankfurt]]/D.
The founders were
*Georges Berne/F,
*Johannes Dinnebier/D,
*Erwin Döring/D,
*Francesco Iannone/I,
*Heinrich Kramer/D,
*Alison Ritter/UK,
*Joachim Ritter/D,
*Lucy Rittner/F and
*Serena Tellini/I.

PLDA is a voluntary federation of lighting designers and lighting consultants who are active on an international scale. Their purpose is to increase the reputation of the profession and to establish the profession as such in its own right.

==Membership==
There are different [https://web.archive.org/web/20110727175928/http://pld-a.org/153.0.html?&amp;L=3%2F membership categories] which one can apply to - membership fees are organized accordingly.

Voting members are Fellow members, Professional members and Associate members. The Fellow members are members who are deemed to have excelled in contributing to the Architectural Lighting Design profession and to PLDA. Professional members are those who own an independent practice or work in an independent practice, and have a certain number of years of experience in lighting design. The same applies to Associate members, except their number of years' experience is less.

Non-voting members are Design members (independent, but with little or no experience as an independent designer), Student members and Affiliate members.
Affiliate members are those who are not full-time lighting designers, but are very interested in lighting design or need it for their profession.

==Collaboration==
PLDA collaborates with other lighting associations, including CIE, IES and other groupings of lighting designers around the world.
With the Institution of Lighting Engineers, PLDA has a partnership agreement, in order to foster deeper understanding between the lighting profession and engineering practitioners.

The official magazine of the organization is the [http://www.pldplus.com/ Professional Lighting Design], which is published by the [http://via-verlag.com/ VIA-Verlag]. Every member receives the magazine automatically. The VIA-Verlag maintains very close ties with PLDA by, for example, organizing many events for the association.

==Education==
The Professional Lighting Designers' Association believes that education is the key to establishing Lighting Design as a serious profession. The association thus dedicates a large portion of its time to the organisation and support of education programmes at university level. PLDA has an Educators' network. International educators meet on a regular basis. PLDA works closely with many universities around the world, for example at KTH in Stockholm/S, the Hochschule Wismar/D, Fachhochschule Hildesheim/D, Parson's New School of Design in NYC/USA and Bachelor and Masters programmes in many European countries.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080725090440/http://www.via-verlag.com/644.0.html Workshop Programme] with up to four major workshops a year gives students and young designers the opportunity to work in teams under the guidance of a professional lighting designer to develop and implement a lighting design concept on a real project. Some universities have these workshops in their curriculum.

The Professional Lighting Designers' Association stages the Light Focus conference once a year, usually in conjunction with a major lighting fair event, e.g. Light+Building in Frankfurt/D or Euroluce in Milan/I. The sessions cover topics of interest and relevance to all those involved in architectural lighting design and bring to light a variety of professional themes.

The Professional Lighting Designers' Association stages the Vox Juventa conference for young designers once a year. The winning speaker receives a money prize.

==Workshops==
PLDA, hosts a number of practical workshops, which are organized by the event management of VIA publishing, in which various lighting projects are carried out in areas of a selected town or city. In this way, the general public is educated and shown what lighting design means and that it can help to improve the urban nightscape.

The town of [[Alingsås]], [[Sweden]] is the most regular partner. In 2009 PLDA and Alingsås celebrated their [http://www.lightsinalingsas.se/ tenth year] of working together.

Others have been carried out in [[Jyväskylä]]/FIN, [[Winterthur]]/CH, [[Birmingham]]/UK, [[Lüdenscheid]]/D, [[Liverpool]]/UK or [[Stavanger]]/N and [[Notodden]]/N.

==Council==
Policy making for PLDA is handled the association's elected council:

*'''President''' Francesco Iannone/I
*'''Director General''' Wim Aalders/NL
*'''Director of Membership''' Tapio Rosenius/FIN
*'''Director of Education''' Jean Sundin/USA

A '''quantum point contact''' ('''QPC''') is a narrow constriction between two wide [[Electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] regions, of a width comparable to the electronic [[wavelength]] (nano- to micrometer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. van Houten  |author2=C.W.J.

== Fabrication ==
There are several different ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a [[break-junction]] by pulling apart a piece of [[conductor (material)|conductor]] until it breaks. The breaking point forms the point contact. In a more controlled way, quantum point contacts are formed in a [[two-dimensional electron gas]] (2DEG), e.g. in [[GaAs]]/[[AlGaAs]] [[heterostructure]]s. By applying a [[voltage]] to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the electron gas can be locally depleted and many different types of conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them [[quantum dot]]s and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] close to the surface of a conductor.

== Properties ==
Geometrically, a quantum point contact is a constriction in the transverse direction which presents a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to the motion of [[electron]]s. Applying a voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; across the point contact induces a current to flow, the magnitude of this current is given by &lt;math&gt;I=GV&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] of the contact. This formula resembles [[Ohm's law]] for macroscopic resistors. However, there is a fundamental difference here resulting from the small system size which requires a quantum mechanical analysis.

At low temperatures and voltages, unscattered and untrapped electrons contributing to the current have a certain energy/momentum/wavelength called Fermi energy/momentum/wavelength. Much like in a [[waveguide]], the transverse confinement in the quantum point contact results in a "quantization" of the transverse motion—the transverse motion cannot vary continuously, but has to be one of a series of discrete modes. The waveguide analogy is applicable as long as coherence is not lost through scattering, e.g., by a defect or trapping site. The electron wave can only pass through the constriction if it interferes constructively, which for a given width of constriction, only happens for a certain number of modes &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The current carried by such a [[quantum state]] is the product of the velocity times the electron density. These two quantities by themselves differ from one mode to the other, but their product is mode independent. As a consequence, each state contributes the same amount &lt;math&gt;e^2/h&lt;/math&gt; per spin direction to the total conductance &lt;math&gt;G=NG_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a fundamental result; the conductance does not take on arbitrary values but is quantized in multiples of the [[conductance quantum]] &lt;math&gt;G_Q=2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, which is expressed through the [[electron charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Planck constant]] &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The integer number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the width of the point contact and roughly equals the width divided by half the electron [[wavelength]]. As a function of the width of the point contact (or gate voltage in the case of GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure devices), the conductance shows a staircase behavior as more and more modes (or channels) contribute to the electron transport. The step-height is given by &lt;math&gt;G_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

An external [[magnetic field]] applied to the quantum point contact lifts the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] degeneracy and leads to half-integer steps in the conductance. In addition, the number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of modes that contribute becomes smaller. For large magnetic fields, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the width of the constriction, given by the theory of the [[quantum Hall effect]]. An interesting feature, not yet fully understood, is a plateau at &lt;math&gt;0.7G_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called 0.7-structure.

== Applications ==
Apart from studying fundamentals of charge transport in [[mesoscopic]] conductors, quantum point contacts can be used as extremely sensitive charge detectors. Since the conductance through the contact strongly depends on the size of the constriction, any potential fluctuation (for instance, created by other electrons) in the vicinity will influence the current through the QPC. It is 
possible to detect single electrons with such a scheme. In view of [[quantum computation]] in [[Solid state physics|solid-state]] systems, QPCs can be used as readout devices for the state of a [[quantum bit]] (qubit) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Rebecca "Becky" Gurley Bace''' (1955 - 2017) was an American computer security expert and pioneer in intrusion detection. She spent 12 years at the US [[National Security Agency]]  where she created the Computer Misuse and Anomaly Detection
(CMAD) research program. She was known as the "den mother of computer security".&lt;ref name="den"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saita|first1=Anne|title=Rebecca 'Becky' Base: From government to guiding security startups|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Rebecca-Becky-Base-From-government-to-guiding-security-startups|website=SearchSecurity|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also influential in the early stages of intelligence community [[venture capital]] and was a major player in [[Silicon Valley]] investments in cyber security technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Steve|title=Goodbye Mama Bear, the cybersecurity community will miss you|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/3183459/security/goodbye-becky-bace-the-cybersecurity-community-will-miss-you.html|website=Cybersecurity Business Report|publisher=CSO Online|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Bace grew up in rural Alabama as one of seven children and was diagnosed with [[epilepsy]] in adolescence. Her mother was a [[war bride]] from [[Japan]] following [[World War II]] and her father was a self-educated [[teamster]] from Alabama.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thieme|first1=Richard|title=IDS Den Mother: An Interview with Becky Bace — Thiemeworks|url=http://www.thiemeworks.com/an-interview-with-becky-bace/|website=www.thiemeworks.com|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=1 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to prevailing attitudes about the illness and about women, her neurologist suggested that she stay home and collect disability following high school.&lt;ref name="memorium"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiser|first1=Deborah|title=Remembering Becky Bace|url=http://www.deborahheiser.com/single-post/2016/11/07/Becky-Bace|website=I.M.AGE Institute|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She credited a local librarian and family friend, Bertha Nel Allen, for the encouragement to apply for college and scholarships. She won scholarships from charitable foundations set up by [[Betty Crocker]] and [[Jimmy Hoffa]] in her senior year of high school, and in 1973 she was accepted to the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] as the only woman in engineering.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; Because of financial hardship and frequent employment interruptions, she took eight years of classes at various schools to earn her degree.&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=Gary|title=Silver Bullet Talks with Becky Bace|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine|date=May 2007|volume=5|issue=3|pages=6–9|doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.70|url=https://www.cigital.com/silver-bullet-files/shows/silverbullet-012-bbace.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bace first became interested in computing during her freshman year working with [[punch cards]] programming [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]] on an [[IBM mainframe]] and got her first engineering job while teaching at an engineering lab. She was approached by a couple of [[Xerox]] technicians who needed to fill [[affirmative action]] requirements, and accepted a job as a specialist repairing copier machines.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; Of the experience she stated that she faced significant gender and racial bias, and that "sometimes customers would raise a ruckus for having to deal with [her] because they believed they had been given "second best" when [she] showed up, even though [she] was better educated than most of the men."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation in 1984, Bace started working at the [[NSA]], and while searching for a flexible job to allow her to care for her [[autistic]] son who was later diagnosed with [[leukemia]], she took an assignment in 1989 in the [[National Computer Security Center]].&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; The NCSC was chartered as part of the NSA expressly to deal with computer security issues for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the intelligence community. Bace served as program manager for [[intrusion detection]] research, specifically on transferring research into the relatively new commercial security products market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romeo|first1=Jim|title=2014 Women in IT Security: Becky Bace|url=https://www.scmagazine.com/2014-women-in-it-security-becky-bace/article/540088/|website=SC Magazine US|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played a pivotal role in the apprehension of [[Kevin Mitnick]], proving that [[IP traceback|trace back]] and capture were possible beyond the theoretical context.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; She also provided some of the seed funding for computer security labs at [[UC Davis]] and [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name="den"/&gt;

Following the death of her son, Bace went to serve as the deputy security officer at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in the Computing, Information and Communications Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yost|first1=Jeffrey|title=An Interview with Rebecca G.

Bace also briefly served as Technical VP of the Cyber Security Practice for [[In-Q-Tel]], the investment arm of the US Intelligence Community, and before her death she served as chief strategist for the Center for Forensics, Information Technology, and Security (CFITS) at the [[University of South Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becky Bace, President/CEO, Infidel, Inc.; Chief Strategist for the Center for Forensics, Information Technology, and Security (CFITS) at the University of South Alabama|url=https://www.wisporg.com/blog-posts/2016/12/26/becky-bace-article|website=Women in Security and Privacy|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a venture capitalist, she provided expert advice to a generation of security startups, including [[Qualys]], [[Sygate]], [[iRobot]], [[Arxan Technologies]], [[HyTrust]], and [[List of acquisitions by Cisco Systems|Neohapsis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebecca Bace|url=https://www.oreilly.com/people/716f8-rebecca-bace|website=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Eddy Barrett''' (1834–1912) was a Chicago industrialist and Major in [[the American Civil War]]. He was born in 1834 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] and in 1857 founded the manufacturing firm Barrett, Powell &amp; Arnold, which later became S.E. Barrett Manufacturing Company. He volunteered in the 1st Illinois Artillery Regiment, commanding its [[Battery "B", 1st Regiment Illinois Volunteer Light Artillery|Company B]]. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|Major]] in 1863. Barrett married Alice D. Brush in 1868 and had six children. He worked with S.E. Barrett Manufacturing Company (later Barrett Manufacturing Company) until his death, while simultaneously acting as the head of the American Coal Products Company starting in 1903. Barrett died in 1912.

The '''signal-to-interference ratio''' ('''SIR''' or '''''S/I'''''), also known as the '''carrier-to-interference ratio''' ('''CIR''' or '''''C/I'''''), is the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power ''S'' or ''C'' and the average received [[co-channel interference]] power ''I'', i.e. [[cross-talk]], from other transmitters than the useful signal. 

The CIR resembles the [[carrier-to-noise ratio]] (CNR or ''C/N''), which is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR or ''S/N'') of a modulated signal before demodulation. A distinction is that interfering radio transmitters contributing to ''I'' may be controlled by [[radio resource management]], while ''N'' involves noise power from other sources, typically [[additive white gaussian noise]] (AWGN).

==Carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio (CNIR)==
The CIR ratio is studied in interference limited systems, i.e. where ''I'' dominates over ''N'', typically in cellular radio systems and broadcasting systems where frequency channels are reused in view to achieve high level of area coverage. The ''C/N'' is studied in noise limited systems. If both situations can occur, the '''carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio''' ('''CNIR''' or '''''C/(N+I)''''') may be studied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">In the field of [[software development]], the term '''build''' is similar to that of any other field. That is, the construction of something that has an observable and tangible result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Kevin.A|title=The Buildmeister's Guide - Achieving Agile Software Delivery|year=1996|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1847283733|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}} Historically, build has often referred either to the process of converting [[source code]] files into standalone [[artifact (software development)|software artifact(s)]] that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so. However, this is not the case with technologies such as [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Python (software)|Python]] which are examples of [[interpreted language]]s.

== Functions ==
Building software is an end-to-end process that involves many distinct functions. Some of these functions are described below.

=== Version control ===
The [[version control]] function carries out activities such as workspace creation and updating, baselining and reporting. It creates an environment for the build process to run in and captures metadata about the inputs and outputs of the build process to ensure repeatability and reliability.

Tools such as [[Git (software)|Git]], [[AccuRev SCM|AccuRev]] or [[StarTeam]] help with these tasks by offering tools to tag specific points in history as being important, and more.

=== Code quality  ===
Also known as [[static program analysis|static program analysis/static code analysis]] this function is responsible for checking developers have adhered to the seven axes of code quality: comments, unit tests, duplication, complexity, coding rules, potential bugs and architecture &amp; design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SonarQube™ software|url=http://www.sonarqube.org/|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuring a project has high-quality code results in fewer bugs and influences nonfunctional requirements such as maintainability, extensibility and readability, which have a direct impact on the [[return on investment|ROI]] for your business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muschko|first=Benjamin|title=Gradle in Action.|publisher=Manning Pubns Co|isbn=9781617291302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compilation ===
This is only a small feature of managing the build process. The compilation function turns source files into directly executable or intermediate objects. Not every project will require this function.

While for simple programs the process consists of a single file being [[compiled]], for complex software the source code may consist of many files and may be combined in different ways to produce many different versions.

== Build tools ==
The process of building a [[computer program]] is usually managed by a [[build tool]], a program that coordinates and controls other programs. Examples of such a program are [[make (software)|make]], [[Gradle]], Meister by [[OpenMake Software]], [[Ant (software)|Ant]], [[Maven (software)|Maven]], [[Rake (software)|Rake]], [[SCons]] and [http://www.phing.info Phing]. The build utility typically needs to [[compiler|compile]] the various files, in the correct order. If the source code in a particular file has not changed then it may not need to be [[recompile]]d (may not rather than need not because it may itself depend on other files that have changed). Sophisticated build utilities and linkers attempt to refrain from recompiling code that does not need it, to shorten the time required to complete the build. A more complex process may involve other programs producing code or data as part of the build process.

[[File:U&amp;U Stereoscope (02).jpg|right|thumb|A common U&amp;U Stereoscope]]

A '''stereoscope''' is a device for viewing a [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic pair]] of separate images, depicting left-eye and right-eye views of the same scene, as a single three-dimensional image.

A typical stereoscope provides each eye with a lens that makes the image seen through it appear larger and more distant and usually also shifts its apparent horizontal position, so that for a person with normal binocular depth perception the edges of the two images seemingly fuse into one "stereo window". In current practice, the images are prepared so that the scene appears to be beyond this virtual window, through which objects are sometimes allowed to protrude, but this was not always the custom. A divider or other view-limiting feature is usually provided to prevent each eye from being distracted by also seeing the image intended for the other eye.
 
Most people can, with practice and some effort, view stereoscopic image pairs in 3D without the aid of a stereoscope, but the physiological depth cues resulting from the unnatural combination of eye [[convergence (eye)|convergence]] and [[accommodation (eye)|focus]] required will be unlike those experienced when actually viewing the scene in reality, making an accurate simulation of the natural viewing experience impossible and tending to cause eye strain and fatigue.

Although more recent devices such as [[Stereo Realist|Realist-format]] [[Slide viewer#Stereo slide viewer|3D slide viewers]] and the [[View-Master]] are also stereoscopes, the word is now most commonly associated with viewers designed for the standard-format stereo cards that enjoyed several waves of popularity from the 1850s to the 1930s as a home entertainment medium.

Devices such as polarized, anaglyph and shutter glasses which are used to view two actually superimposed or intermingled images, rather than two physically separate images, are not categorized as stereoscopes.

==History==

[[Image:Charles Wheatstone-mirror stereoscope XIXc.jpg|thumb|230px|Wheatstone mirror stereoscope]]
[[Image:PSM V21 D055 The brewster stereoscope 1849.jpg|thumb|230px|Brewster stereoscope]]

===Wheatstone stereoscope===
The earliest type of stereoscope was invented by [[Sir Charles Wheatstone]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="Wheatstone"&gt;Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.—Part the First. On some remarkable, and hitherto unobserved, Phenomena of Binocular Vision. By CHARLES WHEATSTONE, F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Philosophy in King's College, London. [http://www.stereoscopy.com/library/wheatstone-paper1838.html Stereoscopy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welling, William 1978. ''Photography in America'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. 0690014511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster1856"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sir Brewster|title=The Stereoscope; its History, Theory, and Construction, with its Application to the fine and useful Arts and to Education: With fifty wood Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VI85AAAAcAAJ|year=1856|publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user's eyes, each reflecting a picture located off to the side. It demonstrated the importance of [[binocular vision|binocular]] [[depth perception]] by showing that when two pictures simulating left-eye and right-eye views of the same object are presented so that each eye sees only the image designed for it, but apparently in the same location, the brain will fuse the two and accept them as a view of one solid three-dimensional object. Wheatstone's stereoscope was introduced in the year before the first practical [[photography|photographic]] process became available, so drawings were used. This type of stereoscope has the advantage that the two pictures can be very large if desired.

===Brewster stereoscope===&lt;!--[[Lenticular stereoscope]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[File:IGB 006055 Visore stereoscopico portatile Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|left|Brewster-type stereoscope, 1870]]

Contrary to a common assertion, [[David Brewster]] did not invent the stereoscope, as he himself was often at pains to make clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Margaret Maria|title=The Home Life of Sir David Brewster|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=1175699926|pages=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rival of Wheatstone, Brewster credited the invention of the device to a Mr. Elliot, a "Teacher of Mathematics" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, conceived of the idea as early as 1823 and, in 1839, constructed "a simple stereoscope without lenses or mirrors", consisting of a wooden box 18 inches long, 7 inches wide and 4 inches high, which was used to view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to be invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zone|first=Ray|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838-1952|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=0813124611|pages=9–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1dgJ3-y1ZsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brewster's personal contribution was the suggestion to use [[lens (optics)|lenses]] for uniting the dissimilar pictures in 1849; and accordingly the '''lenticular stereoscope''' (lens based) may fairly be said to be his invention.&lt;ref name="Virtual Empire"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of Stereoscopy|url=http://sydney.edu.au/museums/collections/macleay/hist_photos/virtual_empire/origins.shtml|work=Virtual Empire|publisher=Sydney University Museums|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed a reduction in size, creating hand-held devices, which became known as Brewster Stereoscopes, much admired by [[Queen Victoria]] when they were demonstrated at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851.&lt;ref name="devices of wonder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stafford|first=Barbara Maria, Frances Terpak and Isotta Poggi|title=Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen|year=2001|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0892365906|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewster was unable to find in Britain an instrument maker capable of working with his design, so he took it to France, where the stereoscope was improved by [[Jules Duboscq]] who made stereoscopes and stereoscopic [[daguerreotype]]s, and a famous picture of Queen Victoria that was displayed at The Great Exhibition.&lt;ref name="Virtual Empire" /&gt;  Almost overnight a 3D industry developed and 250,000 stereoscopes were produced and a great number of ''stereoviews'', ''stereo cards'', ''stereo pairs'' or ''stereographs'' were sold in a short time. Stereographers were sent throughout the world to capture views for the new medium and feed the demand for 3D.&lt;ref name="dubosq"&gt;[http://www.sue-davis.net/e23d/history.html E2 3-D – history of 3-D]&lt;/ref&gt; Cards were printed with these views often with explanatory text when the cards were looked at through the double-lensed viewer, sometimes also called a ''[[stereopticon]]'', a common misnomer.

===Holmes stereoscope===
[[Image:Holmes stereoscope.jpg|thumb|230px|A [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Holmes]] stereoscope, the most popular form of 19th century stereoscope]]
In 1861 [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] created and deliberately did not patent a handheld, streamlined, much more economical viewer than had been available before. The stereoscope, which dates from the 1850s, consisted of two prismatic lenses and a wooden stand to hold the stereo card. This type of stereoscope remained in production for a century and there are still companies making them in limited production currently.

===Modern use===
In the mid-20th century the [[View-Master]] stereoscope (patented 1939), with its rotating cardboard disks containing image pairs, was popular first for 'virtual tourism' and then as a toy. In 2010, Hasbro started producing a stereoscope designed to hold an iPhone or iPod Touch, called the My3D. In 2014, [[Google]] released the template for a papercraft stereoscope called [[Google Cardboard]]. Apps on the mobile phone substitute for stereo cards; these apps can also sense rotation and expand the stereoscope's capacity into that of a full-fledged [[virtual reality]] device. The underlying technology is otherwise unchanged from earlier stereoscopes.

Several fine arts photographers and graphic artists have and continue to produce original artwork to be viewed using stereoscopes.

==Principles==
[[Image:Stereograph as an educator.jpg|thumb|230px|Stereo card of a stereoscope in use (1901). ([[Image:Stereogram guide parallel.png|10px]])]]

A simple stereoscope is limited in the size of the image that may be used. A more complex stereoscope uses a pair of horizontal [[periscope]]-like devices, allowing the use of larger images that can present more detailed information in a wider field of view. The stereoscope is essentially an instrument in which two photographs of the same object, taken from slightly different angles, are simultaneously presented, one to each eye. This recreates the way which in natural vision, each eye is seeing the object from a slightly different angle, since they are separated by several inches, which is what gives humans natural depth perception. Each picture is focused by a separate lens, and by showing each eye a photograph taken several inches apart from each other and focused on the same point, it recreates the natural effect of seeing things in three dimensions.

A moving image extension of the stereoscope has a large vertically mounted drum containing a wheel upon which are mounted a series of stereographic cards which form a moving picture. The cards are restrained by a gate and when sufficient force is available to bend the card it slips past the gate and into view, obscuring the preceding picture. These coin-enabled devices were found in arcades in the late 19th and early 20th century and were operated by the viewer using a hand crank. These devices can still be seen and operated in some museums specializing in arcade equipment.

The stereoscope offers several advantages:
* Using positive curvature (magnifying) lenses, the focus point of the image is changed from its short distance (about 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm) to a virtual distance at infinity. This allows the focus of the eyes to be consistent with the parallel lines of sight, greatly reducing eye strain. 
* The card image is magnified, offering a wider field of view and the ability to examine the detail of the photograph.
* The viewer provides a partition between the images, avoiding a potential distraction to the user.

A [[Slide viewer#Stereo slide viewer|stereo transparency viewer]] is a type of stereoscope that offers similar advantages, e.g. the [[View-Master]].

Disadvantages of stereo cards, slides or any other hard copy or print are that the two images are likely to receive differing wear, scratches and other decay. This results in stereo artifacts when the images are viewed. These artifacts compete in the mind resulting in a distraction from the 3D effect, eye strain and headaches.

The '''stethoscope'''  is an acoustic [[medicine|medical]] device for [[auscultation]], or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest, and two tubes connected to earpieces. It is often used to listen to lung and [[heart sounds]]. It is also used to listen to [[intestines]] and blood flow in [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s. In combination with a [[sphygmomanometer]], it is commonly used for measurements of [[blood pressure]]. Less commonly, "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes can also be used to check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks. A stethoscope that intensifies [[auscultation|auscultatory]] sounds is called '''phonendoscope'''.

The stethoscope was invented in [[France]] in 1816 by [[René Laennec]] at the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Wade2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Deutsch|first2=Diana|title=Binaural Hearing – Before and After the Stethophone|journal=Acoustics Today|date=July 2008|pages=16–27|url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Article_2of3_from_ATCODK_4_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laennec |first=René |authorlink=|title=De l'auscultation médiate ou traité du diagnostic des maladies des poumon et du coeur |location=Paris |publisher=Brosson &amp; Chaudé |year= 1819 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtTTeKls2bUC&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laennec_Forbes_translation"&gt;'Laennec, R.

Laennec called his device the "stethoscope"&lt;ref name="Foreign_Medicine_and_Surgery_1820"&gt;{{Citation |year=1820 |title=Laennec's new system of diagnosis |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine and Surgery and of the Sciences Connected with Them |volume=2 |pages=51–68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNVLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=stethoscope&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[wikt:stetho-#Prefix|stetho-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-scope#Suffix|-scope]]'', "chest scope"), and he called its use "[[wikt:mediate#Adjective|mediate]] auscultation", because it was [[auscultation]] with a tool intermediate between the patient's body and the physician's ear. (Today the word ''auscultation'' denotes all such listening, mediate or not.) The first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, p. 490, cites Comins, "A flexible stethoscope", ''Lancet'' 29 August 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, [[Golding Bird]] described a stethoscope he had been using with a flexible tube. Bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design (which he thought was of little utility) which he described as the snake ear trumpet. Bird's stethoscope had a single earpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Wilks, "Evolution of the stethoscope", ''Popular Science'', '''vol. 22''', no. 28, pp. 488–91, Feb 1883 {{ISSN|0161-7370}}.&lt;br /&gt;Golding Bird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9FXVoGcVJygC&amp;pg=PA440#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Advantages presented by the employment of a stethoscope with a flexible tube"], ''London Medical Gazette'', '''vol. 1''', pp. 440–12, 11 December 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, Irish physician Arthur Leared invented a binaural stethoscope and, in 1852, George Philip Cammann perfected the design of the stethoscope instrument (that used both ears) for commercial production, which has become the standard ever since. Cammann also wrote a major treatise on diagnosis by auscultation, which the refined binaural stethoscope made possible. By 1873, there were descriptions of a differential stethoscope that could connect to slightly different locations to create a slight stereo effect, though this did not become a standard tool in clinical practice.

[[Somerville Scott Alison]] described his invention of the '''stethophone''' at the Royal Society in 1858; the stethophone had two separate bells, allowing the user to hear and compare sounds derived from two discrete locations.  This was used to do definitive studies on binaural hearing and [[auditory processing]] that advanced knowledge of [[sound localization]] and eventually lead to an understanding of [[binaural fusion]].&lt;ref name=Wade2008/&gt;

The medical historian [[Jackie Duffin|Jacalyn Duffin]] has argued that the invention of the stethoscope marked a major step in the redefinition of disease from being a bundle of symptoms, to the current sense of a disease as a problem with an anatomical system even if there are no noticeable symptoms. This re-conceptualization occurred in part, Duffin argues, because prior to stethoscopes, there were no non-lethal instruments for exploring internal anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=Big Ideas: Jacalyn Duffin on the History of the Stethoscope|url=http://ww3.tvo.org/video/182217/jacalyn-duffin-history-stethoscope|publisher=TVO|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport and Sprague designed a new stethoscope in the 1940s, which became the standard by which other stethoscopes are measured, consisting of two sides, one of which is used for the respiratory system, the other for the cardiovascular system. The Rappaport-Sprague was later made by [[Hewlett-Packard]]. HP's medical products division was spun off as part of Agilent Technologies, Inc., where it became Agilent Healthcare. Agilent Healthcare was purchased by [[Philips]] which became Philips Medical Systems, before the walnut-boxed, $300, original Rappaport-Sprague stethoscope was finally abandoned ca. 2004, along with Philips' brand (manufactured by Andromed, of Montreal, Canada) electronic stethoscope model. The Rappaport-Sprague model stethoscope was heavy and short ({{convert|18|-|24|in|cm|abbr=on}}) with an antiquated appearance recognizable by their two large independent latex rubber tubes connecting an exposed leaf-spring-joined pair of opposing F-shaped chrome-plated brass binaural ear tubes with a dual-head chest piece.
[[File:Early flexible stethoscopes.jpg|thumb|left|Early flexible tube stethoscopes. Golding Bird's instrument is on the left. The instrument on the right is the stethophone.&lt;ref name=Wade2008/&gt;]]
Several other minor refinements were made to stethoscopes until, in the early 1960s, [[David Littmann]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor, created a new stethoscope that was lighter than previous models and had improved acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Littmann Stethoscopes at a glance |publisher=3M.com |url= http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Littmann/stethoscope/products/history/ |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, 3M-Littmann introduced the tunable diaphragm: a very hard (G-10) glass-epoxy resin diaphragm member with an overmolded silicone flexible acoustic surround which permitted increased excursion of the diaphragm member in a Z-axis with respect to the plane of the sound collecting area. The left shift to a lower resonant frequency increases the volume of some low frequency sounds due to the longer waves propagated by the increased excursion of the hard diaphragm member suspended in the concentric accountic surround. Conversely, restricting excursion of the diaphragm by pressing the stethoscope diaphragm surface firmly against the anatomical area overlying the physiological sounds of interest, the acoustic surround could also be used to dampen excursion of the diaphragm in response to "z"-axis pressure against a concentric fret. This raises the frequency bias by shortening the wavelength to auscultate a higher range of physiological sounds.

In 1999, Richard Deslauriers patented the first external noise reducing stethoscope, the DRG Puretone. It featured two parallel lumens containing two steel coils which dissipated infiltrating noise as inaudible heat energy. The steel coil "insulation" added .30&amp;nbsp;lb to each stethoscope. In 2005, DRG's diagnostics division was acquired by TRIMLINE Medical Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trimline.us |title=TRIMLINE Medical Products |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practice==

[[File:Standardized-Patient-Program-examining-t he-abdomen.jpg|thumb|A doctor using a stethoscope to listen to a patient's abdomen]]

Stethoscopes are often considered as a symbol of healthcare professionals, as various healthcare providers are often seen or depicted with stethoscopes hanging around their necks. A 2012 research paper claimed that the stethoscope, when compared to other medical equipment, had the highest positive impact on the perceived trustworthiness of the practitioner seen with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmir.org/2012/4/e100/|title=Impact of the Presence of Medical Equipment in Images on Viewers’ Perceptions of the Trustworthiness of an Individual On-Screen|author=|date=|work=Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR)|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of practical, widespread [[portable ultrasound|portable ultrasonography]] (point-of-care ultrasonography) in the late 1990s to early 2000s led some physicians to ask how soon it would be before stethoscopes would become [[obsolescence|obsolete]].&lt;ref name="pmid_15571638"&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkins |first=RL |last2= |first2= |year=2004 |title=Is the stethoscope on the verge of becoming obsolete? |journal=Respir Care |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=1488–1489 |pmid=15571638 |pmc= |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others answered that they thought the relationship of the various tools (stethoscopes and digital devices) would change but that it would be a long time before stethoscopes were obsolete.&lt;ref name="Respir_Care_2005_50_5_660"&gt;{{Citation |last=Murphy |first=R |year=2005 |title=The stethoscope – obsolescence or marriage? |journal=Respir Care |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=660–661 |url=http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/50/5/660.full.pdf+html |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, in 2016, the same two sides of the coin were still recognized.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2016-01-02"&gt;{{Citation |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |date=2016-01-02 |title=Heart doctors are listening for clues to the future of their stethoscopes |journal=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/heart-doctors-are-listening-for-clues-to-the-future-of-their-stethoscopes/2016/01/02/bd73b000-a98d-11e5-8058-480b572b4aae_story.html |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[cardiology|cardiologist]] said, "the stethoscope is dead", but a pediatrician said, "We are not at the place, and probably won't be for a very long time", where stethoscopes were obsolete. One consideration is that it depends on the segment of [[health care]] ([[emergency medical services]], [[nursing]], [[medicine]]) and the [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]]. "Stethoscopes retain their value for listening to [[lung]]s and [[gastrointestinal tract|bowels]] for clues of disease, experts agree."&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2016-01-02"/&gt; But for the [[circulatory system#Human cardiovascular system|cardiovascular system]], "auscultation is superfluous", one cardiologist said.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2016-01-02"/&gt; Thus, it could be that cardiology in the [[health care#Secondary care|secondary]] and [[health care#Tertiary care|tertiary care]] settings may abandon the stethoscope many years before [[primary care]], [[pediatrics]], and [[physical therapy]] do.

==Types==

===Acoustic===
[[File:Stethoscope.svg|thumb|Parts of a binaural stethoscope]]
[[Image:Stethoscope pink.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Acoustic stethoscope, with the ''bell'' upwards]]

Acoustic stethoscopes are familiar to most people, and operate on the transmission of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound: a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm is placed on the patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears. If the bell is placed on the patient, the vibrations of the skin directly produce acoustic pressure waves traveling up to the listener's ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague in the early part of the 20th century.

One problem with acoustic stethoscopes was that the sound level was extremely low. This problem was surmounted in 1999 with the invention of the stratified continuous (inner) lumen, and the kinetic acoustic mechanism in 2002.

===Electronic{{anchor|Digital Stethoscope|Electronic Stethoschope}}===

An electronic stethoscope (or '''stethophone''') overcomes the low sound levels by electronically amplifying body sounds. However, amplification of stethoscope contact artifacts, and component cutoffs (frequency response thresholds of electronic stethoscope microphones, pre-amps, amps, and speakers) limit electronically amplified stethoscopes' overall utility by amplifying mid-range sounds, while simultaneously attenuating high- and low- frequency range sounds. Currently, a number of companies offer electronic stethoscopes.
Electronic stethoscopes require conversion of acoustic sound waves to electrical signals which can then be amplified and processed for optimal listening. Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all based on the same physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal at the head of a metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32  uses an [[electromagnetic diaphragm]] with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure.  The Eko Core enables wireless transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet.

Because the sounds are transmitted electronically, an electronic stethoscope can be a [[wireless]] device, can be a recording device, and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and audio output. Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of [[telemedicine]] (remote diagnosis) and teaching.

Electronic stethoscopes are also used with [[Computer-aided Auscultation|computer-aided auscultation]] programs to analyze the recorded heart sounds pathological or innocent heart murmurs.

====Recording====

Some electronic stethoscopes feature direct audio output that can be used with an external recording device, such as a [[notebook computer|laptop]] or [[MP3]] recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded [[auscultation]] through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient's condition and [[telemedicine]], or remote diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Palaniappan R, Sundaraj K, Ahamed NU, Arjunan A, Sundaraj S. Computer-based Respiratory Sound Analysis: A Systematic Review. IETE Tech Rev 2013;30:248–56&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some [[smartphone]] apps that can use the phone as a stethoscope.&lt;ref&gt;Bianca K. Chung, Brad Tritle, "The power of mobile devices and patient engagement", [https://books.google.com/books?id=7YMsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93], chapter 8 in Jan Oldenburg (ed), ''Engage! Transforming Healthcare Through Digital Patient Engagement'', Himss Books, 2012 {{ISBN|1938904397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one uses the phone's own microphone to amplify sound, produce a visualization, and e-mail the results.  These apps may be used for training purposes or as novelties, but have not yet gained acceptance for professional medical use.&lt;ref&gt;William Hanson, ''Smart Medicine: How the Changing Role of Doctors Will Revolutionize Health Care'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FKlKjUgduP0C&amp;pg=PA22 pp. 20–22], Macmillan, 2011 {{ISBN|0230120938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stethoscope that could work with a smartphone application was introduced in 2015  &lt;ref&gt;Matt McFarland, "Eko’s stethoscope shows the potential of digital technology to reinvent health care", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/09/02/ekos-stethoscope-shows-the-potential-of-digital-technology-to-reinvent-health-care/], Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fetal===
{{main|Pinard horn}}

[[File:Pinard horn Uganda US Army nurse.jpg|150px|right|thumb|A [[Pinard horn]] used by a U.S. Army Reserve nurse in Uganda]]

A ''fetal stethoscope'' or ''fetoscope'' is an acoustic stethoscope shaped like a listening trumpet. It is placed against the [[abdomen]] of a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman to listen to the heart sounds of the [[fetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arup Kumar Majhi|title=Bedside Clinics In Obstetrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7zfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|date=2016-08-16|publisher=Academic Publishers|isbn=978-93-83420-87-2|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fetal stethoscope is also known as a [[Pinard horn]] after French [[obstetrician]] [[Adolphe Pinard]] (1844–1934).

===Doppler===

A Doppler stethoscope is an electronic device that measures the [[Doppler effect]] of [[ultrasound]] waves reflected from organs within the body.  Motion is detected by the change in frequency, due to the Doppler effect, of the reflected waves.  Hence the Doppler stethoscope is particularly suited to deal with moving objects such as a beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ananthi, ''A Textbook of Medical Instruments'', pp. 290–96, New Age International, 2006 {{ISBN|8122415725}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was recently demonstrated that continuous Doppler enables the auscultation of valvular movements and blood flow sounds that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope in adults. The Doppler auscultation presented a sensitivity of 84% for the detection of aortic regurgitations while classic stethoscope auscultation presented a sensitivity of 58%. Moreover, Doppler auscultation was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation. Since the physics of Doppler auscultation and classic auscultation are different, it has been suggested that both methods could complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Loughlin MJ and Mc Loughlin S. Cardiac auscultation: Preliminary findings of a pilot study using continuous Wave Doppler and comparison with classic auscultation Int J Cardiol. 2013 Jul 31; 167(2):5 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cardiac-Auscultation-Continuous-Stethoscope-ebook/dp/B00AXFB2IG/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369946217&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=mario+mc+loughlin|title=Amazon.com: Cardiac Auscultation With Continuous Wave Doppler Stethoscope: A new method 200 years after Laennec's invention eBook: Mario Jorge Mc Loughlin, Santiago Mc Loughlin: Kindle Store|author=|date=|work=amazon.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A military noise-immune Doppler based stethoscope has recently been developed for auscultation of patients in loud sound environments (up to 110&amp;nbsp;dB).

===3D-printed===
A '''3D-printed stethoscope''' is an open-source medical device meant for [[auscultation]] and manufactured via means of [[3D printing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope Official project site] at GitHub&lt;/ref&gt; The 3D stethoscope was developed by Dr. Tarek Loubani and a team of medical and technology specialists. The 3D-stethoscope was developed as part of the Glia project, and its design is open source from the outset. The stethoscope gained widespread media coverage in Summer 2015.

The need for a 3D-stethoscope was borne out of a lack of stethoscopes and other vital medical equipment because of the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]], where Loubani, a Palestinian-Canadian, worked as an emergency physician during [[Operation Pillar of Defense|the 2012 conflict in Gaza]]. The 1960s-era ''[[David Littmann|Littmann Cardiology 3]]'' stethoscope  became the basis for the 3D-printed stethoscope developed by Loubani.&lt;ref name="TheRegister"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pauli |first=Darren |title=Gazan medico team 3D-prints world-leading stethoscope for 30c |publisher=The Register |location=United Kingdom |date=2015-08-14 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/14/printed_stethoscope_cccamp/ |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earpieces==

Stethoscopes usually have rubber earpieces, which aid comfort and create a seal with the ear, improving the acoustic function of the device. Stethoscopes can be modified by replacing the standard earpieces with moulded versions, which improve comfort and transmission of sound. Moulded earpieces can be cast by an audiologist or made by the stethoscope user from a kit.

'''''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power''''' is [[Daniel Yergin]]'s history of the global [[petroleum industry]] from the 1850s through 1990.  ''The Prize'' became a bestseller, helped by its release date in December 1990, four months after the [[invasion of Kuwait]] ordered by [[Saddam Hussein]] and one month before the U.S.-led coalition began the [[Gulf War]] to oust [[Iraq]]i troops from that country.&lt;ref&gt;MIT Communications Forum: [http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/ivory.html "Beyond the Ivory Tower"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706035537/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/ivory.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, February 18, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie H. Gelb, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/09/books/the-stuff-that-makes-the-world-go-round.html?pagewanted=all "The Stuff That Makes the World Go Round"]. ''The New York Times'', December 9, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The book eventually went on to win a Pulitzer Prize.&lt;ref Name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web | title = The 1992 Pulitzer Prize Winner in General Nonfiction: ''The Prize'', by Daniel Yergin | publisher = The Pulitzer Prizes | url =http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/daniel-yergin | accessdate = 2016-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prize'' has been called the "definitive" history of the oil industry, even a "bible".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Yeomans, ''Oil: Anatomy of an Industry''. New York &amp; London: New Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-56584-885-3}}, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular success==
In 1992 ''The Prize'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]];&lt;ref Name="Pulitzer"/&gt; it has been translated into fourteen languages. Now out of print in hardcover, ''The Prize'' was published in a paperback edition ({{ISBN|0-671-79932-0}}) that was released at the end of 1992, and is currently in print.  ''The Prize'' is often cited as essential background reading for students of the history of [[petroleum]].  Prof. Joseph R. Rudolph Jr. said in ''Library Journal'', for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Written by one of the foremost U.S. authorities on energy, it is a major work in the field, replete with enough insight to satisfy the scholar and sufficient concern with the drama and colorful personalities in the history of oil to capture the interest of the general public.  Though lengthy, the book never drags in developing its themes: the relationship of oil to the rise of modern capitalism; the intertwining relations between oil, politics, and international power; and the relationship between oil and society in what Yergin calls today's age of "Hydrocarbon Man".&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.dclibrary.org/client/en_US/dcpl/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:408576/ada Library Journal Review: ''The Prize''].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ten years in the making,&lt;ref name=booknotes&gt;[http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/16032-1/Daniel+Yergin.aspx ''Booknotes'' interview with Yergin on ''The Prize''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222110430/http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/16032-1/Daniel+Yergin.aspx |date=2015-12-22 }}, January 27, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Prize'' draws on extensive research carried out by the author and his staff, including [[Sue Lena Thompson]], [[Robert Laubacher]], and [[Geoffrey Lumsden]].  Daniel Yergin has excellent connections with the oil industry, and is the Chairman of a private energy consulting firm called [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]],&lt;ref name=booknotes/&gt; Global Energy Analyst for NBC and CNBC, member of the board of the [[United States Energy Association]] and of the [[U.S.-Russia Business Council]].  Yergin's history has 61 pages of notes and a bibliography of 26 pages that lists as sources not only 700 books, articles, and dissertations, 60 government documents, 28 "data sources", more than 34 manuscript collections, fifteen government archives, eight oral histories, and four oil company archives ([[Amoco]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]], and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]), but also 80 personal interviews with key individuals like [[James Schlesinger]] and [[Armand Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Prize'', bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
''The Prize'' was the basis for a eight-hour documentary television series titled ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, &amp; Power'', narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and broadcast by [[PBS]] in 1992–1993. The series is said to have been seen by 20 million people in the United States.

The book is also available as an [[abridged]] [[audiobook]], read by [[Bob Jamieson]] with a run time of 2 hours and 53 minutes.

In 2011 Yergin's ''[[The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World]]'' was published by [[Penguin Press]]. ''The Quest'' is considered the sequel to ''The Prize''.

==Origin of the title==

The name of the book is taken from a quote by [[Winston Churchill]] in 1912, when he was [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], long before becoming [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He was arguing for the conversion of British warships from coal to fuel oil, but noted the geopolitical ramifications of tying Britain's fortunes to oil.

As Yergin quotes Churchill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To build any large additional number of oil-burning ships meant basing our naval supremacy upon oil. But oil was not found in appreciable quantities in our islands. If we required it we must carry it by sea in peace or war from distant countries. We had, on the other hand, the finest supply of the best steam coal in the world, safe in our mines under our own land. To commit the Navy irrevocably to oil was indeed to "take arms against a sea of troubles." Yet, if the difficulties and risk could be surmounted, "we should be able to raise the whole power and efficiency of the Navy to a definitely higher level; better ships, better crews, higher economies, more intense forms of war power"—in a word, "'''mastery itself was the prize of the venture.'''" [Emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">A '''video sculpture''' is a type of [[video installation]] that integrates video into an object, environment, site or performance. The nature of video sculpture is that it utilizes the material of video in an innovative way in space and time, different from the standard traditional narrative screening where the video has a beginning and end.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=video+sculpture&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS_a_CsoDRAhXCJCYKHXZZBMQQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1216&amp;bih=690#imgrc=c6QQosPv071yVM%3A&lt;/ref&gt;

In one definition video sculpture involves one or more monitors or projections that spectators move among or stand in front of. Video sculptures formed of more than one screen or projection may broadcast a single program or may simultaneously broadcast different interconnected sequences on several channels. The screens used in the sculpture can be arranged in many different ways. For example, they can be suspended from a ceiling, aligned and stacked to make a [[video wall]] or even randomly stacked on top of each other. Video sculpture is a medium that offers [[performing artist]]s a chance to have a more permanent artistic forum.&lt;ref name=IP/&gt;

Video sculpture includes [[projection mapping]] on objects and environments. This has become more accessible and popular due to software advancements in the last five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://projection-mapping.org/whatis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, artists [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Edward Kienholz]] began experimenting with televisions by using them in their [[happenings]] and assemblages respectively. In March 1963, [[Nam June Paik]]'s debuted his video sculpture entitled ''Music/Electronic Television'' at the Parnass Gallery in Wupertal, which used 13 altered televisions. In May 1963 [[Wolf Vostell]] shows his [[Installation art|installation]] ''6 TV-Dé-coll/age''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/ Wolf Vostell, ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York utilized six televisions, each with an anomaly.&lt;ref name=DTPIV&gt;{{cite web |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/leonardo/v034/34.1dictionary.html |title= Dictionary Terms—Part II: Video |accessdate=2008-08-06 |publisher=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shigeko Kubota]] was also an innovator in the use of video in sculptural form.  Her ''Duchampiana: Nude Descending a Staircase'' was the first video sculpture acquired by the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. This work is a reference to [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912)&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVzPI1mvf1cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA193&amp;lpg=RA1-PA193&amp;dq=%22video+sculpture%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Kuc-thLswe&amp;sig=JZjwFGfnl2OWAhEU5Skv_pNR8YU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=13&amp;ct=result#PRA1-PA193,M1|title=Into Performance|accessdate=2008-08-11|publisher=Rutgers University Press/google books|author=Yoshimoto, Midori|pages=191–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Video sculpturist are becoming influential among early 21st century artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/arts/design/04voge.html?|title=Finalists Named for Hugo Boss Prize |accessdate=2008-08-11|date=2008-01-04|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Vogel, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Paik's video sculptures in which the six windows of a 1936 [[Chrysler Airstream]] were replaced with video monitors sold for [[U.S. Dollar|$]]75,000 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E5DB153CF937A15757C0A9649C8B63|title=ACQUISITIONS; Whether Turtle or Motherwell, There's More Than Meets the Eye|accessdate=2008-08-11|date=2008-01-04|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Ivry, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlotte Moorman]] was a notable subject of video sculptures as a renowned topless [[cellist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945209-3,00.html|title=The Decline and Fall of the Avant-Garde (page 3)|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|author=Hughes, Robert|date=1972-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current developments==
There are several developments in current video sculptures. The proliferation of powerful projectors and pixel-bending technology has enabled large-scale works often created for specific events and locations. Other artists like make use of multiple LCD screens or video walls and incorporate computer generated images. A different approach is used by artists like [[Madeleine Altmann]], who creates sculptures with recycled [[cathode ray tube]] monitors.

[[Image:CVRD7windrow.turner.jpg|thumb|right|Windrow turner used on maturing piles at a biosolids composting facility in Canada.]]
[[Image:CVRD6windrow.matureing.jpg|thumb|right|Maturing windrows at an [[in-vessel composting]] facility.]]
In [[agriculture]], '''windrow composting''' is the production of [[compost]] by piling [[organic matter]] or [[biodegradable waste]], such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (''[[windrow]]s''). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale [[composting]] method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.

The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce [[compost]] on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4&amp;nbsp;feet (1.25&amp;nbsp;meters) or more high, by as much as 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air ([[oxygen]]) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial [[decomposition]] are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using [[four wheel drive]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a [[self-trailering]] option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck [[tractor]]. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or [[vinasse]]. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8&amp;nbsp;liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has [[Chemical_oxygen_demand|COD]] of 1,50,000 PPM and [[Biochemical_oxygen_demand|BOD]] of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100&amp;nbsp;meters long windrows of 3&amp;nbsp;meters x 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that a 100&amp;nbsp;meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415&amp;nbsp;m³ of Spent wash in 50&amp;nbsp;days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1&amp;nbsp;kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.
