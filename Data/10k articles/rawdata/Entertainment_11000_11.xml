'''''7 Sins''''' is a [[life simulation game|life simulation]] [[video game]] where the player must get to the top of the social ladder and make decisions related to the [[seven deadly sins]]. The game is set in the fictional Apple City. Throughout the game the player makes decisions based on [[pride]], [[wrath]], [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]], [[envy]], [[lust]], [[sloth (sin)|sloth]] and [[gluttony]]. Once a relationship has been built new missions are unlocked. In total there are seven chapters and one hundred [[non-player characters]] to interact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=45757 |title=7Sins - Overview |author= Deci, T.J. |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amusia''' is a [[music-specific disorders|musical disorder]] that appears mainly as a defect in processing [[pitch (music)|pitch]] but also encompasses musical memory and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce J. M. S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia." [Article] | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145–48 | doi=10.1159/000089606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of [[brain damage]], and congenital amusia, which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.

Studies have shown that congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder.&lt;ref name=Insights&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Hyde K. L. | year = 2003 | title = What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia." [Review] | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 362–67 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00150-5 | pmid=12907232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing [[speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Zatorre R. | year = 2005 | title =  Brain Organization for Music Processing| url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 89–114 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070225| pmid = 15709930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; much like [[aphasia|aphasics]] lose speech selectively but can sometimes still [[singing|sing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hébert S., Racette A., Gagnon L., Peretz I. | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting the dissociation between singing and speaking in expressive aphasia | url = http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = 8 | pages = 1838–50 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg186 | pmid = 12821526 | access-date = 17 June 2009 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120721222425/http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | archive-date = 21 July 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorgueille, C. 1966. Introduction à l'étude des amusies.
Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Université de la Sorbonne, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociations]] between [[rhythm]], [[melody]], and emotional processing of music,&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. (2007). ''Musicophilia'', New York: Random House. pp. 3–17, 187–258, 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt; and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.

==Basics of music processing==
Neurologically intact individuals appear to be born musical. Even before they are able to talk, infants show remarkable musical abilities that are similar to those of adults in that they are sensitive to [[musical scale]]s and a regular [[tempo]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, infants are able to differentiate between [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant and dissonant]] intervals. These perceptual skills indicate that music-specific predispositions exist.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Prolonged exposure to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training does not seem to be necessary in the processing of [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[key (music)|keys]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]], both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that [[Broca's area]] is involved in the processing of musical syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhard Maess, Stefan Koelsch, Thomas C. Gunter and Angela D. Friederici. "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area: an MEG study" (2001) ''Nature Publishing Group''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonality|atonal]] music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar [[melodies]], the loss of ability to read [[musical notation]], and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy&gt;http://amusia-brain.blogspot.com/2008/02/definition_25.html Hutchings, Tiffany, Seth Hayden, Mandy Politziner, and Erina Kainuma. "Amusia." Web log post. Amusia: Definition, Welcome to Amusia..., Congenital and Acquired Amusia, Neural Overview. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 10 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write [[musical notation]], and/or play an instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R., Ciampetti M. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.

Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt; Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).

Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | author = Douglas K. M., Bilkey D.K. | year = 2007 | title = Amusia is Associated with Deficits in Spatial Processing | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 915–21 | doi=10.1038/nn1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] differences in pitch direction in their final word. This suggests that amusia can in subtle ways impair language processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu F, Patel AD, Fourcin A, Stewart L | year = 2010 | title = Intonation processing in congenital amusia: discrimination, identification and imitation | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = 6| pages = 1682–93 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awq089 | pmid = 20418275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies.&lt;ref name=Diagnosis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Järvenpa Miika, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2009| title = The amusic brain: in tune, out of key, and unaware | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 5 | issue = 5| page = 1277 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A behavioral failure on this test is diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls.&lt;ref name=Music-specific&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Hyde K. | year = 2002 | title = Congenital amusia – A group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I, Champod AS, Hyde KL | year = 2003 | title = Varieties of musical disorders. The Montreal battery of evaluation of amusia | doi = 10.1196/annals.1284.006 | pmid = 14681118 | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 999 | issue = | pages = 58–75 | bibcode = 2003NYASA.999...58P }}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves a series of tests that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Ayotte J., Zatorre R. J., Mehler J., Ahad P., Penhune V. B. ''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Congenital amusia: A disorder of fine-grained pitch discrimination. | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00580-3| journal = Neuron | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 185–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate [[pitch contour]], musical scales, pitch [[interval (music)|intervals]], rhythm, [[meter (music)|meter]], and memory.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; An individual is considered amusic if they perform two [[standard deviations]] below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Family&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Cummings S., Dube M. P. | year = 2007 | title = The genetics of congenital amusia (tone deafness): A family-aggregation study." [Article] | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 582–88 | doi=10.1086/521337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with amusia (See [[Neuroanatomy]]).&lt;ref name=Diagnosis/&gt; Additionally, [[voxel-based morphometry]] (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.&lt;ref name=Diagnosis/&gt;

==Classifications==
There are two general classifications of amusia: congenital amusia and acquired amusia.

===Congenital amusia===
'''Congenital amusia''', commonly known as '''tone deafness''',&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation,&lt;ref name="Fine-grained"/&gt; and it affects about 4% of the population.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Peretz I. | year = 2004 | title = Brains that are out of tune but in time." [Article] | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 356–60 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes even if they have normal [[audiometry]] and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Tone-deaf people seem to be disabled only when it comes to music as they can fully interpret the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of human speech.  Tone deafness has a strong negative [[correlation]] with belonging to societies with [[tonal language]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This could be evidence that the ability to reproduce and distinguish between notes may be a learned skill; conversely, it may suggest that the genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence the linguistic development of a population towards tonality. A correlation between [[allele frequencies]] and linguistic typological features has been recently discovered, supporting the latter hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dediu |first=Dan |author2=D. Robert Ladd |title=Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and Microcephalin |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10944–49 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17537923 |pmc=1904158 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610848104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10944 |accessdate=18 July 2008|bibcode=2007PNAS..10410944D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tone deafness is also associated with other musical-specific impairments such as the inability to keep time with music ([[beat deafness]], or the lack of [[rhythm]]), or the inability to remember or recognize a song. These disabilities can appear separately, but some research shows that they are more likely to appear in tone-deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Julie |last=Ayotte |author2=Isabelle Peretz |author3=Krista Hyde |title=Congenital amusia: a group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=238–51 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11844725 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/2/238 |accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experienced musicians, such as [[W. A. Mathieu]], have addressed tone deafness in adults as correctable with training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathieu |first=W. A. |title=Tone-Deaf Choir |url=http://ListeningBookAudio.com/tonedeaf.htm |accessdate=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired amusia===
'''Acquired amusia''' is a musical disability that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, but rather than being inherited, it is the result of brain damage.&lt;ref name= Stroke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sarkamo T., Tervaniemi M., Soinila S., Autti T., Silvennoinen H. M., Laine M. ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study." [Article] | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 2642–2651 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more common than congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; While it has been suggested that music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the [[frontal lobe]] and [[auditory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; [[Temporal lobe]] lesions were also observed in patients with amusia.  Amusia is a common occurrence following an [[ischemic]] MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage.&lt;ref name= Stroke/&gt; While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

==Neuroanatomy==
{{Infobox medical condition |Name=Music Processing and the Brain |Image= |Alt=A diagram showing the different sections of the brain and how they relate to music processing. |Caption=An image depicting the different sections of the brain and specific areas that relate to music processing in particular.}}

===Overview===
Many research studies of individuals with amusia show that a number of cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the [[primary auditory cortex]], secondary auditory cortex, and [[limbic system]] are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Pitch relations===
Studies suggest that the analysis of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as [[Pitch contour|contour]] (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Berlin P. | year = 2001 | title = Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 11 | issue = 10| pages = 946–53 | doi=10.1093/cercor/11.10.946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information.&lt;ref name=Agnosia&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Rousseau I., Bard C., Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926–38 | doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 | pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tramo M., Shah G.D., Braida L.D. | year = 2002 | title = Functional role of auditory cortex in frequency processing and pitch perception | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 122–39 | doi=10.1152/jn.00104.1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal relations===
The brain analyzes the temporal (rhythmic) components of music in two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Di Pietro M., Laganaro M., Leeman B., Schnider A. | year = 2004 | title = Receptive amusia: temporal auditory deficit in a processional musician following a left temporo-parietal lesion | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 868–977 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilson S.J., Pressing J., Wales R.J. | year = 2002 | title = Modeling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 1494–505 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00198-1 | pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halsband U., Tanji J. Feund | year = 1993 | title = The role of premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in the temporal control of movement in man | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 243–46 | doi=10.1093/brain/116.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.&lt;ref name= Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Memory===
Memory is required in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Samson S. | year = 1991 | title = Role of the right temporal neocortex in retention of pitch in auditory short-term memory | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 114 | issue = 6| pages = 2403–17 | doi=10.1093/brain/114.6.2403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaab, N., Gaser, C., Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Schlaug, G. (2003). Functional anatomy of pitch memory-an fMRI study with sparse temoral sampling. NeuroLmage. 19:1417-1426.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs,&lt;ref name=Agnosia/&gt; and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Halpern R. | year = 1993 | title = Effect of unilateral temporal-lobe excision on percention and imagery of songs | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 221–32 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(93)90086-f| pmid = 8492875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.

===Other regions of the brain possibly linked to amusia===
* Lesions (or the absence of) in associations between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior [[arcuate fasciculus]] in the right hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was the origin of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loui | first1 = P. | last2 = Alsop | first2 = D. | last3 = Schlaug | first3 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Tone Deafness: A New Disconnection Syndrome? | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 33| pages = 10215–120 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1701-09.2009 | pmid=19692596 | pmc=2747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cortical thickness and reduced [[white matter]] – in a recent study, [[voxel-based morphometry]], an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of amusic individuals as compared to controls.&lt;ref name=Morphometry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K.

==Discovery==
In 1825, [[Franz Joseph Gall|F. Gall]] mentioned a "musical organ" in a specific region of the human brain that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. Alossa, Nicoletta; Castelli, Lorys, "Amusia and Musical Functioning", ''Eur Neurol'', Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 269–77 (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135718/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]] described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a [[theory of cognitive development|theory of cognition]]. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888–1890, [[August Knoblauch]] produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it amusia. This model for music processing was the earliest produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00527-4 | volume=51 | title=August Knoblauch and amusia: A nineteenth-century cognitive model of music | journal=Brain and Cognition | pages=102–14 | year=2003 | author=Johnson Julene K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===First documented case of congenital amusia===
While the possibility that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits is not a new notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.

In order to determine if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; A later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.&lt;ref name=Tone-deaf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foxton J. M., Dean J. L., Gee R., Peretz I., Griffiths T. D. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization of deficits in pitch perception underlying 'tone deafness'." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = 4| pages = 801–10 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding led to another test that was designed to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond "yes" if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond "no" if she could not detect a pitch change.  Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two [[semitone]]s ([[whole tone]]), or half steps.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, it does not seem to include speech intonation.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music.&lt;ref name= Insights/&gt; In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

===Family aggregation study===
Another interesting question posed about congenital amusia is if it has a genetic origin.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

Overall, test results support the view that congenital amusia is hereditary.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

===Singing in congenital amusia===
While it is known that congenital amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing.&lt;ref name=Singing&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bella S. D., Giguere J. F., Peretz I. | year = 2009 | title = Singing in congenital amusia | doi = 10.1121/1.3132504 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 414–24 | bibcode = 2009ASAJ..126..414D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

The results of singing with the lyrics and singing on the syllable "la" can also be compared. Although most of the amusic subjects struggled with maintaining the correct pitch when singing with lyrics, they were able to complete the task. However, when singing the same song on the syllable "la", more than half of the amusic subjects could only sing a few notes.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; This is due to a poor memory of the musical component of songs.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; Overall, it was concluded that singing deficiency in amusic individuals might be a result of their pitch perception deficit.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; However, the existence of amusic individuals who are able to sing proficiently suggests that there may be separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

==Related diseases==

{{Main article|Music-specific disorders}}

Amusia has recently been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities.&lt;ref name=Congenital&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte Julie, Peretz Isabelle, Hyde Krista | year = 2002 | title = Congenital Amusia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to [[dyslexia]] and other similar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2002 | title = Abnormal Electrical Brain Responses to Pitch in Congenital Amusia | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Brain-Patterns-In-Amusia-May-Be-Related-To-Other-Disorders-4751-1/ | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 478–82| doi = 10.1002/ana.20606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been shown that amusia may be related to an increase in size of the [[cerebral cortex]], which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and [[epilepsy]] are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde Krista, Lerch Jason, Zatorre Robert J | year = 2007| title = Cortical Thickness in Congenital Amusia: When Less Is Better Than More. | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 47| pages = 13028–32 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.3039-07.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amusia is also similar to [[aphasia]] in that they affect similar areas of the [[human brain|brain]] near the [[temporal lobe]]. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as [[memory]] and [[learning]], mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

Amusia can also be related to [[aprosody]], a disorder in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It has been found that both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name=aprosody&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R.E., Ciampetti M.Z. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt; There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt;

==Social and emotional impact==
Other than their inability to hear music, which is most likely due to a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]], the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is on the ability to tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf Stewart, Lauren, "Pitch Fever", BBC Music Magazine, pp. 36–38, (October 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406231451/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently, no forms of treatment have proven effective in treating amusia. One study has shown tone differentiation techniques to have some success, however future research on treatment of this disorder will be necessary to verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt;

==Future research==
Over the past decade, much has been discovered about amusia. However, there remains a great deal more to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as [[dysphasia]] and dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Music-specific/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

'''Angry Penguin Productions''' is a [[Rochester, New York]] based multimedia company, founded in 2002 by Antonio Esteves and Jonathan Bernier.

==Beginning==
Angry Penguin was first started in 2002 when Bernier and Esteves started promoting local music shows (particularly of the Punk Rock, Emo and Metal variety) around the [[Westchester County, New York]] area. The two felt their area lacked in variety of music shows and took matters into their own hands. The name they choose as their promotion guise was Angry Penguin and the pair started putting on and promoting one to two shows a week. Their shows took place mainly in bars and occasionally VFW halls. Many of the bands who played early Angry Penguin shows have gone on to great success, including [[Plain White T's]], [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]] and [[Kevin Devine]].

===Angry Penguin Records===
In 2004, Bernier and Esteves started Angry Penguin Records, an [[independent record label]]. As the label had no distribution deal, all albums are sold through festival appearances, music concerts and their website.

Angry Penguin's first signing was Dr. Hourai, a [[progressive metal]] band from the greater [[Westchester County, New York]] area. Their first album, ''Post Apocalyptic Nightmare Volume One: Vibrations in Hyperspace EP'' was recorded at The Loft studios in [[Bronxville, New York]] in early 2004. The label began what would become a long-running tradition of promoting both themselves and their signed acts on the [[Warped Tour]] in Summer 2004.

In 2007, Angry Penguin Records signed [[Manchester]], England's [[Pendleton (band)|Pendleton]], a 4-piece punk rock band. Their first recording (done in England), ''[[You, by Us]]'', was re-issued in the states by Angry Penguin. The band toured the US on the Vans [[Warped Tour 2007]], followed by a self-booked tour, also in the US. In the spring of 2008, Pendleton came back to the states to record their sophomore release ''[[The Difference (album)|The Difference]]''. The album was done by producer [[John Naclerio]] at Nada Recording Studios in [[New Windsor, New York]].

===Rage Fest===
In 2009, Angry Penguin Productions sponsored the first ever Rage Fest, a hardcore and metal daylong music festival at Rochester's [[Water Street Music Hall]] on August 28. It featured over 15 local bands, including [[Sirens and Sailors]], June Rising, Storm The Bay and Makyo Star.

It has been announced on Angry Penguin's official blog, that the second annual Rage Fest will take place on August 27, 2010 at [[Water Street Music Hall]]

==Angry Penguin (character)==
The Angry Penguin is a fictional character, found in The Angry Penguin [[comic book]] series. He is portrayed as having a prominent rage problem, cemented with the tagline "More Violent Than He Needs To Be." Because he is still a developing character, the whereabouts of his origin are unknown, as well as the motive behind his quest for world domination.

===Webcomic===
Angry Penguin Productions has released four issues of the Angry Penguin [[webcomic]] on their website. These have been short, sequential series. All four have been illustrated by Peter Lazarski and written by Esteves and Bernier. In a recent review, the website Geek Girl on the Street hinted at purposeful political undertones being present in the comic, though Angry Penguin Productions has yet to respond to the allegation.

====Volume 1====
*Issue 1: It Takes an Angry Penguin to Raise a Village.
*Issue 2: And in this Iron Corner
*Issue 3: Awakening

====Volume 2====
*Issue 1: The Glowing Sarcophagus

===Festival appearances===
Angry Penguin annually makes appearances on the entire [[Vans Warped Tour]] and at [[New York Comic Con]]. In 2010, the company also appeared at C2E2 and San Francisco's Wondercon.

===Clothing line===
The Angry Penguin appears on a line of adult clothing, including T-shirts, hooded sweatshirts, tank tops as well as women's "booty shorts", T-shirts, long sleeved shirts and more. The items depict the Angry Penguin in a variety of circumstances, as well as his enemies and weapons.

'''''Animal Crossing: City Folk'''''{{refn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Dōbutsu no Mori: Machi e Ikōyo'''''|街へ行こうよ どうぶつの森||lit. ''Let's Go to the City: Animal Forest''}}}}, known in Europe and Oceania as '''''Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City''''', is a 2008 [[Life simulation game|life simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]] [[video game console|console]] and the third game in the [[Animal Crossing|''Animal Crossing'' series]]. It is also one of the first titles that was re-released as a part of the [[Nintendo Selects]] collection in 2011.

In ''City Folk'', the [[player character]] lives in a [[rural]] [[village]] populated with [[anthropomorphic]] animals, taking part in various activities such as [[collecting]] and [[planting]]. Similar to other games in the ''Animal Crossing'' series the game is synced to the Wii system clock and calendar, allowing the game to be played in [[real-time (media)|real-time]] and affecting the occurrence of in-game events based on the current [[Hour|time of day]] or [[season]]. ''City Folk'' utilizes [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], allowing players to visit one another's villages via [[online play]]. The game is also the first Wii title to be compatible with the [[Wii Speak]] accessory, which enables [[voice chat]].

''City Folk'' was officially announced at [[E3 2008]]. The game is one of the [[List of best-selling Wii video games|best-selling games on the Wii]] with 3.38 million copies sold worldwide.&lt;ref name=081031e/&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Animal Crossing#Gameplay}}
[[File:Animal Crossing City Folk Start.jpg|A player's house during winter|thumb|left]]
''Animal Crossing: City Folk''{{'}}s gameplay is built upon the gameplay of previous ''Animal Crossing'' games. The [[Wii Remote]] pointer and motion controls (including the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]]) can be used for handling tools, such as axes, watering cans, slingshots, fishing rods, and bug-catching nets.&lt;ref name="Eguchi Talks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/891/891149p1.html|title=Eguchi Talks ''Animal Crossing''|last=Bozon|first=Mark|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080722063601/http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/891/891149p1.html| archivedate= 22 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also has shovels and watering cans. Players live in individual houses spread apart from each other, unlike ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'', in which all four houses are located in a central plaza, and ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World]]'', in which all players share one house. Each town begins with six animal residents, and can grow to a maximum of ten. In Animal Crossing for the [[GameCube]], up to 15 animal residents can live in a single town, and in Animal Crossing: Wild World, there can be only 8. In previous [[iteration]]s of ''Animal Crossing'', custom clothing involves a single image that is repeated on the front, back and sleeves; in ''City Folk'', the player can make separate images for each, which is called a "Pro" design.

The player will be able to celebrate as time progresses through several real-world holidays, such as [[Christmas Eve]], [[Christmas Day]], [[Thanksgiving]], [[Easter]], [[Father's Day]], [[Mother's Day]], and [[Halloween]], although they are named differently in the game itself.&lt;ref name="E3 Press Conference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/36502.html|title=GameTrailers|website=YouTube|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holiday-associated characters from previous games return, as well as new additions such as Zipper T. the [[Easter Bunny]], Pavé (a peacock who celebrates "Festivale"), and Nat (a chameleon who hosts the "Bug-off", a bug catching contest).

Players use a currency known as "bells" in the game. They can get bells by selling items to Nook, the local store owner, such as fish, bugs, fruit, or almost anything they have. Players can save their bells in their own account at the Bank of Nintendo. They may deposit or withdraw bells at the ABD machine located at the town hall.

Players have their own house in the game. Their house is provided by Tom Nook. Nook allows them to pay off their house over time, instead of all at once. They can go to the ABD machine to pay off some of this debt whenever they have the money. Once a player pays off a certain amount, their house is upgraded, adding a new story or making the first level of the house bigger. Players may decorate this house anyway they please. The HRA (Happy Room Academy) in the city rates their room, and will pick a room to put on display. Players buy furniture at Tom Nook's, Redd's in the city, or from other animals in their town. Players can use feng shui to earn more HRA points and get luckier in their daily doings, such as catching rare fish or bugs more often.

Players and animals alike can participate in hobbies. These include fishing, bug-catching, fossil finding, and gardening. There is a wide variety of bugs and fish that can be caught, which can be sold or donated to the museum. There is also a large selection of trees and flowers to plant. There are many fossils to be found buried across the village. The player can participate in occasional Bug-Offs or Fishing Tourneys.

The city is a new area added to the game. The player can go there by taking a bus from town, driven by Kapp'n, and once at the city, players can buy clothes, get their hair done, go to a theatre, bid on furniture, and much more. Special characters often appear in the city; these characters include Phineas (who hands out prizes) and Kicks (who polishes shoes).

===Online connectivity===
''Animal Crossing: City Folk'' is the first Wii game to use Wii Speak, a new microphone option for the Wii that enables voice communication over [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] (WFC). With Wii Speak, all people in a room can communicate with those in another room also containing the device, and can also have live text chat using a USB Keyboard.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Redefines"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/ocz--Co1ctoYQiDXSdIMe5sNloaAk0O8|title=Nintendo again redefines game control, puts spotlight on community building|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2008-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080719050941/http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/ocz--Co1ctoYQiDXSdIMe5sNloaAk0O8| archivedate= 19 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can communicate with other players by sending messages to their town, Wii Message Board, mobile phone, or personal computer.

An auction house run by Lloid, a Gyroid, is available in the city and is where players can auction items to other players via Nintendo WFC. There is also an office for the Happy Room Academy run by Lyle, where players can see how other players' towns are progressing.&lt;ref name="Eguchi Talks" /&gt;

As of May 2014, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection has been terminated and is only possible with homebrew process to connect online.

The game supports [[Nintendo DS]] connectivity functionality. Instead of creating a new character, players can import characters from ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''. Only the character's face, hair (including color and style) and catalog (the items purchasable from Tom Nook) are imported; bells and items owned by the character (including items in the character's inventory, house, town, or dressers) are not transferred. The data in ''Wild World'' is not modified when a character is copied to ''City Folk'', so the character can continue to be played on the DS as well. Items from the character's catalog can be repurchased with bells from ''City Folk''.&lt;ref name="accfmanual"&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Nintendo|title =''Animal Crossing: City Folk'' instruction booklet|publisher=Nintendo of America|pages=3 (in English), 25 (in French), 47 (in Spanish)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system error occurred with the Australian version of ''Let's Go to the City'' when connecting with the Nintendo DS claiming that it was "the wrong game card". Nintendo Australia allowed gamers to send back their game discs to fix the error to allow compatibility.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} Additionally, the Nintendo DS can be used to transfer characters between Wii consoles as a means of visiting other player's towns via DS Download Play.

====Downloadable content (DLC)====
Using [[WiiConnect24]], Nintendo periodically sent out downloadable content to online players. These ranged from items to celebrate particular holidays or to commemorate the release of new games. The first item released from Nintendo was the "Red [[Pikmin]] Hat". Other items given to players include a "Girl's Day updo" and "Top", [[Saint Patrick's Day]] hat, [[Nintendo DSi|DSi]] chair (White for EU; black or pink for US), a bag of bells for Tax Day, and a bus model for teacher appreciation week. After summer '09 began, Nintendo sent to North American players a hot dog hat, the dolphin model from [[Pikmin]], ladder shades, a hopscotch flooring, a dresser in the shape of a [[GameCube]], a pile of leaves, an election poster, an anniversary cake, and a Wii locker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accf.wikispaces.com/downloadable+content|title=Let's Go To The Wiki: Downloadable content|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These items can be ordered from Nook's catalog provided that they had been downloaded when they were available. In the case of patterns given by Wendell the Walrus, if they were originally Japanese only, then they will keep their Japanese name if used in a European or American version of the game, while regular items will have English names.

==Development==
The game was announced as a Wii game that markets the [[WiiConnect24]] feature of the console.&lt;ref name="ign e3 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/670/670543p1.html|title=E3 2005: ''Animal Crossing'' Revolution|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Casamassina|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2005-05-19|accessdate=2008-12-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115000901/http://wii.ign.com/articles/670/670543p1.html| archivedate= 15 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview, [[Katsuya Eguchi]], leader of ''Animal Crossing''{{'}}s production development, stated, "someone could send a letter from their cellphone or from an email address on a PC to the Wii, and then the player living in the town in ''Animal Crossing'' could receive that letter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-g.co.uk/news/06-06-2006-2937.html|title=Nintendo exec talks ''Animal Crossing'' Wii and peripherals|publisher=[[Pro-G]]|accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview with [[IGN]], Katsuya Eguchi also discussed how his team continues exploring potential ways to take advantage of the WiiConnect24 feature such as allowing friends to visit other towns or to leave messages while the machine is in standby mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/709/709218p1.html|title=Interview: Wii Sports|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Casamassina|publisher=IGN|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FarlaRevenge.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Assistant's Revenge performed by [[Christian Farla]]]]
The '''Assistant's Revenge''' is a transposition [[magic_(illusion)|illusion]] in which two performers change places. It was created by magician and inventor [[Robert Harbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.magictricks.com/library/invented.htm
 |title = Who Invented It?
 |publisher = Magictricks.com
 |accessdate = 2007-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070226072025/http://www.magictricks.com/library/invented.htm| archivedate= 26 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
One of the two performers, the ''restrainee'',  is placed in a standing position in a large frame and restrained there with various straps, manacles, chains and locks. The second performer, the ''restrainer'', circles the frame, drawing a curtain first across the front, and then around one side and the back. Almost as soon as the restrainer disappears behind the frame, the restrainee appears from the other side of the apparatus, drawing back the curtain as he or she comes. This reveals the restrainer now restrained in the frame; the two seem to have changed places by magic.

In practice, the roles of restrainer and restrainee have been interchangeable between [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[magician's assistant|assistant]]. Sometimes it begins with the assistant restraining the magician, with the implication that in this way the assistant is gaining "[[revenge]]" for all the other tricks they do where the assistant is put in a box. However it is also performed with the assistant being restrained at the beginning and emerging at the end to with the magician restrained as "revenge" for the opening part.

==Method==
In ''[[Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed]]'', it is shown that the assistant can come out from the back of the frame and switch places with the magician.  Because it is hidden by the curtain, it looks like they magically switched places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Episode Four |episode-link= |url= |access-date=May 29, 2018 |series=Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed |series-link=Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed |first= |last= |network=Fox Broadcasting Company |station= |date=October 20, 2008 |season= |series-no=2008 revival |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2017}}
Born in 1943 in Ayer, Massachusetts, Aucoin attended [[Northeastern University]] and graduated with a degree in film.&lt;ref name="aucoin.biz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aucoin.biz/au_pages/about.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704124202/http://www.aucoin.biz/au_pages/about.php |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He worked at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] in [[Boston]] during his college years and after. Aucoin later worked at Teletape Productions as a cinematographer.&lt;ref name="aucoin.biz"/&gt; Credited with discovering [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], Aucoin managed the group for nearly a decade. He was fired in 1982 due to a dispute about the band's appearance plus his drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/business/the-bad-boys-start-watching-their-pockets.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Bad Boys Start Watching Their Pockets|first=Geraldine|last=Fabrikant|date=1997-02-23|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later worked with the band on various [[DVD]] projects.

Aucoin produced a television show called ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1568719/|title=Bill Aucoin|website=IMDb|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2007, Aucoin went into the Broadway business with a staging of [[The Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia (musical)|Quadrophenia]]'', which showed intermittently for two years in [[Anaheim]] and [[Los Angeles]].

'''Black light theatre'''  (in [[Czech language|Czech]] ''černé divadlo'') or simply '''black theatre''', is a theatrical performance style characterized by the use of [[black box theatre]] augmented by [[black light]] illusion. This form of theatre originated from Asia and can be found in many places around the world. It has become a speciality  of [[Prague]], where many theatres use it.&lt;ref name=HILTPRESS&gt;http://blacklighttheatre.wbs.cz/tisk-press.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive characteristics of "black theatre" are the use of black curtains, a darkened stage, and "black lighting" (UV light), paired with [[fluorescent]] costumes in order to create intricate visual illusions. This "black cabinet" technique was used by [[Georges Méliès]], and by theatre revolutionary [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] (especially in his [[List of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski|production]] of ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]''). The technique, paired with the expressive artistry of dance, [[mime]] and acrobatics of the performers is able to create remarkable spectacles.&lt;ref name=tafantastika&gt;http://www.tafantastika.cz/en/black-light-theatre/index.php#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optics==

A key principle of black light theatre is the inability of the human eye to distinguish black objects from a black background. This effect results in effective invisibility for any objects not illuminated by the 'black light'.&lt;ref name=tafantastika /&gt; The second optical principle behind black light theatre is the effect of UV light on fluorescent objects. Black lights actually emit as much light as 'normal' lights, but at a frequency that humans cannot detect. While most objects either absorb UV light or reflect it back at the same frequency at which it came in, fluorescent objects absorb UV light then re-emit it at a longer wavelength that human eyes can detect.&lt;ref name=illinois.edu&gt;http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1913&lt;/ref&gt; The combined effect is that designers can make some objects appear as bright as if the room were fully lighted, while making other objects appear as dark as if the room were completely dark.

==History==
The 'black box trick' of using performers dressed in black in a dark playing space has been in use for millennia, starting with the jugglers performing for the emperor in ancient China.&lt;ref name=cernedivadlo&gt;http://www.cernedivadlo.cz/theatre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Japan developed this technique in its [[Bunraku Theatre]] by having puppeteers wear black in order to place complete emphasis on the puppet.&lt;ref name=puppetsnow&gt;http://www.puppetsnow.com/history-of-puppets.html&lt;/ref&gt; In modern theatre the black box trick has been adopted up by Russian director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], film director [[George Melies]], and various French avantgarde directors of the 1950s. Among these directors, George Lafaye became an earlier pioneer of black cabinet.&lt;ref name=tafantastika /&gt; But all these directors used the simple trick of black cabinet just for few moments during their performances mostly to make something on the stage disappear.

The father of modern black light theatre, author of the principe of black cabinet as is used nowadays (placement of spot lights, placement of uv lights, selection of black velvet as the best material to absorb residual light on the scene...) and even author of the name "black light theatre" and so the creator of the 1st black light theatre in the world is  Jiri Srnec. The   first performance of the ensemble took place in 1959 in Vienna. It became better known after  its participation in the Theatre Festival in Edinburgh in 1962. Later, other  groups using the technique of black box appeared starting the new wave of this theatre style.&lt;ref name=srnectheatre&gt;http://www.srnectheatre.com/en/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Prague has since become the home of black light theatre with  around 10 black light theatre companies .&lt;ref name="HILTPRESS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cernedivadlotour&gt;http://www.cernedivadlo.cz/festivals-and-awards.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagetheatre.cz/en/trips-and-activities/ Image Theatre tours]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tafantastika.cz/en/repertoire/on-tour.php name=tafantastikatour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=badmintontheater&gt;[http://www.badmintontheater.gr/show_event_en.asp?eid=151 Badminton Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known group of black light theatre is black light theatre HILT Prague,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilt-theatre.cz Hilt Theatre Web]&lt;/ref&gt; whose performances are based on modern music and dance choreographies, and has incorporated live singing. The group was founded in 2006 by Czech dancer, choreographer, director and music composer Theodor Hoidekr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilt-theatre.cz/times2.jpeg Times of  India]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 was founded the new black light theatre style called "[https://www.hilt-theatre.cz/Shadow-theatre-HILT.html shadow film theatre]" by the group HILT Prague. Except black light theatre shows they present also the first shadow film theatre - dancers and actors are playing with their shadows on the screen with projections of real places.

==Modern dance in black light theatre==
In 1989 the [http://www.imagetheatre.cz/en/performance/ Image Theatre] was founded by dancer Eva Asterova (former member  of Pavel Smok's famous Czech ballet company) and Alexander Cihar. They brought new aspects into black light theatre effects such as modern dance and non-verbal acting. Under the hand of Eva Asterová, the theatre's artistic director, Image seeks to produce an individual look of at a scene’s signature. The audience also often becomes an integral part of the performance. The repertory of the Image theatre is composed of its own devised works. Apart from Eva Asterová there are also other authors cooperating repeatedly on Image Theatre's performances such as Josef Tichý, Petr Liška, René Pyš or Zdeněk Zdeněk.
Since the beginning, Image Theatre had presented 10 different performances &lt;ref&gt;Black light Image Theatre: http://www.imagetheatre.cz/en/performance/&lt;/ref&gt; and in each of them they came with some new black light technique effects. Magic poetics, playfulness, and humor are the most important trademarks of this ensemble.

The Image theatre has 22 years experience in Prague’s black light theatres scene. Apart from regular performances in Prague, Image also performs internationally (Korea, Hong Hong, Macau, Israel, Turkey, India, Lebanon, Greece, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Slovakia, Cyprus).

==Black light theatre today==
[[File:BLACK LIGHT THEATRE HILT 11.jpg|thumb|350px|Only parts of this performer's body can be seen because of the special costume.]]

Nowadays there are many companies of black light theatre also out of Prague (Hungary, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.velvets-theater.de&lt;/ref&gt; USA) trying to make shows similar to black light theatres in Prague. Prague scene has changed its face to the style of 20th century - modern dance was involved, costume designs have become more effective, black light theatre shows have become more musical.
Prague is still home of black light theatre - hundreds thousands of tourists visit their shows every month.

[https://hilt-theatre.cz HILT] - the black light theatre of Theodor Hoidekr was the first ever who has involved live singing into black light show. The most popular HILT´s black light theatre musical show was "Juliet´s Dream" premiered on 14 February 2012 in Prague. HILT is working on new style of black light theatre - all the members are experienced in black light theatres all over Prague. Its founder and director Theodor Hoidekr was originally dancer who later started to work with black light theatre style. His experiences comes from Prague, Slovakia, Germany, Malta, Greece, South America, India &lt;ref name=HILT&gt;http://www.hilt-theatre.cz/tisk-press.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 8 April 2015 HILT performs the new show [https://hilt-theatre.cz "Phantom"] that is the world first black light theatre version of the mysterious phantom figure. The black light theatre HILT starts the new part of their history in theatre Royal Prague. In 2016 HILT has presented the first [https://www.hilt-theatre.cz/home/cinderella-shadow-theatre/ shadow film theatre Cinderella].

In 2017 HILT has moved to the Prague popular U Valsu Theatre in the centre of the Old Prague. 2.6.2017 they start to present also their best of called Phantom (best of 2007 - 2017) that is the combination show of black light theatre, shadow theatre.and projections. This show was the only Czech theatre and the only black light theatre presented at [https://www.mzv.cz/newdelhi/en/pr/culture/black_light_theatre.html 8th World Theatre Olympics 2018] in India.

==In Performance==
[[File:Beo Beyond Costume design.jpg|thumb|220px|Fluorescent costume under UV light. Created by the artist Beo Beyond]]
The effect of black light theatre allows invisible performers to move visible props, turning the objects into independent participants in the theatre at the same level as the human actors.&lt;ref name=tafantastika /&gt; Furthermore, the appearance of objects and actors in a performance can be sudden and can occur anywhere on stage, even within a few meters of an audience member.&lt;ref name=badmintontheater /&gt; In order to achieve this effect it is necessary to create an intense field of UV light throughout the entire playing space. Because the intensity of light emitted from a typical 'black light' source diminishes significantly with increased distance from the source, covering an entire theatre space with UV light requires either that the 'black light' sources be spaced as close as one meter apart or emit much more light than a typical 'black light'.&lt;ref name=theatrefx&gt;http://www.theatrefx.com/funfacts2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another important consideration is that, since most of the space is completely dark, and the form is heavily dance based, a single wrong move by a single performer can negatively impact the entire production. For this reason performers train extensively specifically for the black light theatre environment.

Contemporary black light theatre often includes many highly technical devices, in addition to the standard 'black light' technique. Such devices can include "flying" performers, large video projections,&lt;ref&gt;Image Theatre: http://www.imagetheatre.cz/en/afrikania/&lt;/ref&gt; and even massive puppets.&lt;ref name=tafantastika /&gt; These technical devices serve as a significant factor in black light theatre's worldwide popularity; since its most important devices are entirely visual, audiences throughout the world can understand most black light theatre performances.&lt;ref name=pragueexperience&gt;http://www.pragueexperience.com/theatre/theatres.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The intended result is a theatrical work that combines grand spectacle with beautiful and moving art.&lt;ref name=tafantastika /&gt; Major companies currently producing black light theatre include Srnec Theatre, HILT, Ta Fantastika Theatre, Image Theatre, Metro Theatre, and All Colours Theatre.&lt;ref name=pragueexperience /&gt;

==Biography==
Eubanks was born in [[Flint, Michigan]], but was raised primarily in [[Pasadena, California]], where he grew up listening to music, most notably favorites like [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Doc Watson]]. His parents, John Otho Leland Eubanks (September 28, 1905 – April 11, 1995) and Gertrude  Eubanks (née McClure) (February 15, 1907 – July 24, 1997), were originally from [[Missouri]]. They moved to Flint during the [[Great Depression]], where their only child was born, before moving on to California. The young boy became a child model, doing photo shoots for ads and meeting his idol, [[Gene Autry]], when he was scheduled to do an ad photo shoot with him.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book |title=It's In The Book, Bob! |editor-last=Eubanks |editor-first=Bob |editor2-last=Hansen |editor2-first=Matthew Scott |publisher=Benbella Books |page=337 |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-932100-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He watched popular classic television and quiz game shows. Also growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he was influenced by [[Cary Grant]], [[Howard Hughes]], [[Buddy Hackett]] and [[Bill Cullen]]. He attended [[Pasadena High School (Pasadena, California)|Pasadena High School]], where he graduated in 1955. After graduation from high school, he attended Pierce College (according to his commentary on a Card Sharks episode) and then went on to become one of California's most popular [[disc jockey]]s. In 1956, his first radio exposure was at [[KVTA|KACY]] Radio in [[Oxnard, California]]. He joined [[KRLA]] in Pasadena in 1960 to do the overnight show. In the spring of 1962 he was promoted to morning drive, then a year later moved to his long-running 6–9 pm evening slot. During most of the 1960s, he was also a producer of concerts, such as [[The Beatles]] 1964 and 1965 [[Hollywood Bowl]] performances,&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat98/&gt;&lt;ref name=KRLA1964&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krlabeat.sakionline.net/issue/9oct64.pdf |title=KRLA Beat |date=October 9, 1964 |publisher=KRLA Radio |accessdate=March 18, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KRLA1965&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krlabeat.sakionline.net/issue/12may65.pdf |title=KRLA Beat |date=May 12, 1965 |publisher=KRLA Radio |accessdate=March 18, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;and [[The Rolling Stones]], during the first two years of their American tour.&lt;ref name=KRLAStones&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krlabeat.sakionline.net/issue/18nov64.pdf |title=KRLA Beat |date=November 18, 1964 |publisher=KRLA Radio |accessdate=March 18, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; While still in [[Los Angeles]], he also produced such artists as [[Barry Manilow]], [[The Supremes]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Elton John]] and [[Merle Haggard]], among others.&lt;ref name=Promoter&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P1pGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cikNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2801,1682131&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title=Famed TV emcee looks ahead to Newburgh Mall festivities |last=Duvoli |first=John |date=March 13, 1980 |newspaper=The Evening News |location=[[Newburgh, New York]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eubanks married Irma Brown, an avid athlete, ranch forewoman and artist, on September 10, 1969. They had three children: Trace, a retired firefighter; Corey, a stuntman; and Theresa.&lt;ref name=Whoopie/&gt; In 1970, the couple purchased a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} portion of a working cattle ranch, and later expanded it to {{convert|26|acres|m2}}.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt; The entire family enjoyed roping and riding, with Eubanks participating in rodeos during his spare time.&lt;ref name=Rodeo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-6E0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x60FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3954,3360405&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title=Honeymoon not over for Bob Eubanks |last=White |first=Karen |date=August 14, 1987 |newspaper=[[The Item|The Sumter Daily Item]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eubanks is a gold card member of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]].&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; Irma handled interior decorating, landscaping, and mounting one to two equestrian shows a year.

The couple has a young son, Noah.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whoopie/&gt; In October 2010, Eubanks and his wife put their Westlake Village, CA home on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/home/la-hm-hotprop-bob-eubanks-20101005 |title=Bob Eubanks lists Westlake Village home |last=Beale |first=Lauren |date=October 5, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Newlywed Game'' and country music business==
In 1966, he received a phone call from [[Chuck Barris]] to host a new game show, ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] that same year. During its debut, it was an immediate hit, and the show's popularity led the network to expand the prime-time lineup, where it had run on the air for five years.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Only 28 years old when he started hosting, Eubanks became widely popular for bringing a youthful energy to daytime television, pressing contestants into giving embarrassing and hilarious answers. ''The Newlywed Game'' was also ranked as one of the top three daytime game shows, for five consecutive years, between 1968 and 1973, and was ranked in the top three prime-time game shows, also for five years, between 1966 and 1971.&lt;ref name=Talent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/12/news/cl-55088|title=A Talent at Having Fun With the Newly Wed |last=Howe |first=Elena Nelson |date=July 12, 1999 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whoopie /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodeo /&gt;

While hosting ''The Newlywed Game'', Eubanks was known for using the [[catchphrase]] "makin' whoopee", in reference to marital [[sexual intercourse]]. It was Eubanks who coined the term from the [[Makin' Whoopee|song]] of the same name, in an attempt to keep parents with young children from the need to explain the facts of life because of a television show. While his network was comfortable with the term "making love", they did not allow the use of the word "[[panties]]".&lt;ref name=Whoopie&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/fashion/03night.html?_r=1 |title=The Whoopie Man |last=Diamond |first=Jamie |date=December 31, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xHaq4gBQ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/fashion/03night.html?_r=2 |archivedate=March 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not taping, he also pursued a career in the country music business, where he served as manager of such artists as [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[Marty Robbins]].&lt;ref name=Promoter /&gt; The same year, he also signed Merle Haggard to an exclusive live-performance contract, producing more than 100 dates per year with the performer for almost a decade.&lt;ref name=Talent /&gt; His first ending of his first-run network TV show, ''The Newlywed Game'', ended in 1974, after 2,195 episodes, making Eubanks one of the most beloved and bankable [[game show hosts]] to date. He also hosted various editions in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]], from 1977–1980, 1985–1988 and 1997–1999.&lt;ref name=Promoter /&gt; For Series Two of the 2009 [[Game Show Network|GSN]] revival, Eubanks hosted a celebrity charity episode with first host [[Carnie Wilson]] and her husband [[Rob Bonfiglio]] playing against Carnie's sister [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and her husband Daniel Knutson, and their mother [[Marilyn Wilson-Rutherford]] and her current husband Daniel Rutherford. In spring 2010, Eubanks hosted another episode of ''The Newlywed Game'', subtitled the "Game Show Kings" episode. This episode featured [[Monty Hall]] and his wife Marilyn Hall, [[Peter Marshall (U.S. entertainer)|Peter Marshall]] and his wife Laurie Stewart, and [[Wink Martindale]] with his wife Sandy. This makes him the only person to host the same game show in six consecutive decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s).

In 1988, Eubanks left ''The Newlywed Game'' to pursue other interests (even though he was still hosting ''[[Card Sharks]]'' on CBS for another seven months) and was replaced by [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]].

In 1996, Eubanks also appeared as the host of ''Prime Time Country''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other game shows==
After ''Newlywed Game'', he hosted a number of other game shows in his career, including ''[[Rhyme and Reason]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]'', ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', ''[[Trivia Trap]]'', and ''[[Powerball: The Game Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dOYbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hGgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4670,7374838&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title=Initial Reaction is Astonishment for Winners on 'Dream House' |last=Scott |first=Vernon |date=September 29, 1983 |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q_1fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4AENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1615,2096386&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title=Town woman appears on game show |last=Brewster  |first=Sloan |date=May 12, 2001 |work=[[Record-Journal]] |location=[[Meriden, Connecticut]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Mark Goodson]] hired Eubanks, a second time (the first being the aforementioned [[Trivia Trap]]), to host a revamped version of the show ''[[Card Sharks]]'' for [[CBS]].&lt;ref name=Work/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-14/entertainment/ca-2727_1_card-sharks |title='Card Sharks' is Dealt Back In |date=November 14, 1985 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eubanks hosted ''Card Sharks'' throughout its CBS run from January 1986 until its demise in March 1989.&lt;ref name=Rodeo/&gt; Prior to hosting ''Card Sharks'', he appeared as a special guest on the original [[NBC]] version alongside [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] to promote his 1979 game show ''[[All Star Secrets]]'', which he also produced.

His final network game show was ''[[Family Secrets (game show)|Family Secrets]]''. In recent years, he has hosted or co-hosted all five of NBC's ''[[Most Outrageous Moments|Most Outrageous Game Show Moments]]'' specials. Eubanks was also one of three rotating hosts (along with [[Chuck Woolery]] and [[Jamie Farr]]) of the "$250,000 Game Show Spectacular" at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] until the show closed in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=R.I.P. $250,000 Game Show Spectacular |url=http://thestrippodcast.blogspot.com/2008/04/rip-250000-game-show-spectacular.html |accessdate=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides producing Hill-Eubanks's ''All Star Secrets'', the company also produced ''[[The Guinness Game]]'' in 1979–80, ''The [[Toni Tennille]] Show'' in 1980, [[Buddy Hackett]]'s ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' revival in 1980, and ''Infatuation'' (which Eubanks also hosted) in 1992. Between 1994 and 1995 Eubanks also traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to host a British version of this series, ''Infatuation UK'', (produced by Thames TV) for UK cable network [[Living (UK TV channel)|Living TV]]. Eubanks tried acting, but found he was not good at doing lines; he also learned the game show business was far more lucrative and less confining.&lt;ref name=Work&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oNMzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cuYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5273,5620753&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title=$500,000 For 35 Days' Work |author=Graham, Jefferson |date=May 22, 1988 |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob Eubanks likes his cake with icing |author=King, Richard |date=July 23, 1983 |newspaper=[[Merced Sun-Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Prior to entering game shows, Eubanks was a popular radio [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at station [[KRLA 1110]] in Los Angeles as well as a [[music promoter]] and manager, between 1960 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/04/local/me-then4 |title=In the AM radio wars of the '60s, they talked big and talked back |author=Harvey, Steve |date=October 4, 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for bringing [[The Beatles]] to [[Los Angeles]] for their first West Coast performances in 1964 and 1965 (mortgaging his house to do so),&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat98&gt;{{cite news |last=Hochman |first=Steve |title=KRLA's Switch to Talk Will End Rock Era on AM Dial in L.A.; Radio Some are nostalgic about a station that retained family appeal to the end.

==Other appearances==
In 1992, Eubanks appeared on the TV sitcom ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' in the episode "Eyes on the Prize" hosting the game show "Double Trouble." That same year, he also made a cameo in the movie ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' hosting the game show "Ding-Dang-Dong", where he mentioned that the show's contestants stayed at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]], and also gave the phone number for reservations (which allowed [[Kevin McCallister]], played by [[Macaulay Culkin]], to check in).

He has also hosted the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on Los Angeles television channel [[KTLA]] since 1976 and with [[Stephanie Edwards (TV personality)|Stephanie Edwards]] from 1978–2005.

He also hosted the some years the [[Miss California USA]] Pageant and [[Mrs. International Pageant]], sister pageant to the Miss International (United States) Pageant, between 2000 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pageantrymagazine.com/magazine/features/2001/d01/d01mrsintlwebed.html |title=Mrs. International Pageant: The Honeymoon Continues |work=Pageantry |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2007, Eubanks sat in as a celebrity "Mob Member" on the NBC [[game show]] ''[[1 vs. 100 (U.S. game show)|1 vs. 100]]''.

In 2011, Eubanks hosted a special version of ''The Newlywed Game'', live at Champion's Week for the ''[[NASCAR]]'' ''[[Sprint Cup Series]]''.

Eubanks briefly appears in the music video for [[The Offspring]]'s "[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|yR6A-Bk9eZQ|"Why Don't You Get A Job?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he appeared as a host of a couples game on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars (WE channel).

==Controversy==
He appeared in [[Michael Moore]]'s 1989 documentary ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]''. The film documented Moore's attempts to track [[General Motors]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger Smith]] to confront him about the company's impact on Flint, Michigan and Moore's claim that it was responsible for massive [[Layoff|downsizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EElOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8hMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7059,5746917&amp;dq=bob+eubanks&amp;hl=en |title='Roger &amp; Me' part of savagely funny film tradition |author=Wiley, Mason |date=June 30, 1980 |newspaper=[[Star-News]] |location=Wilmington, NC |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eubanks, a native of Flint, was interviewed about his views on the downsizing, and was filmed reciting an [[Off-color humor|off-color]] joke about AIDS:
{{
quote|MOORE: [In regards to ''The Newlywed Game'' containing racy/sexual content] Bob was right. He didn't say "breasts" and I considered apologizing for implying that his show wasn't wholesome family entertainment.
[cut to:]
EUBANKS: You know why Jewish women don't get AIDS? Because they marry assholes, they don't screw them. Pardon me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/r/roger-and-me-script-transcript.html |title=Roger And Me Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or Michael Moore movie |website=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
According to Moore in the film's DVD commentary, Eubanks attempted to denounce the film with the [[Anti-Defamation League]] for containing anti-Semitic content, despite the fact that he himself contributed the sole moment of anti-Semitic content present in the film.

The '''Border Region: Schools &amp; Youth Competitions''' structures established for the 2015-16 season group schools and clubs based on the development structures they have in place, the volume of teams they operate and results over recent seasons. The fixture programmes arranged by Scottish Rugby will guarantee blocks of 'school v school' or 'club v club' fixtures in the autumn phase of the season&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.scottishrugby.org/fixtures-results-schools-youth&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In December 2013 Scottish Rugby launched its strategic initiative ‘Youth Rugby – A Strategy for Schools’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottishrugbyforum.org/wp-content/wps-content/forum/735/795/1_sr_clubyouth_updateapril2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] rugby coach [[Frank Hadden]] conducted the review for [[Scottish Rugby]].&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/rugby/onus-on-scottish-rugby-to-stop-gold-spoon-from-devouring-schools-scene.121974225&lt;/ref&gt;

"In recent years youth rugby has had many changes in competition structure mainly based on the needs and wants of participating teams, some teams have thrived, some teams have struggled but change has been a constant and it is obvious that the current structure continues to be affected by; withdrawal of teams from leagues, weather, lack of competitive fixtures for some teams, a disjointed approach to fixturing, a reluctance by some to play on a regular basis. There is no doubt that the structure for youth rugby has reached a point where a radical change in approach is required to bring stability to our game."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottishrugbyforum.org/wp-content/wps-content/forum/735/795/1_sr_clubyouth_updateapril2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Markoff''' is a Yugoslavian/American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is best known for his appearances with [[professional wrestling promotion]]s in the [[Midwestern United States]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Pope2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristian Pope|title=Tuff Stuff Professional Wrestling Field Guide: Legend and Lore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcRlZN7dIP0C&amp;pg=PA294|date=14 August 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=1-4402-2810-8|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cagematch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=1993|title=Chris Markoff|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pierce2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Pierce|title=Wrestling in Akron|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqFpBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=10 June 2013|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4396-4350-1|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Markoff was born in [[Yugoslavia]] and raised in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pope2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RaceTritz2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Harley Race]]|author2=Gerry Tritz|title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKlr1fZuWIEC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2004|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=978-1-58261-818-0|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Markoff began his career in the Minneapolis-based [[American Wrestling Association]] in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="CagematchCareer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=1993&amp;page=20|title=Chris Markoff – Career|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managed by Professor Steve Druk, he feuded with [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]].&lt;ref name="Pope2005"/&gt; He became [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|AWA World Tag Team Champion]] with [[Harley Race]] in January 1967 after Race's original partner, [[Larry Hennig]], sustained a broken leg. Their reign ended in November 1967 when they were defeated by [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]] and [[Wilbur Snyder]].&lt;ref name="CagematchTitles"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=1993&amp;page=11|title=Chris Markoff – Titles|work=Cagematch.de|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, Markoff began wrestling for the [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]-based [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|World Wrestling Association]], where he formed a [[tag team]] with [[Angelo Poffo]] called "The Devil's Duo". Markoff and Poffo won the [[WWA World Tag Team Championship]] in 1966 and again in 1967.&lt;ref name="Lentz2011B"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M. Lentz III|title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH_GCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA338|date=9 May 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4175-4|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late-1960s, Markoff began competing for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]. He won the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] in 1969 and again in 1972.

In 1969, Markoff wrestled for the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]-based promotion [[NWA Hollywood Wrestling]]. Over the course of the year, he won the [[NWA Americas Tag Team Championship]] with Bronko Lubich, the [[NWA "Beat the Champ" Television Championship]], and the NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship ''(Los Angeles version)'' three times.&lt;ref name="PacificCoast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CagematchTitles"/&gt;

In 1972, Markoff toured Japan with the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|Japan Wrestling Association]], wrestling a series of matches against [[Apache Bull Ramos]]. Antagonism between Markoff and Ramos resulted in a legitimate brawl in a restaurant during which Ramos bit off part of Markoff's ear and Markoff bit off the tip of Ramos' finger.&lt;ref name="WilsonJohnson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Wilson|author2=Jim Wilson &amp; Weldon T.

In 1978, Markoff wrestled in New Zealand for All Star Pro Wrestling, briefly holding the [[NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship]]. In the same year, he wrestled in [[Hawaii]] for [[50th State Big Time Wrestling]], holding the [[NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship]] with [[Steve DiSalvo|Steve Strong]].

In 1981, Markoff joined the [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-based [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where he formed a tag team with [[Nikolai Volkoff]] called "The Imperial Russians". Managed by [[Lord Alfred Hayes]], the duo won the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship]] later that year.&lt;ref name="CagematchCareer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RobertsonRenwick2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lentz2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">The '''''Class sketch''''' is a [[comedy sketch]] first broadcast in an episode of [[David Frost]]'s satirical comedy programme ''[[The Frost Report]]'' on 7 April 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1150598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uknowotimean.com/funny-stuff/top-25-sketches/cleese-barker-corbett/|title=John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Ronnie Corbett, I Know My Place |publisher=www.uknowotimean.com |accessdate=2012-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "genuinely timeless sketch, ingeniously satirising the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|British class system]]"&lt;ref name = BFI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/852164/ |title=BFI Screenonline: Frost Report, The (1966–67) |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 was voted number 40 in [[Channel Four]]'s "Britain's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/old_story/278/ |title=BBC4 to celebrate The Frost Report |publisher=www.comedy.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html |title=Channel4&amp;nbsp;– 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches |publisher=www.channel4.com |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327141914/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html |archivedate=March 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Marty Feldman]] and [[John Law (writer)|John Law]],&lt;ref name = TVH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/shows_fi_to_fu.htm#frost_report |title=THE FROST REPORT&amp;nbsp;– A TELEVISION HEAVEN REVIEW |publisher=www.televisionheaven.co.uk |accessdate=2014-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and features [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]], and [[Ronnie Corbett]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:FrostReportClassSketch.jpg|thumb|Cleese, Barker, and Corbett in the sketch as broadcast in April 1966]]

Cleese, tall and [[Elitism|patrician]] in appearance and demeanour, represents the [[upper class]]; Barker, of average height, the [[middle class]], and Corbett, short in stature, the [[working class]]. Each in turn describes their social advantages and disadvantages, and contrasts them with their neighbours, an effect emphasised by the actors' relative heights as they look downwards or upwards to each other: {{quote|Barker: "I look up to him [Cleese] because he is upper class, but I look down on him [Corbett] because he is lower class."
Corbett: "I know my place."&lt;ref name = TVH/&gt;}}

It is this situation that gives Corbett the [[Punch line|pay-off line]]; as the others describe their advantages in the form of "I get&amp;nbsp;... (e.g. a sense of superiority)", his character finally looks up at the others and says "I get a pain in the back of my neck."&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thefrostreport/ |title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Comedy&amp;nbsp;– The Frost Report |publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
The [[British Film Institute]] commented, "Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment."&lt;ref name = BFI/&gt; The sketch's influence has persisted to the present day, having been referred to in 21st-century discussions of politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552095/Theres-no-way-up.html |title=There's no way up&amp;nbsp;– Telegraph |work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2010-04-21 |location=London |date=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Braham|first= Peter|author2=Linda Janes|year= 2002|publisher= Blackwell|isbn= 978-0-631-23310-7|page= 62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9rqacodOaAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=the+frost+report+an+understanding+of+class&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jURNHhCpTA&amp;sig=ihjcwImaeQRlcV_5Zgf4Lk5mJ-4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HTDPS6LCD82tsAbez725Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social differences and divisions|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/30/marina-hyde-manchester-city-united |title=Sir Alex's nod to Nancy Mitford | author=Marina Hyde |work=Guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-21 | location=London | date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoffs==
Ronnie Barker wrote scripts for three further "Three Classes" sketches featuring the same characters, comparing their family life, their leisure activities, and their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=All I Ever Wrote |last=Barker |first=Ronnie |isbn=9780283073342 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spinoff sketch was broadcast on the BBC Millennium programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JSahEDRjvw|title=The Two Ronnies - 2000 Today|author=ratpackmanreturns|date=15 December 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; satirising three eras of English history. [[Stephen Fry]] represents Modern Man, Barker a [[miller]] from the [[English Renaissance|Renaissance]], and Corbett a weaver serf from the [[Middle Ages]]. The basic premise of the sketch is no different from the original. The sketch was incorporated into ''[[The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything]]''.

==Copyright==

The estates of  Marty Feldman and John Law have apparently being aggressively pursuing copyright on the sketch which makes it difficult to access today.

'''''Clifford's Puppy Days''''' is an American [[animated television series|animated]] [[children's television series]] that originally aired on both [[PBS]] and [[PBS Kids]] from September 15, 2003 to February 23, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clifford's Puppy Days Volume 3|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00X4S9SJY|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prequel to the original ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', it features the adventures of Clifford during his puppy days before he became a big red dog and before moving to Birdwell Island.

The series was cancelled in February 2006 following low ratings,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} with very few PBS stations re-running it afterwards. Since then, occasional reruns continue to air.

In the UK the show aired on [[CBeebies]] from 2004 to early 2011  and like the original series, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original American soundtrack.

==Setting==
Set two years before the events of ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', the series focuses on when Clifford is a tiny red puppy, the runt of the litter in a litter of puppies given birth to by the pet dog of Emily Elizabeth's neighbor, Mr. Bradley (who appeared in an episode of the first cartoon series, "Little Clifford") and after he had been adopted by Emily Elizabeth and before he grew up into a giant red adult dog, forcing the Howards to move to Birdwell Island so Clifford would have plenty of room, the series shows Clifford and Emily Elizabeth's life and friends before they moved from the city to Birdwell Island and all of their adventures.

==Format==
The show followed the same format as its predecessor, ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]''.

*The opening theme is followed by the first central story, which is about the dogs, and a problem they face.
*Storytime with Speckle – Between the first and second story, Emily Elizabeth reads Clifford the Speckle Story, a small 60 seconds (approximately) time filler about a fictional dog (Speckle), and his animal friends.
*This is followed by another central story, about Emily Elizabeth and her friends.
*Clifford's Idea to Grow On – Before the credits, another 30-second short takes place called Clifford's Idea to Grow On. The short is basically an animation of an etiquette, a proverb, or basic truth such as "Play Fair", "Help Others", etc., with narration by Emily Elizabeth. This short was called Clifford's Big Idea in the previous series.

==Characters==
*'''Clifford''' (voiced by [[Lara Jill Miller]]; Lizzie Waterworth in the British version as a puppy) – Pet number 2 (but dog number 1) of Emily Elizabeth. A small puppy who is highly playful and always looks forward to meet new friends. He loves to play with his toys, eat dog treats, and like Daffodil he loves to take naps. His best friend is Jorge and his older sister is Daffodil (who is a rabbit), who cares very deeply for him.
*'''Emily Elizabeth Howard''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]; [[Joanna Ruiz]] in the British version) – The affectionate 8-year-old owner of Clifford and Daffodil. Her best friend is Nina. 
*'''Daffodil''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) – A [[Holland Lop]], pet number 1 of Emily Elizabeth, and also Clifford's helper, protector, and sister. She is portrayed as a very neat rabbit. She loves to take walks, take naps, eat carrots, and play with Clifford and her toys. Her catchphrase is "Sure I'm sure". She sometimes gets annoyed by Clifford, but whenever Clifford is crying, scared, needs help, or just feels alone, she is always there for him. In the first half of the series she was originally pink but her fur was changed to white in the second half.
*'''Nina''' (voiced by [[Masiela Lusha]]) – is the sweet and enthusiastic owner of Jorge. Her best friend is Emily Elizabeth. Sometimes, however, Nina is shown to be insensitive to others' feelings, which causes rifts between her and her friends, although they always make up in the end.
*'''Evan Thomas Taylor''' (voiced by [[Orlando Brown (actor)|Orlando Brown]]) – A boy who looks a few years older than Emily Elizabeth but nevertheless one of her best friends. He loves to play basketball. He is also a great skater and Emily learned how to skate from him.
*'''Shun''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]; [[Ben Small|Benjamin Small]] in the British version) – A young Japanese-American boy who is quiet, intelligent, and very proud of his Japanese heritage. He is a very close friend of Emily Elizabeth and Nina. Although he is not good at sports, he is always willing to give new things a try.
*'''Flo and Zo''' (voiced by LaTonya Holmes and [[Ogie Banks]], respectively) – Brother and sister, but twins of kittens who are very playful. They usually love to play with each other or play with their other friends. They are owned by Mr. Solomon. In the episodes "The Big, Big Present/Hanukkah Plunder Blunder," it is revealed that they and Mr. Solomon are Jewish.
*'''Jorge/George (UK)''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]; [[Ben Small|Benjamin Small]] in the British version) – A brown [[dachshund]] who loves to have fun with his best friend, Clifford. His owner is Nina.
*'''Norville''' (voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]; Tom Eastwood in the British version) – A bird who always has problems. He often calls Clifford "little red" or "pup".
*'''Mr. Solomon''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]) – A wheelchair-bound writer. Flo and Zo are his two pet kittens. In the episodes "The Big, Big Present/Hanukkah Plunder Blunder," it is revealed that he, Flo, and Zo are Jewish.
*'''The Sidarskis''' – A family of mice who live in the laundromat. They have five playful children, Lucy, Lewis, Sophie, Sid, and a new baby.
*'''Tricksie''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) - An elderly dog who once performed in the circus with her owner, Mrs. Z. She has little interaction with Clifford and his friends, but is still very friendly to them.
*'''Mrs. Z''' - An elderly Italian woman who was once in the circus, and Trixie's owner. She is shown to be quite kind towards the kids.
*'''Bebe''' (voiced by [[Jill Talley]]) – A [[Golden Retriever]] [[Guide dog|Seeing-eye dog]], who joins in on Clifford and his friends' fun whenever she can spare the time. She belongs to a blind girl named Jenny.
*'''Jenny''' (voiced by Dionne Quan) - A blind girl and Bebe's owner. While she is blind, Jenny has unusually high situational awareness, being able to tell where things are without even touching them. She demonstrates expertise in botany and gardening, helping the kids to plant a willow tree.

}}

The '''Content Scramble System''' ('''CSS''') is a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and [[encryption]] system employed on many commercially produced [[DVD-Video]] discs. CSS utilizes a [[wikt:proprietary|proprietary]] [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]] [[stream cipher]] algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.

CSS is one of several complementary systems designed to [[DVD-Video#Restrictions|restrict DVD-Video]] access.

It has been superseded by newer DRM schemes such as [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM), or by [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) in the [[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS) DRM scheme used by [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], which have 56-bit and 128-bit [[key size]]s, respectively, providing a much higher [[level of security]] than the less secure 40-bit key size of CSS.

==Preliminary note==

The content scramble system (CSS) is a collection of proprietary protection mechanisms for [[DVD-Video]] discs. CSS attempts to restrict access to the content only for licensed applications. According to the [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (CCA), which is the consortium that grants licenses, CSS is supposed to protect the intellectual property rights of the content owner.

The details of CSS are only given to licensees for a fee. The license,&lt;ref name=css-license&gt;[http://www.dvdcca.org/Documents/CSS_license_ver_1_2.pdf DVD CCA CSS License Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530224136/http://www.dvdcca.org/Documents/CSS_license_ver_1_2.pdf |date=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which binds the licensee to a [[non-disclosure agreement]], wouldn't permit the development of [[open-source software]] for DVD-Video playback. Instead, there is [[libdvdcss]], a [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] implementation of CSS. Libdvdcss is a source for documentation, along with the publicly available [[DVD]]-ROM-&lt;ref name=ecma267&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-267.pdf Standard ECMA-267, 3rd edition, 2001, 120 mm DVD - Read-Only Disk]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SCSI Multimedia Commands|MMC]]-&lt;ref name=mmc5&gt;[http://www.t10.org/cgi-bin/ac.pl?t=f&amp;f=mmc5r04.pdf Multi-Media Commands - 5 (Working Draft) T10/1675D, Revision 4, 2006-10-24]&lt;/ref&gt; specifications. There has also been some effort to collect CSS details from various sources.&lt;ref name=css-study&gt;[https://github.com/helo2804/css_study/raw/release.1/doc/CSS.pdf The Content Scramble System – A Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD-Video can be produced with or without CSS. The publisher may for instance decide to go without CSS protection to save license and production costs.

==Introduction==

The content scramble system deals with three participants: the disc, the drive and the player. The disc holds the copyright information and the encrypted feature. The drive provides the means to read the disc. The player decrypts and presents the audio and visual content of the feature. All participants must conform to the CCA's license agreement.

There are three protection methods:
*Playback protection is based on encryption: the player requires a secret key to decrypt the feature. 
*Read protection is based on the drive: access to significant disc data is only granted if the player authenticates successfully. 
*Regional restriction is based on the disc and the drive: the drive can deny access if the disc doesn't belong to the drive's region.

The first two protection methods have been broken. Circumvention of regional protection is not possible with every drive -- even if the drive grants access to the feature, prediction of title keys may fail.&lt;ref name=css-study&gt;[https://github.com/helo2804/css_study/raw/release.1/doc/CSS.pdf The Content Scramble System – A Study]&lt;/ref&gt; However, drives which do not enforce regional restrictions are inexpensive and widely available, which makes regional restrictions largely ineffective as a component of CSS.

==The disc==
The DVD-ROM's main-data (§16&lt;ref name=ecma267 /&gt;), which are consecutive logical blocks of 2048 bytes, are structured according to the DVD-Video format. The DVD-Video contains (besides others) an [[MPEG program stream]] which consists of so-called Packs. If CSS is applied to the disc then a subset of all Packs is encrypted with a title-key.

A DVD-ROM contains, besides the main-data, additional data areas. CSS stores there:
*a flag that indicates whether CSS is applied or not (§6.23.3.2.2&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;),
*the 8-bit region-management-information ([[DVD region code|region code]]),
*a disc-key-block that holds 409 encrypted variants of the disc-key (§6.23.3.2.3&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;).

CSS also uses six bytes in the frame header for each logical block of user data (§16.3,&lt;ref name=ecma267 /&gt;§6.29.3.1.5&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;):
*one byte with copyright management information,
*five bytes holding an encrypted title-key.

==The drive==
The drive treats a DVD-Video disc as any DVD-ROM disc. The player reads the disc's user-data and processes them according to the DVD-Video format. However, if the drive detects a disc that has been compiled with CSS, it denies access to logical blocks that are marked as copyrighted (§6.15.3&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;). The player has to execute an authentication handshake first (§4.10.2.2&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;). The authentication handshake is also used to retrieve the disc-key-block and the title-keys.

The drive may also support [[Regional Playback Control]] (RPC) to limit the playback of DVD-Video content to specific regions of the world (§3.3.26&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;). RPC Phase II drives hold an 8-bit region-code and adhere to all requirements of the CSS license agreement (§6.29.3.1.7&lt;ref name=mmc5 /&gt;). It appears that RPC Phase II drives reject title-key requests on region mismatch. However, reading of user-data may still work.&lt;ref name=css-study /&gt;

==The cipher==
CSS employs a [[stream cipher]] and mangles the [[keystream]] with the plain-text data to produce the cipher text.&lt;ref name=cryptanalysis /&gt; The stream cipher is based on two [[linear feedback shift register]] (LFSR) and set up with a 40-bit seed.

Mangling depends on the type of operation. There are three types: 
*the decryption of a disc- or title-key, 
*the decryption of a Pack and 
*the encryption of keys for the authentication handshake.

In order to decrypt a DVD-Video, the player reads the disc-key-block and uses its player-key to decrypt the disc-key. Thereafter, the player reads the title-keys and decrypts them with the disc-key. A different title-key can be assigned for the [[DVD-Video#Directory and file structure|Video Manager]] and for each [[DVD-Video#Directory and file structure|Video Title Set]]. The title-keys are used to decrypt the Packs.&lt;ref name=css-study /&gt;

==Cryptanalysis==
CSS employs cryptographic keys with a size of only 40 bits. This makes CSS vulnerable to a [[brute-force attack]]. At the time CSS was introduced, it was forbidden in the United States for manufacturers to [[Export of cryptography in the United States|export]] cryptographic systems employing keys in excess of 40 bits, a key length that had already been shown to be wholly inadequate in the face of increasing computer processing power (see [[Data Encryption Standard]]).

Based on the leaked [[DeCSS]] source-code, [[Frank A. Stevenson]] published in November 1999 three exploits that rendered the CSS cipher practically ineffective:&lt;ref name=cryptanalysis&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dvd-copy.com/news/cryptanalysis_of_contents_scrambling_system.htm | title=Cryptanalysis of Contents Scrambling System | date=November 8, 1999 | author=[[Frank A. Stevenson]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302000206/http://www.dvd-copy.com/news/cryptanalysis_of_contents_scrambling_system.htm | archivedate=March 2, 2000 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[correlation attack]] enables the recovery of a keystream's seed at complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The mangling of disc- and title-keys can be reversed at a complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.
*A disc-key can be recovered from its hash-value at a complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;.
The latter exploit recovers a disk-key from its hash-value in less than 18 seconds on an Intel Pentium III @ 450&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The CSS design was prepared for the leak of a few player-keys. New discs wouldn't contain an encrypted variant for these player-keys in the disc-key-block. However, Stevenson's exploits made it possible to generate all player-keys. [[Libdvdcss]] uses such a list of generated player-keys.

There are cases when no title-keys are available. A drive may deny access on region mismatch but still permit reading of the encrypted DVD-Video. Ethan Hawke presented a plain-text prediction for data repetitions in the [[MPEG program stream]] that enables the recovery of title-keys in real-time directly from the encrypted DVD-Video.&lt;ref name=prediction&gt;[https://cyberside.net.ee/ripping/DeCSSplus_v1.0.zip Ethan Hawke: DeCSSplus (Source Code)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Geeks Bearing Gifts]]'', author [[Ted Nelson]] states "DVD encryption was intentionally made light by the DVD encryption committee, based on arguments in a libertarian book [[Computer Lib]].", a claim cited as originating from personal communication with an [[anonymous source]]; Nelson is the author of ''Computer Lib''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Ted|title=Geeks bearing gifts : how the computer world got this way|year=2008|publisher=Mindful Press|location=Sausalito, CA|isbn=978-0-578-00438-9|pages=199|edition=Ed. 1.0.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After a brief tenure at Fox Filmed Entertainment, Patwa was hired by Disney ABC Television as a director of business development.  She remained at Disney ABC until 2008, when she joined [[William Morris Endeavor]] (WME) as Vice President, Intellectual Property.  She was named Senior Vice President and Head of Strategic Planning and Business Development in 2009.&lt;ref name="LA Times El Rey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Daniel|title=FactoryMade builds up cast of Hollywood players for El Rey Network|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-ct-factorymade-20130910-story.html#page=1|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At WME, in addition to working with [[Telefonica]] and [[JC Penney]],  Patwa served as an advisor to [[Hasbro]] on the ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra|GI Joe]]'' film franchises.  She consulted on the creation of [[Hasbro Studios]]' [[Hub Network]] (with [[Discovery Communications]]) and on the development and launch of [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]]'s HSN Arcade.   Patwa worked closely with WME founding board member [[John Fogelman]] during her three-year tenure at the company.&lt;ref name="LA Times El Rey" /&gt;

In 2011, Patwa and Fogelman left WME to found FactoryMade Ventures.  At launch, the company announced initial alliances with [[Telefonica]], Hasbro, [[RTL Group]],  Michael Bay, [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Thom Beers]] and Whoopi Goldberg, in addition to J.J. Abrams, who was then a principal investor. Abrams withdrew from the company in January 2012, reportedly due to his schedule.&lt;ref name=Deadline&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finke|first1=Nikki|title=J.J.

'''Dual role''' (also known as '''double role''', '''triple role''' and '''multiple role''') refers to one actor playing two or more roles, which may be deliberately scripted in a play or film, or merely be a by-product of a low budget.  In a theatrical production where more than one actor plays multiple characters, it is sometimes referred to as an "Ironman" cast. In film and television, a dual role is commonly used either for comic effect or to depict [[identical twin]]s.

==Theatre==
In [[theatre]], the use of multiple roles may be budget-related, may be intended to give an accomplished actor more stage time or a greater challenge, or may be of thematic significance to the story. The combination of factors leading to such a decision may often remain unknown. For example, debate exists over the significance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of dual roles, with a notable example being whether the characters of Cordelia and the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' were intended to be one and the same.

More recent examples include:

* In stage productions of ''[[Peter Pan]]'', it is a tradition for Mr. Darling and Captain Hook to be played by the same actor, a tradition often continued in film adaptations with the actors playing dual roles.

* In the works of [[absurdism|absurdists]] such as [[Tom Stoppard]], characters played by the same actor are often of thematic significance. 

* In [[Tony Kushner]]'s ''[[Angels in America]]'', a cast of eight actors are each assigned multiple roles for reasons that may include encouraging the audience to consider the elasticity of gender and sexual identities.

* In the musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', four actors/actresses are cast in dual roles, each a major supporting character, with a change of roles between the first and second acts. The actors who play [[John Laurens]]/[[Philip Hamilton]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]/[[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]]/[[James Madison]] wear identical white costumes in the opening song, "[[Alexander Hamilton (song)|Alexander Hamilton]]", and were given lines with intentional double meanings that would fit either of their dual roles.&lt;ref name=MirandaMcCarter2016/&gt; The actress who plays [[Peggy Schuyler]]/[[Maria Reynolds]] is also double casted. 

== Film ==
{{See also|List of actors who have played multiple roles in the same film}}
===Hollywood===
''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', based on a book about a lookalike who assumes the identity of a king, includes a dual role that has been played by [[Lewis Stone]] ([[The Prisoner of Zenda (1922 film)|1922 version]]), [[Ronald Colman]] ([[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|1937 version]]), [[Stewart Granger]] ([[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|1952 version]]), and [[Peter Sellers]] ([[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|1979 version]]).

An early and unusual example of double casting was the 1925 silent film ''[[Lady of the Night]]'', in which two women were portrayed by [[Norma Shearer]] to spotlight their very different social classes, and nobody took any notice of their identical appearance.

In ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), the actors who played the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow also played farmhands in scenes set in Kansas. [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] played both the roles of Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West, and [[Frank Morgan]] played multiple characters in addition to the title role of the Wizard.

[[Lee Marvin]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for a dual role in ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), and [[Nicolas Cage]] was nominated for Best Actor for a dual role in ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' (2002).

In some low-budget films, actors have been cast in more than one role to save money. For example, in one of [[Peter Jackson]]'s early films, ''[[Bad Taste]]'', Jackson played two characters; in one scene, one of them tortures the other.

Multiple casting has been used for comic effect in film, with notable examples that include:
* Peter Sellers in movies such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1979)
* [[Mike Myers]] in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'' film series]] (1997–2002)
* [[Buster Keaton]] in his 1921 film ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'', playing nearly every part

Particularly in comedies, multiple casting has often included the casting of an actor as multiple members of the same family. For example:
* In the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' franchise]], actor [[Michael J. Fox]] played [[Marty McFly]] and McFly's son and daughter, including an appearance as all three characters at the same time in a dinner scene, while [[Thomas F. Wilson]] played [[Biff Tannen]], his grandson [[Griff Tannen]], and his great-grandfather Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen.
* [[Alec Guinness]] played all eight members of one family in ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949).
* [[Eddie Murphy]] played the title character and almost every member of his family in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1996) and [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps|its sequel]] (2000).

===India and Bollywood===
Prior to [[Bollywood]], the first double role in Indian cinema was played by [[Ashok Kumar]] in his film [[Kismet (1943 film)|''Kismet'']] in 1943. [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film]] actor [[M. N. Nambiar]] played eleven parts in the early 1950s film ''Digambara Samiyar'', as a sage using nine disguises to defeat an evil lawyer.

Starting in the 1970s, having a living double in a Bollywood film became "almost a genre in itself," according to filmmaker [[Govind Nihalani]].&lt;ref name=Gulzar2003/&gt; The first double role in Bollywood, played by [[Amitabh Bachchan]], was in the film ''[[Bandhe Haath]]'' in 1973. ''[[Angoor (1982 film)|Angoor]]'' (1982) featured two pairs of identical twins, played by [[Sanjeev Kumar]] and [[Deven Verma]].  Another Tamil actor, [[Kamal Hassan]], had ten roles in the 2008 film ''[[Dasavathaaram]] (The Ten Avatars)''. [[Sivaji Ganesan]] played nine roles in the Tamil film ''Navarathiri''. [[Priyanka Chopra]] played the roles of twelve eligible girls in the movie ''[[What's Your Raashee?]]'', and [[Mehmood Ali]] portrayed three generations of the Kapoor family (Prithviraj, Raj, and Randhir) in the movie ''[[Humjoli]]''.

==Television==
In [[television]], [[soap opera]]s commonly use the technique to either portray [[twins]] (or even similar looking relatives), or to bring an actor back whose character has been killed. This technique is uncommon, although not unheard of, in [[primetime]] television. In ''[[Friends]]'', Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe and her twin sister Ursula. David Schwimmer played a character in heavy make-up named Russ, who was a parody of Ross (played by Schwimmer), both of whom appear on screen together.

In the 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode titled "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]", as well as its sequels in episodes of three later ''Star Trek'' series (''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]''), several of the regular characters visited or switched places with morally-inverted counterparts from a parallel [[Mirror Universe]], with the actors playing dual roles.

In the third season of ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'', [[Ewan McGregor]] was cast in the lead dual role as the brothers Emmit and Ray Stussy.

''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' [[The Originals (TV series)|franchise]] features [[Nina Dobrev]] playing four roles (doppelgangers [[Elena Gilbert]], Katerina Petrova, Tatia, and their progenitor Amara) and [[Paul Wesley]] playing three roles (doppelgangers [[Stefan Salvatore]], Tom Avery, and their progenitor Silas).

''[[The Lying Game]]'' and ''[[Liv and Maddie]]'' both feature twins played by the same actress ([[Alexandra Chando]] and [[Dove Cameron]], respectively).

The '''Dumas Brothel''' was a [[bordello]] in [[Butte, Montana]]. The brothel was founded by [[French Canadian]] brothers Joseph and Arthur Nadeau in 1890 and named after the nominal owner, Delia Nadeau, {{Nee}} Dumas, who was Joseph's wife.  It grew considerably through the years, with the miners employed by the city's [[Anaconda Copper|copper mines]] often patronizing the establishment.  After several changes of the "madams" and continuing pressure from authorities, the brothel closed in 1982, described as "a rare, intact commentary on social history". At the time of its closure, it was the longest operating brothel in the United States, having operated years after prostitution was made illegal. After closing, the brothel changed hands several times, eventually becoming a tourist attraction owned and managed by a series of Butte residents.

==Background==
In the 1870s, a group of women, called "ladies of the line", began selling sexual services on Park Street, in the north of the city of [[Butte, Montana]].&lt;ref name="Baumler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baumler|first1=Ellen|title=Devil's Perch: Prostitution from Suite to Cellar in Butte, Montana|url=http://mhs.mt.gov/Portals/11/education/docs/CirGuides/Baumler%20Butte%201998.pdf|publisher=[[Montana Historical Society]]|accessdate=11 January 2015|date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} When the tents and shacks on the street were replaced with legitimate businesses some years later, the "Park Street girls", as they had come to be known, moved to the south of the city. By the mid-1880s, a variety of dance halls, gambling houses and saloons had appeared in the city. By 1888, Butte's East Galena Street was lined with brothels; in fact, nearly every building on the street housed prostitution. This area of Galena Street would come to be known as the "twilight zone".&lt;ref name="Baumler" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Paramount to these establishments was the Casino Theater, a mixture of a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]], dance hall and brothel. In the late 19th century, several prominent Montanans owned brothels in Butte, including [[Lee Mantle]], who would go on to be a [[United States Senator]], and Anton M. Holter, a wealthy businessman from [[Helena, Montana]].&lt;ref name="Baumler" /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

Two [[French Canadian]] brothers, Joseph and Arthur Nadeau, would eventually acquire the most property in Butte's prostitution areas, or "[[red light district]]". The brothers built a brothel in 1890 on 45 East Mercury Street and named it for Delia Nadeau, {{Nee}} Dumas, Joseph's wife.&lt;ref name="MacKell" /&gt; By the turn of the century, there were three high-class sex houses in Butte: the Hotel Victoria, the Windsor Hotel and the Dumas Brothel, also called the Dumas Hotel.&lt;ref name="Baumler" /&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

==Description==
The Dumas Brothel Museum is a two-story brick building at the north side of east Mercury street in the historic city of Butte, Montana.  It also includes a basement level containing clandestine underground tunnels. There is a single story addition that was added to the rear of the main structure in 1912,  and this leads directly onto the infamous brick- lined "Venus Alley", once the hub of Butte's red light district.  The original structure features original vaulted skylights, and the upper level is surrounded by an interior balcony, which still provides a birds eye view for on-lookers to glimpse the suites (or "cribs") below. The basement afforded much more basic accommodations, and was built to connect the Dumas to Butte's business corridor via a subterranean tunnel system. 

The Dumas Brothel was purchased by natives Michael Piche and Travis Eskelsen, who have been working to restore the building.  They operate a museum and provide tours of the brothel beginning each spring and lasting until fall.  Recently, they have added an antique shop and  a souvenir gift shop, with plans to come that include opening a bed and breakfast at the site.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulliford|first1=Andrew|title=Preserving Western History|date=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0826333109}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}} After the death of Piche in 2018, Eskelsen put the building up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kbzk.com/story/37249879/historic-dumas-brothel-up-for-sale |title=Historic Dumas Brothel up for sale |last=Emeigh |first=John |date=January 11, 2018 |website=[[KXLF-TV]] |publisher=[[Evening Post Industries]] |access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and operations==
Scant details are known about the early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early boarders of the house listed their occupations as "gambler" and "saloon man" in census records.&lt;ref name="MacKell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKell|first1=Jan|title=Red Light Women of the Rocky Mountains|date=2009|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=082634612X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The cost of sex in the brothel at the turn of the 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}}  Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; These businesses were frequented by miners from the local [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Copper Mining Company]].&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|6}} That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building "cribs" (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|4–6; 15}}&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel. A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts,&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, the girls would attract prospective clients while being in varying states of undress.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|12}} The ''Butte Miner'', a local newspaper, explained how the girls did this:

{{Quote|With an abandon that has no trace of modesty in it, these women lean out of their windows and address the vilest kind of language imaginable to people passing on the street, or else boldly make their appearance on the thoroughfare and visit from one crib to another.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|12}}}}

The Dumas's business and those like it were criticized by a number of people who sought to reform the red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," and that he saw "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it." Biederwolf held [[Revival meeting|revival services]] for residents which attracted "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's [[dry cleaners]] and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for [[birth control]] potions and [[venereal disease]] remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they "refrain from any indecent exposures." After these ordinances were put in place, the ''Butte Miner'' reported that "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|13–16}}

In 1913 the brothel was expanded again. A one-story structure was added to the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|16}} The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916,&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[World War I]] and the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] impelled local lawmakers to initiate a crackdown on Butte's red light district; by 1917, the district was effectively closed. Signs saying "Men Under 21 Keep Out" were commonplace,&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|17}} and in [[United States Census, 1920|the next census]], prostitution had completely disappeared as a declared profession in Butte. The Dumas, however, remained in operation. In 1925 Anne Vallet began overseeing the Dumas for the Nadeau family, and in the 1930s, operations had passed to Madam Rose Davis. In 1940 Lillian Walden and her husband Dick began running the brothel,&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; raising the price of sex at the brothel to $2.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} Three years later, the US government ordered all brothels shut down to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among soldiers in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|17}} In response, the Dumas began operating even more furtively, now under the guise of being a boardinghouse.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; The "window-shopping" was abandoned completely and a heavy steel door was installed at the back of the Dumas with a small sliding window; customers would only gain entrance after the sliding window was opened and their identity was acknowledged.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; Additionally, doorbells were added and a code system for dealing with troublesome guests was also employed.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt;

When Lillian Walden retired in 1950, the price for a woman at the brothel was $5.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} Afterwards, the Dumas's operations went to Elinore Knott. The Nadeaus also ceased being owners of the brothel around this time.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; Knott's management of the Dumas was short. In 1955 she committed suicide after her [[Extramarital affair|lover]] died of a heart attack.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; When the late 1960s came about, several local police officers were taking the initiative to close the three operating high-class sex houses: Hotel Victoria, Windsor Hotel and the Dumas.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|20}} The Dumas did not remain closed for long however, with its next madam, Bonita Farren, operating it from 1955 until her death from [[cancer]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt; In 1970 the Dumas was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a "Victorian Brothel" and an active house of prostitution.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} By the following year, Ruby Garret, a local resident of Butte for some thirty years, had purchased the Dumas. Garret would pay local police officers and officials $200 to $300 a month in return for their silence about the Dumas's activities.&lt;ref name="Baumler"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Under Garrett, the cost of a prostitute was $20.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} She would come upon financial difficulties however, being charged with [[tax evasion]] in 1981. The Dumas Brothel was closed the following year.&lt;ref name="MacKell"/&gt;

==After closure==

In 1982 Ruby Garrett, the last madam of the Dumas, was convicted of federal tax evasion and served six months in prison.&lt;ref name="Missoulian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gevock|first1=Nick|title=Ruby Garrett, owner of Butte's Dumas Brothel, dies at 94|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/ruby-garrett-owner-of-butte-s-dumas-brothel-dies-at/article_13ef83f0-729c-11e1-99cb-001871e3ce6c.html|website=Missoulian.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothel was closed soon after, but not before a robbery took place there.&lt;ref name="Missoulian"/&gt; When it closed, it was the longest operating brothel in the United States,&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Laura|title=Last madame of Montana dies at 94 - after a colourful career including shooting her husband over a card table|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117909/Last-madame-Montana-dies-94--colourful-career-including-shooting-husband-card-table.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having operated for 92 years, long after prostitution was outlawed.&lt;ref name="Missoulian"/&gt;

Garret sold the Dumas to an antiques dealer named Rudy Giecek on the condition that it was preserved in its original state.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228}} Giecek turned the brothel into a museum and operated it as such for most of the 1990s. However, in 1998 Giecek encountered financial difficulties and attempted to sell the building. The International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture and Education (ISWFACE) responded. The ISWFACE sought to reopen the Dumas as not only a museum but also a gallery and convention center.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|228–229}} Ellen Baumler of the [[National Register of Historic Places]] wrote in support for the rescue of the Dumas that "[it] is not only significant as the last standing parlor house in this area of Butte, but also because of its length of operation as a rare, intact commentary on social history."&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|229}} Some were against the restoration of the Dumas, including former prostitutes in Butte, but the operation proceeded—at least until September 2000, when Giecek claimed the ISWFACE owed him $52,000 in wages for work performed at the Dumas. Giecek sued and was granted the wages he petitioned for and additional penalties. The business deal with ISWFACE was terminated however.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|229}} In the years that followed, the Dumas was put up for auction twice as Giecek did not have the money to maintain the building.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|229}}

In late May 2005 Giecek was escorting a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter through the Dumas for an interview when he discovered the place had been broken into.&lt;ref name="DenverChannel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare Sex Toys Stolen From Brothel Museum|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/rare-sex-toys-stolen-from-brothel-museum|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=[[KMGH-TV|The Denver Channel]]|date=25 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Kirk|title=Dark Days for a Reminder of the Wild, Wild West in Montana|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/30/national/30butte.html?_r=0|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giecek, low on funds and worried about his health, had shut down the Dumas earlier that month after it had operated offering $5 tours.&lt;ref name="Gulliford"/&gt;{{rp|231}}&lt;ref name="DenverChannel"/&gt; After the robbery, Giecek discovered "dismantled beds, stolen antique lamps and artwork and emptied glass cases full of brothel artifacts" as well as missing "rare sex toys".&lt;ref name="DenverChannel"/&gt;

In June 2012 the Dumas was conveyed to new owners, locals Michael Piche and Travis Eskelson.&lt;ref name="Missoulian2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trainor|first1=Tim|title=Butte men buy historic Dumas Brothel|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/butte-men-buy-historic-dumas-brothel/article_c36b1f18-c915-11e1-a341-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=The Missoulian|date=8 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="8KPAX"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Katy|title=Historic Butte brothel to get new life|url=http://www.kpax.com/news/historic-butte-brothel-to-get-new-life/|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=8KPAX.com|date=5 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150117113830/http://www.kpax.com/news/historic-butte-brothel-to-get-new-life/|archivedate=17 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time however, the building was in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof.&lt;ref name="Missoulian2"/&gt; The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year,&lt;ref name="Missoulian2"/&gt; but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast.&lt;ref name="8KPAX"/&gt; "It needs to be around. It needs to be here for the rest of the community and the people who want to visit it," said Piche.&lt;ref name="8KPAX"/&gt; In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte.&lt;ref name="MontanaStandard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Mike|title=Historic Dumas Brothel wants URA loan|url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/historic-dumas-brothel-wants-ura-loan/article_2b0a48ca-6d06-11e3-9663-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=The Montana Standard|date=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant.&lt;ref name="MontanaStandard"/&gt; As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.&lt;ref name="MontanaStandard"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4956">The '''Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria''' ('''FRCN''') is [[Nigeria]]'s publicly funded radio broadcasting organization. Its subsidiary is the domestic radio network known as Radio Nigeria, with FM stations across the 36 states and Zonal station in the 6 geopolitical zones that broadcast on the SW.

==History==
The Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria was founded in 1933 by the British colonial government. Named the Radio Diffusion Service (RDS), it allowed the public to hear the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s foreign radio service broadcasts in certain public locations over loudspeakers.&lt;ref name="FRCNweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceofnigeria.org/about.htm |title=About the FRCN |publisher=Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria |access-date=2008-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327101126/http://www.voiceofnigeria.org/about.htm |archivedate=2008-03-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1950, the RDS became the Nigerian Broadcasting Service and introduced radio stations in [[Lagos]], [[Kaduna]], [[Enugu]], [[Ibadan]], and [[Kano]]. This service was reorganized into the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) on April 1, 1957, by act of parliament. Its mission was to "provide, as a public service, independent and impartial broadcasting services". By 1962 the NBC had expanded its broadcast stations into [[Sokoto]], [[Maiduguri]], [[Ilorin]], [[Zaria]], [[Jos]], and [[Katsina]] in the north; [[Port Harcourt]], [[Calabar]], and [[Onitsha]] in the East; and [[Abeokuta]], [[Warri]], and [[Ijebu-Ode]] in the West. Each of these stations was considered a subsidiary station of a regional station. The subsidiary stations broadcast local interest programs during part of the day, and then relayed programming from their regional station during the rest of the broadcast day. National programs were broadcast from two [[shortwave]] transmitters and one [[medium wave]] transmitter located in [[Sogunle]], near Lagos.&lt;ref name="Yearbook1962"&gt;{{cite book |title= Nigeria Year Book 1962 |publisher= [[Daily Times of Nigeria]] |year= 1962|pages= 151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1960, the Federal Parliament amended the NBC Ordinance to allow the sale of commercial [[advertisements]]. The first ads ran on October 31, 1961, and were broadcast from Lagos. By 1962 regional and provincial broadcasters began selling ads to local businesses. The goal of allowing radio advertisements was to help provide additional funding to NBC stations beyond that received from the government.&lt;ref name="Yearbook1962"/&gt;

The Federal Parliament approved the creation of the [[Voice of Nigeria]] (VON) external shortwave service in 1961. Broadcasts began on January 1, 1961, from [[Lagos State]]. Its initial operations were limited to two hours a day to West Africa, but by 1963 VON had expanded both its coverage and transmission times with the addition of five additional transmitters.&lt;ref name="VON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceofnigeria.org/about.htm |title=About Voice of Nigeria |publisher=Voice of Nigeria |accessdate=2008-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327101126/http://www.voiceofnigeria.org/about.htm |archivedate=2008-03-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In April 1961, with financial assistance from the [[Ford Foundation]] and technical assistance from the British Broadcasting Corporation, NBC began the National School Broadcasting Service in April 1961. The NBC Schools unit broadcast lessons in various school subjects for primary and secondary schools, as well as special programs for teacher training colleges. The Schools unit was based in [[Ibadan]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook1962"/&gt;

The NBC and the Broadcasting Corporation of Northern Nigeria (BCNN) were merged in 1978 to become the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN). Mediumwave transmitters previously owned by the NBC were transferred to the individual state governments where the transmitters were located. At the same time, the states transferred shortwave transmitters to the FRCN.&lt;ref name="FRCNweb"/&gt;

In 1996, VON installed three high power transmitters at its [[Ikorodu]] transmitter site, allowing worldwide transmissions for the first time.&lt;ref name="VON"/&gt;

==FRCN Today==
FRCN's medium wave service, Radio Nigeria, has 25 stations located throughout the country, and together with Voice of Nigeria, considers itself to have the largest radio network in Africa.&lt;ref name="FRCNweb"/&gt; In 2007, FRCN began introducing FM transmitters in some locations, and plans to begin upgrading and modernizing its shortwave and medium wave transmitters in the coming years&lt;ref name="VON"/&gt;

The '''Gambling Act 2005''' (2005 c 19) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It mainly applies to [[England and Wales]], and to [[Scotland]], and is designed to control all forms of [[gambling]].  It transfers authority for licensing gambling from the [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s to local authorities (specifically unitary authorities, and the councils of metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district and London boroughs), or to Scottish [[licensing board]]s. The Act also created the [[Gambling Commission]].

The Act gives its objectives as
{{quote|1=&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by gambling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
}}

Some provisions of the bill faced controversy, particularly in its original form, where it would have allowed eight so-called "[[super casino]]s" to be set up.  With the Parliamentary session drawing to a close, a compromise was agreed to reduce this to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4412949.stm | title=Climbdown saves super casino plan | publisher=[[BBC News website]] | date=2005-04-05 | accessdate=2007-08-09 | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lengthy bidding process, with [[Manchester]] being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after [[Gordon Brown]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7264143.stm | work=BBC News | title=Super-casino proposal is ditched | date=2008-02-26 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also specifically regulates [[Online gambling|Internet gambling]] for the first time. 

The law permits gambling companies to advertise on television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuben |first1=Anthony |title=Premier League shirts row: The fickle fashions of sponsorship |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45440347 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is wide-ranging including regulation of  lotteries.  The "no purchase necessary" clause on on-product promotions and semi-legal competitions went, replaced with the so-called "New Zealand Model" where purchase may be a requirement, if the purchase is at the "normal selling price".

The Act, together with regulations and specifications developed by the Gambling Commission, define and in some cases redefine, categories of gaming machines and where they are allowed to be placed.

From 1 December 2014, the Gambling (Licensing &amp; Advertising) Act 2014 contributed several updates to the Act, including a requirement that all off-shore gambling brands apply for a licence from the Gambling Commission and submit to a 15% point of consumption (POC) tax on gross profits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightcasino.com/news/new-uk-gambling-law-explained/ "New UK gambling law explained: what's all the fuss about?"

The '''[[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal''' was awarded between 1980 and 2011.

The award was discontinued after the 2011 award season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all solo or duo/group performances (including instrumental performance) in the rock category were shifted to the newly formed '''[[Best Rock Performance]]''' category.

[[U2]] hold the record for most awards with a total of seven, followed by [[Aerosmith]] with a total of four.

'''''Hammer Heads''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[arcade game]] similar to [[Whac-A-Mole]]. It is developed by Nuclide Games and distributed by [[PopCap Games]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:HammerHead.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Players' objective is to smash the gnomes.]]
The objective of the game is to smash the gnomes coming from the holes in the game area. The player controls a hammer with the mouse, and clicking on the gnomes reduces their hearts, displayed on the bottom of the gnome, depending on the power of the hammer. The default hammer takes away one heart, but more powerful hammers can be bought at the shop. There are various gnomes in the game, with different health and characteristics. Care must be taken to avoid clicking on traps, such as bombs. The player starts with five hearts, which is reduced when a click misses, a gnome escapes, or a trap is activated. They can be recovered by clicking on the hearts dropped by gnomes, or purchasing them from the shop. If you hit the item (such as snake or [[roller skates]]) on the background, 500 points will be awarded. The maximum amount of hearts can be raised by making a purchase at the shop as well. If all of the hearts run out, the game is over.

Starting on level five (six in the Deluxe version), the shop begins popping up from holes. If clicked, the player is taken to a new screen where they can buy several things, such as hammers, hearts, and other powerups. Coins are used to purchase items from the shop. There are various way to obtain coins, such as picking them up when left behind by gnomes, completing a bonus round, or defeating certain gnomes and/or in a certain manner.

==Deluxe version==
The deluxe version of ''Hammer Heads'' includes a checkpoint system for the regular classic mode. If the player loses all hearts, he/she may continue from a certain level. A new checkpoint is available every five levels. If the player quits the game, the game suspends progress, and the player can continue exactly where he/she started. Hammer Heads Deluxe also includes a marathon mode, which is similar to classic mode, however, the player is given no checkpoints and the game can last indefinitely. ''Hammer Heads Deluxe'' has a trophy system similar to ''[[Chuzzle|Chuzzle Deluxe]]''. When a certain objective is met, a trophy is received and added to the trophy room, where the player can check the trophies earned, as well as find out how to earn the rest. There is also a boss enemy called "King Globus" at the end with approx. 3500 hit points. Defeating the boss unlocks the "Tough Cookie" option, a higher difficulty setting.

PopCap offers a free online version at their site. It is more limited than the deluxe version, which can be downloaded as a free trial for one hour. After the hour has passed, the player must purchase the game.

[[File:Oakland Hoodslam 1.JPG|thumb|The Stoner Brothers, a popular duo at Hoodslam, wrestling Bat Manuel and El Chupacabra]]
'''Hoodslam''' is an underground [[professional wrestling]] event that takes place in [[Oakland, California]]. Created in 2010 by Sam Khandaghabadi as a regular gathering for wrestlers who wanted to perform edgier acts for adults, Hoodslam quickly became a popular event in the [[Bay Area]], attracting over 1,000 attendees at each monthly performance. Hoodslam performances combine the athleticism and tropes of professional wrestling with more bizarre, absurd characters, as well as profanity, sexuality, and public consumption of drugs and alcohol, which are not considered appropriate at mainstream professional wrestling events.

== History ==

[[File:Oakland Hoodslam 2.JPG|thumb|Sam Khandaghabadi, founder of Hoodslam, wrestling as The Dark Sheik]]

Hoodslam was founded by Sam Khandaghabadi, who had been wrestling at other venues under the name The Sheik but was fed up with needing to keep his act appropriate for children. He called together other wrestlers he had met on the West Coast and convinced them to come to the Victory Warehouse in Oakland, the place where he lived and where underground metal shows were regularly performed, promising them that profanity and sexuality would be allowed. 15 wrestlers participated in the first Hoodslam, for which Khandaghabadi did not charge admission.

The gathering continued to be held monthly until May 2011, when the landlord of the Victory Warehouse complained about the noise and partying surrounding the event. However, in June 2011, slam poet [[Jamie DeWolf]] invited Khandaghabadi and the other Hoodslam wrestlers to perform as part of his underground variety art show, [[Tourettes Without Regrets]], at a larger warehouse venue in Oakland, the Oakland Metro Opera House. The popularity of their performance ensured them a regularly monthly spot at the Oakland Metro &amp;ndash; on the same night as Oakland's [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] art gathering &amp;ndash; which continued to attract large crowds. In October 2014, for the first time, the 1,000-person venue sold out before the show began.&lt;ref name=vice-hoodslam&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bien-Kahn|first1=Joseph|title=The Drunken, Bloody Pro Wrestling of Hoodslam Isn't for Kids|url=https://www.vice.com/read/hoodslams-drunk-and-bloody-pro-wrestling-isnt-for-kids-666|website=vice.com|publisher=VICE media|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in early 2015, an offshoot of Hoodslam, called "Beachslam", began promoting shows in [[Santa Cruz, California]] and [[Knightsen, California]] featuring many of the same performers and characters as Hoodslam--as well as several new, regional or experimental characters.

== Style and characteristics ==

According to Khandaghabadi, Hoodslam, unlike traditional professional wrestling, is a form of [[performance art]]: because the wrestlers do not need to appeal to a young audience and do not have to pretend that their act is real, they can unleash their creativity in a more sophisticated way, simultaneously demonstrating their athleticism and poking fun at the absurdity of professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=sfgate-raunch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Dana|title=A little raunch doesn't throw Hoodslam fans|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/A-little-raunch-doesn-t-throw-Hoodslam-fans-4911878.php|website=SFGate|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoodslam wrestler A.J. Kirsch states that the tagline of the event, "This Is Real," is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the obvious absurdity of the show, which features wrestlers dressed as popular video game characters [[Ken (Street Fighter)|Ken]] and [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]], as well as an "invisible" wrestler, Charlie Chaplin, whom the real wrestlers pretend to battle.&lt;ref name=vice-hoodslam /&gt; Unlike the characters and story lines, however, the physical prowess of the performers is real, and their moves are difficult and dangerous.&lt;ref name=sfgate-raunch /&gt;

As the show unfolds, the performers chant, "fuck the fans," which, according to O.J. Patterson, is a "unifying war chant" that functions as "part reminder not to take things too seriously and part demand for hedonistic excess."&lt;ref name=bolditalic-crazy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=O.J.|title=Oakland's Hoodslam Is Crazy; Go To It|url=http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/4742-oaklands-hoodslam-is-crazy-go-to-it|website=The Bold Italic|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jack in the box after Gavarni.jpg|thumb|Jack-in-the-box after [[Paul Gavarni]].]]
A '''jack-in-the-box''' is a [[child]]ren's [[toy]] that outwardly consists of a [[box]] with a [[Crankset|crank]].&lt;ref name="Sobey2008"/&gt; When the crank is turned, a [[music box]] mechanism in the toy plays a [[melody]]. After the crank has been turned a sufficient amount of times (such as at the end of the melody), there is a "[[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]":&lt;ref name="Hayes2012"/&gt; the lid pops open and a figure, usually a [[clown]] or [[jester]], pops out of the box. Some jack-in-the-boxes open at [[random]] times when cranked, making the [[startle]] even more effective. Many of those that use "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]" open at the point in the melody when the word "pop" would be sung. In 2005, the jack-in-the-box was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] due to its frequent charm that captivates children's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/jack-box|title=Jack-in-the-Box {{!}} National Toy Hall of Fame|website=www.toyhalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There you will find all types of versions of the toy, stating from the beginning versions, and ending with the most recently manufactured versions.

==Origin==
A theory as to the origin of the jack-in-the-box is that it comes from the 14th-century [[England|English]] [[prelate]] [[John Schorne|Sir John Schorne]],&lt;ref name="Vince2008"/&gt; who is often pictured holding a [[boot]] with a [[devil]] in it. According to [[folklore]], he once cast the devil into a boot to protect the village of [[North Marston]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. In French, a jack-in-the-box is called a "''diable en boîte''" (literally "devil in a box").

== Models ==
Originally, the jack-in-the-box was a made out of [[wood]] however, as new technology began to come out the toy transformed into printed cardboard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/jack-box|title=Jack-in-the-Box {{!}} National Toy Hall of Fame|website=www.toyhalloffame.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then around the 30s, the jack-in-the-box became a [[Wind-up toy|wind up]] toy made from [[tin]]. Over the years, the jack-in-the-box has evolved into characters other than the clown, such as [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]], the [[The Cat in the Hat|Cat in the Hat]], the [[The Three Little Pigs|Three Little Pigs]], [[Kitten|kittens]], [[Dog|dogs]], [[Curious George]], [[Santa Claus (disambiguation)|Santa Clause]], [[Giraffe|giraffes]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.j2e.com/victoria+junior+school/Admin/history+of+pop+up+toys+and+jack+in+the+boxes/|title=history of pop up toys and jack in the boxes|website=www.j2e.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Distributers ==
Starting in 1935 and continuing for 20 years, the first company to take on the distribution of the toy, was a very small company named the Joy Toy. This company is located in [[Italy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; as well as the [[Netherlands]]. Since then, [[Fisher-Price|Fischer Price]], [[Chad Valley (toy brand)|Chad Valley]], as well as [[Tomy]], have all taken major parts in distributing the jack-in-the-box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.j2e.com/victoria+junior+school/Admin/history+of+pop+up+toys+and+jack+in+the+boxes/|title=history of pop up toys and jack in the boxes|website=www.j2e.com|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Charles Isherwood]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed the show, writing: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chenoweth's appeal is in her perky wholesomeness and golly-gee enthusiasm ... which never feel manufactured. She has lost none of the girlish glow she possessed when she first rose to Broadway stardom. ... Nor does her singing ever feel mannered, although her bright lyric soprano is a superbly trained instrument. ... [H]er voice bloomed and soared almost effortlessly, in a wide range of repertoire, much but not all drawn from Broadway shows. ... [I]n a duet with a surprise guest, the opera star [[Renée Fleming]], on "[[Over the Rainbow]]"... Fleming cast an amused eye at Ms. Chenoweth's ... magenta sequined leotard ... and admired her courage for wearing "hot pants."... Chenoweth also brought a reflective quality to [several songs]. ... The band, though numbering just five, sounded plenty plush. ... Chenoweth's lively, natural humor was on ample display. ... Whether singing or delivering her often self-deprecating patter, Ms. Chenoweth always radiates a pleasure in performing that carries across the proverbial footlights ... she's like a singing ray of sunshine.&lt;ref name=NYTreview&gt;[[Charles Isherwood|Isherwood, Charles]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/theater/review-kristin-chenoweth-my-love-letter-to-broadway.html?_r=0 "Review: Kristin Chenoweth, That Perky Performer With the Powerhouse Pipes"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Film noir]] is not a clearly defined [[genre]] (see [[film noir|here]] for details on the characteristics). Therefore, the composition of this list may be controversial. To minimize dispute the films included here should preferably feature a footnote linking to a [[WP:RS|reliable, published source]] which states that the mentioned film is considered to be a film noir by an expert in this field, e.g.{{listref|a}}{{listref|b}}{{listref|c}}{{listref|d}}

The terms which are used below to subsume various periods and variations of film noir are not definitive and are meant as a navigational aid rather than as critical argument. Because the 1940s and 1950s are universally regarded as the "classic period" of American film noir, films released prior to 1940 are listed under the caption "Precursors / early noir-like films". Films released after 1959 should generally only be listed in the [[list of neo-noir titles]].

'''Lucca Comics &amp; Games''' is an annual [[Comic book convention|comic book]] and [[gaming convention]] in [[Lucca]], [[Tuscany]], traditionally held at the end of October. It is the largest [[comics]] festival in [[Europe]], and the second biggest in the world after the [[Comiket]].

== History ==
[[File:Lucca Comics 2012 - 01.jpg|thumb|Crowd in Vittorio Veneto street during the Lucca Comics and Games 2012]]
[[File:Lucca Comics 2007 padiglione.jpg|thumb|Entern of a pavilion]]
The '''Salone Internazionale del Comics''' ("International Congress of Comics") was launched by a Franco-Italian partnership, consisting of Italians Rinaldo Traini and Romano Calisi and Frenchman {{ill|Claude Moliterni|fr}} (forming the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators) in 1965 in [[Bordighera]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lucca 9," ''Bang!'' #11 (1974), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pasamonik, Didier. [http://www.actuabd.com/Disparition-de-Claude-Moliterni-fondateur-du-Festival-d-Angouleme "Disparition de Claude Moliterni, fondateur du Festival d’Angoulême ,"]''ActuaBD'' (Jan. 21, 2009). {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966 it moved to a small [[piazza]] in the center of Lucca, and grew in size and importance over the years.

Funding issues reduced the frequency of the festival to every two years, beginning in 1977. In the 1980s, the festival was moved to a sports center outside the city walls, where it remained until 1992, when it was moved to another city. (Funding issues also forced the cancellation of the 1988 festival.)

After the Salone internazionale del Comics ended in Lucca, city leaders launched a new convention called simply '''Lucca Comics''' that was a reprise of the old one. In 1996 it changed its name to Lucca Comics &amp; Games. The festival attracted 50,000 attendees in 2002.

Meanwhile, the Salone internazionale del Comics was held in Rome from 1995 to 2005. In 2006, for the festival's 40th anniversary, the Salone merged with Lucca Comics &amp; Games and moved back to Lucca's city center, with numerous tents and pavilions arranged in different squares within and outside the walls of the medieval city.

In 2016, the festival attracted 270,000 attendees.

=== Comics awards ===
From 1970–2005, the festival presented the  {{Interlanguage link multi|Yellow Kid Award|de|3=Yellow Kid (Preis)|lt=Yellow Kid Award}} — named in honor of [[Richard F. Outcault]]'s seminal comic strip character [[The Yellow Kid]] — in such categories as Best Cartoonist, Best Illustrator, Best Newcomer, Best Foreign Artist, and Lifetime Achievement. Yellow Kid Awards were also presented to publishers, both domestic and foreign. &lt;!-- The festival gives out annual [[Yambo]] Awards, named after [[Enrico Novelli]], an Italian cartoonist who used the pen name "Yambo." [[Don Rico]] was given a Yambo Award. --&gt;

The festival also (since 1967) presents a special award called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gran Guinigi|it|3=Gran Guinigi|lt=Gran Guinigi Award}} (named after Lucca's [[Guinigi Tower]]).

'''''Magmic Inc.''''' is an [[Ottawa]]-based developer and publisher of mobile entertainment and lifestyle software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070322_018503.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech Gaming Goes Business Casual] via [[BusinessWeek]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=de9ff3c2-bc5d-44b0-9054-330eb7007db5 Ottawa's major players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906132902/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=de9ff3c2-bc5d-44b0-9054-330eb7007db5 |date=2009-09-06 }} via [[The Ottawa Citizen]]&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2002, Magmic produces content based on both original and licensed [[intellectual property]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/gaming/238.html Magmic Games, IG Fun target smartphone market]&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of handset models, including [[Java ME]], [[Qualcomm Brew|BREW]], Sidekick, [[Windows Mobile]], Apple [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[BlackBerry]] smartphone devices.

==Distribution==
Magmic has distribution deals with carriers worldwide, allowing subscribers to purchase and download Magmic games and other software directly through their handsets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/322897348115793.php 'We're going for top 10 in the world'] via [[Ottawa Business Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, Magmic has launched several direct-to-consumer portals including Bplay (for the BlackBerry market) and Winplay (for the Windows Mobile market) which allow for a variety of payment and download options.
Magmic also sells games for iPhone and iPod Touch through Apple iTunes and has several offerings on [[App World]], the BlackBerry application store launched by [[Research In Motion]] in 2009.

==Connected Games==
Magmic developed its own mobile connected gaming platform which allows users to post scores, download daily puzzles, and play head-to-head. Early Magmic titles such as Blackjack Highroller (released in 2002) allowed the player to submit their scores to a centralized server and view high score leaderboards in real time. This technology was expanded to include the downloading of content to the device with games such as Sudoku (2004) and [[Ka-Glom!]] (2005).

True head-to-head mobile connected gaming was realized with the launch of [[Medieval Kings Chess II]] (2004) and Texas Hold'em King 2 (2004), which featured a mixture of live players and AI "bots" playing Texas Hold'em for play money at a virtual table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesondeck.com/feature/1538/interview_john_criswick_and_.php Interview: John Criswick and Nicholas Reichenbach, Magmic Games] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719165201/http://www.gamesondeck.com/feature/1538/interview_john_criswick_and_.php |date=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; THK2 proved very popular and was eventually included as a pre-loaded game on several BlackBerry handsets. THK2 was improved in 2008 with the release of Texas Hold'em King 3, which improved gameplay and added more multiplayer features.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that "if audiences are not yet satiated with spy spoofs, United Artists' "Matchless" may get an appreciative reception from the action market."{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=222|ps=: "Review is of 104 minute version reviewed on September 18, 1967"}} The review noted that "the film doesn't take itself too seriously and makes some clever gibes at the expense of military and intelligence powers of all nationalities." and that "uneven acting and technical credits hamper the film's chances of rising above programmer status."{{sfn|Willis|1985|p=222|ps=: "Review is of 104 minute version reviewed on September 18, 1967"}}

MDI has worked with organizations such as [[Internews]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=512|title=Media4Diversity: Taking the Pulse of Diversity in the Media|last=|first=|date=March 2009|publisher=European Commission|year=|isbn=978-92-79-12419-8|location=Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Federation of Journalists]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Article 19]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupar|first1=Verica|title=Getting the Facts Right: Reporting Ethnicity &amp; Religion|date=2012|publisher=MDI &amp; International Federation of Journalists|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Federation of Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MDI is also a member of the [[Ethical Journalism Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporting on Migration and Refugees Training Workshop for EU Journalists|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/reporting-migration-refugees-training-workshop-eu-journalists|website=Ethical Journalism Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
MDI was founded in 1997&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; by journalist Milica Pesic, who was working at the time for NYU Center for War, Peace and the News Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Press Freedom Day 2017|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2017/milica-pesic|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDI works on an international scale, but has a European focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buXzDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media and Cultural Policy in the European Union|last=Kretzschmar|first=Sonja|publisher=Rodopi|year=2007|isbn=9789401204156|editor-last=Sarikakis|editor-first=Katharine|location=Amsterdam|pages=215|chapter=Diverse Journalists in a Diverse Europe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI works to engage, educate and train the actors in society who have influence over media coverage of diversity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This includes media decision makers (owners, editors, managers), journalists, academics, students, [[Social Movement Organization|Civil Society Organisations]] and governmental organisations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106391301.html|title=European Media Institute Publishes Manuals on Media and Diversity|last=|first=|date=7 August 2003|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also organize conferences on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87676017.html|title=Diversity Reporting Program Planned for South Caucasus|last=|first=|date=23 June 2002|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDI's first large scale media diversity project, The Reporting Diversity Network (RDN), was launched at a conference in November 1998 with keynote speakers [[Michael Ignatieff]] and Jean-Paul Marthoz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuller|first1=David|title=Reporting Diversity Manuel|date=2002|publisher=Media Diversity Institute &amp; European Union|location=London|page=14|url=http://www.cestim.it/argomenti/08media/2002-Reporting-Diversity-Manual-Balkan-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDN's work focused on Central and Eastern Europe as well as the newly independent former Soviet states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesic|first1=Milica|title=The Media's Markers of Race and Ethnicity in the Balkans|journal=Rhodes Journalism Review|date=August 2001|volume=2001|issue=20|pages=24–25|url=http://journals.co.za/content/rujr/2001/20/EJC144721;jsessionid=UgRbGlGP3pWXxTOUvp_u967d.sabinetlive}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been involved in addressing the deaths of [[Romani people|Romani]] journalists and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Peter|date=29 November 2006|title=A Prolegomena to the Study of the Romani Media in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Gross6/publication/249720670_A_Prolegomena_to_the_Study_of_the_Romani_Media_in_Eastern_Europe/links/56e8191808aea51e7f3b153e/A-Prolegomena-to-the-Study-of-the-Romani-Media-in-Eastern-Europe.pdf|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=21|issue=4|pages=485|doi=10.1177/0267323106070012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other projects that MDI have been involved in include Dune Voices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dune Voices|url=http://www.dune-voices.info/public/index.php/en/about-us/about-dune-voices|website=Dune Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Get the Trolls Out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Counter Hate Speech on Twitter|url=http://www.stoppinghate.getthetrollsout.org/|website=Stopping Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Against Hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Media Against Hate|url=http://europeanjournalists.org/mediaagainsthate/|website=Media Against Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The collaboration between MDI and [[Twitter]] in developing a guide on countering hate speech was referred to in an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', October 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madhumita Murgia|first1=Hannah Kuchler|title=Social Media: Challenging the Jihadi Narrative|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3b03edde-8992-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|agency=Financial Times|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video broadcast produced by MDI's Dune Voices project was published on the BBC website on December 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Mali: Artwork from Motorcycle Parts|url=http://www.bbc.com/arabic/media-38470942?SThisFB|website=BBC Arabic|publisher=Dune Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI contributed to the Journal for Applied Journalism and Media Studies in 2017. MDI’s founder Milica Pesic presented concrete and detailed examples of how MDI has worked to promote inclusive journalism and diversity in the media in many different countries and regions.

Box 644, Helensvale, QLD 4212, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Auran is now operated as a holding company, with operations and development ceded to N3V Games, a different closely held company.

==History==
Auran was established by Greg Lane and Graham Edelsten in 1995, and released its first game, ''[[Dark Reign: The Future of War]]'', in 1997. ''Dark Reign'' sold over 685,000 units and was rated in the top ten [[real-time strategy]] games by the US magazine ''[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]''.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; The game received a 9.2 rating on [[GameSpot]] and was called "one of the most impressive games released this year in any genre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.gamespot.com/dark-reign-the-future-of-war/reviews/dark-reign-review-2538542/ ''Dark Reign: The Future of War'' – Review] by Vince Broady, [[GameSpot]], 2 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the Mid-2000s, Tony Hilliam had established a video game company 'N3VrF41L Games' while occasionally participating on the Auran forums as a Trainz fan. When Auran overextended backing the wrong product in early 2007, Hilliam bought in, and initially brought out several republished or rebundled packaged releases as new product titles to boost cash flow (''Trainz Routes'', ''Trainz Complete Collection'' and eventually the regionally focused ''Trainz Classics'' and Europe only releases.&lt;ref&gt;See lists: [[b:Trainz/Version And Build Numbers]], among other pages. See links to individual titles for histories.&lt;/ref&gt;) Since 2007, the re-titled N3V Games has taken over primary day to day operation, development, and management of the Auran/N3V panoply of resources, websites, holdings, and software.

===Auran JET ===
{{anchor|Auran Jet|Auran JET|Auran JET engine|Auran JET graphics engine|AURAN JET}}
Success of ''Dark Reign'' spurred interest in the game engine from other games developers, and Auran began in-house development of a generalized version of the graphics engine for licensing to third-party companies based on its self-developed [[middleware]] [[game engine]] called the Auran JET&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and in 1998 began development of a more specialized version for what became the game engine for the ''[[Trainz]]'' series of [[train simulator]] products&amp;mdash;beta tested with ''Trainz'' 0.9 in 2000 amongst railfans, and with a major new release about every 2½ years.

Auran grew steadily on the ''Trainz'' revenues and, in 2007, invested heavily and overextended its finances developing the ''[[Fury (video game)|Fury]]'' video game, a [[player versus player]] (PvP) based [[massively multiplayer online game]] which never recouped its costs. In the ensuing bankruptcy the company lost most of its development staff. Prior to that and the ''Trainz'' series of simulators, Auran had published a number of Auran Jet based games for the Australian market, including ''[[Freedom Force vs the 3rd Reich]]'', ''[[Shadowgrounds]]'' and ''[[Hearts of Iron II]]: Doomsday''.

===Key transitions===
In late 2005, after overseeing the stabilization (four [[service pack]]s released in one year) of the ''Trainz 2004'' and ''Trainz 2006'' retail releases, one of the company's founders, Greg Lane, left, saying publicly it was time to move on. Lane was responsible for the development of ''Dark Reign'' and ''Trainz'' as well as the early Auran Jet Graphics Engine of ''Trainz'' V1.x, ''Trainz Virtual Railway'' and the ''Ultimate Trainz Collection''; the upgraded Jet technology (JET 2) of ''Trainz 2004'' and ''Trainz 2006'' and evolutionarily, is still at the heart of all ''Trainz'' releases through TS2009. 
This was overhauled as JET 3 in the ''TS2010'' version and again improved with the last 32 bit release, ''Trainz 2012''&amp;mdash;which under the highly strained JET 3 version crossed the line into better utilization of 64 bit Graphics Card computer architectures and like the preceding N3V Games developed Trainz 2010, better utilizes modern multi-core [[CPU]] [[microprocessor]] units&amp;mdash;though still a 32 bit core application.
 
N3V Games has the public position that TS2012 takes 32 bit architecture as far as it is possible, so in summer of 2013 began development of an entirely new 64 bit game engine called '''''Trainz: A New Era''''' (TANE or T:ANE) which originally slated for Christmas 2014 release, has an official release on May 15, 2015&lt;ref&gt;Various articles, {{plain link|http://www.trainzportal.com/news|Trainz News tab}} of the Trainz Portal.&lt;/ref&gt; after a lot of troubles during alpha and beta testing. TANE was kickstarter funded and the company released a partial version in December called T:ANE Community Edition (effectively a public partial Beta Test lacking many of the promised features and capabilities.)

Lane is now the [[chief technology officer]] for SituHome which makes use of Auran JET as the basis for its 3D home design program and other projects. Auran emerged from bankruptcy as Auran Holdings, LTD which still owns the rights of the Trainz franchise, now operated by N3V.

===Demise of Auran===
The remaining Auran management embarked on an expensive software development&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; and virtually ignored the continued development of ''Trainz''&lt;!-- self-evident if you understand Trainz Build-tag version codes: TRS2006 SP0 is ver 2.5, TRS2009 is ver 2.9; such increments with releases and service packs. In four years there was a static product, the only significant software changes to TRS2006 happened with the release of Trainz 2009, under a new ownership, new programmers, after bankruptcy, staff firings, server disappearance for a month, etc. Trainz Classics --&gt; except for a series of joint ventures based on the extremely stable ''Trainz 2006'' software which had been released in late 2005. These joint ventures were mainly locally published and distributed regionally customized versions of ''TRS2006'' such as ''Trains Deluxe''&lt;ref&gt;Focus, 3 DVD set [www.focus...co.uk DVD case Url],{{Full|date=July 2013}} and also lists Alcazar Video, for the Video clips. See: [[commons:File:Collected-Trianz-Releases-2013-0727,about half the EnglishLang Releases.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the local publishers/distributors bundled additional software such as trains videos, video capture software, or a much more limited trains simulator ''Virtual Model Railway''.

In 2007, the game ''Fury'' was the most expensive game yet produced in Australia,&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;[http://www.acmi.net.au/global/docs/games_timeline_australia.pdf "Timeline of Game Development in Australia"] by the game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA), published by the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] (acmi)&lt;/ref&gt; costing AU$8.3 million.&lt;ref name="HistGamDevAus"&gt;[http://www.acmi.net.au/explore_history_oz_game.htm "History of Game Development in Australia" (.pdf)], Scott J. Knight &amp; Jeffrey E. Brand, Centre for New Media Research &amp; Education, [[Bond University]], published by the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]], direct quote from Games_timeline_australia.pdf, p. 6: "Auran signs an $8.3m joint venture development deal to develop a MMORPG for the Asian market, using its Jet engine and the BigWorld technology, creating an Australian total solution."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game did not sell well on its release.&lt;ref name="HistGamDevAus" /&gt;

{{Confusing|section|date=July 2013}}
On 13 December 2007, Auran Development, the company behind ''Fury'', went into voluntary [[bankruptcy|administration]], having focused and spent heavily on development of the new game which flopped, squandering the ongoing cash flow from their ''Trainz'' franchise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumea.com.au/snews.asp?news=3702 "Auran undergoing liquidation"] (13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=19706 Lance Jago (Trainz Team): "Auran Developments News"] (13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Renai|last=LeMay|url=http://www.misaustralia.com/viewer.aspx?EDP://20071211000020068424&amp;magsection=news-headlines-list&amp;portal=_misnews&amp;title=Swords+fall+as+Fury+fails+mission+to+thrill|title=Swords Fall as Fury mission fails to thrill|work=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=MIS Financial Review|date=11 December 2007|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://palgn.com.au/9823/auran-development-team-in-liquidation/ Daniel Golding: "Auran development team in liquidation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029100008/http://palgn.com.au/9823/auran-development-team-in-liquidation/ |date=29 October 2009 }} (13 December 2007)
&lt;/ref&gt; despite the staggered releases of ''Trainz Classics'', ''Trainz Classics 2'' and 3 &amp;ndash; all versions focused on regionally specific routes partnered with organizations that had offered the route and asset content as payware, added a demo driver-only version ''Trainz Driver'' as well as releases specifically aimed to grow the international clientele (''Trainz 2007'' and ''Trainz 2008'', French and Eastern European languages releases). The majority of staff was laid off.

A new legal entity, Auran Games, emerged in the reorganization as the interim developer of the ''Trainz'' series, and continued to operate the Trainz business under the reorganization. During this period, the active Auran web board forums disappeared for over a month creating widespread user community anxieties, but was revitalized just short of five weeks later and the ''Trainz'' franchise continued under Auran Games with a development team of just three individuals working on the next major ''Trainz'' release with its many user-demanded improvements, ''Trainz 2009: World Builder'' edition.

===New investors===
Soon after the rump company emerged from bankruptcy, Tony Hilliam, a ''Trainz'' devotee, offered additional capital, and the next year Auran Games became a subsidiary of N3V Games (previously known as N3VRF41L), co-founded by Graham Edelsten and Tony Hilliam in 2005,&lt;ref name="Ownership" /&gt; and Edelsten was the remaining founder at Auran&lt;ref name="WhoOwns" /&gt; while Tony Hilliam, a long time railfan had participated in the ''Trains'' 0.9 beta testing in 2000, and was an active and well-known figure on the Auran web board forums, and user of the ''Trainz'' simulators. Hilliam injected much needed operating cash, rehired the sole available programmer from the ''Trainz'' beta team, Chris Bergmann as lead programmer,{{cn|date=June 2016}} hired additional staff and began once again to develop and improve the ''Trainz'' franchise with a new team of developers continuing work on what became ''Trainz 2009: World Builder Edition''.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===New websites, new directions===
On 24 October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5?title=N3V&amp;oldid=1|title=Mediawiki installation notice|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new team including Hilliam began TrainzOnline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5?title=N3V&amp;oldid=157|title=Mediawiki staff page creation|accessdate=14 August 2013}}, This Mediawiki history page is the 157th overall edit, showing the new technical team, including the new Owner, Hilliam&lt;/ref&gt; a wiki dedicated to ''Trainz'' technology; the new software featured a built-in web browser to assist ''Trainz'' users, in place of publishing separate [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] manuals for each release. This was in part an attempt to re-engage the formerly hyper-active ''Trainz'' user community assistance in tutorials for new users,{{Clarify|date=July 2013|post-text=mangled grammar}} but as of July 2013, the only user written tutorial content was on the advanced topics of content creation (3D modeling techniques). Tony Hilliam himself authored most of the scant new user tutorial pages&lt;!-- The site is 'down', see Category:Help and then content page histories if you think this needs further citation --&gt;.

====MMORPG and ''Trainz'' interactive====
On 6 October 2010, N3V and {{Interlanguage link multi|Frogster|de}} Pacific began operating a Brisbane-based server for the ''[[Runes of Magic]]'' [[MMORPG]] developed by [[Runewaker Entertainment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 2011, ''Trainz 2010''-SP3 was released incorporating a new interactive web play between multiple-users, a move to increased DRM spurred by software piracy, and with that service pack, the first version of ''Trainz'' where assets may not be convertible (back-fixed for) older versions. The release is the first fully exploiting modern graphics cards and multi-core microprocessor desktop computers, which has been further extended in the ''Trainz 2012'' release (April 2011).

====Simulator Central====
By mid-2011, N3V had begun offering payware add-on assets for ''Trainz'' developed by its third-party partners, and released a number of smaller game style simple simulations. Late in 2012, it renamed its online store to Simulator Central and began marketing a whole catalog of simulation software titles, ranging from farming and zoo management simulations, taxi driving-to-become a fleet operator, and warfare simulations including naval battles.&lt;ref name="SimulCent"&gt;{{cite web

By July 2013, their web store categories list nearly 200 titles, mostly for download, for Windows, Mac and boxed set DVD platforms (sic).&lt;ref name="SimulCent" /&gt;

"'''Partial Terms of Endearment'''" is the 21st and final episode of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. Directed by Joseph Lee and written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], the episode originally aired on [[BBC Three]] in the United Kingdom on June 20, 2010, and has not been allowed to air in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the original television network of the series, due to its controversial nature. This is the last episode that is presented in [[standard-definition television|standard format]], before the series' switch to [[high definition television|high definition format]], and it is the final episode to feature the opening sequence that was updated during the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]].

In the episode, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is approached by an old friend from college who asks her to become a [[surrogate mother]].  After arguing with her husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] who is against the idea, Lois agrees and undergoes [[in vitro fertilisation]].  However, while Lois is pregnant, the biological parents are killed in an automobile accident. Lois and Peter have to decide whether to abort the fetus, or carry it to term and give the baby up for adoption.  Peter attempts to persuade his wife to get an [[abortion]] but changes his mind after [[pro-life|pro-life activists]] convince him that abortion is murder. Despite Peter's objections, Lois goes ahead with the abortion.

The episode was banned from airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company due to concerns over its portrayal of the controversial subject of abortion.  This is the second episode of ''Family Guy'' to be prevented from airing during the episode's respective regular season run; the first episode was the [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]]'s "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]". Unlike that episode, [[Cartoon Network]]'s adult-oriented block [[Adult Swim]] refused to air it upon [[FOX Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s request. It was first announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].

Critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised the storyline, cultural references and its assessment of the subject of abortion. The episode was watched in just under a million homes in its original airing in the United Kingdom. Guest performances included [[Gary Beach]], [[Jackson Douglas]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Will Sasso]], [[Julia Sweeney]], [[Wil Wheaton]] and [[Michael York]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. "Partial Terms of Endearment" was released on DVD in the United States, along with ''Seth and Alex Almost-Live Comedy Show'', on September 28, 2010. Even though this episode was placed at the end of season 8, the episode was placed between "[[Go Stewie Go]]" and "[[Peter-assment]]" in the UK.

==Plot==
While attending her college reunion at [[Salve Regina University]] with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] spots her old roommate, Naomi Robinson, with whom she had a brief [[lesbian]] relationship in college. Peter is shocked but excited to discover that Lois was [[bisexuality|bisexual]] in college. Naomi indicates that she would like to discuss an important matter with them at their home. Assuming that he will participate in a [[threesome]] with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in an [[orgy]], and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. When they clear the air to a dismayed Peter that they're not there for sex, Naomi and Dale tell Lois and Peter they've had trouble conceiving and ask Lois to be a surrogate mother for them, and Lois considers the matter.

As the family eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her intention to become a surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset at the thought of her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to [[List of Family Guy characters#Dr. Hartman|Dr. Hartman]] to have the [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A [[pregnancy test]] comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on [[Interstate 95]]. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an [[abortion]] or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.

In an attempt to come to a decision, Lois and Peter decide to visit the local family-planning center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo. However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video by one of the protesters. The video causes him to reconsider about aborting the unborn baby. Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter, once and for all. At dinner, Lois talks with the family about "the wonderful new member of the [[Griffin family]]", but then, after a few seconds of silence, Peter turns to the camera and says to the audience "We had the abortion", promptly ending the episode.&lt;ref name="UKairedate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sttg1/broadcasts|title=BBC – BBC Three Programmes – Family Guy, Series 8, Partial Terms of Endearment|publisher=BBC Three|accessdate= 2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and development==
The episode was first announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer [[Seth MacFarlane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MacFarlane revels in 'Family Guy' noms|publisher=''Variety''|last=Maxwell |first= Erin|date=2009-07-25|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006495.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=2009-07-25|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/07/the-emmynominated-family-guy-and-the-abortion-episode-you-wont-see.html|last=Phillips |first=Jevon|title=The Emmy-nominated 'Family Guy' and the abortion episode you will not see|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]&lt;ref name="abortion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006945.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;ref=bd_tv |title='Family Guy' to table read abortion ep|publisher=''Variety'' |last=Schneider |first=Michael|date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular [[Tom Devanney]],&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{cite video |date= 2010-09-28 |title= Family Guy Partial Terms of Endearment Audio Commentary |people=Smith, Danny|medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox |accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and periodically references ''[[Billions and Billions]]'' (1997), a book of essays by [[Carl Sagan]].  Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, "Abortion: Is It Possible to Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'", before beginning to write the script.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/how-family-guy-tried-to-talk-about-abortion/ |title=How ‘Family Guy’ Tried to Talk About Abortion |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=2010-08-03 |date=2010-07-19 |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/arts/television/20family.html?_r=1 |title=Banned TV Episode Has Its Day on DVD |publisher=''The New York Times'' |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was originally intended to air along with the rest of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]]. However, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt; This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject. Previously, the network had also disapproved of the [[Family Guy (season 3)|season 3]] episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]", which was originally prevented from airing on Fox, but finally aired on [[Adult Swim]], and eventually on Fox more than four years after it was rejected.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; Thinking the same would happen with "Partial Terms of Endearment", MacFarlane believed that Fox would eventually run the episode on their network, stating, "Most of the time these things turn out to be nothing."&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; In a statement released by Fox, they noted their full support of "the producers' right to make the episode and distribute it in whatever way they want."&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|left|thumb|155px|Series' creator Seth MacFarlane announced on July 25, 2009 at the San Diego Comic-Con that the episode had been banned by Fox.]]
At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane announced that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer [[Kara Vallow]] confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with ''Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show''.&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/n/14026 |title=Family Guy 'Partial Terms of Endearment' Brings Banned-From-TV Episode to DVD |last=Lambert |first=David |accessdate=2010-07-07 |date=2010-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715095157/http://tvshowsondvd.com/n/14026 |archivedate=2010-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the announcement, [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: "Of all the issues, {{interp|abortion}} is the one that seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling and there were a lot of very tough conversations going on with clients."&lt;ref name="nytreilly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/money-not-morality-was-key-to-decision-on-family-guy-episode/ |title=Money, Not Morality, Was Crucial to ‘Family Guy’ Decision |publisher=''The New York Times'' |last=Carter |first=Bill |accessdate=2010-09-05 |date=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reilly said that "the advertisers know what they’re getting" with ''Family Guy'', and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but "this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it was just not worth it."&lt;ref name="nytreilly"/&gt; Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on [[BBC Three]] in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station.&lt;ref name="UKairedate" /&gt; Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the [[Ricardo Montalbán Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt; ''Family Guy'' was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]], becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/17/entertainment/et-emmy-family17 |title=Family Guy breaks the funny bone barrier with Emmy nod |first=Scott |last=Collins |date=2009-07-17 |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, "We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes."&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt;

In addition to the regular cast, actor [[Jackson Douglas]], husband of [[Alex Borstein]], appeared in the episode as Dale Robinson, actress [[Julia Sweeney]] appeared as Naomi Robinson, actress [[Rutina Wesley]] appeared as Cheryl, actor [[Wil Wheaton]] cameoed as an anti-abortion protester and actor [[Michael York]] voiced the nature narrator. Actor [[Gary Beach]], voice actor [[Phil LaMarr]], and comedian/actor [[Will Sasso]] guest starred as various characters. Recurring guest voice actress [[Alexandra Breckenridge]], actor [[Ralph Garman]], and writers Danny Smith, [[Alec Sulkin]] and John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring guest cast member [[Patrick Warburton]] guest appeared in the episode as well.&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/family-guy/partial-terms-of-endearment/episode/1285309/cast.html?tag=cast_summary;cast |title=Family Guy – "Partial Terms of Endearment" – Cast and Crew |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=2010-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810031003/http://www.tv.com/family-guy/partial-terms-of-endearment/episode/1285309/cast.html?tag=cast_summary%3Bcast |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode marked Sweeney's first guest appearance since the [[Family Guy (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Wasted Talent]]".

"Partial Terms of Endearment", along with ''Seth and Alex Almost-Live Comedy Show'', was released on [[DVD]] in the United States on September 28, 2010. The set includes a brief audio commentary by Seth MacFarlane, voice actress [[Alex Borstein]], writer Danny Smith and director Joseph Lee,&lt;ref name="dvd"/&gt; as well as animatics, a table read of the episode, and nine downloadable original ''Family Guy'' songs. It was also released for [[digital distribution|digital retail]] in the United States the same day without the bonus features included on the DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/family-guy-partial-terms-endearment/id392153807|title=iTunes – TV Shows – Family Guy: Partial Terms of Endearment|date=2010-09-28|work=[[iTunes Stores]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Partial-Terms-of-Endearment-HD/dp/B00458IDWA/|title=Family Guy Specials, Ep. 4 "Partial Terms of Endearment"|date=2010-09-28|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] (US) Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=2013-11-12|quote=HD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00458GCXW/|title=Family Guy Specials, Ep. 4 "Partial Terms of Endearment"|date=2010-09-28|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] (US) Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=2013-11-12|quote=Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clips from the episode were shown during the special ''Family Guy: 200 Episodes Later'', in which MacFarlane describes it as being the closest the writers have come to doing a modern-day ''[[All in the Family]]'' episode. Additionally, Smith calls it a relatively balanced and intelligent discussion of a very difficult subject and Sulkin claims that it, like "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", is not controversial at all.

In the opening scene of the episode, Peter and Lois are shown entering her [[alma mater]] at [[Salve Regina University]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quahog.org/factsfolklore/index.php?id=124 |title=The Road to Rhode Island |work=Quahog.org |publisher=''Best of Rhode Island'' |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after they are approached by Lois's ex-roommate Naomi and her husband Dale, Lois announces her intention to carry the couple's baby, causing Peter to question why Lois is the one who has to become the couple's surrogate. Their daughter, Meg, suggests that she could carry the baby herself, but Lois objects due to Meg's inability to have a boyfriend "for more than a few weeks." Meg notes her relationship with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character [[Count von Count]], who only left her after discovering she had at least three [[nipple]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

Before Lois prepares to undergo ''in vitro'' fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies conceived by celebrity couples, including actress [[Shelley Duvall]] and singer-songwriter [[James Blunt]]; actress [[Hilary Swank]] and actor [[Gary Busey]]; Olympic medalist [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] and physicist [[Stephen Hawking]]; and actress, writer and comedian [[Tina Fey]] and actor [[Joaquin Phoenix]].&lt;ref name="tableread"&gt;{{cite video |date= 2010-09-28 |title= Family Guy Partial Terms of Endearment Table Read |people=Viener, John|medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, "Well, perhaps you could tell them—if only you spoke Hovitos," a reference to ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Later, in an attempt to cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the "[[Acme Corporation|Acme]] Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a [[crossbow]]. In a reference to the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon series [[Wile E.

As Peter exits the abortion clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as a reference to the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film ''[[Reefer Madness]]''), portraying it as [[murder]], [[larceny]], [[jaywalking]] and [[securities fraud]]. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]]'s would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of ''[[The Three Stooges]]'', and Islamic extremist [[Osama bin Laden]]'s America-loving brother from being born.&lt;ref name="apreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/08/family-guy-team-talk-abortions-variety-shows-and-emmy-odds.html |title='Family Guy' team talk abortions, variety shows and Emmy odds |publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|last=Stanhope |first=Kate |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

==Reception==
The episode was viewed in just under a million homes in its original airing on [[BBC Three]] in the United Kingdom, earning an audience share of 5.7 percent, despite airing simultaneously with ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[E4 (channel)|E4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a231038/sundays-big-brother-recovers-to-22m.html |title=Sunday's 'Big Brother' recovers to 2.2m |publisher=Digital Spy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |date=2010-06-21 |last=Laughlin |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reception of the episode represented a slight decrease from the previous week's ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a226972/sundays-big-brother-rallies-to-27m.html |title=Sunday's 'Big Brother' rallies to 2.7m |publisher=Digital Spy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |date=2010-06-14 |last=Laughlin |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a review of the episode's original broadcast, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' rated the double bill of "Partial Terms of Endearment" and "[[Go Stewie Go]]" as four out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite, Digital and Cable Channels|work=The Mail on Sunday|publisher=Associated Newspapers|date=2010-06-20|page=32|location=Eire edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of the episode's release on DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode "wickedly funny, no matter how offensive."&lt;ref name="apreview"/&gt; [[Frazier Moore]] of the [[Associated Press]] commented that "What, in other hands, could have been a serious, even heart-wrenching story is on ''Family Guy'' a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute examination of the current abortion clash."&lt;ref name="apreview"/&gt; Moore also noted, however, that "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass."&lt;ref name="apreview"/&gt; Dave Itzkoff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' deemed the episode "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters."&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of [[IGN]] criticized the episode for its [[shock value]], but appreciated "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." White went on to comment that it was "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" and that "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter." White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/112/1124423p1.html |title=Family Guy "Partial Terms of Endearment" DVD Review |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-09-30 |date=2010-09-29 |last=White |first=Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessing ''Family Guy''{{'}}s impact on television, [[Mary Elizabeth Williams]] of [[Salon.com|Salon]] commented on the portrayal of abortion: "That ''Family Guy'', that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should be one of the few shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas {{interp|...}} And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/07/20/family_guy_television_abortion/index.html |title=American TV: Still not ready for an abortion |publisher=''Salon'' |accessdate=2010-08-30 |date=2010-07-20 |last=Williams |first=Mary Elizabeth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824155602/http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/07/20/family_guy_television_abortion/index.html |archivedate=2010-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Perfect Dark Zero''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. It was exclusively released as a [[Xbox 360 launch|launch title]] for the [[Xbox 360]] video game console in 2005. The game is part of the ''[[Perfect Dark (series)|Perfect Dark]]'' series and a prequel to the original ''[[Perfect Dark]]''. The story of the game follows [[Joanna Dark]], a bounty hunter working with her father and a computer hacker, as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent a rival corporation from getting possession of an ancient artefact which endows individuals with superhuman powers.

''Perfect Dark Zero'' features a [[Campaign setting|campaign mode]] consisting of 14 missions that can be played [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operatively]] and a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of [[deathmatch]] and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]], [[system link]], and the [[Xbox Live]] online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and later the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.

Upon release, ''Perfect Dark Zero'' sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, garnering a score of 81 out of 100 at review aggregate website [[Metacritic]]. The game's numerous multiplayer modes singled out as strong features. However, some critics felt that the game did not meet the expectations, criticising single-player aspects such as its story and voice acting. In 2015, the game was included in the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' video game compilation for [[Xbox One]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Perfect dark zero gameplay.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The gameplay shifts into a [[Virtual camera system|third person perspective]] when the player is in [[cover system|cover]] mode. The [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] shows Joanna's [[Health (gaming)|health status]] and remaining ammunition in the weapon's magazine.]]
''Perfect Dark Zero'' is a [[first-person shooter]] where players control the [[player character]] mostly from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The combat features mechanics such as an evasive dodge roll and a [[cover system]] in which the gameplay switches to a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]], allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ Guide - Basics"/&gt; Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles as long as they can reasonably reach them.&lt;ref name="IGN single-player 2"/&gt; It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; The player has a certain amount of [[Health (gaming)|health]] which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.&lt;ref name="IGN single-player 3"/&gt;

Players can only carry a limited number of weapons since the inventory features a 4-slot system in which single hand held pistols usually take a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like [[sniper rifle]]s or [[rocket launcher]]s can take up to three weapon slots.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in ''Perfect Dark Zero'' have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide equipment"/&gt; For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an [[X-ray]] function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide equipment"/&gt; Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a [[sentry gun]], while the SuperDragon [[assault rifle]] can launch bouncing grenades.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide equipment"/&gt;

===Campaign===
The campaign is divided into 14 missions in which the player plays as [[Joanna Dark]]. Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ Guide - Walkthrough"/&gt; To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus can be used to open locked doors.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; [[Stealth game|Stealth]] is another important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them.&lt;ref name="IGN single-player 1"/&gt; Unlike the original ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.&lt;ref name="IGN single-player 1"/&gt;

The game also provides a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]], [[system link]], or through the [[Xbox Live]] online service.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start far away from the main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]] procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.&lt;ref name="Video Game Daily"/&gt;

===Multiplayer===
In addition to the campaign mode, ''Perfect Dark Zero'' features a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of [[deathmatch]] and objective-based games via split-screen, system link, or Xbox Live.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; The multiplayer offers two main modes with their own customisable options: DeathMatch and DarkOps. DeathMatch is a standard gametype where players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that are available on the map itself, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as [[Capture the flag#Software and games|Capture the Flag]] and [[King of the Hill (game)#In video gaming|Territorial Gains]].&lt;ref name="Prima Guide arena"/&gt; DarkOps, on the other hand, is a slower-paced and team-only gametype where weapons must be purchased from a player's stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, where the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, where the team that causes the most damage to the other team's property wins; and Onslaught, where one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide arena"/&gt;

Players can either choose to play a ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, where they will be matched with other players using a system called [[TrueSkill|TrueSkill Matchmaking]], or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; Like the original ''Perfect Dark'', these games can be highly customized and can also include [[computer game bot]]s.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them as long as they are on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.&lt;ref name=QJ/&gt;

==Plot==
''Perfect Dark Zero'' is set in 2020, where a large percentage of the world is controlled by corporations.&lt;ref name=gamespotprequel/&gt; The most notable of these corporations are dataDyne, headed by Zhang Li, and the Carrington Institute, headed by Daniel Carrington. The player is cast as Joanna Dark, a [[bounty hunter]] working with her father Jack Dark and computer hacker Chandra Sekhar. The team is after Nathan Zeigler, an independent researcher who has been captured by a [[Hong Kong]] [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] gang led by a man named Killian. Joanna and her father successfully rescue Zeigler, but Killian manages to escape. Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research, which contains information about a dangerous weapon. As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research, Joanna is sent to retrieve it while her father stays with Zeigler. After Joanna retrieved a case with Zeigler's research from a nearby safe house, Zeigler takes a device called a neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research data into Jack's mind. Afterwards, Zeigler succumbs to his injuries sustained by Killian and dies. Before dying, Zeigler says that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll.

While escaping, Jack and Joanna are attacked by a dataDyne assault team assisted by Killian in a dropship. Joanna manages to kill Killian and escape with Sekhar, but Jack is captured by dataDyne. With the help of Sekhar, Joanna learns that her father has been taken to a mansion in China, where Zhang Li lives. Joanna infiltrates the mansion and finds her father in a cell. He has been tortured, and begins speaking [[gibberish]] to her, an after effect of the neurodrive. The pair fights their way out of the complex, but their extraction is interrupted by Zhang Li's daughter, Mai Hem, who kills Jack before Joanna escapes in a hovercraft. Joanna and Sekhar decide to pursue Zeigler's lead and seek out Dr. Caroll, who works aboard a research platform on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Upon meeting with Joanna, Dr. Caroll uses a neurodrive to extract Zeigler's data from Joanna's memory, which she gained when she rescued her father. Soon after, Sekhar betrays Joanna and shoots Dr. Caroll, revealing that she decided to join dataDyne because Zhang Li had made her a large offer. A team of Carrington Institute agents saves Joanna, but Sekhar ultimately escapes with the data.

After escaping the research station, Joanna agrees to work with the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne. Daniel Carrington contacts her and explains that Zeigler had been working on an [[algorithm]] capable of decoding extraterrestrial [[glyph]]s at a dig site in [[South America]]. Traveling to [[Peru]], Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power-source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna plants a tracking device onto the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands. The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge. Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father's death by killing Mei Hem. Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Sekhar after using the Graal. Despite the advantage, Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle. Daniel Carrington commends her efforts, informing her that she did “Perfect”.

==Development==
Development of ''Perfect Dark Zero'' began on the [[Nintendo GameCube]] with a very small team of roughly ten people.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in [[Rare (company)|Rare]], making the company a Nintendo [[second-party developer]].&lt;ref name="Second-party"/&gt; According to lead designer Chris Tilston, "It was basically [[Prototype|prototyping]], finding out where we could go and how we could get there."&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; When Rare was purchased by [[Microsoft]] in 2002,&lt;ref name="MS Buys Rare"/&gt; the project was transferred to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for Xbox Live online play.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics "just couldn't handle it."&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was "about 12 months away" from completion when the shift occurred.&lt;ref name="Edge article"/&gt;

Initially, the game had a heavy [[anime]] style and Joanna Dark received many alterations throughout the development process.&lt;ref name="EG anime style"/&gt; Lead Art Director [[Wil Overton]] explained that they "wanted to bring her back in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic."&lt;ref name="Overton interview"/&gt; However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit.&lt;ref name="Overton interview"/&gt; The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, which was one of the first that could be played via Xbox Live.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we pulled it off, and because we pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing."&lt;ref name="1UP afterthoughts"/&gt;

''Perfect Dark Zero'' is also one of the first games that uses the [[Havok (software)|Havok]]'s HydraCore [[physics engine]], which was specifically designed for multi-core video game systems like the Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="GS Havok Engine"/&gt; The game's renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|previous console generation]], including [[parallax mapping]], [[ambient occlusion]], [[subsurface scattering]], and [[High-dynamic-range rendering|high dynamic range]].&lt;ref name="IGN Rare Epilogue 4"/&gt; The soundtrack of the game was primarily composed by David Clynick, who worked with [[Grant Kirkhope]] on the original Nintendo 64 game's score.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ OST"/&gt; New York based group MorissonPoe contributed two songs to the score, while DJs [[Kepi and Kat]] composed the game's nightclub theme.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZOS review"/&gt;

The cover mode was designed to enhance the stealth aspect of the game and the third-person perspective was needed to allow players to see the character they were playing.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; The idea of bringing the game into a total third-person perspective was rejected as the shooting "works better" in first-person view, explained Tilston.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; Developers decided not to include a jumping function since they felt it goes against the nature of the genre.&lt;ref name="1UP afterthoughts"/&gt; Botwood pointed out that it can "look damn stupid when you see other players doing it".&lt;ref name="1UP afterthoughts"/&gt; For this reason, the team implemmented moves such as climbing obstacles or, more specifically, the combat roll, which makes players harder to hit since it breaks the game's [[Aimbot|auto-aim lock]].&lt;ref name="1UP afterthoughts"/&gt; The transition between first and third-person view with some moves took a lot of work so that they did not become disorientating.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt; A first-person roll was implemented at one time, but it was ultimately dropped.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 2"/&gt;

Because ''Perfect Dark Zero'' was intended to be an Xbox 360 [[launch title]], the last stage of development was very challenging and several features had to be canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline.&lt;ref name="JS PDZ scaled down"/&gt; The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32, and a "dataDyne TV" mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="JS PDZ scaled down"/&gt; Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed. The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete. Rare later stated they felt very confident they would pass, but it was a significant risk producing 700,000 disks if a bug turned up.&lt;ref name="EG risks"/&gt; According to Botwood, "very few people believed we could make launch, but everything came together in time and it was out there for day one."&lt;ref name="IGN Rare Epilogue 1"/&gt;

The actual development of the game took overall five years to complete and spanned three platforms: the Nintendo GameCube, the Microsoft Xbox and the Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="CVG interview 1"/&gt; Tilston remarked that, throughout the course of development, the team noticed how the [[video game industry]] had evolved as computing and graphics power increased, and how earlier games like ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' where their development costs were minimal could easily be profitable with a few programmers.&lt;ref name="EG ex-Rare"/&gt; Tilston also revealed that the team behind ''Perfect Dark Zero'' was composed of roughly 25 people for most of the project, which was "ridiculously" small compared to [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|Xbox 360 generation]] standards where there are 100 or 200 people working on a team.&lt;ref name="EG ex-Rare"/&gt; Despite this, ''Perfect Dark Zero'', from a development cost, made four times its money back.&lt;ref name="EG ex-Rare"/&gt;

==Marketing and release==
''Perfect Dark Zero'' made its first appearance at [[Nintendo Space World|Spaceworld]] 2000, an annual video game [[Trade fair|trade show]] hosted by Nintendo in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=Spaceworld/&gt; The demo briefly showed a 3D real-time render of Joanna Dark.&lt;ref name=Spaceworld/&gt; Some reports further suggested the development of the game with Rare applying to trademark the names "After Dark", "Perfect Dark Evolution" and the phrase "Shot in the Dark".&lt;ref name="PD evolves"/&gt; The next year, at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in June 2001, Nintendo advertised the title "Perfect Dark Zero" on a list of upcoming GameCube releases, but it was quickly removed. In January 2002, it was allegedly announced that its release was pushed back to 2004 due to internal team problems at Rare.&lt;ref name="Zero progress"/&gt; When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in September 2002, several cartoony images of Joanna Dark were released, but few other official announcements were made in the following years.&lt;ref name="MS Buys Rare"/&gt;

In May 2005, one of the rewards in the [[OurColony]] [[viral marketing]] campaign for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console was a new image of Joanna Dark.&lt;ref name="IGN Joanna Dark"/&gt; At the official unveiling of the Xbox 360, it was revealed that ''Perfect Dark Zero'' would be a launch title for the new system in the fall of 2005.&lt;ref name="GS launch title"/&gt; A demo was shown during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2005 shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="PDZ E3 2005"/&gt; Prior to its release, Microsoft arranged a deal with [[Tor Books]] to produce a novel series set in the ''[[Perfect Dark (series)|Perfect Dark]]'' universe.&lt;ref name="IGN novels"/&gt; The first novel, entitled ''[[Perfect Dark: Initial Vector]]'' and written by [[Greg Rucka]], was released on October 4, 2005.&lt;ref name="IGN novels"/&gt; A six-issue [[comic book]] series written by Eric Trautmann and illustrated by Cold FuZion Studios was also announced.&lt;ref name="IGN comic"/&gt; Around the same time, Joanna Dark made an appearance on the cover of ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="FHM Magazine"/&gt; An official soundtrack album featuring a selection of music from the game was produced by [[Nile Rodgers]] and released on November 8, 2005 through [[Sumthing Else Music Works]].&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ OST"/&gt;

The first release of the game came on November 22, 2005 in North America.&lt;ref name="NA release date"/&gt; The game was playable at the Xbox 360 Zero Hour Launch event, along with other Xbox 360 launch titles such as Rare's ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]'' and [[Activision]]'s ''[[Call of Duty 2]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN Zero Hour"/&gt; Other releases followed on December 2 in Europe and on December 10 in Japan.&lt;ref name="IGN Launch in Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Launch in Japan"/&gt; In Europe, Microsoft organized a party by simulating an apartment as Joanna Dark's home, where several journalists could try out the Xbox 360 and the game.&lt;ref name="IGN Launch in Europe" /&gt; During the Japanese launch weekend, ''Perfect Dark Zero'' became the second best-selling 360 game with roughly 15,000 units sold, behind [[Namco]]'s ''[[Ridge Racer 6]]''.&lt;ref name="JP best-selling"/&gt;

''Perfect Dark Zero'' was released in both a standard edition and a limited collector's edition. The collector's edition features a disc with behind-the-scenes content, a black metal game case, a special-edition comic booklet which sets the scene for the game, and one of nine holographic collectible cards.&lt;ref name="IGN Collectors Edition announced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Collectors Edition"/&gt; As of October 2006, the game had sold more than one million units worldwide.&lt;ref name="IGN platinum"/&gt; As a result, it was one of the first games to be re-released under the "Platinum Hits" list.&lt;ref name=Platinum/&gt; In 2015, ''Perfect Dark Zero'' was released as a [[List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One|backward compatible]] game on the [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref name="Xbox One emulation"/&gt; The game was also included in the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' video game compilation.&lt;ref name="Rare Replay"/&gt;

==Additional content==
Shortly after the game's release, new multiplayer scenarios and a counter-operative mode like the one found in the original ''Perfect Dark'' were said to eventually become freely available as [[downloadable content]].&lt;ref name=IGNnewmodes/&gt; Senior game designer Duncan Botwood later clarified that it was unlikely to happen due to technical issues. According to him, "It would have required much groundwork to be laid in the core AI code, which meant that it was unlikely to be available as downloadable content post-release."&lt;ref name=ScribesCounterOp/&gt; He also remarked that the counter-operative mode was planned during the development of the game, but was eventually rejected due to the pressure to cut planned content.&lt;ref name=ScribesCounterOp/&gt;

In May 2006, an auto-update was made available on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some [[Software bug|bugs]] and adding additional multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code to prevent an ongoing problem where players could walk through the air, an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire, and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provide seven additional new bot types and the ability to use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ Update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GS PDZ Update"/&gt; Additionally, a playable [[Game demo|demo]] of the game was made freely available on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] shortly afterwards. The demo includes one campaign mission that can be played in solo mode or co-operatively, and a new multiplayer map.&lt;ref name="IGN PDZ Demo"/&gt;

Rare released a multiplayer map pack, called ''Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack One'', to the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 7, 2006.&lt;ref name=PDZ_Map_Pack_1/&gt; It contains the demo's new multiplayer map as well as three other new maps to add to the game's original six.&lt;ref name=IGNmappack1/&gt; Unlike the game's default maps, the new maps only have one variant instead of two. On October 31, 2006, Rare announced that a special platinum edition of ''Perfect Dark Zero'' would be released, and would include the first map pack and two additional maps. The two new maps were later released for free in a pack called ''Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack Two''. These maps are updated versions of two maps from the original ''Perfect Dark'': Felicity and Ruins.&lt;ref name="IGN platinum"/&gt; The pack was released on November 1, 2006 for Gold Members and on November 8, 2006 for Silver Members.&lt;ref name=PDZ_Map_Pack_2/&gt;

Critical reception for ''Perfect Dark Zero'' was divided but generally positive, garnering a [[Metacritic]] aggregated review score of 81 out of 100 respectively.&lt;ref name=metacritic /&gt; Writing for [[GameSpot]], [[Greg Kasavin]] felt that ''Perfect Dark Zero'' "champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, as well as its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action."&lt;ref name=gamespot /&gt; He concluded that the game "delivers just about everything you could hope for from a first-person shooter."&lt;ref name=gamespotreviewpage3/&gt; Charles Onyett of [[IGN]] praised the game's [[replay value]],&lt;ref name=ignreviewpage4/&gt; but also criticised single-player aspects such as the weak [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] of enemies, commenting that "they never display any advanced assault tactics."&lt;ref name=ignreviewpage2/&gt;

The graphics were highlighted positively. Kasavin was impressed with the amount of lighting and [[motion blur]] effects, and noted that the "excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look."&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt; Bryn Williams of [[GameSpy]] considered the graphics as a "stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of", but also admitted that the animation "is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness".&lt;ref name=gamespyreviewpage2/&gt; IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny.&lt;ref name=ignreviewpage2/&gt; The game's audio was said to feature "heavy-hitting weapon effects [and] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms".&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt;

The game's weapons were very well received.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt;&lt;ref name=gamezonereview/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised their weight, stating that each weapon encourages strategic play with their secondary functions.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and that they did not feel overpowered,&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt;&lt;ref name=gameinformerreview/&gt; but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode.&lt;ref name=ignreviewpage3/&gt; Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt; GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors."&lt;ref name="GameCritics review"/&gt; Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score "easily drown this out."&lt;ref name=gamespotreviewpage3/&gt;

Publications judged the co-op aspect of the game well. Kristan Reed of [[Eurogamer]] praised the fact that the missions were "designed with co-op in mind."&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt; He noted that, for example, the third level "has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next. In the single player campaign Jack's AI controlled, but co-op lets you take direct control of his actions, making the experience a much more engaging affair all-round."&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt; Multiplayer matches of ''Perfect Dark Zero'' were widely well received. GameSpot stated that "the excellent weapon selection, flexibility of options, high-quality maps, and smooth online performance ... make for a rock-solid competitive shooter."&lt;ref name=gamespotreviewpage3/&gt; IGN stated similar pros, calling it "enormous".&lt;ref name=ignreviewpage3/&gt; [[1UP.com]] reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer, but observed that "constantly roll-dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [...] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of your character [...] can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners."&lt;ref name=1up/&gt;

Despite solid reviews, numerous publications remarked that ''Perfect Dark Zero'' did not meet the expectations. According to GameCritics, "It took Rare a whole console generation to do it ... and the wait wasn't really worth it".&lt;ref name="GameCritics review"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline "Don't believe the hype".&lt;ref name=gameinformerreview/&gt; In a positive review, GameSpy observed that "''Perfect Dark Zero'' is a lot of fun and does a lot of things very well, but it's just not the [[Killer application|killer-app]] that we'd all hoped for".&lt;ref name=gamespyreviewpage3/&gt; ''Edge'' said that the game "falls short", especially when compared to ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; In 2010, [[GameTrailers]] placed the game 6th in their list of the "Top 10 Disappointments of the Decade" and 10th in their "Top 10 Worst Sequels" list.&lt;ref name="GameTrailers' Top 10 Disappointments of the Decade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameTrailers' Top 10 Worst Sequels"/&gt;

'''Shayera Hol''' is the name of a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s during the [[Silver Age of Comics]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Shayera Hol was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Joe Kubert]], and first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 (March 1961). Depicted as the second  '''[[Hawkgirl]]''' and first '''[[Hawkwoman]]'''.  

==Publication history==
With the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of ''Flash Comics'' in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl became married alien police officers from the planet [[Thanagar]] who come to Earth in order to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as [[Shayera Hol]] (phonetically identical to Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the [[Justice League]] in ''Justice League of America'' #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. Several years later, Silver Age Hawkgirl joined the Justice League of America with issue #146 in 1977. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her name to [[Hawkwoman]] in the Hawkman backup feature of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #274.

With the establishment of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on [[Earth-Two]] and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on [[Earth-One]]. 

==Fictional character biography==

Shayera Hall, The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of [[Hawkgirl]] / [[Hawkwoman]], was a law enforcement officer from the planet [[Thanagar]] and wife of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]], the Silver Age Hawkman and was a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

She was born on Thanagar, which had a scientifically advanced civilization in which crime was virtually unknown. As an adolescent, Shayera joined the Thanagarian police force and was assigned to assist the force's most decorated officer, Katar Hol, in capturing the Rainbow Robbers. At first, Katar was furious at being assigned an inexperienced young woman as a partner, but he nevertheless became strongly attracted to her. 

[[Image:Hawkwoman1.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Shayera Hol on the cover to ''Hawkman v2'' #6. Art by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]].]]
Together, they captured the Rainbow Robbers in their stronghold found behind a waterfall; while on the case, Shayera saved Katar's life and the two fell deeply in love. A few weeks later, Katar proposed to Shayera in front of the same waterfall. She accepted and they were married. Ten years later, the couple was sent to Earth in pursuit of the criminal [[Byth]] Rok. Upon reaching Earth, they were befriended by [[Midway City]] police commissioner George Emmett, who established cover identities for them as Carter and Shiera Hall. After capturing Byth and bringing him back to their planet, Katar and Shayera chose to return to study Earth's crimefighting methods, and they fought against evil as the superheroes Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Shayera renamed herself Hawkwoman in the early 1980s.

As Hawkgirl, Shayera eventually joined her husband as a member of the Justice League. She was the first League member admitted as part of the League's vote to lift its prior twelve-member limitation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/common/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=8118&amp;start=60 ]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had effectively prevented the admission of more women to its ranks. Her membership set precedent for the admission of [[Zatanna]] as the League's fifteenth member. Both Zatanna and Shayera became close friends since ''Hawkman'' vol. 2 #4 .

As Shiera, she first worked as Carter's secretary, but later became co-director of the Midway City Museum. She has a sort of rivalry with the museum naturalist [[Mavis (DC Comics)#Hawkman|Mavis Trent]], who has her eyes on both Hawkman and Carter Hall.

Later, Thanagar had established itself as a military dictatorship bent on conquering other planets. Hawkman and Hawkwoman thwarted Thanagarian plans to invade Earth, destroying their own starship in the process. Hawkman and Hawkwoman remain on Earth, regarded as traitors by everyone on Thanagar. She helped her husband come to terms with the deaths they caused during the battle. Eventually, she changed her codename to Hawkwoman.&lt;ref&gt;''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of DC's miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the histories of Earth-One and Earth-Two are merged. As a result, both Golden Age and Silver Age versions of Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]]/Hawkwoman live on the same Earth. Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged. They took Superman to Krypton (now a gas planet),&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (volume 2) #18 "Return to Krypton"&lt;/ref&gt; briefly joined [[Justice League International]], teamed-up with Atom,&lt;ref&gt;''Power of the Atom'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; and helped [[Animal Man]] defuse a Thanagarian bomb during ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]''. However, DC reversed this decision and [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] Hawkman continuity after the success of the 1989 ''[[Hawkworld]]'' miniseries. Originally, ''Hawkworld'' retold the origins of Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. After becoming a success, DC Comics launched a ''Hawkworld'' ongoing series set in the present resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. By doing so, several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkwoman's Justice League appearances needed to be fixed.

Following Convergence's storyline, Shayera Hol is featured in the Hawkman: Convergence. She is shown working as a curator in Gotham City museum while fighting as Hawkwoman also. At the end of the story her universe vanishes due to the Crisis happening, she is last seen flying with Hawkman.

Following Rebirth's continuity, Shayera Hol appeared in the Hawkman Vol. 5 series. She was shown in Thanagar alongside her partner Katar Hol.

After that Stewart began something with fellow leaguer [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]; however, during a trip to the future John Stewart met Warhawk, who called him "Dad". This baffled Stewart, but Warhawk did explain what had happen. It turned out he was the child of John and Shayera. When John returned he decided not to tell Shayera immediately; he did eventually tell her, but he also told her he would not be Destiny's puppet.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Unlimited'' series (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the ''Justice League Beyond'' comic book series, it is revealed that Shayera and John get back together and gotten married after Vixen is brutally murdered by [[Shadow Thief]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Beyond'' #7(May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; They have a son named Rex Stewart who would later join the Justice League Beyond as [[Warhawk (comics)|Warhawk]]. After Warhawk was born, Shayera and John decided to leave the Justice League in order to care of Rex.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Beyond'' #8(June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewords===
Shayera and Katar are featured in the [[Elseworlds]] three-part series ''Legend of the Hawkman'' (2000). The story takes place in the Earth-One timeline, some time after ''The Brave and the Bold'' #34. She is shown wanting to return home to [[Thanagar]] while Katar has grown accustomed to life on Earth. Although this mini-series was never labelled as an ''Elseworlds'' project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' era.

===''Legend of the Hawkman''===
Hawkgirl ([[Shayera Hol]]) and [[Hawkman]] feature in this mini-series set soon after their arrival on Earth as the duo faces an ancient menace with connections to their [[Thanagarian]] heritage. In the first chapter, ''"The Fallen One"'', Shayera has been anxious to return to [[Thanagar]], but Katar feels a responsibility to the museum, especially its upcoming extraterrestrial treasure exhibit. While [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar]] has adopted Earth as his home Shayera doesn't feel like they belong there. In [[Tibet]] a group of archaeologists discovers a [[Thanagarian]] gateway carved into a cliff side, after being informed of this [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] and [[Hawkman]] travel to the location.&lt;ref&gt;''Legend of the Hawkman'' #1 (July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hawkman]] deciphers the writing on the gateway and it depicts the life of [[Thanagar|Thasaro]], a Thanagarian child so evil that he threatened the existence of [[Thanagar|Thanagar's]] ancient gods. The ancient gods of Aerie condemned Thasaro into a mystic urn. Shayera's ancestor was entrusted with burying the urn so no one could release Thasaro. The archeologists and Katar want to examine the gateway but [[Hawkwoman|Shayera]] insists that the gateway be left alone. [[Hawkman]] and Shayera get into a fight until Shayera flies away heartbroken because Katar cares more about archeology than her feelings. Katar's fingerprints genetically opens the gateway. Shayera hears an explosion and heads back to the site. Thasaro appears and makes the stone sentries throughout his chamber come to life. The sentries attack Hawkgirl but she manages to defeat his enforcers and finds [[Hawkman|Katar]] within Thasaro's grip. Thasaro then summons corpses like talons that rise up from the ground and pull Hawkgirl into a cavern beneath [[List of Hawkman enemies|Thasaro]]'s chamber. The talons maim Hawkgirl, but she manages to break away. Shayera's distress in the cavern awakens the spirit of her ancestor. Shayera's ancestor channels his aura into Shayera and gives her the edge she needs to subdue Thasaro. Thasaro is banished once again into the urn. The urn is then transported to the [[Midway City (DC Comics)|Midway City]] Museum so [[Hawkman|Katar]] and [[Shayera Hol|Shayera]] can safeguard it.&lt;ref&gt;''Legend of the Hawkman #2'' (August 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later [[Shayera Hol|Shayera]] is shown wanting to start a family, in the meantime [[Thanagarian]] zealots return to Earth to free the heinous fallen god. [[Thanagar|Thasaro's]] return brings chaos and devastation to [[Midway City (DC Comics)|Midway City]], but using their [[Nth Metal]] weapons Hawkgirl and [[Hawkman]] are able to subdue him, banishing him to the fiery depths of Earth's Hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Legend of the Hawkman'' #3 (September 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Justice League Adventures''===
''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' is a [[DC Comics|DC]] comic book series featuring the Justice League, but set in the continuity (and style) of the television shows ''[[Justice League Animated]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''; as opposed to the regular DC Universe.Shayera Hol is featured in the comic, this version of Hawkgirl is really similar to the one introduced in the television show, as the comics serves as a spin-off of the series, with Hawkgirl being one of the founding members of the [[Justice League]].

===''JLA: The Nail'' &amp; ''JLA: Another Nail''===
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' and ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Hawkgirl is a member of a much-hated Justice League, and remains so even after her husband's death by [[Amazo]]. In ''Another Nail'', she appears to be close friends with [[Zatanna]]. She has forgiven [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] (in Amazo's body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed. Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series.

===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===
In ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the Hawks tried to return to Thanagar to flee from [[Lex Luthor]]'s military dictatorship, only to crash in the rain forests of [[Costa Rica]]. They decided to remain in hiding. They gave birth to a son and daughter, giving them natural wings. Katar and Shayera were killed in a military strike ordered by Lex Luthor, embracing each other in their final moments. The children were brought up in the jungle ever since. They were bent on revenge against Lex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fanboyplanet.com/ontv/justiceleague/mg-jluONCEANDFUTURETHING2.php |title=mg-jluONCEANDFUTURETHING2 : |publisher=Fanboplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As '''Hawkboy''', the son ultimately kills Lex with Batman's permission, since he understands what he has been through.

===''Justice''===
In [[Alex Ross]]'s Silver Age-toned ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', Hawkgirl is a member of the [[Justice League]] and co-director of the Midway City Museum, alongside her husband. With the entire JLA's secrets and weaknesses in hand, the [[Legion of Doom]] stages a simultaneous attack on nearly every member of the League. Hawkgirl and [[Hawkman]] are surprised by [[Toyman#Winslow Schott|Toyman]] in the [[Midway City|Midway City Museum]], but manage to survive and decide to investigate his warehouse, where they are assaulted by his forces, and discover that he is making multiple [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] androids. She also appears in ''Secret Origins'' and ''Liberty and Justice''.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Hawkgirl is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics.  Much like their [[Silver Age (comics)|Silver Age]] counterparts, Shayera and [[Hawkman|Katar]] are married and very much in love.

===''DC New Talents Showcase''===
Hawkgirl was chosen for one of the seven features in the one-shot comic book. She lives in Chicago, working as a police detective. She is from [[Thanagar]], her mace vibrates like a smartphone when [[Nth metal|Nth-Metal]] Thanagarian weapons are near and she has a secret Hawkroom. It is revealed that she did not leave Thanagar on good terms, after some time collecting Thanagarian weapons from crime scenes she started suspecting something was wrong. This led to her fighting against an ancient Thanagarian that wanted her dead since she chose humans instead of Thanagarians.

[[Erica Schultz]], said she was inspired by [[Justice League Animated]] version of the character, ''"I've always been drawn to strong characters, but what really solidified my love for Shayera was the [[Justice League]] cartoon show."''&lt;ref&gt;''DC New Talent Showcase'' (January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scooby-Doo Team-Up'' #17===
During a crossover with the cast of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of [[Hawkwoman|Hawkgirl]] is featured alongside [[Hawkman]] in the [[Midway City (DC Comics)|Midway City Museum]], working as curators. The heroes team-up with the characters from the [[animated series]] to discover who were stealing from their workplace. Later they uncover that [[Shadow Thief]], [[Matter Master]] and [[Fadeaway Man]] were behind it. After a fight against the villains the heroes retrieve the stolen items.

==In other media==

===Television===

====''Super Friends''====
Hawkgirl has appeared in a few episodes of ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' paired alongside her husband Hawkman. In her appearances on the show, she looked like the Silver Age version of the character. However, in her last appearance during the "lost season", Hawkgirl got a new costume (a totally black mask, a yellow one piece with a red belt, and grey boots) and her hair was changed to blonde. She was voiced by [[Shannon Farnon]] and [[Janet Waldo]].

====''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''====
[[File:Hawkgirl.png|thumb|Hawkgirl as she appeared in ''[[Justice League Animated|Justice League]]''.]]
Hawkgirl appears in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Maria Canals-Barrera]]. She is based on [[Hawkwoman|Shayera Hol]], the Silver Age version of the character. Her personality was completely redesigned for the series by the producers, who wanted a second female superhero for the team to contrast with [[Wonder Woman]]. While [[Black Canary]] is traditionally more associated with the Justice League, the producers preferred to have the Hawk family represented. In the animated continuity, Hawkgirl's wings are organic and she wields an Nth metal mace which disrupts magical forces and other forms of energy; she is also depicted as having superhuman strength, endurance, durability and is an expert hand-to-hand combat, as shown in "In Blackest Night Pt. II" when she defeated four members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] single-handedly. It can be assumed that she also has some hover capability, as at times she is seen to hang in midair without the visible use of her wings. In the episode "Only a Dream Pt. 1", she is seen hovering with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] clinging to her back.

In "Secret Origins", the [[Martian Manhunter]] gathers the future League to battle against an alien invasion on Earth. After the defeat of the invasion, the seven remained a team and officially formed the Justice League, dedicated to the defense of Earth against attack both within and without. To the rest of the League, Shayera was a mysterious woman with angelic wings from another world. She explained that she found herself on Earth when, while pursuing some criminals who were trafficking in forbidden technology, she was accidentally transported by the rays of a dimensional transporter known to her people as a Zeta Beam, which has been traditionally associated with DC's science fiction hero [[Adam Strange]].

Throughout the series, she slowly builds a relationship with Green Lantern ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]). In the two-part episode "Wild Cards", John is nearly killed by a bomb the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] has set off while protecting Shayera. She just barely manages to bring him back to life by shocking him with her mace, then leaves the city to treat him. Later, in the Watchtower, John and Shayera show their true feelings for each other, and Shayera allows John to remove her mask, giving the viewer their first look at Hawkgirl's face beneath the mask, and the two share a kiss.

In the second-season finale "Starcrossed", Shayera reveals herself to be a military officer of her planet's armed forces, working as an advance scout on Earth. When her people suddenly arrive in force on Earth, she works to help the Thanagarians gain the support of Earth's leaders to protect it from the Thanagarians' mortal enemies, the Gordanians. She is also reunited with her commanding officer and fiance Hro Talak (an anagram for the name of the Silver Age Hawkman Katar Hol), with both her now-revealed spy mission and this unmentioned romance creating considerable friction between herself and John. Information she has given to the Thanagarians enables them to take the League prisoner, though Shayera says they should not be killed. They later escape.

Unbeknownst to Shayera, the Thanagarians' true intent is to transform Earth into the final link in a hyperspace bypass, which will destroy Earth but allow the Thanagarians to strike a mortal blow at the Gordanians' home world. When Shayera learns of this plan, she betrays her people and informs the Justice League of the Thanagarian plot, proving this by returning John's ring which the Thanagarians had taken. The Thanagarian forces are eventually defeated by the League and forced to leave Earth, with Shayera left behind as a traitor. (For this reason, Shayera is later ambushed by a band of rogue Thanagarian resistance fighters seeking revenge in "Hunter's Moon".) The other six members of the League take a vote on whether to allow Shayera to stay on the team, but before they can tell her the result, she resigns from the League and departs (in "Wake the Dead", it is revealed that the decision, while split, was in favor of letting her stay, with John abstaining and [[Superman]] breaking the tie). She eventually comes to reside with [[Doctor Fate]] and his wife [[Inza Nelson|Inza]] in Fate's tower stronghold in an effort to decide what to do with her life.

In the episode "Wake the Dead", [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy's]] corpse is reanimated, and he wreaks havoc. Shayera takes the responsibility of killing Grundy, whom she once considered to be a friend. After this, she returns to the League, but it is some time before she is properly re-accepted among its members, particularly Wonder Woman and [[Batman]] (who were likely the two who had previously voted against her remaining on the team). After she is allowed to rejoin the [[Justice League]], Shayera reclaims her seat among the seven founding members and opts to dress in simple civilian clothing as opposed to her previous, more militaristic costume.

[[File:ShayeraJLU.png|thumb|left|Hawkgirl as she appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
After returning to the [[Justice League]], Shayera found conflict with [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon warrior]] had reluctantly allowed Shayera to join the team again, however holding a grudge against her. She would sustain that feeling until the episode "The Balance", when she was forced to take Shayera along to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] and Tartarus due to [[Felix Faust]]'s return and his usurping of Hades' throne, Shayera was vital to this mission because her [[Nth Metal]] mace was the only weapon capable of stopping Faust. During this mission, Shayera and Wonder Woman settled their differences once and for all. Shayera still met conflict with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. Once, they, during the episode "Hunter's Moon", along with [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] were assigned to a rescue mission on a distant moon where alien miners were having problems due to the supposed high levels of unstable Nth metal. However, it turned out to be a trap set by Paran Dul, who was leading a group of [[Thanagar|Thanagarians]] soldiers including the mentally disabled Kragger. During their confrontation on the moon, Paran revealed that Shayera's betrayal had led to [[Thanagar]]'s defeat by the Gordanians and that [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hro Talak]] had been killed while fighting back. A distressed Shayera was tempted to turn herself in and let them pass judgment on her, but Vixen and Vigilante refused to let her go.

Shayera even offered to surrender in exchange for Vixen who had been captured by the Thanagarians, but then fought back when they almost killed Vixen by dropping her from mid-air. The Thanagarians were defeated and the three League members stole a Thanagarian Scout Ship and returned to the [[Watchtower (comics)|Watchtower]]. Upon their arrival, John Stewart rushed over to both Vixen and Shayera, but they walked straight past, implying that they were going to settle their dispute over him. Stewart feared the worse, but they merely laughed over drinks during which the two women discussed his quirks and habits. Shayera did reveal that she still loved him while Vixen revealed that he still loved Shayera and that she just wanted to see things through until the end. They agreed to a friendly contest for his affections, with a toast to en garde.

The show ends with Shayera and Green Lantern (who is by this point in a relationship with League member Vixen) having resolved to be friends for the time being. Series creator [[Bruce Timm]] said in an interview that while he was deliberately ambiguous about the future of their relationship and understood while some fans disliked where it was left at the series finale, it was his opinion that "You can put two and two together and imagine what happens",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvpast.org/forum/toons-superheroes/4007-interview-bruce-timm.html|title=TVPast Forums - Interview with Bruce Timm About JLU and DC Anim.|website=www.tvpast.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially since Green Lantern has at this point met his future son, [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]] (Rex Stewart) who indicates that his mother is Shayera. A resolution to this storyline occurs in the fifth issue of the ''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' comic book, in which John and Shayera finally reconcile and settle down to raise a family in Africa. These events are not considered canonical to the [[DC Animated Universe]] storyline as the issues were created by independent writers not associated with the original production.

In addition to John, Shayera shows a strong friendship with the Flash that is touched on several times through both the ''JL'' and ''JLU'' series, usually in a sisterly way, including him being the only one to hug her goodbye after her decision to resign. She is also the first one try and pull him back from the [[Speed Force]] in the episode "Divided We Fall."  In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' fifth season's debut episode, "I Am Legion", Flash says, "She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only, you know... short."

Later Hawkgirl meets archaeologist Carter Hall, who claims they are the re-incarnations of two Thanagarians, Khufu and Chay-Ara, who landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and became rulers of Egypt. The [[Shadow Thief]] captures them and Green Lantern and uses Thanagarian technology from that era to show them what happened. After Shayera had an affair with the military leader and closest friend of Katar Bashari, apparently the past John Stewart, due to her husband not spending enough time with her, they were poisoned by the Priest Hath-Set who heard Carter wish they were dead. When he found out, he poisoned himself.

====''Static Shock''====
Hawkgirl appears in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode, "A League of Their Own", with [[Maria Canals]] reprising her role. Within the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], [[Batman]] is checking the stasis field shielding a left-over module from [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from its environs. As Batman explains to Hawkgirl Brainiac's nature as a regenerative program, a virus that will not die, an alarm goes off and [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] calls everyone to the control room. As it turns out, the Watchtower is in the path of a cosmic super string, and even with the shield up, most of the power is drained from the station's generator. Brainiac manages to take advantage of this, escaping from his drained stasis field. Hawkgirl and the [[Justice League]] call in [[Static (comics)|Static]] and [[Rick Stone (comics)|Gear]] to assist in the fight against Brainiac.

====''Krypton''====
Hawkgirl is going to be featured in the ''[[Syfy]]'' television series ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]''. The series will work as a prequel to the ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' film. This version of the character is based on [[Shayera Hol]] and goes by the codename [[Hawkwoman]]. After finding out that a group of villains returned to the past to stop [[Superman]] from being born, Shayera and [[Adam Strange]] travel through time to prevent this from happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/37587-syfy-krypton-tv-series-time-travel-twist.html|title=Syfy's 'Krypton' Has a Time Travel DC Twist ... and Adam Strange &amp; Brainiac|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Comedy Garage''''' is a documentary by director [[Logan Leistikow]], released in 2011, depicting a day in the life of five rising star comedians who produce a stand up comedy show performed on a self-made stage in their garage in [[Burbank, California]]. Shot [[cinéma vérité]] style, the film highlights the unique personalities and techniques of comics Cornell Reid, Matthew Sullivan, Sean Green, Paul Danke, and Casey Feigh.

The Comedy Garage had been a staple of the Los Angeles comedy scene before filming began. Leistikow met the comedians while working at [[Tom Green Live]]. Once he was invited to a comedy garage show, he got inspired and soon began production on the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.indieflix.com/2011/03/filmmaker-spotlight-logan-leistikow/ |title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Logan Leistikow &amp;#124; The Indieflix Blog |publisher=Blog.indieflix.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the second-to-last Silly Symphonies cartoon.

==Plot summary==
[[Practical Pig]] is hard at work building a new anti-wolf contraption, this time a [[lie detection|lie detector]].  His two brothers, Fiddler and Fifer Pig, find this funny and laugh; they then decide to go swimming, despite their brother's warning not to as the Wolf is lurking near the local pond.  Oblivious to their danger, they are followed to the pond by the [[Big Bad Wolf]], who disguises himself as a voluptuous [[mermaid]] to entice them, and then traps them in a net.  While the Wolf plans to entrap Practical as well using a fake letter requesting help by his brothers, he tells his sons, the Three Little Wolves, not to eat until he captures Practical. They tell him that they'll wait until he returns with Practical, but as soon as he leaves, they prepare to bake Fiddler and Fifer into a pie.

The Wolf's messenger boy disguise is seen through when he blows the fake letter under Practical's door.  Realizing his brothers have been captured, Practical sees an excellent chance to try out his new invention.  The welcome mat then drops in beneath the Wolf's feet, and he falls into a pit below.  He is next seen strapped into a chair in Practical's house, helpless against the technology of the resourceful.  When interrogated by Practical about the whereabouts of his brothers, the Wolf first claims to have never heard of the two, and the lie detector goes into action; a needle on the machine's indicator points to "lie", two steam whistles blow in the manner of a [[wolf-whistling|wolf-whistle]] to signify the claim as such and the machine washes the Wolf's mouth out with soap.  Then the Wolf claims to have not seen the two pigs, and gets a spanking from the lie detector.  Lastly, he tries to fool the machine into thinking he and Practical are "pals" but the lie detector is able to detect this as a lie, and the Wolf ends up getting the works, with his mouth washed out, his butt being spanked, and his knuckles being whacked with rulers.

Back at the wolves' hideout, the Three Little Wolves are about to bake Fifer and Fiddler in the finished pork pie.  The pigs remind the wolf boys about their father's warning and tell them they will be sorry when the Wolf returns, but they sarcastically concur with this and laugh.  One of the wolves, though, realizes that they forgot to add pepper and sprinkles some onto the pie.  However, the pepper shaker lid unexpectedly comes off and the pepper gets everywhere; thus resulting sneeze from the pigs is so strong that it blows the crust right off of the pie and into the wolves, splatting them against a back wall like glue.  With their captors trapped,  Fifer and Fiddler then escape and rush back to Practical's house.

Meanwhile, the lie detector punishes the Wolf harder and harder until he finally gives in and the machine's indicator points to "truth", with a mechanical bird tweeting and playing a harp at which point he tells the truth, "''they're in the old... the old mill''".  He is then shot out of the house with a firecracker and seemingly explodes in the sky. Practical prepares to go save his brothers when Fiddler and Fifer burst in, slamming the door in his face.  When confronted by their older brother on defying his orders, they play innocent and tell him that they didn't go swimming.  But the lie detector springs into action, Fiddler and Fifer are flipped over, the force of the flip sends their shorts to their ankles, and their bare bottoms turn bright red as they are soundly spanked. Practical tells them "''Remember, this hurts me worse than it does you''", but much to his chagrin, the machine takes him literally and also gives him a spanking as the cartoon ends.

==Later references==

In [[Stieg Larsson]]'s thriller ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', the fiercely independent  protagonist [[Lisbeth Salander]] several times uses the term "Practical Pig" for the journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]], whose efforts to help her she both appreciates and resents.

'''Aniversario''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[card (sports)|card]] that is held annually by Puerto Rican [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC) to commemorate its anniversary. The first show was held in 1983 to mark the tenth anniversary of WWC's creation in 1973. Various WWC championships are defending at the event, and the 1986 event featured two defenses of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. The show has also been dedicated to various former professional wrestling including [[Bruiser Brody]] in 2007 and [[Hugo Savinovich]] in 2009. In 2017 WWC did not held the Aniversario show due to the path of [[Hurricane Maria]] thru Puerto Rico.
