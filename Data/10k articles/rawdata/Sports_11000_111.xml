Events in [[chess]] in 1941

==Chess events in brief==
* ''[[Basic Chess Endings]]'' by [[Reuben Fine]] was published.
* 29 August 1941 - [[Gideon Ståhlberg]] played a 400-game [[simultaneous exhibition]] in Buenos Aires; 364 wins, 14 draws, 22 losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title Unknown |url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/history.txt |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kfLHqMvc?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/history.txt |archivedate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8–14 September 1941 - ''Europaturnier'' held in Munich, was organised by [[Ehrhardt Post]], the Chief Executive of Nazi ''Grossdeutscher Schachbund''. [[Max Euwe]] had declined the invitation for München 1941 due to his "occupational obligations", as manager of a groceries business. This time he refused to participate, because [[Alexander Alekhine]] was invited. Euwe mentioned futile reasons. The real motive was Alekhine’s offence of Euwe in his anti-Semitic articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endgame.nl/salz1942.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-10-10 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803202925/http://www.endgame.nl/salz1942.htm |archive-date=2012-08-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alekhine wrote six Nazi articles which first appeared in the Paris newspaper ''[[Pariser Zeitung]]'' in March 1941. He wrote a series of articles for the ''[[Deutsche Zeitung in den Niederlanden]]'' called "Jewish and Aryan Chess." The articles were reproduced in ''Deutsch Schachzeitung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alekhine and the Nazis |url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/nazi.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kg6NDmbW?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/nazi.htm |archivedate=2009-10-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, Alekhine had written about the "Jewish clique" around  Euwe in [[World Chess Championship 1935]].
The [[Munich 1941 chess tournament]] was won by [[Gösta Stoltz]], who scored a spectacular victory (1½ points ahead of Alekhine and [[Erik Lundin]]), and won 1,000 Reichsmarks. His trophy (donated by the ''Ministerpräsident'' [[Ludwig Siebert (politician)|Ludwig Siebert]]) of [[Meissen porcelain]] is worth close to $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter14.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archbold Stadium''' was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It opened in 1907 and was home to the [[Syracuse University]] [[Syracuse Orange football|Orangemen]]&lt;ref&gt;The school did not adopt its current nickname of "Orange" until 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football|football]] [[team]] prior to the [[Carrier Dome]] opening in 1980.  It was the third concrete football stadium built in the United States.

== History ==

The stadium was named for [[John D. Archbold]], who donated $600,000 for the project.  He was also responsible for funding towards the building of [[Archbold Gymnasium]], located just to the east overlooking the stadium.

The stadium was occasionally used to stage [[Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball)|Syracuse Stars]] minor league baseball games, such as in 1920 while the Stars were awaiting the completion of [[Star Park]].

== Description ==
[[File:Syracuse-university-1922 archibald-stadium west.jpg|thumb|The [[Syracuse University]] - Archbold Stadium - West entrance - 1922|202x202px]]
The 800' x 475' stadium was oval-shaped, with a track (originally dirt) and a natural grass football field. The west end zone, the stadium's main entrance, was marked by a grand castle-like façade with turrets framing the gateway arch.  There was originally a wooden roof over the central section of the south grandstands for the reserved seating.

== Grandstand expansion ==
[[File:Syracuse-university archibald-promenade.jpg|thumb|The [[Syracuse University]] - Archbold Stadium - Promenade|203x203px]]
In the 1950s, the stadium was expanded to the north and south, bringing the capacity up to 40,000.  However, by the 1970s, stricter fire codes forced a reduction in capacity to 26,000.

This proved to be the stadium's undoing.  By the mid-1970s, Syracuse faced the prospect of being demoted to Division I-AA unless it got a more modern stadium, and quickly.  It was closed following the 1978 season, to be razed for the building of the Carrier Dome, which occupies Archbold's former footprint.

== Final game ==

In the final game at Archbold Stadium, on November 11, 1978, the Orangemen defeated nationally ranked Navy, 20-17.

During its history, Syracuse compiled a 265-112-20 record at Archbold.

'''Christophe Robert''' (born 30 March 1964) is a former French professional [[Association football|footballer]].

He is famous for having been involved in the bribery scandal involving [[Olympique de Marseille]] and his team [[US Valenciennes]]. He  and teammates, [[Jorge Burruchaga]] and [[Jacques Glassman]] were contacted by OM player [[Jean-Jacques Eydelie]], in order to let ''l'OM'' win and, more importantly, not to injure any OM player ahead of the [[UEFA Champions League]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Barry|title=Tapie Directly Implicated As Marseille Trial Opens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/sports/14iht-tapie.html|accessdate=4 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=14 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D61F3DF931A35754C0A965958260|date=2 July 1993|accessdate=12 March 2007|title=Argentine Charged in Marseille case|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/wenger-slams-tapie_sto817893/story.shtml|title=Wenger slams former Marseille Chairman|date=23 January 2006|accessdate=4 January 2018|work=Eurosport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then suspended for two seasons by the [[French Football Federation]].

'''Dan Alon''' ({{lang-he|דן אלון}};&amp;nbsp;28 March 1945 – 31 January 2018) was an Israeli [[fencing|fencer]]. He competed in the individual [[foil (fencing)|foil]] event at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], at the age of 27.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/al/dan-alon-1.html |title=Dan Alon Olympic Results |accessdate=14 February 2011 |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed fourth in round one with three wins (defeating [[John Bouchier-Hayes]] of Ireland, [[Arcangelo Pinelli]] of Italy, and [[Klaus Reichert]] of West Germany) and two losses and advanced to round two.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"/&gt; There, he placed fifth with two wins (defeating [[Omar Vergara]] of Argentina and [[František Koukal]] of [[Czechoslovakia]]) and three losses, and was eliminated.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"/&gt;

He was among six Israeli team members who avoided being captured by terrorists in the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name="jewishchronicle.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishchronicle.org/article.php?article_id=10437 |title=Munich survivor Dan Alon carries scars of '72 Olympics |accessdate=14 February 2011 |work=jewishchronicle.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726202829/http://www.jewishchronicle.org/article.php?article_id=10437 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and four teammates were in apartment 2 of the building at [[Connollystraße]] 31, and while the terrorists captured the Israeli residents in nearby apartments 1 and 3, they passed by this apartment, presumably led to believe by one of the kidnapped Israelis that this apartment was not occupied by Israelis. All five residents of apartment 2 managed to leave the building through the garden and flee to safety.

In 2012, Alon released a book entitled ''Munich Memoir'', co-authored by Carla Stockton, recounting his experiences at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the impact on his life.

On 26 July 2013, Alon wrote a public letter to Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] urging Israel's cooperation in a lawsuit brought against the [[Bank of China]] by the parents of an American teenager killed in a 2006 terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="fatherhoodchannel.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2013/07/28/survivor-of-1972-munich-olympic-massacre-speaks-out-on-behalf-of-a-fathers-fight-against-bank-of-china-728/ |title=Survivor of 1972 Munich Olympic massacre speaks out on behalf of a father’s fight against Bank of China |accessdate=28 July 2013 |work=fatherhoodchannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Embrunman''' is a long distance [[triathlon]] held on August 15 each year around [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]] in the [[Hautes-Alpes]], [[France]].  It is an equivalent triathlon consisting of a swim of 3.8&amp;nbsp;km, a 186&amp;nbsp;km cycle ride and running a [[marathon]] (42.2&amp;nbsp;km), but is not affiliated with the World Triathlon Corporation which owns the brand Ironman, so is not promoted as such.  The French newspaper ''[[Le Dauphiné libéré]]'' described it in 2012 as the hardest triathlon in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Article in Le Dauphiné.com, 15 August 2012 : « Hervé Faure, le tenant du titre, le dit lui-même : "C’est le triathlon le plus dur au monde, car il dure deux heures de plus que les autres ironman." [...] Établi l’an dernier, le record est détenu par le Français Hervé Faure (9h34’08). » Source : http://www.ledauphine.com/hautes-alpes/2012/08/15/une-histoire-de-fous&lt;/ref&gt;
The men's record time for the event is 9 h 34 m 10 s by the Frenchman [[Hervé Faure]] on August 15, 2011 and the women's record is held by Tine Deckers from Belgium (Marmotta Alpin Triatlon Tribe) at 10 h 51 m 14 s on 15 August 2017. The men's record number of victories in this event is held by Frenchman Yves Cordier with five wins, and women's record by Briton Bella Bayliss Commerford with 3 victories.

The Embrunman is the culmination of a multi day series of events dedicated to the sport of triathlon with an Olympic distance triathlon (1.5&amp;nbsp;km swim, 43.5&amp;nbsp;km bike, 10&amp;nbsp;km run) and events reserved for youth and beginners.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

The first event was held on the 19 August 1984, but was only a hint of what it would become.  It had a 750 m swim, 30&amp;nbsp;km bike and 10&amp;nbsp;km race walk.  However, the first bike ride included the steep climb up the Cote de Chalvet (indeed the competitors had to tackle it twice) and which still features today at the end of the bike stage - triathletes today still call it "The Beast"

In 1985, the event was given the organisation of the standard distance triathlon championship of France.  The route was adapted by lengthening the distance to 1,500 m swim, 70&amp;nbsp;km bike and 21&amp;nbsp;km run on a difficult circuit.  280 triathletes participated in the event, backed by 200 volunteers and 20,000 supporters.

=== A long distance event ===

In 1986 the Embrun triathlon became a long distance event with a 4&amp;nbsp;km swim, 131.5&amp;nbsp;km bike and 42.2&amp;nbsp;km run.  The organisers claimed at the time that among all categories of triathlon it was the most difficult in the world. In 1987, the distances were increased to 5&amp;nbsp;km swimming, 180&amp;nbsp;km cycling and 42 2&amp;nbsp;km of running.  A larger climb was introduced of 2600 m on the bike course and 400 m in the marathon.  The event's popularity increased with 420 competitors, 480 volunteers and a large audience attending the event. In 1989, the swimming distance of long-distance triathlon was reduced to 3800 m, to meet the specifications of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTRI). In 1990, the route was changed for the last time with the introduction, in the bike portion, of the ascent of the [[Col d'Izoard]]. This new route of 186&amp;nbsp;km in one loop is characterized by increased difficulty: 3600 m of climbing.

In 2008, despite the competition of the Olympic Games in Beijing, the event see a record of number of participates with 1260 registered on the long route and 600 on the short.  Despite awful weather the race is held, although there are over 110 dropouts during the descent of the Izoard. In 2010, the event supports the twinning of the town of Embrun with the Thai island of [[Ko Samui]] with the creation of a long-distance triathlon on the island.  The planned first event in 2011 was canceled due to natural disasters, but an event took place on 22 April 2012.

=== The short distance triathlon ===

In 1988, in addition to the long-distance triathlon, an Olympic distance triathlon (triathlon M) was started, with 1.5&amp;nbsp;km swim, 43.5&amp;nbsp;km bike, and 10&amp;nbsp;km run.  520 competitors, 600 volunteers and 40,000 spectators participate in this event. In 1991, the Embrun short distance triathlon became a stage of the [[World Cup triathlon]] , a competition with 11 stages and held across 5 continents.  For this event, the bike course was totally changed, with greater technical challenge and a vertical climb of 1,200 m located mainly on the first part of the course.  1,260 triathletes participated in the various formats as well as 1,000 volunteers and nearly 100,000 spectators. As part of its tenth event in 1993, Embrun hosts a stage of the World Cup triathlon for the third consecutive time.  The attendance increased, to a record with 1,500 triathletes involved in various formats, 1300 volunteers, and over 100,000 spectators. It was not until 1997 that the short distance triathlon Embrun was a stage of the World Cup triathlon again, and for the last time.  To date, with these 4 appearances, Embrum is the French triathlon which has most often hosted a stage of the World Cup circuit.

== The Current Embrunman ==

The 30th staging of the Embrunman in 2013 saw several events spread over five days of racing:
* Long Distance Triathlon: 3.8&amp;nbsp;km: swimming, 186&amp;nbsp;km cycling, 42.2&amp;nbsp;km of running.  The bike ascent is more than 3600 m and 400 m ascent in the run.
* Short Triathlon : 1.5&amp;nbsp;km swim, 43.5&amp;nbsp;km bike, 10&amp;nbsp;km of running
* Triathlon Sprint: 750 m swim, 18&amp;nbsp;km bike, 5&amp;nbsp;km run
* [[Aquathlon]] : 1&amp;nbsp;km swim, 5&amp;nbsp;km run
* [[Duathlon]] : 5&amp;nbsp;km Running, 19.1&amp;nbsp;km bike, 2.5&amp;nbsp;km run.  The bike ride has a climb of 245 m
* Run &amp; bike : 22.5&amp;nbsp;km for a team of two competitors with one bike for a total vertical climb of 730 m.
* A triathlon reserved for juniors with specific distances for each age class.

3500 triathletes, amateurs or professionals, juniors and veterans participated in these competitions, including 1000 registered on the short-distance triathlon and 1500 inscribed on the long distance triathlon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dici.fr/actu/2013/12/23/retro-sport-d-ci-la-30eme-edition-de-lembrunman La rétro sport DCI]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIA WTCC Race of Morocco''' (سباق المغرب) is a round of the [[World Touring Car Championship]], held on the temporary [[Marrakech Street Circuit]] in the city of [[Marrakech]] in [[Morocco]].

The race was first run in May 2009 on a purpose-built track. It was the first international car race in Morocco since the [[1958 Moroccan Grand Prix]] at the [[Ain-Diab Circuit]] in [[Casablanca]]. It is also the only WTCC race to ever take place in [[Africa]]. The race was scheduled to be the season opener for the [[2014 World Touring Car Championship season|2014 season]] for the first time, taking the place of the [[FIA WTCC Race of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tremayne|first=Sam|title=Marrakech to open 2014 WTCC season for the first time|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/111148|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|accessdate=8 November 2013|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No Moroccan driver has ever won their home race although [[Mehdi Bennani]] has taken the independents' victory twice when he finished ninth in both race one in 2009 and race two in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The '''Galt Arena Gardens''' is one of the oldest continuously-operating [[ice hockey]] arena in the world{{sfn|Rutherford|2012|p=61}} and the oldest operating [[arena]] in [[Ontario]]. Galt Arena Gardens  was built throughout 1921 and opened in January 1922. It is located in the city of Galt, which is now a part of the city of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], [[Ontario]]. It is the home of the junior hockey team, [[Cambridge Winter Hawks]] as well as the [[Special Hockey International]] team, Cambridge Ice Hounds. The arena is noted for its impressive external [[facade]]. [[ice hockey|Hockey]] legend [[Gordie Howe]] played a season in the arena for the [[Galt Red Wings]] before playing in the [[National Hockey League]].
Former [[New York Americans]] centreman [[Norman Himes]] grew up right across the street from the arena at 91 Shade Street. He played [[Ontario Hockey Association|OHA]] senior hockey in the arena for the [[Galt Terriers]]. [[Ontario Hockey League|Ontario Hockey Association]] teams including the [[Galt Rockets]] and [[Galt Black Hawks]] also played at the building.

Several ice hockey arenas are older, including the [[Aberdeen Pavilion]] in [[Ottawa]], built in 1898, and the [[Stannus Street Rink]], of [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]], built in 1897, but are no longer in operation for ice hockey. The 1910 [[Matthews Arena]] in [[Boston]] is still in operation, but it closed for several seasons due to fires and for renovations.{{sfn|Rutherford|2012|p=62}}

The arena was most recently renovated in 1997, replacing the concrete floor, the spectator seating and the dressing rooms.{{sfn|Rutherford|2012|p=62}} The renovation reduced [[seating capacity]] from 2,000 to 1,100.

An '''in-between hop''' is that term in [[baseball]] which indicates a bounced baseball that reaches an infielder at the midpoint of its upward bounce. As a fielder in this instance typically cannot respond to the path of the ball quickly enough, players try to avoid encounters with in-between hops. While ground balls and throws in the dirt usually do not change direction, such factors as the spin of the baseball or imperfections of the playing surface can influence a bounce. An in-between hop contrasts with a ''short hop'', which refers to a baseball that reaches an infielder immediately after it bounces.

The in-between hop is often responsible for errors in [[Infielder|infield]] play. In a December 2003 [[Baseball Digest]] interview, first baseman [[John Olerud]] cites the in-between hop as the toughest play for a fielder to handle.

'''''Just Dance 2016''''' is a [[dance video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]]. Unveiled on June 15, 2015, during its [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference, it was released in October 2015&lt;ref name=gamezone-releasedate&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubisoft reveals Just Dance 2016 release date|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/ubisoft-reveals-just-dance-2016-release-date-3421135|website=GameZone|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]].&lt;ref name=gs-jd2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Dance 2016 Announced by Ubisoft at E3 2015|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-dance-2016-announced-by-ubisoft-at-e3-2015/1100-6428157/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, ''[[Just Dance 2017]]'', was released on October 25, 2016.

''2016'' notably placed an emphasis on the use of a [[smartphone]] [[mobile app]] for motion detection, and introduced a subscription-based service which offers streaming access to a back catalogue of songs from previous entries in the franchise, as well as additional content that is exclusive to the service.

==Gameplay==
As with previous installments, players select a song, and then follow the motions of on-screen dancer(s) and their choreographed routine. Players are judged on a ranking scale for the accuracy of each of their moves in comparison to that of the on-screen dancer. The game supports the use of each console's motion controller accessories ([[Kinect]] on Xbox 360 and One, [[PlayStation Camera]] on PS4, [[PlayStation Move]] on PS3 and PS4, and [[Wii Remote]]s on Wii and Wii U); alternatively, players can utilize a [[smartphone]] [[mobile app|app]] for motion tracking.&lt;ref name=gs-jd2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=psu-review/&gt;

Standard gameplay has been re-organized under the banner of "Dance Party" mode—encompassing competitive and co-operative multiplayer modes, and the ability to send recordings of performances alongside challenges to other players.&lt;ref name=gs-jd2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=psu-review&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Dance 2016 Review|url=http://www.psu.com/review/28501/Just-Dance-2016-Review|website=[[PSU.com]]|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Dance Quests" mode, players compete against a computer opponent across three randomly selected songs.&lt;ref name=psu-review/&gt; Versions for eighth-generation consoles also include "Showtime", which allows players to record short [[lip sync]] music videos to songs with themed visual effects.&lt;ref name=psu-review/&gt;&lt;ref name=ign-gamescomshowtime&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamescom 2015: Showtime Mode Revealed for Just Dance 2016|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/gamescom-2015-showtime-mode-revealed-for-just-dance-2016|website=IGN.com|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Steve Hannley of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' criticised ''Just Dance 2016'' for its lack of differentiation from previous versions, especially for a franchise described as having reached "''[[Guitar Hero]]'' levels of saturation". Although the Dance Quest mode was partially praised for being a new feature at all, it was declared redundant to manually picking three songs to play in a row, and all of the new modes in 2016 were panned for being "glorified ways to play the game in exactly the same way". The soundtrack was considered to be worse than that of ''[[Just Dance 2015]]'' (which he had previously described as having the worst in series history), citing "terrible" songs, lacking "underground" [[electronic dance music]], and containing too many older songs (noting that only 8 of the 44 on-disc songs were released within the year). The ''Just Dance Now'' service was speculated as being the potential future of the franchise, noting that "at $39.99 a year (or the insane $6.99 a month), it's priced just under the cost of the game at retail and considering the gameplay hasn't changed the past three years, it makes sense to simply phase this in as the complete replacement of annual releases." In conclusion, Hannley gave ''Just Dance 2016'' a 2.5 out of 5, concluding that "while the core gameplay remains fun despite some questionable choreography, the overall package reeks of complete and utter apathy. Basic Kinect features have been stripped, there's an unnecessary focus on smartphone use and only eight licensed songs of the over forty included in total are from this year, which is a huge issue considering that the series has devolved into a glorified track pack."&lt;ref name="hg-jd2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Just Dance 2016|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/10/24/review-just-dance-2016/173737/|website=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lafort Arena''', formerly Knyazha Arena is football stadium in the city of [[Dobromyl]], [[Lviv Oblast]] in [[Ukraine]]. It is the home ground of [[FC Lviv]] of the [[Ukrainian First League]]. The stadium was originally funded and owned by the insurance and brokerage firm "[[Knyazha]]" which used to own the football club. On July 21, 2010 the stadium was renamed to its new sponsors ''Lafort''.&lt;ref name="Lafort"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/first/4c46c044.html|title="Львів" змінив назву стадіону  (Lviv change the name of their stadium?)  |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |work=ua-футбол|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium was declared fit to hold [[Ukraine Premier League|Premier League]] matches in March 2009, but after atrocious conditions in their home game with [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] which left the pitch and stadium damaged, the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] barred further games until the pitch and stadium was brought up to league standard.&lt;ref name="Attend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/49b6a019.html|title=Позор в Добромыле: кто виноват?

'''Letalnica bratov Gorišek''' ({{lang-en|Flying hill of Gorišek brothers}}) is a [[ski flying]] [[ski jumping hill|hill]] and the biggest of eight hills located at the [[Planica Nordic Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovenia.si/visit/trails/the-new-planica-nordic-centre/ | title=The New Planica Nordic Centre | publisher=slovenia.si|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Planica]], Slovenia. It was built in 1969 and is named after the original constructors and brothers [[Vlado Gorišek|Vlado]] (also known as Lado) and [[Janez Gorišek]]. With a total of [[List of the longest ski jumps#Men|28 world records]] set it is the world leading ski jump hill in this statistic. The world's steepest [[zip-line]] with average incline of 38.33% (20.9°) and maximum incline of 58.7% (30.5°) incline opened at the hill on 19 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planica-zipline.si/en/#zipline | title=planica zipline | publisher=planica-zipline.si|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavian ski jumper [[Miro Oman]] made the premiere test jump of {{convert|135|m}} on 6 March 1969. The first ever [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]] were organized on this hill in [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships 1972|1972]]. After [[Matti Nykänen]] set a world record jump of {{convert|191|m}} at the [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships 1985|SFWC 1985]], a new rule was instituted by the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] that no points for jumps over this distance would be awarded in order to prevent world record hunting. On 17 March 1994 [[Andreas Goldberger]] touched the snow with his hand at {{convert|202|m}} for the first ever albeit disqualified over two hundred metre jump. Just a few minutes later [[Toni Nieminen]] landed on his feet at {{convert|203|m}} and officially became the first man in history to jump over two hundred metres. In addition, the first ever jumps over 160 m, 170 m, 180 m, 190 m, 200 m, 210 m, 220 m and 230 m were recorded at the hill. The hill will host the [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]] in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/zimski-sporti/planici-sp-v-poletih-ne-pa-tudi-v-nordijskih-disciplinah/395323|title=Planici SP v poletih, ne pa tudi v nordijskih disciplinah|language=Slovenian|date=9 June 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=[[RTV Slovenija]]|author=A.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill is also known for annually hosting [[Red Bull 400]] world series event, the stepeest 400 metres uphill run in the world, with over 1,000 competitors from around the globe.

Velikanka bratov Gorišek (original name) was planned, constructed and developed by Slovenian constructors, engineers and brothers, [[Vlado Gorišek|Vlado]] and [[Janez Gorišek]]. At the time, a lead engineer of Planica was a Bloudek's successor Stano Pelan, who proposed to enlarge [[Bloudkova velikanka]]; however, they decided for a new hill on another location instead.

At that time, Janez Gorišek was working as an engineer in [[Libya]], where he prepared a plan and profile for a new hill. Construction started in summer of 1967 and was mainly completed in late 1968. During the construction, Janez was still working in Africa, so his older brother Vlado was fully in charge of the construction site. Original [[construction point]] was at K153, with inrun 145 metres long and height difference between take-off table and bottom of the hill 127 metres.

On 6 March 1969, the hill was tested for the first time and [[Miro Oman]] from Yugoslavia was selected to be the first man to jump. He jumped 135 metres from the second gate and set the first hill record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New world record this year in Planica? | url=http://www.dolenjskilist.si/media/arhiv-pdf/dl/1969/DL_1969_03_20_12_991.pdf | publisher=dolenjski list|accessdate=19 March 2015|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The hill was officially opened and hosted a three-day competition called Planica Ski Flying Week from 21 to 23 March 1969. There were 60 competitors from 15 countries with [[Jiří Raška]] winning the competition. A total of 90,000 people has gathered in the three days of competition. The world record was improved five times and finally stopped at {{convert|165|m}}, set by [[Manfred Wolf]] from East Germany.

In 1972, the hill hosted the first ever [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]], where the Swiss ski jumper [[Walter Steiner]] became the first ski flying world champion.

In 1984, in the honour of Planica's 50th anniversary, organizing committee decided to modernize the hill. First big renovation works were done in summer and fall of 1984. Soldiers from the Yugoslav Army, volunteers and different working organizations helped at the construction site under the command of Gorišek brothers. 1,500 cubic metres of material was dug out and filled into the landing zone. They also dug out 300 cubic metres of material from inrun. Old wooden inrun tower was replaced with steel and take-off table was pushed back for five metres.

During the [[1986–87 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|1986–87]] season, two [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|World Cup]] ski flying individual events were organized on the hill for the first time. Polish ski jumper [[Piotr Fijas]] set the last parallel style world record on the first day of competition when he jumped {{convert|194|m}}. However, this record was only recognized seven years later at FIS congress in [[Rio de Janeiro]] when they cancelled the "191 metres" rule.

At the first round of the training on 17 March 1994, Austrian ski jumper [[Andreas Goldberger]] landed at {{convert|202|m}}, making the first ever jump over 200 metres; however, he touched the snow with his hands, and the jump was counted as invalid. Just a few minutes later, Finnish ski jumper [[Toni Nieminen]] landed on his feet at {{convert|203|m}} and officially became the first man in history who jumped over 200 metres.

In the [[1999–2000 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|1999–2000]] season, ski flying team event was organized at the hill for the first time in history. Two world records were set by Austrian ski jumpers [[Thomas Hörl]] with {{convert|224.5|m}} and [[Andreas Goldberger]] with {{convert|225|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mopo.de/donnerstag-16-03-2000--12-44-weltrekord--oesterreicher-thomas-hoerl-flog-224-5-m-weit-19047470 | title=Thomas Hoerl set world record | publisher=mopo |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany became the first ever team ski flying winner.

In 2010, Planica got new chairlift, judge tower renovated, landing zone widened, profile adjusted, and take-off angle lowered to keep jumpers closer to the ground. All this was needed to fulfill international FIS standards.

In 2015, the hill was completely renovated and opened after one-year break. A new profile was drawn by Janez Gorišek with the help of his son Sebastjan Gorišek, who is also a constructor. The hill's new construction point was at K200 and the hill size at HS 225. The take-off table was moved five metres higher and pushed back for twelve metres compared to the old one.

In 2017, the hill size was changed from HS225 to HS240.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==In popular culture==
In 1974, the Letalnica bratov Gorišek appeared as the main location in ''[[The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner]]'', a [[Germany|German]] [[film]] directed by [[Werner Herzog]] which portrayed Swiss ski jumper [[Walter Steiner]] who works as a [[carpenter]] for his full-time occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYnvIBLMBQ | title=The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner - Werner Herzog  | publisher=[[Werner Herzog Filmproduktion]] | accessdate=26 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the landscape painting of the flying hill, drawn by [[Vinko Bogataj]], appeared at the end of the footage on the American ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' show presented by [[Brent Musburger]]. Clip shows an interview with [[Vinko Bogataj]] about his agony of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ZvwIFbXMM | title=Vinko Bogataj interview and his landscape painting of the flying hill shown at the end of the footage | publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] | accessdate=30 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an image of the flying hill was portrayed at the American ''[[The Queen Latifah Show]]'' hosted by [[Queen Latifah]]. Image was used in the background at the parody sketch "Norwegian Sven Nordquist, the oldest ski jumper in Sochi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcLfTrJf9mA | title=Photo of the flying hill in the background of the comedy sketch of ''The Queen Latifah Show'' | publisher=[[The Queen Latifah Show]] | accessdate=2 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Make Mine Music''''' is a 1946 American animated [[anthology film]] produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released to [[Movie theater|theatres]] on April 20, 1946. It is the 8th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], much of [[Walt Disney]]'s staff was drafted into the [[United States Army|army]], and those that remained were called upon by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] to make training and [[propaganda film]]s. As a result, the [[Movie studio|studio]] was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the feature film division alive during this difficult time, the studio released six [[package films]] including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music. This is the third package film, following ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]''. The film was entered into the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4280/year/1946.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Make Mine Music |accessdate=January 3, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film segments==
This particular film has ten such segments.

===''The Martins and the Coys''===
The popular radio vocal group; The King's Men sings the story of a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfields and McCoys]]-style feud in the mountains broken up when two young people from each side inadvertently fall in love. This segment was later cut from the film's US video release due to comic gunplay, although the film's UK and Japanese video releases has the segment intact and uncensored.

===''Blue Bayou''===
This segment featured animation originally intended for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' using the [[Claude Debussy]] musical composition ''Clair de Lune'' from [[Suite bergamasque]]. It featured two [[egrets]] flying through the [[Everglades]] on a moonlit night. However, by the time ''Make Mine Music'' was released ''Clair de Lune'' was replaced by the new song ''Blue Bayou'', performed by the [[Ken Darby]] Singers. However, the original version of the segment still survives.

===''All the Cats Join In''===
This segment was one of two sections in which [[Benny Goodman]] and his Orchestra contributed. Their music played over visuals that were drawn by a pencil as the action occurred. The scene portrayed [[Teenager|teens]] of the 1940s being swept away by [[popular music]]. This segment features some mild female nudity that was edited out in both the US and UK DVD releases, although the film's Japanese Laserdisc and VHD releases has the segment features some mild female nudity intact and uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=301104&amp;page=26&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Without You''===
This segment was a [[ballad]] of lost love, sung by [[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]].

===''Casey at the Bat''===
This segment featured [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], [[Recital|reciting]] the poem also titled "[[Casey at the Bat]]" by [[Ernest Thayer]], about the arrogant ballplayer whose cockiness was his undoing. A few moments are exaggerated or altered and music is added.

===''Two Silhouettes''===
This segment featured two [[rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] live-action [[Ballet|ballet dancers]], [[David Lichine]] and [[Tatiana Riabouchinska|Tania Riabouchinskaya]], moving in [[silhouette]] with animated backgrounds and characters. [[Dinah Shore]] sang the title song.

===''[[Peter and the Wolf (1946 film)|Peter and the Wolf]]''===
This segment was an animated dramatization of the 1936 [[Peter and the Wolf|musical composition]] by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], with narration by actor [[Sterling Holloway]]. A Russian boy named Peter sets off into the forest to hunt the wolf with his animal friends: a bird named Sascha, a duck named Sonia, and a cat named Ivan. Just like in Prokofiev's piece, each character is represented with a specific musical accompaniment: Peter by the [[String quartet|String Quartet]], Sascha by the [[Flute]], Sonia by the [[Oboe]], Ivan by the [[Clarinet]], Grandpa by the [[Bassoon]], the shooting of the Hunters' guns by the [[Timpani|Kettledrums]], and the evil Wolf primarily by [[French horn|horns]] and [[cymbal]]s.

===''After You've Gone''===
This segment again featured [[Benny Goodman]] and The Goodman [[Quartet(music)|Quartet]] as six [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] instruments (Piano, [[Double Bass|Bass]], Snare and bass Drums, Cymbal and [[Clarinet]]) who paraded through a musical playground.

===''Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet''===
This segment told the [[Romance (love)|romantic story]] of two hats who fell in love in a [[department store]] window. When Alice was sold, Johnnie devoted himself to finding her again. They eventually, by pure chance, meet up again and live happily ever after together, side by side. [[The Andrews Sisters]] provided the vocals. Like the other segments, it was later released theatrically. It was released as such on May 21, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affichesdisney.canalblog.com/archives/johnny_fedora___alice_bluebonnet/index.html|accessdate=December 3, 2010|title=Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finale: ''The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met''===
The final segment, the finale of the movie, is a bittersweet story about a [[sperm whale]] (named Willie) with incredible musical talent and his dreams of singing [[Metropolitan Opera]]. A rumor is spread throughout the city about an operatic whale, but is seemingly disproven, therefore the short-sighted [[Theatrical producer|impresario]] Tetti-Tatti believes that the whale has swallowed an opera singer and sets out to "rescue" his non-existent quarry, the newspapers announcing that he was going to sea. Whitey, Willie's seagull friend, excitedly brings Willie the newspaper, all of his friends believing that this is his big chance, so he goes out to meet the boat and sing for Tetti-Tatti. He finds them, and upon hearing Willie sing, Tetti-Tatti comes to believe that Willie has swallowed not one, but '''three''' singers (due to his having three individual voice ranges), and chases him with a [[harpoon]] on a boat with three crewmen. Upon hearing the whale sing, the crewmen try to stop Tetti-Tatti from killing the whale, as they want to continue listening to him sing, even to the point of sitting on Tetti-Tatti. A montage then follows of what would be Willie's future career in performing opera on the stage of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Met]], with Tetti-Tatti shown to have finally been convinced otherwise. In the end, reality strikes when Tetti-Tatti succeeds in harpooning and killing Willie, but the narrator then explains that Willie's voice will sing on in heaven.

[[Nelson Eddy]] narrated and performed all the voices in this segment. As Willie the Whale, Eddy sang all three male voices in the first part of the [[Sextet]] from [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s opera, [[Lucia di Lammermoor]]. Just as the Curtains close, the film ends.

==Theatrical and home video releases==
''Make Mine Music'' was initially released in theaters in 1946. Like many other package features of the 1940s, it was never given a wide theatrical reissue. Instead, its distinct segments were separated and released as separate short films or used as segments in [[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disney television programmes]].

The film returned rentals to RKO by 1951 of $3,275,000 with $2,085,000 being generated in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref name="Jewell" /&gt;

''Make Mine Music'' was originally released on [[Laserdisc]] and [[Video High Density|VHD]] in [[Japan]] on October 21, 1985. It was released on VHS and DVD in the US on June 6, 2000 under the [[Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection]] line. This release was edited to remove "The Martins and the Coys", because it contained comic [[gun]]play not suitable for children. It also removed some mild female nudity in the "All the Cats Join In" segment. The Japanese Laserdisc includes none of the edits made to the VHS/DVD versions. A partially uncensored version of the film was released on DVD in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2013, having been previously unavailable until that point. While it restores the entire "The Martins and the Coys" segment it does not restore the edits in "All the Cats Join In".&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=301104&amp;page=26&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]] re-acquired [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] from [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] on March 14, 2018, the entire "The Martins and the Coys" segment and the "All the Cats Join In" segment features some mild female nudity were uncensored.

Outside of North America, ''Make Mine Music'' has been largely unavailable on DVD and VHS. It has, however, been available in Scandinavia on both VHS (1983) and DVD (2006) and since 2013 on DVD in the UK. This and ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' are the only two major Disney animated films never to see a release on Region 4 DVD in Australia.

'''NYSEG Stadium''' (former '''Binghamton Municipal Stadium''') is a [[stadium]] located in the northern section of downtown [[Binghamton, New York]]. It is home to the [[Binghamton Rumble Ponies]] of the double-A [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]]. Construction began in July 1991 after it was announced that the [[Williamsport Bills]] would be moving from [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].  The ballpark opened the following season, in April 1992, and has a [[seating capacity]] of 6,012 fans.

The stadium is [[Stadium#Corporate naming|named]] for [[New York State Electric &amp; Gas]], the local [[electric utility|electric]] and [[public utility|gas utility]].

==Features==
The stadium is a split-level construction, with a concourse running around the middle of the seating area.  The lower section closest to the field (8-10 rows) is all box seats; above the concourse, the first few rows around home plate are also considered box seats.  The rest of the upper section is "reserved grandstand" seating.  All seats are blue chair-back models.  Six luxury boxes and the press box are located at the top of the seating bowl behind home plate.  A small roof covers the luxury boxes and the top few rows of the grandstand seats.

July 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of developing a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.&lt;ref name=NYT2014July/&gt; The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral [[cam]], which made the machine a success, resembled a [[nautilus]].&lt;ref name=NYT2014July/&gt; On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.&lt;ref name=NYT2014July/&gt;

The '''Nihon Phoenix football''' program, established in 1940, represents [[Nihon University]] in [[college football]]. Nihon is a member of the [[Kantoh Collegiate American Football Association]]. Nihon Phoenix football has been a powerhouse in Japan's college football along with the [[Kwansei Gakuin Fighters football|Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters]] for four decades.&lt;ref name="NHK20180516"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/nhknewsline/backstories/angerspreads/ |title=Anger Spreads after College Football Violence |publisher=Nippon Hoso Kyokai | date=2018-05-16 |accessdate=2018-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Nihon won the Japanese collegiate championships for 17 times including 5    in a row when Mikio Shinokake was the team's head coach. Shinokake adopted the shotgun formation as the team's basic offensive formation. He often had played the team's best athlete as a quarterback in the formation, and the qb played the dual role of qb and tailback. The strategy had worked very well because the size and the power of Japanese defenders had not been so big nor strong enough to injury the qb, making the defenders confused whether  the qb throws the ball or keeps the ball for qb draw. Nihon sometimes used the Dragonfly formation which is a kind of the shotgun formation, and two quarterbacks are aligned at the same time in the formation. These qb's also play the dual role of qb and tailback, then it is almost the same as if four players were aligned in the backfield. Nihon scored two touchdowns using the formation against the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] at the [[Ivy Bowl]] in 1993.

== Controversy ==
The Nihon University Phoenix has played friendly exhibition games against the [[Kwansei Gakuin Fighters football|Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters]] for forty years, and during an exhibition match on May 6, 2018, a defensive player of Phoenix tackled a quarterback of Fighters from behind at least two seconds after throwing an incomplete-pass.&lt;ref name="JT20180515"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/05/15/more-sports/football/dangerous-plays-nihon-university-defender-rock-college-football/ |title=Dangerous plays by Nihon University defender rock college football |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180516/p2a/00m/0na/019000c |title=Dangerous illegal tackle of university quarterback ordered by head coach: sources |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarterback was forced to leave the game.&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516" /&gt; Also, the defender committed three fouls in the match.&lt;ref name="JT20180515" /&gt; However, he was in tears at the bench after substituted off.&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516" /&gt; Just after the match, the Phoenix head coach commented on the defender's plays as if he approved of the fouls or encouraged the players to commit them.&lt;ref name="JT20180515" /&gt; This dangerous illegal late-hit and the coach's comment stirred a national controversy.&lt;ref name="JT20180515" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC20180519"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/05/19/japanese-college-football-coach-resigns-over-controversial-hit/ |title=Japanese college football coach resigns over controversial hit |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ex-[[NFL]] line-backer [[Masafumi Kawaguchi]] pointed out that he'd never seen anything like the late-hit that became a problem.&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516" /&gt; The Kwansei Gakuin University formally protested to the Nihon University,&lt;ref name="Mainichi20180516" /&gt; and accused Nihon of intentionally trying to hurt the quarterback.&lt;ref name="NBC20180519" /&gt; [[Daichi Suzuki]], the chief of the government's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japan Sports Agency]], launched an inquiry and called the play into question.&lt;ref name="JT20180519"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/05/19/more-sports/football/nihon-university-coach-masato-uchida-apologizes-controversial-play-quits/ |title=Nihon University coach Masato Uchida quits over controversial play |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The quarterback was damaged in his [[Vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref name="NBC20180519" /&gt; The defender who injured him was obviously ordered to make dirty tackles by Nihon Phoenix coaches,&lt;ref name="NT20180522" /&gt; and later admitted it in public according to his conscience.&lt;ref name="JT20180522"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/05/22/more-sports/football/nichidais-taisuke-miyagawa-says-coach-ordered-dirty-hits-football-game/ |title=Nihon University player Taisuke Miyagawa says coach ordered dirty tackles |publisher=Japan Times |date=2018-05-22 |accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head coach of Nihon, nevertheless, denied that he had ordered his players to play dirty and resigned as coach without giving veracity in explain.&lt;ref name="JT20180519" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JT20180524"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/05/24/general/veracity-lacking-explanation-coaches/ |title=Veracity lacking in explanation by coaches |publisher=Japan Times |date=2018-05-24 |accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger spread in nation-wide.&lt;ref name="NHK20180516" /&gt;

Reporters of ''[[New York Times]]'' speculated that this controversy related to deep-rooted cultural dynamics including what the Japanese call “[[power harassment|power hara]]”.&lt;ref name="NT20180522"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/sports/football/japanese-football.html |title=The Football Hit Felt All Over Japan |publisher=New York Times |date=2018-05-22 |accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''no decision''' is one of either of two complicated [[sports]] [[statistics]] scenarios: one in [[baseball]] and [[softball]], and the other in [[boxing]] and related [[combat sport]]s.

==Baseball and softball==
A [[starting pitcher]] who leaves without earning either a win or a loss – that is, before either team gains or surrenders the ultimate lead – is said to have received a ''no decision'' pitching [[win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]], regardless of individual performance.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the record for most no decisions by a starter in a single season (dating back to at least 1908) is held by [[Bert Blyleven]], who had 20 in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/kIBhn|title=Pitching Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by greatest number of games in a single season matching the selected criteria|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy John]] has the all-time record of 188 career no decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/wsZC2|title=Pitching Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by greatest number of games in all seasons matching the selected criteria |work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting staff of the [[1918 Boston Red Sox]] picked up just 3 no decisions, the fewest of any MLB team dating back to at least 1908, while the fewest in a 162-game season is 16, by the [[1980 Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/UYdST|title=Pitching Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by smallest Performances matching selected criteria by a Team|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record for most no decisions by a group of starting pitchers is 66, set by the [[1993 Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/yBbHO|title=Pitching Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by greatest Performances matching selected criteria by a Team|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxing and related combat sports==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}
Although uncommon these days except in [[white-collar boxing]], a ''no decision'' (ND), i.e. a tie or draw, occurs if both boxers are still standing at the bout's conclusion and there was no knockout. This may be by law, to discourage gambling; by rules to discourage injury of amateurs; or by prearrangement of the fighters, to protect titles from sudden upsets.

'''Old Gym''' is one of the surviving [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings that characterized the early style of the [[Vanderbilt University]] campus in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The Old Gym was originally a [[gym]]nasium, later served as the Fine Arts Building, and currently houses the university's admissions office.

==History==
The gymnasium was completed in 1880 and featured an indoor running track and considerable gymnastic equipment. At the time, it was one of the best equipped gymnasiums in the [[southern United States]]. The exterior of the building remains fairly untouched while the interior space has been modified through the years and uses of the building.&lt;ref name="HABS #TENN 11"&gt;{{Citation |last=Senkerith |first= Anatole, Jr. |year= 1970 |title= Historic American Building Survey: HABS #TENN 11 |publisher= US Department of the Interior, National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Gym is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; The building consisted of a foundation of Tennessee [[limestone]] with a structure of wooden [[truss]]es and walls of natural finished red brick. The [[Mansard roof]] was covered with [[slate]] shingles. Some of the original gymnastic equipment included a leaping rig, a vaulting board, [[rowing machine]], [[parallel bars]], trapeze ropes, [[Indian club]]s, [[Dumbbell|dumb bells]] and a walnut [[strandpulling|chest expander]].&lt;ref name="HABS #TENN 11"/&gt;

===Remodeling===
In 1962 the Old Gym was renovated and made into the Fine Arts Building by Warfield and Associates. The remodeling project included the removal of the second-floor running track and the addition of heating and cooling throughout the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Suter|first= John, E.|year= 1961 |title= Interoffice Correspondence, May 15, 1961. Subject: Remodelling the Little Gymnasium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namings were purchased by Provident Bank of New York.

In 2012, the project to design and build the stadium received the Ward House Award from the Lower [[Hudson Valley]] Branch of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ward House Award |url=http://www.ascemetsection.org/branches/lower-hudson-valley-branch/awards/ward-house |work=ASCE Metropolitan Section |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2016, it was announced that the naming rights had been sold to Palisades Federal Credit Union.

==Notable events==

* The park hosted games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2014 Can-Am League Championship Round, featuring the Rockland Boulders and the New Jersey Jackals. It was the first time in the stadium's history that championship games were played. It did such again in 2016, this time with the Boulders hosting the Ottawa Champions. It hosted again in 2017, with the Boulders hosting the [[Quebec Capitales]].
* Field of Screams, a Halloween themed event for children that is held every October since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lohud.com/story/life/2015/10/19/field-of-screams/74046172/ Field of Screams brings scares to Provident Bank Park] ''LoHud''. Accessed September 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Record''''' is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[sport]]s [[newspaper]], founded by Manuel Dias, published in [[Lisbon]]. Although it covers most sports, [[association football|football]] is the focal point of it, and almost always is the only sport referred to on the cover.

==History and profile==
''Record'' was founded by [[Manuel Dias (athlete)|Manuel Dias]]. Dias was a newspaper vendor as well an athlete.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt; Dias participated the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt; In 1949, Dias would enter the national lottery in Portugal and would win 40 contos. Dias would use these funds to establish the ''Record'' newspaper. The first edition of the newspaper was published on 26 of November 1949 and was sold on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt; Over the 63 years, ''Record'' have had a difficult times and gone through becoming a [[Privatization|privatizied]] company to a publicly traded one.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

Before the [[Carnation revolution]] ''Record'' belonged to the Banco Borges and Irmão, a bank.&lt;ref name=hel&gt;{{cite web|author=Helena Sousa|title=Portuguese Media: New Forms of Concentration|url=http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/1620/1/hsousa_IAMCRCoreia_1994.pdf|work=University of Minho|accessdate=24 January 2015|format=Conference paper|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it was nationalized following the revolution.&lt;ref name=hel/&gt;

In 1988, ''Record'' was privatized and was acquired by the company Projectos e Estudos de Imprensa (PEI), which also became the owner of the paper ''[[Diário Popular]]'' the next year.&lt;ref name=hen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nelson Michaud|author2=Howard M.

The '''River City Relay''' is a play in a [[National Football League]] (NFL) game involving the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] that took place on December 21, 2003, at [[Alltel Stadium]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. With the Jaguars leading 20–13, the Saints used three [[lateral pass|laterals]] to score a touchdown as time expired in regulation. However, New Orleans kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] missed the ensuing extra point that would have sent the game into overtime, and instead gave Jacksonville the 20–19 victory.

==Background==
The Saints, at 7–7 entering the game, were attempting to reach the playoffs for the first time since [[2000-01 NFL playoffs|2000]]. However, they needed to win both of their final two games to have a chance at qualifying for the postseason. The Jaguars had already been eliminated from postseason contention. While the Saints led early on in the game 3–0 after a [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] field goal, the scoring had been mostly dominated by the Jaguars. With just seven seconds left at the end of regulation, the Jaguars had built a 20–13 lead on the Saints.

==The play==
[[File: River city relay touchdown.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Jerome Pathon]] scoring the touchdown]]
The Saints were on their own 25-yard line looking at second down and 10. Quarterback [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]] passed the ball to the right side of the field to receiver [[Donté Stallworth]], who caught the pass at midfield. Stallworth then bounced off a tackle attempt by Jaguars cornerback [[Fernando Bryant]] and turned inside and broke two more tackles. The clock had already reached zero, and Stallworth pitched the ball to the 34-yard line to [[Michael Lewis (wide receiver)|Michael Lewis]], who ran the ball to the 25-yard line of Jacksonville. He then turned and pitched the ball to [[Deuce McAllister]], who ran to the Jaguars' 20-yard line. McAllister then pitched the ball to the right side of the field to [[Jerome Pathon]], who caught the ball at the 24-yard line of Jacksonville. Brooks, who had hustled all the way downfield, then laid a block on the last Jaguars defender and Pathon dove into the end-zone.

There was a lengthy delay while the officials determined that all of the ball transfers (after the pass to Stallworth) were indeed legal laterals. All the Saints needed was a [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] extra point to send the game into [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] (Saints coach [[Jim Haslett]] eschewed a [[two-point conversion]] attempt to win the game immediately).

==Aftermath==
Carney lined up to kick the extra point, hit a dead push, and the kick sailed wide right. The famous reaction of Saints play-by-play radio announcer [[Jim Henderson (sportscaster)|Jim Henderson]] was a horrified scream: ''"NOOOO!!! He missed the extra point wide right! Oh my God, how could he do that?"''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTGco82JKHo]&lt;/ref&gt; With no time remaining on the clock, the game was over, giving the Jaguars an improbable 20–19 victory.

Earlier in the season, Coach Haslett had stated to the media that he trusted Carney so much, that he'd even stake his life on him. When reminded later that day of those same comments, Haslett stated, "Then I'd probably be dead right now. He's one of the great all-time kickers. I never would have guessed this would happen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=26551&amp;season=2003&amp;displayPage=tab_gamecenter&amp;week=REG16 NFL Game Center: Post Game – New Orleans Saints at Jacksonville Jaguars – 2003 Week 16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss, the Saints fell to 7–8 on the season and were eliminated from contention for the [[2003–04 NFL playoffs|2003 NFL playoffs]]. However, even if the Saints had won in overtime, they would have been eliminated from the playoffs, as the Dallas Cowboys won their tenth game of the season that day (9 was the highest possible number of wins the Saints could have had if they won) and the Seahawks eventually won their tenth game to gain a wild card. The Saints would, however, finish their season on a high note the next week with a 13–7 home victory over the playoff bound [[Dallas Cowboys]]. For the Jaguars, the victory would lift them to a 5–10 record. They would go on to lose the next week, 21–14, to the [[Atlanta Falcons]].

The River City Relay later went on to win the 2004 [[Best Play ESPY Award]].

'''Run Drop Slide''' is a move in the sport of [[skimboarding]].  The [[Boardsport|board rider]] charges the [[Wind wave|wave]] on [[foot]], throws his board down, and steps onto the board in one step, as a gradual smooth running motion.  After stepping onto the skimboard the rider skims across the water towards the wave, hoping to then cut into the wave while turning, and then catch the wave into shore.

The '''Russian Penguins''' were a professional touring [[Russia]]n [[ice hockey]] club that competed in the [[1993–94 IHL season]], playing one game against each of the 13 teams involved in the regular IHL season. The results of the games played by the Russian Penguins counted in the standings for that season. The Penguins finished with a record of 2 wins, 9 losses, and 2 overtime losses earning them 6 points.

In 1993, [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] owner [[Howard Baldwin]] bought a 50 percent interest in the struggling [[HC CSKA Moscow]] team and signed a management contract to run that club's arena. The aim was to provide the team with Western sponsorship and much-needed capital, as well as providing the Pittsburgh club with easier access to Russian players. The partnership lasted two years until Baldwin and other sponsors pulled out.

[[Nikolai Khabibulin]] was the most notable player on that roster.  Other roster highlights included former first-round draft pick [[Yan Golubovsky]] and former [[New Jersey Devils]] forward [[Sergei Brylin]].

'''Subic International Raceway''' is a [[Race track|racing circuit]] in the [[Philippines]], built in 1994 on the site of a US naval base destroyed by eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. Established through the efforts of famed race car driver [[Pocholo Ramirez]],&lt;ref name=mb&gt;{{Cite news|author=Pinky Concha Colmenares |title=Pocholo Ramirez, the Racing Legend |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/199639 |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the site was bought by Sport Values Inc.

The racing circuit is built over the fuel farm and refueling installation at the old Naval Air Station in Cubi Point. It caters well for spectators, with a close infield in front of the pits and viewing areas, with several combinations of corners. These are followed by a short grandstand straight, a series of esses, and then two long straights both with fast corners halfway, alongside the main runway, now the [[Subic Bay International Airport]].
Since then, the improvement and development of the track and competence of its officials has been at a constant pace. It gained FIM approval in 1997 and its grade four [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] license in 1998.

The track is 2.8 kilometres in length with 12 turns and has a 12 metre wide bitumen surface. Subic Bay has hosted South East Asia's Premier motorcycle, touring car and formula car events. The Marlboro Asia Pacific Road Racing Championship, Asian Festival of Speed (AFOS) featuring the Southeast Asian Touring Car Zone Challenge (SEATCZC) and the Asian Formula 2000 have all raced here, and it also hosts the Asian 1600 Touring Car Invitational Cup, the Philippine Japan Invitational Historic Car Races and the Hong Kong Classic Car Races. The major visitor to the track today is the [[Asian Formula Three Championship|Asian F3 Series]].

'''TCF Bank Stadium''' is an outdoor stadium located on the campus of the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States.  Opened in [[2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|2009]], it is the home field of the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and the temporary home of [[Minnesota United FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quarstad|first=Brian|title=Minnesota United to play inaugural MLS season at new home: TCF Bank Stadium|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/08/19/minnesota-united-play-inaugural-mls-season-new-home-tcf-bank-stadium|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=August 19, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also served as the temporary home of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the 2014 and 2015 seasons during the construction of [[U.S. Bank Stadium]]. The 50,805-seat "[[horseshoe]]" style stadium cost $303.3&amp;nbsp;million to build and is designed to support future expansion to seat up to 80,000.

It was the first new Big Ten football stadium constructed since [[Memorial Stadium (Indiana)|Memorial Stadium]] at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] opened in 1960. TCF Bank Stadium also boasts the largest home locker room in college or professional football and one of the largest video boards in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Athletic Facilities: TCF Bank Stadium|publisher=University of Minnesota|url=http://www.gophersports.com/facilities/|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/guide/tcf-bank-stadium/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=January 10, 2016|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Super Bowl]] winning coach and former quarterback for the Golden Gophers [[Tony Dungy]] called the stadium "unbelievable" and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] said that the on-campus facility "will give the University of Minnesota a chance to compete not only in the Big Ten but nationally for some of the best athletes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Gopher Football: TCF Bank Stadium |publisher=University of Minnesota |url=http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329663-tcf-bank-stadium |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190106/http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329663-tcf-bank-stadium |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium is the third on-campus stadium and fourth stadium used for U of M football. Previous venues have been [[Northrop Field]], [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]], and [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]. It is the first of three [[spectator sport]]s stadiums that have been built for the major tenants of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] – the Gophers and two professional teams, the [[Minnesota Twins]] baseball and [[Minnesota Vikings]] football teams.&lt;ref name=mpr5906 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay|last=Weiner|title=Getting Our Fix|date=November 2007|work=Minnesota Monthly|url=http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/November-2007/Getting-our-Fix/|publisher=Greenspring Media Group|accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gopher football program played its first game there on September 12, 2009 against the [[Air Force Falcons football|Falcons]] of the [[United States Air Force Academy]], prevailing 20-13. This was the first football game played on-campus since November 21, 1981, the last game in Memorial Stadium. The highest-ranked [[AP Poll|AP Top 25]] team to visit was #2 [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] in 2015. [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] is 3-3 against Minnesota in [[Iowa–Minnesota football rivalry|rivalry games]] played at "The Bank", and one of two ranked opponents that the Gophers have defeated in the new facility (#24 Iowa in [[2010 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|2010]] and #21 Nebraska in [[2013 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|2013]]).  At the conclusion of the 2018 season, the Gopher football team has an all-time record of 41 - 29 (0.5857) in games played at TCF Bank Stadium.

===Stadium proposal===
The push for a new on-campus stadium for Golden Gopher football began in the fall of 2000. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as their main reasons for wanting to move back on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student senate minutes|first=Rebecca|last=Hippert|url=http://www1.umn.edu/usenate/ssen/010419stu.html|publisher=University of Minnesota Student Senate|date=April 19, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116165539/http://www1.umn.edu/usenate/ssen/010419stu.html|archivedate=January 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U of M May Go It Alone in Stadium Chase|first=Tim|last=Pugmire|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/13_pugmiret_stadium/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=December 13, 2002|accessdate=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A plan for a joint [[Minnesota Vikings]]/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be designed and managed, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Committee Kills Vikings Stadium Plan|first=Tom|last=Scheck|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200202/18_khoom_stadiums/index.shtml|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=February 18, 2002|accessdate=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by [[T. Denny Sanford]] to be the lead donor for the project, but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Officials: Stadium Plan Must Progress|last=Tibbetts|first=Than|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/10/19/10766|newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=October 19, 2004|accessdate=July 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211104334/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/10/19/10766|archivedate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university unveiled preliminary stadium drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations in December 2003. On March 24, 2005, the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35&amp;nbsp;million towards the project which would give them naming rights.&lt;ref name=newstadium&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Financial Corporation Gives $35 million |url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=March 24, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113215828/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was given an expiration date of December 31, 2005; time enough for the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.&lt;ref name=dec31&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium Sponsorship Agreement With TCF Extended|url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=December 28, 2005|accessdate=December 28, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505025459/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html|archive-date=May 5, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state politicians.  The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own.  Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while the remainder would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2,840&amp;nbsp;acres (11.5&amp;nbsp;km²) of university land in rural [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] back to the state, and game day parking revenue.&lt;ref name=newstadium /&gt;  Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] could be heard.&lt;ref name="leg"&gt;{{cite web |title=At the Legislature|publisher=University of Minnesota via Internet Archive|url=http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html|accessdate=December 21, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109075654/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html|archivedate=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to June 30, 2006.&lt;ref name=dec31 /&gt;

Despite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not coming to a vote, the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session.  On April 6, 2006, the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] passed the stadium bill on a 103–30 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for H.F.

The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a statewide tax on [[sports memorabilia]]. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (similar to the previous on-campus football stadium Memorial Stadium, which was last used in 1981 and demolished in 1992).&lt;ref name=mpr5906&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate Passes Stadium Bills for Twins, Gophers, and Vikings|first=Tom|last=Sheck|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=May 9, 2006|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/05/09/gopherstadium/|accessdate=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] stated he supported the House version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gophers Stadium Plan Passes Senate|first=Mike|last=Kaszuba|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=May 9, 2006|accessdate=May 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316083841/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/|archivedate=March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He signed the bill in May 2006 at the University of Minnesota [[McNamara Alumni Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stadium Bill Signed at McNamara|url=http://www.alumni.umn.edu/Stadium_Signing.html|date=May 25, 2006|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota via University of Minnesota Alumni Association|accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative approval 2006===
Even though the differences between the [[Minnesota House of Representatives|House]] and [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]] bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on May 19, in a House–Senate [[conference committee]]. The naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee.  The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out.  The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to the project to compensate for the smaller student fees.&lt;ref name=highlights&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Bill Highlights|first=Tim|last=Pugmire|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=May 20, 2006|accessdate=July 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614164230/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/|archivedate=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compromise bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on May 20, and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for S.F.

==Location==
The stadium is located on the northeast side of the Minneapolis campus, near the site of the former Memorial Stadium, across from [[Williams Arena]]. The site was previously the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the university's four largest parking lots were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium Location |publisher=University of Minnesota via Internet Archive |date=July 18, 2006 |url=http://www.umn.edu/stadium/location.html# |accessdate=December 21, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502063337/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html |archivedate=May 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The address is 2009 University Ave S.E.&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium Logo Unveiling Signals Start of Construction Phase|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=July 11, 2007|url=http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8400&amp;ATCLID=1087853|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is part of a {{convert|75|acre|sing=on}} expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the [[University of Minnesota#West Bank|West Bank]] was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as ten new academic buildings by 2015.&lt;ref name="stribmjs" /&gt; The [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] [[light rail]] runs near the stadium, with a [[Stadium Village (Metro Transit station)|station]] in [[Stadium Village, Minneapolis|Stadium Village]] serving the facility. Construction of the Green Line began in 2010 and opened June 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Corridor Light-Rail Transit Factsheet |publisher=Metropolitan Council |date=December 2006 |url=http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615050209/http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two other major Twin Cities stadiums are located along this line, within a short distance and travel time on the [[Light rail]] line.

An [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessment]] of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December 2004 and March 2006 at a cost of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.  The results were approved by the Board of Regents on March 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Environmental Review Process|publisher=University of Minnesota via Internet Archive|url=http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html|accessdate=June 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807144513/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:TCF Bank Stadium 2.JPG|thumb|right|Visitor side from the main light bank on top of the press gallery]]

The stadium is a horseshoe-style stadium which organizers said would have a "traditional collegiate look and feel".&lt;ref name=newcost /&gt; On December 7, 2006, the university announced that the stadium's field would be laid out in an unorthodox east-west configuration, with the open west end of the stadium facing campus. This layout, similar to that of Memorial Stadium, provides a view of downtown Minneapolis.&lt;ref name="stribmjs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gophers' Stadium Costs Expected to Rise|first=Mary Jane|last=Smetanka|url=http://www.startribune.com/512/story/861532.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=December 7, 2006|accessdate=December 7, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210003422/http://www.startribune.com/512/story/861532.html|archivedate=December 10, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2009, the University of Minnesota announced that the stadium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Certification, the first college or professional football stadium to achieve LEED certification.&lt;ref name=LEED&gt;{{cite web |title=TCF Bank Stadium achieves LEED Certification|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/091809aad.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General features and football facilities===
The centerpiece of the stadium is the massive scoreboard, designed and built by [[Daktronics]] at a cost of $9&amp;nbsp;million.  At {{convert|48|x|108|ft|1}}, the HD-X [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) video scoreboard is currently the largest in college football-only stadiums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium: About the Stadium: Design|url=http://stadium.gophersports.com/about_design.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=June 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831045526/http://stadium.gophersports.com/about_design.html|archivedate=August 31, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the third largest at the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Ryan - [https://archive.is/20140119133607/http://www.prairiebizmag.com/event/article/id/9681/ Daktronics a major league player in sports arena]. Prairie Business Magazine, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The playing surface is [[FieldTurf]], an infilled [[artificial turf]], and the brick wall surrounding the playing field was made possible by an alumni donation of $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minnesota Selects FieldTurf for new TCF Bank Stadium|publisher=FieldTurf|year=2009|url=http://www.fieldturf.com/en/artificial-turf/artificial-turf-news/minnesota-selects-fieldturf-for-new-tcf-bank-stadium|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MN businesses contributed $91M to stadium, then they built it|publisher=Minneapolis St. Paul Business Journal|date=Aug 23, 2009|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2009/08/24/smallb3.html?page=all|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the stadium ground level is the [[Murray Warmath]] Locker Room, named in honor of the Gophers' national championship winning coach from 1954 to 1971. It is the largest home locker room in college or professional football, and features a block “M” lighting fixture and 120 custom-built [[Prunus|cherry-wood]] lockers.&lt;ref name="University of Minnesota"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murray Warmath Locker Room &amp; Team Areas |publisher=University of Minnesota |url=http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329664-the-largest-locker-room-in-football |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200142/http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329664-the-largest-locker-room-in-football |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2016}} Adjacent to the Murray Warmath Locker Room are other team areas including a fully equipped training room, therapy room, medical exam rooms, an equipment room, custom coaches’ offices and locker rooms, a home media room, private recruiting room, and a training table for dining and nutrition.&lt;ref name="University of Minnesota"/&gt;
After a tour of the complex, Pro Bowl wide receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]] remarked that, "This has got to be the best locker room in the Big Ten."&lt;ref name="University of Minnesota"/&gt;

===Stadium aesthetics===
[[File:Winter at TCF Bank Stadium - county names carved in stone on building exterior.jpg|thumb|County names carved in stone]]
To recognize that the venue was paid for with taxes statewide and to pay tribute to the support of Minnesota citizens, the names of the [[List of counties in Minnesota|state's 87 counties]] are cast in stone around the perimeter of the first level. Each is engraved in a piece of cast stone that is {{convert|16|x|5.3|ft}} and weighs {{convert|6500|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U of M TCF Bank Stadium unveils first county signs|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=May 27, 2008|url=http://www1.umn.edu/news/news-releases/2008/UR_RELEASE_MIG_4803.html|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These panels are contained within the reminiscent Memorial Wall, which forms the external surface of the stadium building. This brick façade perimeter wall with arched portals reflects the heritage of Memorial Stadium's exterior, and a 360° colonnade provides a year-round walkway around the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bringing History Back: University of Minnesota TCF Bank Stadium|publisher=Populous|year=2009|url=http://populous.com/project/um-tcf-bank-stadium/|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displayed on the façade of the stadium's upper deck are panels commemorating the 7 national championships and 18 Big Ten Conference championships won by Minnesota in football, as well as ones distinguishing the five players whose numbers have been retired by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gophers Retire Bobby Bell's No. 78 Jersey|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 2, 2010|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2010-10-02-4185631916_x.htm|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minnesota Tribal Nations Plaza encompasses the main western entrance to the stadium and is named in honor of the 11 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nations in Minnesota, featuring eleven {{convert|18|ft|sing=on}}-tall sky markers: one for each nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tribal Nations Plaza Dedicated at New Stadium|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=2007|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/081709aab.html|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also incorporates the Veterans Tribute, a memorial dedicated to Minnesota [[veteran]]s, located in the open end of the horseshoe near the main plaza.&lt;ref name="veterans"&gt;{{cite news |first=Liz|last=Riggs|title=Appreciation day honors U veterans|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/11/15/72164546|newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=November 15, 2006|accessdate=December 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116065752/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/11/15/72164546|archivedate=November 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U to dedicate Veterans Tribute|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=September 9, 2009|url=http://www1.umn.edu/news/features/2009/UR_CONTENT_129577.html|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seating and amenities===
[[File:Winter at TCF Bank Stadium - panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of seating]]
The first phase of the construction includes approximately 50,805 seats, with the design able to support future expansion of up to 80,000 seats. The 10,000-seat student section is located in the eastern end of the stadium, and the area reserved for the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band]] is  partitioned from it, situated directly behind the eastern end zone and framed by a backdrop labeled ''Pride of Minnesota.''&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=TCF Bank Stadium: A New Era for Gophers Football|url=http://www.startribune.com/newsgraphics/27287664.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=February 9, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193036/http://www.startribune.com/newsgraphics/27287664.html|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 20,000 seats with permanent chairbacks in the stadium, located between the goal lines in both the upper and lower decks, but all remaining locations have aluminum bench seating with no backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TCF Bank Stadium Quick Facts|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=2013|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/030709aaa.html|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also features 1,000 handicap accessible and companion seats, and accessible seating is located throughout the stadium, including in the first row of the first level, the last row of the first level, and the last row of the second level.&lt;ref name="TCF Bank Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium|publisher=University of Minnesota|url=http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329663-tcf-bank-stadium|accessdate=August 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190106/http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329663-tcf-bank-stadium|archive-date=October 29, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium seating includes 37 private suites, 250 indoor club seats, 1,250 outdoor club seats, and 50 [[Box (theatre)|loge]] boxes, along with access to the exclusive {{convert|20,000|sqft|sing=on}} climate-controlled DQ Club Room, which offers luxurious amenities to premium-seat ticket holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stadium Features|publisher=University of Minnesota via Internet Archive|url=http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/features.html|accessdate=May 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025005557/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/features.html|archivedate=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium Premium Seating - DQ Club Room|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=2013|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051608aab.html|accessdate=August 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190146/http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051608aab.html|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concourse is on the second level and wraps around the entire stadium, open to the field of play.&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"/&gt; Concessions and many of the venue's 113 restrooms are located here.&lt;ref name="TCF Bank Stadium"/&gt;

Located in the southwest corner of the stadium is Goldy's Locker Room, the team store, which spans two floors.&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"/&gt; The T. Denny Sanford Athletics Hall of Fame was opened in fall of 2010, positioned in the southwest end of the stadium next to Goldy's Locker Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=T. Denny Sanford Athletics Hall of Fame|publisher=University of Minnesota|url=http://www.gophersports.com/trads/hall-fame.html|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more than {{convert|5,000|sqft|sing=on}} Hall of Fame is not football specific, rather encompassing all 25 of the University of Minnesota's athletic programs through dramatic imagery, artifacts, and interactive kiosks. Visitors to the Hall of Fame hear a soundscape with some of the great radio calls from Minnesota's play-by-play voices. The space also honors the members of the 'M' Club Hall of Fame with a wall complete with plaques for each inductee. The Hall of Fame housed the [[Iowa–Minnesota football rivalry|Floyd of Rosedale]] trophy after a win over [[2010 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] in [[2010 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|2010]].

The media area is a three-tiered press box with 10 network TV camera positions and seating for 160 members of the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TCF Bank Stadium: Media Areas|publisher=University of Minnesota|url=http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329667-media-areas|accessdate=August 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030012741/http://www.gophersportsguides.com/page/show/329667-media-areas|archive-date=October 30, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
The stadium was designed to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium from the end of the press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe.&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"/&gt; The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TCF Bank Stadium expansion|publisher=GopherHole.com|date=September 8, 2009|url=http://www.forums.gopherhole.com/boards/showthread.php?7761-TCF-Bank-Stadium-expansion|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 changes==
For the [[2014 NFL season|2014]] and [[2015 NFL season|2015]] seasons, the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) used TCF Bank Stadium as their home venue while their new venue, [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], was under construction at the site of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]]. To help accommodate the Vikings, TCF Bank Stadium underwent several changes, including a new playing surface with heating coils, increased storage space throughout the stadium, and concession upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/Northern-Home-Vikings-Choose-North-Sideline-at-Gophers-Stadium/5ecf260b-581b-4adc-ba4a-4c41e7c99d55 |title=Northern Home: Vikings Choose North Sideline at Gophers Stadium |publisher=Vikings.com |first=Mike |last=Wobschall |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, temporary seats were installed that increased the stadium's capacity to 52,525.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCF Bank Stadium changes |url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/270420741.html |newspaper=[[Star Tribune]] |date=August 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accommodations were expected to cost about $7 million - an amount attributed to the overall construction cost of the new stadium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thevikingage.com/2014/07/17/new-bleacher-construction-appears-begun-tcf-bank-stadium-photo/ |title=New Bleacher Construction Appears to Have Begun at TCF Bank Stadium  |publisher=Fansided.com |first=Dan |last=Zinski |date=July 17, 2014 |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the cost of building TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the construction planning raised the cost to $288.5 million.&lt;ref name=newcost&gt;{{cite web|title=Regents approve stadium design, new price tag|publisher=University of Minnesota|date=January 3, 2007|url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Regents_approve_stadium_design.html|accessdate=July 8, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714024702/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Regents_approve_stadium_design.html|archivedate=July 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has vowed that even if the stadium cost rises again, it will not seek more money from the state nor increase the student fees any further.&lt;ref name="dailyfee" /&gt;

The University has been charging all U of M students a mandatory stadium fee of $12.50 every semester since planning for the project began, and is continuing this fee despite the stadium being finished. The cost of the stadium was $288.5 million of which the university had to pay 52%, and with an average of more than 50,000 students in a given year, in one semester the university makes more than $625,000 from the stadium fee, meaning they receive more than $12.5 million every 10 years from students.

===Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux donations===
The [[Shakopee-Mdewakanton Indian Reservation|Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community]] (SMSC) agreed to donate $10 million for stadium construction, the largest gift Gopher athletics has ever received. The university matched an additional $2.5 million to create a $5 million endowment for scholarships for Native American  and low-income students. The hospitality plaza on the stadium's west side and the scholarship were named to honor the community, and the plaza designed to "... celebrate the history, presence, and cultural contributions of all eleven Native American tribes in Minnesota".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakopee Tribe's Gift Moves U Closer to Stadium Fundraising Goal|first=Art|last=Hughes|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/19/stadmoney/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=October 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=U of M receives $12.5 million gift from Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community|url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/news_details.php?release=071019_3591&amp;page=NS|author=University News Service|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mdewakanton&gt;{{cite web|title=U receives $12.5 million for stadium, scholarships|url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/U_receives_2412.5_million_for_stadium2C_scholarshi.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=October 19, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214010045/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/U_receives_2412.5_million_for_stadium2C_scholarshi.html|archivedate=December 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University received an additional $2 million from the SMSC for construction of the plaza in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Donation Report|year=2009|publisher=Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol controversy==
University president Robert Bruininks originally planned to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium [[season ticket]] seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This is also consistent with other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan and Ohio State University) with on-campus stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U of M Wants to Sell Beer At Football Games, If You Can Afford It|first=Tim|last=Post|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/11/12/u_of_m_wants_to_sell_beer_at_football_games_if_you_can_afford_it/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.&lt;ref name=Shenoy /&gt;

In May 2009, the state legislature passed a law that states that no alcohol may be served or sold anywhere in the stadium, including in suites and premium boxes, unless all ticketholders 21 or older in the stadium can buy alcohol at a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/laws/?id=120&amp;doctype=chapter&amp;year=2009&amp;type=0|title=Minnesota Laws, 2009, Chapter 120, section 8|publisher=State of Minnesota|year=2009|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Minnesota regents voted on June 24, 2009, on Bruininks' subsequent proposal to ban alcohol entirely at campus athletic events (and also ban it in Mariucci and Williams arenas), which passed 10–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Booze for U Sports Fans|first=Alex|last=Ebert|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/49012236.html|publisher=Avista Capital Partners|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the legislature passed a law saying that alcohol could be served in premium seating if it was also available in one-third of the general seats. Bruininks declined to ask the board of regents to make this compromise. Dan Wolter, a spokesman for the university, said, "We recognize and understand that underage drinking is a big problem in our society as a whole so that is a stand that the University wanted to take."&lt;ref name=Shenoy&gt;{{cite news |title=U of M Decides Not to Sell Alcohol in TCF Bank Football Stadium|first=Rupa|last=Shenoy|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/06/07/no-alcohol-in-stadium/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2012, the university regents voted to allow beer sales at the stadium starting in the fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U of M regents approve beer at TCF Bank Stadium|url=http://www.southernminn.com/northfield_news/news/state/article_85007014-4305-5de7-ba26-fa64d222dca9.html|work=Northfield News|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vikings===
[[File:TCF Bank Stadium Vikings.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Vikings colors on TCF Bank Stadium's field]]
Due to [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome#2010 roof incident and replacement|a collapse of the Metrodome's roof]], the  Minnesota Vikings' [[Monday Night Football]] game against the [[Chicago Bears]] was held at the stadium on December 20, [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|2010]], which was the Vikings' first outdoor home game since exactly 29 years before when [[Metropolitan Stadium]] was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Vikings Will Play at TCF Bank Stadium|first=Seth|last=Kaplan|url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/sports/vikings/vikings/vikings-will-play-at-tcf-bank-stadium-dec-14-2010|work=[[KMSP-TV|KMSP]]|location=Minneapolis|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ended with the Bears defeating the Vikings, 40−14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010122000/2010/REG15/bears@vikings |title=Bears 40 Vikings 14|publisher=National Football League|date=December 20, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the win, the Bears won the [[NFC North]] title and [[Devin Hester]] broke the kickoff return for touchdown record.  This was [[Brett Favre]]'s last game in the [[National Football League|NFL]] after he sustained a concussion from being hit by [[Corey Wootton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5941067 |title=Brett Favre of Minnesota Vikings Leaves Game After Hard Hit|work=[[ESPN]]|date=December 21, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siddons|first=Larry|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-03/brett-favre-says-he-played-his-last-game-after-watching-vikings-loss.html|title=Brett Favre Says He Played His Last Game After Watching Vikings' Loss|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vikings played the [[2014 Minnesota Vikings season|2014]] and [[2015 Minnesota Vikings season|2015 NFL seasons]] at the stadium during construction of [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], which required the demolition of the Metrodome. TCF Bank Stadium was the [[List of current National Football League stadiums|smallest stadium in the NFL by seat capacity]] for those two seasons. The Vikings reportedly paid $2 million for upkeep costs for those seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vikings Strike Tentative Deal to Play at TCF Bank Stadium|first=Mike|last=Florio|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/02/21/vikings-strike-tentative-deal-to-play-at-tcf-bank-stadium/|work=[[NBC Sports]]|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vikings also spent $4.5 million to upgrade the facilities to NFL standards, mainly to include heating coils under the turf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mortenson to Upgrade TCF Bank Stadium for Vikings|first=John|last=Vomhof Jr.|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/sports-business/2013/07/mortenson-upgrade-tcf-bank-stadium.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal]]|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings used the north sideline (opposite the press box) in 2014-15.

===Ice hockey===
The stadium hosted an outdoor NCAA hockey game between the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State Buckeyes]] on January 17, 2014. The Gophers won 1-0 with 45,021 fans in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/north/story/minnesota-enjoys-memorable-hockey-city-classic-win-over-ohio-state-011714|title=Minnesota enjoys memorable Hockey City Classic win over Ohio State - FOX Sports|date=January 18, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted to its first [[National Hockey League|NHL]] contest on February 21, 2016 between the [[Minnesota Wild]] and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as part of the [[2016 NHL Stadium Series]]. The Wild won 6–1 in front of 50,426 fans.

[[Image:Table hockey playing.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A [[Stiga]] table hockey game]]
A '''table hockey game''', also called '''rod hockey game''', '''stick hockey''', '''bubble hockey''', and '''board hockey''', is a game for two players, derived from [[ice hockey]]. The game consists of a representation of a hockey rink; the players score goals by hitting a small puck into the opposing "net" with cutout figures that represent hockey players.   The figures are manipulated by rods below the "ice": each one slides forward and back along its own narrow slot when the player pushes or pulls on the rod, or rotates (about a vertical axis) to shoot or [[stickhandle]] the puck when the player spins the rod. Though similar in concept to [[air hockey]] (commonly known as "glide hockey"), table hockey games are more of a simulation of the sport of ice hockey while air hockey is more abstract.

==Original table hockey==
The game of table hockey was invented in 1932, by the Canadian Donald H. Munro Sr., in Toronto. Don, like so many Canadians in the depths of [[The Great Depression|the depression]], was short of cash for Christmas presents. He had a wife and three young children. That year, the family all pitched in and made the first table hockey game. This mechanical game was built out of scrap wood and metal, and included used coat hanger wire, butcher's twine, clock springs, and lumber from the [[coal bin]]. Unlike current games, the game looked more like an early pinball game, with one key difference: this was a two player game. The playing surface had a peak in the middle and sloped down toward each end. The players controlled levers for the goalie and flippers for the players.&lt;ref name=AmericanRestoration&gt;{{cite episode |title= Slap-shots and Stogies |series= American Restoration |airdate= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story goes that a travelling salesman noticed the game and encouraged Don to take the game down to the local Eaton's department store. Don did just that. The first game went in on a consignment deal. By the time Mr. Munro got home, the game was sold and more orders were placed.

== Manufacturers ==

There are many types of the game. The defunct [[Munro Games]] of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, manufactured the original variant of the game in Burlington, Ontario.&lt;ref name=AmericanRestoration/&gt; [[Stiga]] Games in [[Sweden]] are used in the [[ITHF table hockey|table hockey sport]] administered by the [[International Table Hockey Federation]].

The game has also been played using a variety of commercial boards in North America since the 1920s.  Rick Benej,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/article/DF/20101226/NEWS/312269984|title=FISCHLER: Charting popularity of Table Hockey|website=www.dailyfreeman.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Greenwich (town), New York|Greenwich, NY,]] has built table hockey games since the 1980s. His model has  gone through three different designs and refinements over the years. The most popular board for many years was manufactured by the now-defunct [[Coleco]] company, and most North American boards (such as those built by The Carrom Company and Irwin toys) are a variant of this model.  However, the Stiga board has begun to tap the North American market, even as other new boards continue to be introduced.

== Arcade version ==

The [[penny arcade (venue)|arcade]] version is called '[http://www.gameroomchamp.com/dome-hockey dome hockey]' or 'bubble hockey', because of the large plastic dome that covers the playing surface in order to prevent the puck either becoming lost or stolen. The most popular of these 'bubble hockey' tables is Chexx (USA vs. Soviet Union) and its successor, [[Super Chexx]] (Canada vs. USA).

== Game variations ==
[[Image:Dotoho weiß 525.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Do-To-Ho]]
Another table hockey game, called Do-To-Ho, is completely different from the other games specified here. The play figures are not fastened to bars, but are mobile on the whole playing field. In their bases, just like in the puck, there is a ball bearing, so they slide like ice skate runners over the board.
Moving a play figure is done via a short, unique knock against the figure with a small stick as in billiards. The play courses take place alternating, there are 'attack courses', with which the puck may be played by a play figure, and 'position courses' (defense courses as well as offside release courses), with which a play figure only may change position without touching the puck. Puck possession changes, if the aggressor misses the puck or hits an opposing play figure.
Do-To-Ho was developed in Germany and published in 1994.

'''Ulama''' ({{IPA-es|uˈlama|}}) is a ball game played in a few communities in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Sinaloa]]. Descended from the [[Aztec]] version of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]],&lt;ref&gt;Leyenaar (2001) p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the game is one of the oldest continuously played sports in the world and is notable for the fact that it is the oldest known game using a rubber [[ball]].

==History==
{{Main|Mesoamerican ballgame}}
The word ''ulama'' comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word  ''ōllamaliztli'' {{IPA-nah|oːlːamaˈlistɬi|}} a combination of ''ōllamas'' {{IPA-nah|ˈoːlːama|}} (playing of a game with a ball) and ''ōllei'' {{IPA-nah|ˈoːlːi|}} (rubber).  ''Ōllamaliztli'' was the Aztec name for the Mesoamerican ballgame, whose roots extended back to at least the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]] and evidence of which has been found in nearly all [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures in an area extending from modern-day [[Mexico]] to [[El Salvador]], and possibly in modern-day [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;Fox, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LD6h3NHeHxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The ball : discovering the object of the game''], 1st ed., New York : Harper, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-06-188179-4}}. Cf. Chapter 4: "Sudden Death in the New World" about the Ulama game.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have uncovered rubber balls dating to at least 1600 BC,&lt;ref&gt;See [[El Manati]] article for information on recovery of the earliest rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt; ballgamer figures from at least 1200 BC, and nearly 1500 ancient ball courts.&lt;ref name="FOX"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taladoire counts 1560 courts discovered as of the year 2000, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to its religious and ritual aspects, [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] suppressed the game soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], leaving it to survive in areas such as [[Sinaloa]], where Spanish influence was less pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;Leyenaar (2001) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ulama==
Ulama games are played on a temporary court called a ''tastei'' ({{IPA-all|tas.te|}}, from ''tlachtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡ɬat͡ʃt͡ɬi|}}, the Nahuatl word meaning "ballcourt").  The bounds of these long narrow courts are made by drawing or [[chalk]]ing thick lines in the dirt. The courts are divided into opposing sides by a center line, called an ''analco''. A ball that is allowed to cross the end line, the ''chichi'' or ''chivo'', will result in a point for the opposing team. Points or ''rayas'' ("lines", so named for the [[tally marks]] used to keep score) are gained in play. The scoring system provides for resetting the score to zero in certain conditions, which can make for lengthy games.

The modern-day game has three main forms:

*''Ulama de cadera'' or hip ulama. A hip ulama team consists of five or more players (but there could be as many as twelve) wearing loincloths, with leather hip pads for some protection against the heavy (3&amp;nbsp;kg, around 7&amp;nbsp;lb) rubber ball.  
*''Ulama de antebrazo'' or forearm ulama. Played on a smaller field, with teams of one to three players and a ball lighter than that of hip ulama, the games requires the players to return the ball using their wrapped forearm.&lt;ref&gt;For a more indepth look at hip ulama and forearm ulama, see Leyenaar (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Women often play this game.
*''Ulama de mazo'' or ''Ulama de palo'', in which a heavy (6–7&amp;nbsp;kg or 13-15&amp;nbsp;lb) two-handed wooden paddle strikes a 500 g (1&amp;nbsp;lb) ball, usually with teams of three or four.&lt;ref&gt;Federación Mexicana de Juegos y Deportes Autóctonos y Tradicionales, A.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The object of the game is to keep the ball in play and in bounds. Depending on the score &amp;mdash; and the local variant of the rules &amp;mdash; the ball is played either high or low. A team scores a point when a player of the opposing team hits the ball out of turn; misses the ball; knocks the ball out of bounds; touches the ball with their hands or some other body part aside from the hip; accidentally touches a teammate; lets the ball stop moving before it reaches the centre line or even if they fail to announce the score after they have scored a point.

The first team that scores eight points wins. If both teams end up having the same number of points after a turn, both sides begin again from zero. One record-setting game reportedly lasted for eight days,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but most modern games are stopped after about two hours.
