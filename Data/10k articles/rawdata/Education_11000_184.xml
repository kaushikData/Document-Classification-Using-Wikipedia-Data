'''Ada Adini''' (1855 – February 1924) was an American [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who had an active international career from 1876 up into the first decade of the 20th century. She possessed a large, expressive voice which enabled her to sing a broad range of roles that extended from the [[coloratura soprano]] repertoire to [[dramatic soprano]] parts. She made five recordings with [[Fonotipia Records]] in Paris in 1905.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0zthpCZuAUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=%22his+abilities+during+his+stay+in+England+seem+to+have+made+no+deep+impression%22.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bB3e2OnzXt&amp;sig=ycJFRbb_jWA7d0H-cm4bva_ZZno&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJx8TNOvBJSosQOTl5CDBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Ada%20Adini&amp;f=false|title=Ada Adini|author=[[David Cummings (musician)|David Cummings]]|work=The Grove Book of Opera Singers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born '''Adele Chapman''' in [[Boston]], Adini studied [[singing]] with [[Giovanni Sbriglia]] and [[Pauline Viardot]] in Paris. She married the Spanish tenor [[Antonio Aramburo]] while studying in Paris. She made her professional [[opera]] debut in 1876 at the [[opera house]] in Varese, Italy in the title role of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Dinorah]]''. She was then active with the [[Mapleson Company]] in New York City, making her debut with the company in 1879 as Gilda in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] with Aramburo as the Duke of Mantua. She was later heard with the company as Leonora in Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'' to her husband's Manrico.

In 1882 she joined [[Bartolomeo Merelli]]'s traveling opera troup with whom she performed in Berlin (1882) and Prague (1883).&lt;ref name="oper"&gt;[http://hosting.triboni.com/triboni/exec?method=com.operissimo.artist.webDisplay&amp;id=ffcyoieagxaaaaaavcau&amp;xsl=webDisplay&amp;searchStr=Ada Adini, Ada at operissimo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1887–1890 she was committed to the [[Palais Garnier]] where she notably created the role of the Duchesse d'Étampes in the world premiere of [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]' ''[[Ascanio]]'' (1890).&lt;ref name="Amadeus"&gt;{{Almanacco|match=Ada Adini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Adini sang Brünnhilde in the Italian premiere of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'' at [[La Scala]].&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; She later repeated the role at the [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] (1898) and the [[Teatro Costanzi]] (1899). In 1894 and 1897 she was heard successfully at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London as Donna Anna in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. She sang the role of [[Fredegund|Frédegonde]] in the world premiere of [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Ghiselle]]'' at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]] in 1896.

Her second husband was the opera librettist and writer [[Paul Milliet]]. He wrote the libretto for [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Hérodiade]]'' in which she sang the role of Salomé in Monte-Carlo in 1903 with [[Emma Calvé]] in the title role.&lt;ref name="Amadeus"/&gt; Some of the other roles Adini performed on stage were Anita in ''[[La Navarraise]]'', Brunehild in ''[[Sigurd (opera)|Sigurd]]'', [[Catherine d'Aragon]] in ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'', Charlotte in ''[[Werther]]'', Chimène in ''[[Le Cid (opera)|Le Cid]]'', Countess Almaviva in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', Desdemona in ''[[Otello]]'', Isolde in ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', Rachel in ''[[La Juive]]'', Sélika in ''[[L'Africaine]]'', Simonetta in ''[[I Medici]]'', Valentine in ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', and Venus in ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''.&lt;ref name="oper"/&gt;

After retiring from the stage Adini was active as a singing teacher. One of her notable pupils was the Spanish [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Maria Gay]]. She died in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime]] in 1924. Opera commettor Michael Scott summarises her career and evaluates her recordings in ''[[The Record of Singing]]'' (Duckworth, London, 1977).

'''Adele Addison''' (born July 24, 1925&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stevenson |first1=Joseph |title=Adele Addison Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/adele-addison-mn0002257709/biography |website=AllMusic |publisher=RhythmOne |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]) is an [[African-American]] [[lyric soprano]] who was a figure in the classical music world during the 1950s and 1960s. Although she did appear in several [[operas]], Addison spent most of her career performing in recital and concert. Her performances spanned a wide array of literature from the [[Baroque]] period to contemporary compositions. She is best remembered today as the singing voice for Bess (played by [[Dorothy Dandridge]]) in the 1959 movie ''[[Porgy and Bess (film)|Porgy and Bess]]''. Addison can be heard on numerous recordings, of which her baroque music recording are perhaps her best work. Known for her polished and fluent tone, Addison made a desirable baroque vocal artist. Many of her recordings were made with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the baton of [[Leonard Bernstein]].

==Early life and education==
Addison began studying voice seriously as a teenager and, following high school, won a scholarship to study at [[Westminster Choir College]]. Further scholarships enabled her to pursue graduate studies at [[Princeton University]] and at summer sessions at the [[Berkshire Music School]] at [[Tanglewood]]. At Tanglewood she studied with [[Boris Goldovsky]].&lt;ref name="AllMusic" /&gt;

==Career==
Addison made her professional recital debut in Boston, in 1948 while still a student at Princeton. Following graduation she moved to New York City to pursue a career as a classical soprano. Of her 1952 New York City recital debut ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "The recital season reached a high point last night when Adele Addison, soprano from Springfield, Massachusetts, made her debut in [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]]."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;"Addison, Soprano, Excels in Debussy", ''[[The New York Times]]'' 1952-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her New York debut, she continued to study voice at the [[Juilliard School]] with [[Beverley Peck Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/press/pr012901.html Juilliard School]&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Povla Frijsh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Addison-Adele.htm Adele Addison (soprano)]. bach-cantatas.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 she made her [[New York City Opera]] debut as Mimi in [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''. The ''[[New York Post]]'' said the following of her debut, "Adele Addison is about the most appealing interpreter of the little Parisian seamstress yet to appear on the [[City Center]] stage. Small, frail looking, and pretty, Miss Addison enhanced these assets by acting and singing with moving poignancy and sincerity."&lt;ref name=NYP&gt;"Adele Addison", ''[[New York Post]]'' 1955-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Addison was invited by [[Aaron Copland]] to perform the world premiere of his ''Dirge In Woods'' at a concert sponsored by the [[League of Composers]].

Although Addison was offered more opera roles with several companies, she did not appear in many more opera productions as she preferred to sing in recital and on the concert stage. She did appear in a few more productions with the New York City Opera, the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]], and the [[New England Opera Theatre]]. Her other opera roles included the title role in [[Handel]]'s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'',&lt;ref name="Opera News1"&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/_archive/896/Rorem.896.html '&amp;#39;Opera News'&amp;#39; August 1996]. Metoperafamily.org. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Liù in Puccini's ''[[Turandot]]'', Gilda in [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'', Micaela in [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', Fiordiligi in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', and Nannetta in [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' among others.&lt;ref name="Opera News2"&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/_archive/13093/bgoldovsky.13093.html '&amp;#39;Opera News'&amp;#39; January 1993]. Metoperafamily.org. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Addison sang the role of Bess in the film version of Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess (film)|Porgy and Bess]]''. The role was initially supposed to be sung by [[Urylee Leonardos]], but apparently Leonardos' voice sounded too shrill when recorded so they replaced her with Addison at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/_archive/1094/double.1094.html '&amp;#39;Opera News'&amp;#39; 1994]. Metoperafamily.org. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 ''[[Opera News]]'' interview she said, "Today, young singers are almost forced to make a choice, because they are counseled that becoming established in opera is the way to make a career in music. I never had to make a choice. I loved the song repertoire from the start, and as I began to sing, for even the smallest ladies' clubs, etc., those inviting me expected and accepted that.... Even as the years passed, and I sang all the rest of the repertoire – opera, oratorio, chamber music, etc. – the first love remained.... My curiosity, joy and love for song never changed. It still has not."&lt;ref name="Opera News1"/&gt;

Addison made numerous appearances with major orchestras, such as the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Hollywood Bowl Orchestra]], and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. In 1961 she was chosen by Charles Münch as the soprano soloist in the World premiere of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''Gloria'' with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She became a favorite of Bernstein and the two collaborated frequently, including on a number of recordings. In 1961 he invited her to sing the soprano solos in the world premiere of [[Lukas Foss]]' ''Time Cycle''' with the [[New York Philharmonic]]. She performed the work again later that year with [[Izler Solomon]] and the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. She also sang under Bernstein for the opening of [[Lincoln Center]]'s Philharmonica Hall (now [[Avery Fisher Hall]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/cvvpw/gallery/addison.html Adele Addison]. Beinecke.library.yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted performances by Addison include the world premiere of [[Lester Trimble]]'s ''Canterbury Tales'' and her interpretation of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[L'Enfant prodigue]]''.&lt;ref name="Opera News1"/&gt;
 
Towards the late 1960s, Addison's performing career began to slow down as she focused more on teaching. Although retired now, she taught voice on the collegiate level for more than thirtyfive years. She has been a voice teacher for [[SUNY at Stony Brook]], [[Eastman School of Music]] and [[Aspen Music Festival and School]]. For many years, she was also on the faculty, serving for a time as Chair, of the Voice Department at the [[Manhattan School of Music]], which awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2001. Many of her students, such as [[Dawn Upshaw]], have gone on to have successful careers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/arts/footlights.html Footlights]. New York Times (1998-02-18). Retrieved on 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Addison once said, "What I try to pass on to my own students at the Manhattan School of Music is to make them aware of their own abilities, to know how much they need to know in order to be a singing musician."&lt;ref name="Opera News2"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1958, Addison married Norman Berger, a senior research scientist and clinical professor of Prosthetics-Orthotics education in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at [[New York University]]. Berger died in 2005 after 47 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/classified/paid-notice-deaths-berger-norman.html Paid Notice: Deaths BERGER, NORMAN].

An '''aircraft fire trainer''' is a [[firefighting]] simulator designed to practice rescue of passengers and crew during an 
[[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accident]]. Aircraft fire training simulators allow [[firefighters]] to re-create different emergency scenarios such as large-scale external fuel spill, wing, engine and tail fires. They can also help to develop realistic internal rescue scenarios for seat, [[cockpit]], cabin and [[cargo]] fire. Fire training simulators also offer flexibility for the right training activity while providing maximum safety at all times. They are used by  municipal, industrial fire and rescue departments, international airports and [[military]] throughout the world. Ground collisions and [[accidents]] can be created as a part of a large-scale training exercise involving fire, ambulance and police cruise, ground staff and air crews. In addition, secondary incidents can be developed providing training on controlling incidents that can occur around the aircraft. Every activity is managed and viewed from the control tower.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

When aircraft crash, specialized [[firefighting]] and rescue tactics are a must. However, burning up a million pound [[aircraft]] every so often is not a viable option - even for the largest of companies. The solution - full size mock-ups of several types of [[aircraft]] that are realistic enough to provide the right training, but are also much cheaper to produce and crucially - reusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aca-consultants.co.uk/hot_fire_training_simulators.html ACA Engineering Consultants] Advanced computational Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Currie shifted from acting and stand-up comedy to writing and screenwriting.&lt;ref name="ModeOne.net Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-Tribune – Moore"/&gt; In May 1994, after completing one year in the [[Kelley School of Business]] MBA Program,&lt;ref name="BlackSpeakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ModeOne.net Biography"/&gt; Currie moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], to pursue a career as a screenwriter and filmmaker.&lt;ref name="ModeOne.net Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-Tribune – Moore"/&gt; He was hired into the [[NBC page]] program in [[Burbank, California]]&lt;ref name="BlackSpeakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ModeOne.net Biography"/&gt; and began working for [[The Burbank Studios|NBC Studios]].&lt;ref name="Post-Tribune – Moore"/&gt; He later worked for [[Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation]] in their Guest Relations and Special Events department.&lt;ref name="Post-Tribune – Moore"/&gt;

===Dating and relationships author===
Currie developed his concept of "The Four Modes of Verbal Communication" in October 1990 and published his first pamphlet in 1998, entitled ''Mode One: Let Them Know What You're Really Thinking''.&lt;ref name="United States Copyright Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Currie%2C%20Alan%20Roger&amp;Search%5FCode=NALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=cyYpFkqjQBbSrxqz5HcJ8VyDlS&amp;SEQ=20090815104039&amp;SID=1|title=Copyright Catalog TXu000847895 – Currie, Alan Roger|work=[[United States Copyright Office|US Copyright Office – Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26-page pamphlet outlined general characteristics of each of his "Four Modes" of [[interpersonal communication]] styles with women:

* Mode One behavior – characterized as highly self-assured, up-front, unapologetic and straightforwardly honest
* Mode Two behavior – characterized as pleasant, polite, cautious and "beat-around-the-bush"
* Mode Three behavior – characterized as phony, cowardly, deceptive and fawning
* Mode Four behavior – characterized as resentful, vindictive, misogynistic and harshly critical

Currie converted his initial pamphlet into an eBook in 1999&lt;ref name="Copyright Office – Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=3&amp;ti=1,3&amp;Search%5FArg=Currie%2C%20Alan%20Roger&amp;Search%5FCode=NALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=b1TNnS88PLwgOWXbrTZQkm1d9pUr&amp;SEQ=20090815110254&amp;SID=1|title=Copyright Catalog TXu000905742 – Currie, Alan Roger|work=[[United States Copyright Office]]|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began selling it via the Internet. He advocates for "being honest" and has argued that "cutting to the chase is best as it doesn't waste anyone's time."&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Charlotte Hilton (2016). "[https://www.rd.com/advice/relationships/conversation-starters/ 37 Conversation Starters That Make You Instantly Interesting]". ''Reader's Digest''. Retrieved September 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach has been described as "less gimmicky" compared to the methods of [[pickup artist]]s because of his "straight up unapologetic honesty".&lt;ref&gt;Rabasto, Emily K. (May 4, 2015). "[https://www.arcurrent.com/magazine-dam/2015/05/04/the-art-of-the-pickup-a-look-into-the-culture-of-sacramentos-pickup-artists/ The Art of the Pickup: A look into the culture of Sacramento’s pickup artists]". ''The American River Current''. Retrieved September 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Ian Coburn]] described his writing as "refreshing and truly helpful". Currie has stated that, "If you are attracted to a woman, the best way to capture her attention is to tell her what your intentions are; She may initially gasp in shock, but she is more likely to go out with you."&lt;ref name="Post-Tribune – DeNeal"&gt;{{cite news|author=DeNeal, Lisa|title=Straight talk success: Gary man scores with advice book on relationships|work=Post-Tribune|date=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currie was a speaker at the first Direct Dating Summit for Men in London, England in 2010. The weekend conference has since been held in various cities all over the world, and is geared toward helping single heterosexual men looking for advice on how to improve their interpersonal communication skills with women. Currie has spoken at several of these conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Yates |first=Adrienne |date=1 November 2010 |title="Mode One" Book Author Alan Roger Currie to Speak in London |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/273939 |location=London, UK |publisher=PR.com |agency=Yates Public Relations |access-date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Yates |first=Adrienne |date=15 April 2013 |title=Book Author Alan Roger Currie to Speak in Berlin, Germany |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/485334 |location=Berlin, Germany |publisher=PR.com |agency=Yates Public Relations |access-date=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Yates |first=Adrienne |date=22 July 2013 |title="Mode One" Book Author on His Return to Manhattan: "I Am Not a Pick Up Artist" |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/504553 |location=Manhattan, NY |publisher=PR.com |agency=Yates Public Relations |access-date=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currie appeared in the July 2008 edition of ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Essence magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=They Thought I'd Never Get Married|page=117|authors=Bridgette Bartlett and Demetria L. Lucas|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence magazine]]|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has written for [[Examiner.com]]. He was hired to teach an adult education course, "Dating for 21st Century Singles", through [[Indiana University Northwest]] in Gary, Indiana.&lt;ref name="Northwest Indiana TIMES"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/times-correspondent-puts-himself-on-the-line-for-iu-class/article_bd2f45b3-b9fa-5a10-bf23-ab7b71ad2421.html|last=Earnshaw|first=Rob|title=Times Correspondent puts himself on the line for IU class|work=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]|date=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currie was named "2017 Dating Coach of the Year" and "2017 Black Male YouTube Personality of the Year" by a website titled ''The Negro[[Manosphere]].com''&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

===Radio personality===
From June 2007 to June 2016, Currie hosted an [[Internet radio]] show on the [[Blogtalkradio|BlogTalkRadio Internet Radio Network]] titled ''Upfront &amp; Straightforward with Alan Roger Currie''. The show primarily centered on interviews and discussions with dating and life coaches, relationship experts, sexologists, seduction gurus, and marriage counselors.&lt;ref name="BlogTalkRadio"/&gt; Currie continues to host an adults-only [[podcast]], using his popular nickname "The King of Verbal Seduction", entitled ''The Erotic Conversationalist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Erotic Conversationalist Adults Only Podcast Program|url=http://www.modeone.net/podcasts/|publisher=www.modeone.net|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program centers on interviews and discussions with women from diverse backgrounds regarding their thoughts and opinions on issues related to women's sensuality and female sexual [[sexual desire|desire]] and [[sexual arousal|arousal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langston|first1=Leigh|title=Q &amp; A with Alan Roger Currie a.k.a. The King of Verbal Seduction|url=http://dangerouslee.biz/2015/02/09/q-a-with-author-alan-roger-currie/|website=DangerousLee.biz|publisher=Dangerous Lee|accessdate=9 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211031659/http://dangerouslee.biz/2015/02/09/q-a-with-author-alan-roger-currie/|archive-date=2015-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the seduction community==
Currie has resisted having his name associated with the [[seduction community]], which includes [[pickup artists]] and speakers such as [[Neil Strauss]], [[Mystery (pickup artist)|Mystery]], [[Ross Jeffries]] and [[Roosh V]]. He stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not a Pick Up Artist, never have been, and I will never refer to myself as such... I describe a 'pick up artist' as a man who employs psychological gimmicks, pleasant lies, and manipulative 'head games' in order to persuade naive and unsuspecting women into having sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Yates |first=Adrienne |date=22 July 2013 |title='Mode One' Book Author on His Return to Manhattan: "I Am Not a Pick Up Artist" |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/504553 |location=New York City, NY |publisher=PR.com |agency=Yates Public Relations |access-date=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Currie has criticized attraction and seduction techniques which emphasize or utilize misleading or manipulative tactics, saying, "Manipulation can provide benefits in the short-run, but very rarely if ever in the long-run. At some point, your real, true self will come to the surface." He has said that attempts to manipulate make people more vulnerable to themselves being manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Currie |first=Alan Roger |date=2006 |title=Mode One: Let the Women Know What You're REALLY Thinking |publisher=Mode One Publishing, Inc. |pages=17–36 |chapter=Chapter Two – Manipulative "Game Playing": Why Men Frequently Feel Angry, Frustrated and Bitter towards Women|isbn=978-1-591-13897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ask Shagg''' is a syndicated daily [[comic strip]] drawn by cartoonist Peter Guren since 1980.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher Feb 00"&gt;Editorial Staff  (February 7, 2000). "et cetera...". ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]''. Pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]]; it had been distributed by [[United Feature Syndicate]] from 1980 until 1995.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher July 95"&gt;Astor, David  (July 29, 1995). "'Shagg' to Creators". ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]''. Pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The strip has run in dozens of newspapers including ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher July 95"/&gt; In each strip Guren, through his Shagg E. Dawg character, answers questions from readers about the animal kingdom. 

== Characters and story ==
The strip features lead character Shagg E. Dawg answering questions about animals that are sent in by readers.  Questions about particular animals are sometimes answered by the strip's other characters, Rosko the cat, Mouth the myna bird, and Slippy the flying squirrel.  In 1995 Guren was receiving more than 15,000 letters a year, with about 75% of them from children.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher July 95"/&gt; Readers receive a free Shagg doll if their question appears in the strip. 

The strips generally feature a joke of some sort about the subject animal in addition to providing an accurate answer to the day's question. (For example, one strip answered a question about hamsters storing food in their cheeks and then compared it to a human carrying their money in their mouths. The last panel then showed a picture of a person holding their money in their mouth.)

==Community service==
Guren has often used  ''Ask Shagg'' to raise money or awareness for causes. His Shagg E. Dawg character was used on information cards about endangered species that were included with kid's  meals from Wendy's fast-food restaurants in 1993.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher Nov 93"&gt;Astor, David  (November 27, 1993). "Wendy's promotion". ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]''. Pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
Guren launched his first ''Ask Shagg'' website in May 1996 and began putting the site's address in the newspaper version of his strip.&lt;ref name="Editor &amp; Publisher Nov 96"&gt;Astor, David  (November 23, 1996). "Syndicated Creators Have Their Own Web Sites, Too". ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]''. Pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The site AskShagg.com features a search engine with which users can search for "Ask Shagg" comic strips with questions about a particular animal.

==Book==
In 1985 [[World Almanac]] Publications published the book ''Ask Shagg'', with the attribution "by Shagg E. Dawg as told to Peter Guren."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask Shagg (Open Library)|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5117026W/Ask_Shagg|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was distributed in the United States by [[Ballantine Books]].

The '''Australian Qualifications Framework''' ('''AQF''') specifies the standards for educational qualifications in Australia. It is administered nationally by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government's]] [[Department of Industry (Australia)|Department of Industry]], with oversight from the States and Territories, through the Standing Council of Tertiary Education Skills and Employment. While the AQF specifies the standards, education and training organisations are authorised by accrediting authorities to issue a qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqf.edu.au/Portals/0/Documents/2013%20docs/AQF%202nd%20Edition%20January%202013.pdf Australian Qualifications Framework.

==AQF levels==
The Framework is structured around levels of descriptive criteria, with formal qualifications aligned to the appropriate levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aqf.edu.au/sites/aqf/files/aqf-2nd-edition-january-2013.pdf|title=Australian Qualification Framework|last=Australian Qualifications Framework Council|first=|date=January 2013|website=Australian Qualification Framework|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools sector==

===Senior Secondary Certificate of education===
{{See also|Australian Certificate of Education|Senior Secondary Certificate of Education|Australian Tertiary Admission Rank}}
The '''Senior Secondary Certificate of Education''' (SSCE) is the graduation certificate awarded to most students in Australian high schools, and is equivalent to the [[Advanced Placement|Advance Placement]] of North America and the [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] of the United Kingdom. Students completing the SSCE are usually aged 16 to 18 and study full-time for two years (years 11 and 12 of schooling). In some states adults may gain the certificate through a [[Technical and Further Education]] college or other provider.

The curriculum, assessment and name of the SSCE is different in each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]]. The government of each determines these themselves, although the curriculum must address mutually agreed national competencies.

|[[Northern Territory]]||[[Northern Territory Certificate of Education]]||NTCE
|}

[[Universities Australia]] generates a nationally standardised final score for each SSCE student called the
[[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]].
Universities and other Higher Education providers typically use this mark as the main criterion in selecting domestic students.
Prior to 2010, this was called the [[Equivalent National Tertiary Entry Rank|Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (ENTER) in Victoria,
and the [[University Admissions Index]] (UAI) in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and the [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (TER) elsewhere.

Competing qualifications outside the Australian Qualifications Framework are the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and ''[[Accelerated Christian Education]](ACE) Year 12 Academic Certificate.'' The IB is well accepted by universities. ACE has lesser support, and students may also have to additionally pass a [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (SAT).

==Vocational Education and Training and Higher Education sectors==
There has been growing overlap between the [[Vocational Education|Vocational Education and Training]] (VET), organised under the [[National Training System (Australia)|National Training System]], and Higher Education sectors in Australia. Courses are primarily taken by those aged over 18, however in some vocational and general academic courses a minority of students enter at the minimum school-leaving age of 16, although from May 2009 Federal Government policy calls for young people to be in education, gainful employment, or training until age 17 (Year 12 qualification) with tightening of income support payments to age 20 if not undertaking further training.&lt;ref&gt;{{

 | date = 1 May 2009 | accessdate= 9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tends to happen particularly at [[Technical and Further Education]] colleges (TAFE), and is less likely to happen at a university or a private institution.

The two sectors form a continuum, with VET at the lower end and Higher Education at the higher. VET courses are typically short, practical in nature and delivered by a TAFE college or [[Registered Training Organisation]] at a [[Academic certificate|certificate]] to diploma level. Higher Education courses take three years or longer to complete, are academic in nature and are delivered by universities at [[academic degree|degree]] level. There is significant overlap, however; a TAFE college may offer degrees and universities may offer certificates and diplomas. A number of private institutions and community education centres cover the full range of qualifications.

There has been a strong push towards mutual recognition of qualifications, with VET or Higher Education courses recognised towards other courses (and for those under 21 towards an SSCE). A process of [[Recognition of Prior Learning]] (RPL) has been implemented to allow competencies gained through work and other experience to be assessed and recognised. For instance, a ''Diploma of Agriculture'' might be recognised as the equivalent of the first year of the ''Bachelor of Agricultural Science'' degree; a unit of ''Letter Writing'' in a ''Certificate IV of Writing'' might be recognised as a unit towards a ''Bachelor of Business'' degree; experience in aged care might be recognised towards a ''Certificate in Community Services''.

All students doing nationally recognised training need to have a Unique Student Identifier (USI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usi.gov.au/about|title=About|first=Chris|last=Cook|date=12 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certificates I-IV===
Certificates I-IV are the basic qualifications and prepare candidates for both employment and further education and training. There is no firm duration for these qualifications.

Certificates I-II provide basic vocational skills and knowledge, while Certificates III-IV replace the previous system of ''trade certificates'' and provide training in more advanced skills and knowledge. These courses are usually delivered by [[TAFE]] colleges, community education centres and registered private training providers.

===Diploma, Advanced diploma, Associate degree===
Courses at Diploma, Advanced Diploma and [[Associate degree]] level take between one and three years to complete, and are generally considered to be equivalent to one to two years of study at degree level.
''Diploma'' and ''Advanced Diploma'' are titles given more practical courses, while ''Associate degree'' is given to more academic courses.

These courses are usually delivered by universities, TAFE colleges, community education centres and private RTO's (Registered Training Organisations).

===Bachelor degree and honours===
The [[Bachelor degree]] is the standard university qualification and is recognised worldwide. Most courses take three to four years to complete and are Level 7 qualifications.

[[Honours degrees|Honours]] may be awarded atop a bachelor's degree after an additional year of study for three-year degrees or, in the case of four-year degrees, for performance at credit or distinction average level. An Honours degree is a Level 8 qualification and is denoted by "Hons" in parentheses following the degree abbreviation, for example BA (Hons). Honours degrees requiring an additional year of study generally involve a research project and require the completion of a thesis during the optional fourth year of study.

Traditionally these courses have almost exclusively been delivered by universities, however there is now a growing number of TAFE institutions and private colleges who have higher education status to deliver degree programs.

===Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma===
Graduate Certificate and Graduate diplomas are Level 8 qualifications alongside the Bachelor (Honours) degree. Entry to a Graduate Certificate or Graduate Diploma typically requires completion of a Bachelor's degree or higher. In some cases, admission may be on the basis of significant work experience. Graduate Certificates typically take six months of full-time study to complete, while Graduate Diplomas take twelve months.

These courses are usually delivered by universities and private providers.

===Masters degree===
A Master's degree usually requires two years of full-time study to complete. A completed bachelor's degree, sometimes with honours, is a prerequisite for admission. The pattern of study generally takes one of the following three forms:
* ''Coursework'' – comprising postgraduate level rigorous academic coursework and project work. In some fields also consists of a research component and requires the completion of a thesis. In such fields, completion of only the coursework component without submitting a thesis usually results in a graduate diploma being awarded instead.
* ''Research'' – comprising substantial research and completion of a major, externally assessed thesis.
* ''Extended'' – for preparation for professional practice in fields such as law, medicine, physiotherapy, speech pathology, social work or other professional fields.

Master's degree (extended) are permitted to deviate from the 'Master of ...' naming convention. Those in legal practice may use the name [[Juris Doctor]], but do not allow a graduate use of the honorific title 'doctor'. Master's degree (extended) in medical practice, physiotherapy, dentistry, optometry and veterinary practice are allowed to be named 'Doctor of ...' or 'Master of ...' such as Doctor/Master of Dentistry, Doctor/Master of Optometry and Doctor/Master of Medicine, and graduates are permitted to use 'doctor' (Dr.) as a courtesy title where it is existing practice for that profession. Universities are not permitted to refer to these degrees as doctorates and must note on documentation such as transcripts that the qualification is a master's degree (extended).

Master's level courses are delivered by universities and a limited number of registered private providers.

===Doctoral degree===
The highest qualification, a [[Doctorate|Doctoral degree]] is awarded by a university. This generally requires the completion of a major thesis, which has to be assessed externally by experts in the field of study. Additionally, there are professional doctorates, which require less research and are partially assessed by coursework or projects. Entry into an Australian Doctorate program requires an Honours degree or "Honours equivalent". A Master's degree is usually considered equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrgs.monash.edu.au/research/doctoral/chapter2a.html Admission to doctoral and MPhil candidature], Monash Research Graduate School, Monash University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/grad-school/academic-entry-requirements-and-the-basis-of-admission Our research degrees – UQ Graduate School – The University of Queensland, Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070350/http://www.uq.edu.au/grad-school/academic-entry-requirements-and-the-basis-of-admission |date=22 February 2008 }}, University of Queensland&lt;/ref&gt; Holders of Doctoral degrees are permitted to use the title 'Doctor'.

==Qualification issuing agencies==
Whilst the AQF specifies the standards for qualifications, it is the education and training organisations that issue a qualification. Education and training organisations are authorised to issue qualifications by one of the following authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqf.edu.au/Portals/0/Documents/2013%20docs/AQF%202nd%20Edition%20January%202013.pdf Australian Qualifications Framework.

* State and territory government authorised statutory bodies responsible for issuing the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education in their own state or territory.
* [[Registered Training Organisations]] (RTOs) authorised by the [[Australian Skills Quality Authority]] (ASQA) and the government accrediting authorities in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia, Australia|Western Australia]] to issue AQF qualifications in vocational education and training.
* Non-self-accrediting higher education providers authorised by the [[Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency]] (TEQSA) to issue AQF qualifications in higher education.
* Self-accrediting universities and higher education providers authorised by the [[Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency]] (TEQSA) to issue AQF qualifications in higher education.
* The other users of the Specifications are industry and professional bodies, licensing and regulatory bodies, students, graduates and employers.

The '''blue bottle experiment''' is a [[chemical reaction]]. An aqueous solution containing [[glucose]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[methylene blue]] and some air is shaken in a closed bottle; it turns from colorless to blue and then decolorizes again after a while. With further shaking, the cycle can be repeated many times.&lt;ref name="The 'blue bottle' reaction"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Baker|first=Colin|title=The 'blue bottle' reaction|url=https://eic.rsc.org/exhibition-chemistry/the-blue-bottle-reaction/2020070.article|magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]]|date=1 November 2006|volume=43|issue=6|page=155|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment is a classic chemistry demonstration and can be used in laboratory courses as a general chemistry experiment to study [[chemical kinetics]] and reaction mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=C.Engerer and G.

== Reactions ==
[[File:Complete reactions of blue bottle experment .png|600px|Complete reactions of blue bottle experment]]

It was originally believed that the total reaction was the oxidation of an [[aldehyde]] group to a [[carboxylic acid]] under [[alkaline]] conditions, for example, glucose being oxidized to [[gluconate]] by [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olah|first1=Herbert W. Roesky|title=Spectacular chemical experiments|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-31865-0|edition= 1st Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment also works for compounds such as [[vitamin C]] and [[Benzoin (organic compound)|benzoin]], which do not contain an aldehyde.&lt;ref name=Lim2017/&gt; The reaction is actually the oxidation of an [[acyloin]] or related [[alpha and beta carbon|α]]-[[hydroxyl|hydroxy]]-[[carbonyl]] group, which is a feature of glucose, to a 1,2 di[[ketone]].&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

== Formulation ==

=== Classical version ===

The aqueous solution in the classical reaction contains [[glucose]], [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[methylene blue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakhashiri|first1=Bassam Z.|title=Chemical demonstrations|date=1985|publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=978-0-299-10130-5|pages=142–143|edition= [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step the [[enolate]] of glucose is formed. The next step is a [[redox reaction]] of the enolate with methylene blue. The glucose is oxidized to [[gluconic acid]] which, in alkaline solution is in the [[sodium gluconate]] form. Methylene blue is reduced to colorless leucomethylene blue. The process can be described by as a [[pseudo first order reaction]], using it as an example to understand the changing concentration of the chemicals over the course of the solution going from blue back to colorless.&lt;ref name="The 'blue bottle' reaction"/&gt;

If there is enough available oxygen, leucomethylene blue is then re-oxidized to methylene blue and the blue color of the solution is restored. The availability of oxygen is increased by shaking the solution. When the solution comes to rest, glucose reduction of the redox dye again takes the upper hand and the color of the solution disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summerlin|first1=Lee R.|title=Chemical demonstrations|date=1988|publisher=American Chem. Society|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780841214811|page=127|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is [[Order of reaction|first order]] in glucose, methylene blue and hydroxide ion and zero-order in oxygen. 
Other glucose oxidation products besides sodium gluconate that are reported are D-arabino-hexos-2-ulose (glucosone), the anion of D-arabinonate after splitting of a formate anion and finally [[arabinonic acid]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;''What Is Happening When the Blue Bottle Bleaches: An Investigation of the Methylene Blue-Catalyzed Air Oxidation of Glucose'', Laurens Anderson, Stacy M.

=== Green version ===
Wellman and Noble proposed a new formulation for the Blue Bottle experiment, they use vitamin C instead of glucose, while methylene blue and oxygen are still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellman and Noble|first1=Whitney and Mark|title=Greening the Blue Bottle|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|page=537|doi=10.1021/ed080p537|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed080p537|bibcode=2003JChEd..80..537W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is added as a catalyst for the reoxidation of [[leucomethylene blue]] to [[methylene blue]]. These modifications give an experiment that generates a smaller amount of waste and waste that is less corrosive and easier to neutralize, and therefore are examples of [[green chemistry]] modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajchakit and Limpanuparb|first1=Urawadee and Taweetham|title=Greening the Traffic Light: Air Oxidation of Vitamin C Catalyzed by Indicators|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=October 16, 2015|pages=1486–1489|doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00630|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00630|bibcode=2016JChEd..93.1486R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that the [[Chemical traffic light experiment|traffic light]] and [[Vanishing valentine experiment|vanishing valentine]] experiments can become successful regardless of whether a sugar is added. One variation is more rapid, with the number of color change cycles not lasting as long as the classical and green versions because the reactants are used in smaller amounts; also, the reducing agent for this experiment is benzoin, which is added to help increase the number of cycles in the solution. Moreover, the usable period in this experiment is quite short. Although the experiment is prepared overnight, the reducing agent can be added at any time to be able to observe the solution more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajchakit|first1=Urawadee|last2=Limpanuparb|first2=Taweetham|title=Rapid Blue Bottle Experiment: Autoxidation of Benzoin Catalyzed by Redox Indicators|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=9 August 2016|volume=93|issue=8|pages=1490–1494|doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00018|bibcode=2016JChEd..93.1490R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enzymatic version ===

Zhang, Tsitkov, and Hess from Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;Yifei Zhang, Stanislav Tsitkov, Henry Hess. Complex dynamics in a two-enzyme reaction network with substrate competition, Nature Catalysis 2018, 1, 276–281.[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-018-0053-1 doi:10.1038/s41929-018-0053-1]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an enzymatic version of the "blue bottle experiment". They named it the "green bottle experiment", since the system is colored green and the reagents are safer than classical approaches.The experiment is performed in a clear glass vial containing two common enzymes (glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase), glucose, and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (abbreviated as ABTS) in PBS buffer. A thin layer of oil is used to block the solution from the air. The solution initially turns green and then turns colorless with the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Shaking the solution introduces fresh oxygen and colors the solution green again until the oxygen is consumed.

This version relies on three enzymatic reactions. First, the glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen and produces hydrogen peroxide. Second, the horseradish peroxidase utilizes the hydrogen peroxide to oxidize ABTS to its radical cationic form, ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt;. As the dissolved oxygen is consumed in the solution, the third reaction occurs:  glucose oxidase catalyzes the reduction of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt; back to ABTS in the presence of glucose. This system can also form beautiful patterns arising from reaction-driven Rayleigh-Bénard convection.

=== Variation of dyes ===

Four (families) of dyes are used in the oxidation thiazines, oxazines, azines, and indigo carmine, reported to work with glucose and caustic soda. It is also noted that the observation of ascorbic acid is achieved in a wider range of pH.

* [[Vanishing valentine experiment]]

==Pattern formation==

[[Pattern formation]] is when a solution containing NaOH, glucose, and dye is poured into an open [[Petri dish]] which is open to the atmosphere. This will result in solution changing its structure over a period of time. Structures arise from molecular transport through [[diffusion]] and [[chemical kinetics]]. Patterns formed in the Petri dish can be described as a mosaic pattern; web-like, dynamic spiral, branching, and lines connecting to each others.&lt;ref&gt;''Pattern Formation in the Methylene-Blue-Glucose System'', Pons. A. J, Sague ́s. F, Bees. M. A, Graae Sørensen. P [[J. Phys. Chem. B]] 2000, 104 (10), 2251–2259 {{DOI|10.1021/jp9935788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are factors that can affect pattern formation. Changes in pattern formation are not homogeneous and can be caused by several factors. Different types of dye in solution will give the same pattern because of the bond's formation and the dynamics remain the same, this is because the solution has the same colour as the dye. Different amounts of dye can result in density change in the solution and this results in changing of convective motion. Different amounts of dye can bring in different amounts of convention cell which are also formed by different amounts of glucose and oxidized product. This can result in an interesting spatial phenomena. Time can also affect pattern formation. As the time passed, one pattern gradually faded away. Spirals and branches started to disappear and eventually disappeared fully.&lt;ref name=adamcikova&gt;''The Blue Bottle Experiment and Pattern Formation in this System'', Adamčíková. L`, Ševčík. P [[Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A]] 52a, 650-654 (1997) {{DOI|10.1515/zna-1997-8-918}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facts indicate that [[oxygen]] affects the chemical reaction and this plays a fundamental role in the pattern formation. Pattern formation may also form from a chemically driven convective instability. This means that matter is exchanged across the air-reaction mixture interface, due to the fluctuations in the molecular nature of chemical systems.&lt;ref name=adamcikova /&gt;

A small group of researchers of the [[University of Glasgow]] named Pons, Batiste and Bees came up with a small conclusion about pattern formation in the methylene blue-glucose system. They came up with a conclusive statement that a similar pattern can be formed in a container with accessible oxygen. This resulting surface tension effect isn't required to produce the instability. Small holes were also found in the lid of container that oxygen can't access resulting in a thin, blue, and lower amount of oxygen. Pattern length and time scale had been explored in one of their experiments due to the variation in viscosity and fluid depth. The experiment reveals that the [[wavelength]] is formed as a pattern starts to form quickly. Then wavelength or pattern can be maintained or oscillate for a while.&lt;ref&gt;''Nonlinear chemoconvection in the methylene-blue–glucose system: Two-dimensional shallow layers'',  Pons. A. J, Batiste. O, Bees. M. A [[Physical Review E]] 78, 016316 2008 {{DOI|10.1103/PhysRevE.78.016316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bobo Explores Light''''' is an education book [[Mobile app|app]] for [[iPad]] that introduces children to light and light related topics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/bobo-explores-light/id463809859|title=Bobo Explores Light - App Store Preview|last=|first=|date=|website=App Store|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in September 2011. Bobo was developed by Game Collage in collaboration with journalist Bob Tedeschi, creator and author of [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'']]’ weekly App Smart column. In 2012, ''Bobo Explores Light'' won an [[Apple Design Awards|Apple Design Award]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dustormagic.com/speaker/bob-tedeschi/|title=Bob Tedeschi details|last=|first=|date=|website=Dust or Magic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/01/15/a-feather-in-his-app-times-columnist-creates-popular-bobo/|title=A feather in his app: Times columnist creates popular Bobo|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|date=January 15, 2013|work=New York Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TSA screeners spooked by Apple's 'futuristic artifact' |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/18/apple_design_award_spooks_tsa/ |website=The Register |publisher=The Register |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The main character is a friendly, humorous robot named Bobo who helps kids learn about light. He serves as guide throughout the 21 chapters exploring light-related subjects such as lighting, [[bioluminescence]], [[lasers]], [[refraction]] and the human eye. Targeted for school-aged children, the app presents interactive elements, supplementary videos, articles, animations and trivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/10/bobo-explores-light-will-illuminate-your-ipad-learning/|title=Bobo Explores Light will illuminate your iPad learning|last=Barry|first=Nathan|date=2011-10-12|journal=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Development and release ==
In 2010 Tedeschi came up with the idea to writnoe about the process of developing and publishing an app. He teamed up with app developer Juraj Hlavac and illustrator Dean MacAdam and together they developed Bobo Explores Light over a six-month period. In order to avoid preferential treatment from Apple and other journalists, Tedeschi used the pseudonym Craig Fusco.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efw6H-7Pzjc|title=N.Y.

[[File:Seymour Papert.png|thumb|Seymour Papert]]

'''Constructionist learning''' is when learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. Constructionism advocates student-centered, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alesandrini, K. &amp; Larson, L. (2002). Teachers bridge to constructivism. The Clearing House, 119-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Students learn through participation in project-based learning where they make connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge facilitated by the teacher through coaching rather than using lectures or step-by-step guidance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Further, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with [[experiential learning]] and builds on [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[epistemological]] theory of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cakir, M. (2008). Constructivist Approaches to Learning in Science and Their Implications for Science Pedagogy: A Literature Review. International Journal of Environmental &amp; Science Education, 3(4), 193-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seymour Papert]] defined constructionism in a proposal to the [[National Science Foundation]] titled ''Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory of science education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sabelli |first=N. | date=2008 | title=Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education | publisher=DRL Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings | pages=193-206 | url=http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8751190 | accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars have tried to describe constructionism as a "learning-by-making" formula but, as [[Seymour Papert]] and [[Idit Harel]] say at the start of ''Situating Constructionism'', it should be considered "much richer and more multifaceted, and very much deeper in its implications than could be conveyed by any such formula."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Papert | first1=S. | last2=Harel | first2=I | date=1991 | title=Constructionism | publisher=Ablex Publishing Corporation |pages=193-206 | url=http://www.papert.org/articles/SituatingConstructionism.html | accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papert's ideas became well known through the publication of his seminal book ''[[Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas]]'' (Basic Books, 1980). Papert described children creating programs in the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] educational programming language. He likened their learning to living in a "mathland" where learning mathematical ideas is as natural as learning French while living in France.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Instructional principles==
Constructionist learning involves students drawing their own conclusions through creative experimentation and the making of social objects. The constructionist teacher takes on a mediational role rather than adopting an instructional role. Teaching "at" students is replaced by assisting them to understand—and help one another to understand—problems in a hands-on way.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The teacher's role is not to be a lecturer but a facilitator who coaches students to attaining their own goals.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Problem-based learning===
[[Problem-based learning]] is a constructionist method which allows students to learn about a subject by exposing them to multiple problems and asking them to construct their understanding of the subject through these problems. This kind of learning can be very effective in mathematics classes because students try to solve the problems in many different ways, stimulating their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Hmelo-Silver, C. E. &amp; Barrows, H. S. (2006). Goals and strategies of a problem-based learning facilitator. Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning, 1. 21-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five strategies make problem-based learning more effective:
# The learning activities should be related to a larger task. The larger task is important because it allows students to see that the activities can be applied to many aspects of life and, as a result, students are more likely to find the activities they are doing useful.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wilson, B. (Ed.) Constructivist learning environments: Case studies in instrumental design. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Educational Technology Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The learner needs to be supported to feel that they are beginning to have ownership of the overall problem.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# An authentic task should be designed for the learner. This means that the task and the learner's cognitive ability have to match the problems to make learning valuable.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Reflection on the content being learned should occur so that learners can think through the process of what they have learned.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Allow and encourage the learners to test ideas against different views in different contexts.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Constructionism in social sciences===
Not only can constructionism be applied to mathematics but to the social sciences as well. For example, instead of having students memorize geography facts, a teacher could give students blank maps that show unlabeled rivers, lakes, and mountains, and then ask the students to decipher where major cities might be located without the help of books or maps. This would require students to locate these areas without using prepared resources, but their prior knowledge and reasoning ability instead.&lt;ref&gt;Biehler, R., Snowman, J., D’Amico, M., Schmid, R. (1999). The nature of meaningful learning. Psychology applied to teaching, 387-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructionism and technology==
Papert has been a huge proponent of bringing technology to classrooms, beginning with his early uses of the [[Logo programming language|Logo]] language to teach mathematics to children. While constructionism has, due to its impetus, been primarily used in science and mathematics teaching (in the form of [[inquiry-based science]]), it is arguable that it developed in a different form in the field of [[media studies]] in which students often engage with media theory and practice simultaneously in a complementary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. More recently it has gained a foothold in [[applied linguistics]] in the field of second language acquisition (or [[second language acquisition|SLA]]). One such application has been the use of the popular game ''[[SimCity]]'' as a means of teaching English using constructionist techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Gromik, N. (2004). Sim City and English Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, [[LEGO|The LEGO Group]] funded research of Papert's research group at the MIT Media Laboratory, which at the time was known as the "Epistemology and Learning Group." When LEGO launched its [[Lego Mindstorms|LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System]] in 1998, which was based on the work of his group, it received permission to use the moniker "Mindstorms" from Seymour's 1980 book title. In The LEGO Group's [[Lego Serious Play|LEGO Serious Play]] project, business people learn to express corporate issues and identity through the medium of plastic bricks.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2005, Papert, together with [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Alan Kay]], launched the [[One Laptop Per Child]] initiative to put constructionist learning into practice in the developing world. The aim is to provide [[$100 laptop]]s to every child in the developing world.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Computer programming languages==
A number of [[programming language]]s have been created, wholly or in part, for [[education]]al use, to support the constructionist approach to learning. These languages are [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]], and are [[reflection (computer science)|reflective]]. They include:
* [[Logo programming language|Logo]] is a [[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]] language, which is an easier-to-read adaptation and dialect of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], without the [[S-expression|parentheses]]. Logo is known for its introduction of [[turtle graphics]] to elementary schoolchildren in the 1980s. Its creators were [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Cynthia Solomon]], and Papert.
* [[Smalltalk]] is an [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] language that was designed and created at [[Xerox PARC]] by a team led by [[Alan Kay]].
* [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] is being developed since the 1990s under the direction of [[Alan Kay]], most recently by the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], based on [[Morphic (software)|Morphic]] tile scripting. Etoys was initially targeted at primary school math and science education.
* [[Physical Etoys]] is an extension of Etoys that allows to control different devices such as Lego NXT, Arduino Board, Sphero, Kinect, Duinobot, Wiimote among others.
* [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] was developed in the early 21st century at [[MIT Media Lab]] Lifelong Kindergarten Group led by Papert's pupil [[Mitchel Resnick]]. Like Etoys, it is based on Morphic tile scripts. Scratch was initially designed specifically to enhance the development of technological fluency at after-school centers in economically disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0325828 NSF's grant A Networked, Media-Rich Programming Environment to Enhance Informal Learning and Technological Fluency at Community Technology Centers], [[National Science Foundation]], Sep 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[StarLogo TNG]] was developed by the [[MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program]] under [[Eric Klopfer]]. It combines a block programming interface with 3D graphics. It is targeted at programming games and game-like simulations in middle and secondary schools.
*[[NetLogo]] was developed by [[Uri Wilensky]]. It was developed to teach children computational reasoning and thinking, and extends the [[Logo programming language|Logo]] language by enabling the existence of many, many turtles at the same time. NetLogo is widely used not only in the K-12 environment, but also by researchers interested in the concept of [[Agent-based modeling]]
*[[Easy Java Simulations or Ejs or EJS]] was developed by [[Open Source Physics]] under [[Francisco Esquembre]]. The user is working at a higher conceptual level, declaring and organizing the equations and other mathematical expressions that operate the simulation. It is targeted at programming physics simulations in secondary schools and universities.
*[[LEGO WeDo]] is a graphical programming language for children of age 7 years and up, used with the LEGO WeDo power function hub.
*[[Lego Mindstorms EV3|LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3]] is a [[dataflow]] graphical programming language for children age 10+.

'''Container port design process''' is a set of correlated practices considered during [[container port]] design, aiming to transfer general business mission into detailed design documents for future construction and operation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org/edits/articleshop.php?id=2014135|title=PIANC - Technical Report article|last=bvba|first=Consonant|website=www.pianc.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process involves both conceptual design and detailed design.

== Funding ==

The source of funding determines the mission and scope of the project. Choices include federal funding (subsidies),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N.; Kent, J. (2001). ''Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy''. Washington, DC: Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, state or local funding, and private funding. 

American ports require subsidies from the federal government in order to keep up with advances in maritime transportation as well as the capabilities of the inland freight movement.  Often, roughly 50% of the costs every year come from federal sources.  The [[American Association of Port Authorities]] (AAPA) is an association which aims at ensuring and increasing federal funds to American ports.

A few federal bills which provide funding for ports are 
* Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act: $11 billion in funding to assist in surface transportation improvements
* National Highway Freight Program (NHFP): at least $10 billion in funding reorganized for more efficient use in transportation improvements&lt;ref name="POW Master Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Master Plan for the Diamond State Port Corporation|url=http://portofwilmington.com/images/DSPC%20Master%20Plan%20-%20FINAL%20-%2007%2029%2016.pdf|website=Port of Wilmington|accessdate=4 December 2016|ref=POW Master Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often, the State's Department of Transportation (DOT) is the largest state/local financier of public money investments.  The DOTs see the ports as key elements in the systems of movement that they are responsible for such as railways and highways.

Investment from private entities is critical to the creation and execution of port activities.  American ports are often run by private entities in the sense that day-to-day functions are financed and managed with the primary goal of creating revenue.  The municipalities of the terminals are kept up by the Port Authority but the equipment and infrastructure required for operations are under the private entities' power.

With the creation of new ports, often [[Public-Private Partnerships]], otherwise known as 3P, are formed to bring in the upfront capital necessary for someone to take on the financial risk of operating a terminal.  Container terminals are no different in this sense from other types of terminals.

==Cargo ==
[[File:Container sizes.jpeg|thumb|112x112px|Container types in consideration]]

Cargo determines the main function, transportation mode and related characters required for the container port. In container port design, the object cargo is [[intermodal container]]. Containers are usually classified as 20-foot and 40-foot. 53-foot containers were introduced and used both in the U.S.A. and Canada, mainly for domestic road and rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|title=APL Introduces 53 Foot Ocean Containers|date=2013-11-04|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104235508/http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|archivedate=2013-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{For|container transportation|Intermodal freight transport}}

== Vessels ==
[[File:Container Terminal Tollerort 02.jpg|alt=oversized vessel will not be available to unload cargo.|thumb|Container Vessel in Different size]]

The type of vessel, its dimension and capacity, determines the required capacity for a port's input capacity, which involves berth design, water-borne handling equipment selection and requirements for both storage and land-mode capacity.

The characteristics of vessels and the port characteristics:
* Main dimensions:
** length, which determines the widths and bends of channel, size required for the terminal and maximum number of berths;
** [[Breadth (nautical)|breadth]] and [[air draft]], which influences cargo-handing equipment selection,  and the width of channels;
** [[Hull (watercraft)|draft]], which determines the depth along berths.
* Cargo Capacity, which control over the cargo ship requirements (minimum) of storage, and can affect the loading and unloading processing, usually cranes/ship.
* Designed vessel Function. whether vessel has cargo handling equipment/ how it load cargo. Usually container vessel require external handling equipment.
* Vessel routine shall also get considered as the inter-modal capability requirement for import, export and trans-ship service will be different.

The selection of designed vessel shall also consider the development of the container ship. Underestimating the trend of size development of container ship will result in incapability and low sustainability.

== Location ==
[[File:Triple Bottom Line graphic.jpg|thumb|3BL principle for container port design]]

It should start with data collection and get finished by receiving government permits. The choice of location is considered with philosophy of [[Triple bottom line|triple-bottom line]] and with considerations of waterside access, natural conditions, inter-modal connections and stakeholders.

For ports&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Promotion of the advanced development of urban and regional economy;  
* The requirement of vessel's manoeuvring, [[Brake|braking]], harbor navigation, berthing operations; 
* Greenfield site for general port development, such as new quays, reclamation or [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. 
For container terminals&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* The availability of [[Deep Water Bay|deep water]]; 
* The environmental site conditions including [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions; 
* The availability of land; 
* Good inland transport link or intermodal connections; 
* The [[Soil conditioner|soil conditions]]

=== Waterside Access ===
Waterside access is the condition of waterways in the location, which determines the expected depth, berth quantities, vessel accessibility and effort required for development. Access channel is a waterway that linking the basins of a port to the open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomastelford.com|title=Thomas Telford Ltd.|website=www.thomastelford.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of location of access channels is that it determines the [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] factors such as wave, [[tidal cycle]], current, wind met by the ships in the channel. Also, it needs to keep the depth of [[Channel (geography)|channel]] and be able to accommodate the world's largest cargo vessels. For example, in order to meet the need, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] runs the Main Navigation Channel Deepening Program, dredged 38 miles of federal channels to as deep as 50 feet by 30 years. There are several aspects, based on PIANC (1997), a designer needs to consider:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org|title=PIANC Report N 135-2014|last=bvba|first=Consonant|date=|website=www.pianc.org|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vessel's dimension and velocity; 
# The cargo hazard level; 
# The traffic density; 
# The physical environmental conditions consisting of wind, waves, currents, tidal range, as well as the hardness of the bottom surface.

=== Natural conditions ===
Natural conditions are classified as whether the area selected is developed or natural. Natural condition determines whether there will be existing utilities and constraint for future terminal development.

=== Intermodal connections  ===
Intermodal connection is a place where [[Rail transport|rail]], [[truck]], [[barge]], and other transport methods converge. Intermodal connection for container terminal mainly consists of road and rail. The capacity of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal connection]]---docking and the handling, storage and transfer of cargo---determines the capability of terminal cargo transportation to/from the land.

== Stakeholders ==
Stakeholders as any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives.(R. Edward Freeman 1984.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-15174-0|location=UK|pages=292|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder analysis is a process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account when developing and or implementing a policy or program. The purpose of a stakeholder analysis is to assess the attitudes of the stakeholders regarding the realization of a new container terminal.

Stakeholder in location selection mainly consist of trade organizations, maritime groups, regional government, neighborhood societies, environment groups and other people with direct/indirect interest related to the terminal. Selection shall involve their participation so as to avoid strong conflicts in future development, and to keep terminal development adapt to the changing demand from these stakeholders.

Agencies and societies involves in this process are:
# [[Port authority|Port Authority]]
# [[Municipality]]
# [[Province]]
# [[Federal government of the United States|National Government]]
# Residents
# Potential Operators
# [[Environmentalist]]

== Permits ==
Permits are crucial in the designing process. Large scale development projects that have the potential for causing significant adverse environmental impacts need permits to start operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polb.com/economics/contractors/forms_permits/development.asp|title=Port of Long Beach - Harbor Development Permit Applications|website=www.polb.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects without permits will be identified as offence. Port needs port permits to open. Port Permits are granted automatically from the Guard at the entrance to the Castle/Palace/Doge Estate in the player's capital city once he reaches the required fame needed to obtain it. Environmental permits will be issued by Local Environmental Protection Agencies. Usually include three part: water side, land side and air emissions. Permits for ports should include: clean air permit, construction permit, discharge permit, dredge permits and water discharge permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/|title=US Environmental Protection Agency|last=EPA|first=US|website=www3.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed design==

The consideration of infrastructure includes plans for deployment and construction of infrastructures to implement the functions of terminal. The [[wharf]] at a terminal is the structure which forms the edge of the landside facility.  It is made up of both the topside and the face. The face of the wharf is where equipment is mounted to allow vessels to berth.  It is also designed to be within the high water levels, thus making its structures susceptible to corrosion.  Water-tightness and corrosion protection are a must for any structural elements that make up the face. The topside of the wharf is what is broken down into berths.  Pre-designated lengths of the wharf are separated into identified berths based on the design vessels characteristics.  [[Container crane]]s operate along the wharf when vessels have berthed.

[[Warehouse]]s are created at container terminals to hold specific goods that are transported to the port but are not being shipped out in the same container.  This style of transport is not common, however, this can be service supplied by the terminal owners to increase imports.  Those goods, when warehoused, incur additional handling and storage costs increasing revenue as well.

[[Maintenance management professional|Maintenance]] is the conception that uses engineering theories and practices, risk management and maintenance strategy to plan and implement routine maintenance of facilities and operation systems. The overall maintenance policy for port or terminal should be to maintain all of the facility assets to the extent that the level of expenditure is justified, in order that the assets remain serviceable during their design life or longer and for reasons of safety and security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A typical maintenance team involves experienced personnel under the control of a qualified engineering maintenance manager and supervisory staff and engineering inspection staff. It should meet requirements listed in ISM ([[International Safety Management Code]]).The maintenance facilities required will include a workshop with sufficient space to work on approximately 10% of the mobile equipment and spreaders at any one time. The maintenance facilities should be located outside but close to the container yard. It is necessary to provide a Stores section within the maintenance facility that will hold necessary spare components and materials. Following are the specific requirements for maintenance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Planned preventive maintenance and statutory inspections of equipment are normally carried out during the day shift when all specialist trades are available. Outside of the day shift minimal manning levels are normally retained to cover breakdowns and emergency repairs only. For other specialist areas such as IT and electronics it is usual to retain specialised personnel due to the specific needs of such systems and equipment. Mechanical and electrical engineering and IT personnel will be responsible for the daily maintenance of cargo handling equipment and other aspects of the facility that require these skills and for specific IT operating systems such as the TOS. High voltage electrical cables and switchgear should be maintained by specialist contractors whilst maintenance of low and medium cables and domestic electrics can be undertaken by electrical tradesmen.

A lay down area is the space where container handling equipment place full or empty containers prior to loading onto the containers' next step in its journey to its destination.  The lay down area is composed of multiple structural layers to support the loads brought on by the equipment and cargo. The first layer, the foundation, consists of either the existing or improved [[subgrade]] of the location.  To add extra strength to the foundation,  the existing soils are compacted further, Soil Improvements such as stone columns are installed, or the unsatisfactory soils are removed and a new fill soil is brought in, graded, and compacted to meet requirements.

The second layer is the asphalt paving.  This pavement differs from typical highway and road pavement as the loads are generally more stationary as well as much smaller in magnitude.  This type of pavement contains Hydraulically Bound Materials (HBM), an ingredient used to provide higher compressive strength to the asphalt.  The mixture is the first part of designing the asphalt with the second being the thickness.  Both the materials and the thickness can be calculated by following existing design guides published by engineering societies.  The [[World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure]]'s (PIANC) Report 165-2015 can provide further guidance on container terminal pavements.&lt;ref name="PIANC Pavements"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design and Maintenance of Container Terminal Pavements|journal=PIANC|date=2015|volume= Report 165|ref=135-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lay down area surface is also designed for multiple functions.  The pavement must drain towards a drainage system as well as have a sufficient grip to prevent skidding .  Finally, the pavement is painted to show lanes for travel as well as rows to place [[Intermodal container]] containers when not in transit.

Intermodal yards are mainly consisted of two parts, rail yards and container storage yards. Rail yards should have access to rails and container storage yards should have access to trucks. Container storage yards include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.

== Port security ==
[[Port security]] consists of cargo security, port facility security,staff security and maritime domain security. Port security should be worked jointly by the coast guards and custom and border protection together. Internationally, port security is governed by rules issued by the [[International Maritime Organization]] and its 2002 [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]].

During design process, ports need to come up with a port security plan and implement it. The port security plan should include: security survey and risk assessment, physical security and access control, information security, personnel security, maritime terrorism, drug smuggling, stowaways and alien smuggling, roles/ responsibilities/ legal authorities of port agencies, sea robbery, cargo security and hazardous materials and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/16000/16900/16918/PB2000106164.pdf|title=Port Security- A National Planning Guide|last=U.S. Department of Transportation|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs facility ==
Customs should have both base offices at the warehouse and around the gates. The office at the warehouse is mainly for detecting harmful agriculture and smuggling (drugs, dirty money). Office at gates are mainly for the reason of detecting mis-picked cargo or radiation containers. At gates there should be radiation-detection equipments aim at detecting dangerous weapons and radiation stuff that can be used to make dirty bombs. [[Radiation Portal Monitor]]s (RPMs) are passive radiation detection devices used for the screening of individuals, vehicles, cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Portal VACIS imaging system helps trained operators see the contents of closed containers, assisting them in intercepting weapons, contraband, and other items of interest and verifying shipping manifests. Patented drive-through technology lets trucks drive through the system without stopping, providing an effective solution for high-traffic situations where lengthy manual inspection processes are impractical or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leidos.com/products/security/portal-vacis|title=Portal VACIS|newspaper=Leidos|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mooring ==
[[Mooring (watercraft)]] infrastructure at a port describes those structures that mooring lines from vessels can tie off to in order to prevent drifting along or away from the wharf face.  The mooring structures are called [[cleat (nautical)]] or [[bollards]], depending on their size and shape.  Bollards are designed to handle much larger loads, and in turn, much larger vessels.  Manufacturers of these items typically design the items and supply the finished design to the consultant to include in the bid documents.

Cleats and bollards can be found on all different forms of structures.  The common one is the wharf face of a terminal.  Other locations can include dolphins, which are stand alone structures that are off the face of the landside infrastructure.  Another source can be other barges or sea vessels allowing vessels to tie off to each other.

Bollards and cleats can have multiple types of mooring lines tied off to them.  Bow and stern lines, found at the front and the back of the vessel,  are lines designed to prevent vessels from drifting perpendicular to the berth location.  Breast lines come from closer to the centerline of the vessel and span along the vessel to the mooring location, to keep the vessel from drifting parallel to the berth.  PIANC Report _______  can provide further details on the design of mooring structures.  Bollard and cleat manufacturers can provide more details on dimensions, weights, and capacities of mooring structures&lt;ref name="Maritime International Mooring Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maritime International Mooring Bollards Catalog|url=http://www.maritimeinternational.com/pdfs/Maritime_International_Bollard_Catalog.pdf|website=Maritime International|ref=Maritime International Mooring Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Berthing ==
Berthing of the vessels are analyzed using the design vessels characteristics of weight, draught, and other specification in addition to the requirements set by the terminal location such as wind speeds, direction, currents, and safe berthing velocities of the approach channel and berth.  All these factors come together to determine maximum amounts of energy that must be resisted by the terminal foundation and wharf.  Multiple styles of berthing equipment have been designed in response to this requirement.

Container terminals are for the most part directly on land, eliminating the need for berthing dolphins similar to those described in the Mooring section.  Fender systems installed on the wharf face are the main facility for reducing the amount of energy the wharf structure must absorb during berthing.  A fender system consists of the [[fender (boating)]] itself, the panel, and the various hardware required to anchor and stabilize the unit.

Fenders are made of a grade of rubber chosen for its flexibility.  The more compressible, the more energy the fender can resist.  They come in multiple sizes and shapes, aimed at handling different situations.  Fenders do not need to be mounted in the same location at all times.  Some fenders are designed to rise and fall with water levels.

Panels are large faces that connect to the fender giving more contact space for the vessel.  The size also helps reduce the reaction on the vessel's hull, which is designed for a certain maximum pressure.  They are often covered with a friction reducing surface to prevent lateral forces trying to shear the fender apart.  One final element of panel design is associated not just with its dimensions, but with its location relative to another fender.  The spacing of the fenders relative to the size of the panel must be set so that the design vessel cannot compress the fender in an angled situation and contact the wharf.  Either a second fender panel must be contacted or the fender cannot compress to much in an unsymmetrical fashion.

The structural elements of a fender system must be analyzed ensure equilibrium and stability of each unit at all times.  Chains are installed to keep the panel from putting unnecessary shear due to vessel action or weight of the panel.  Also, anchors are installed into the wharf to anchor the fender to the wharf face.  At these locations, the foundation of the terminal is strengthened more so than at areas of non contact due to the larger forces imparted on the structure.

== Communication ==
Communication is very important in ports because ports are areas with high risks, by good communication people can avoid risks. In the design process, people should consider adding more base stations to ensure good quality of radio contact and video contact. The customs officers should have both radio contact and video contact with truck drivers driving through the gate to make sure they have picked up the right container. Pilots in the port should have good radio communications to guide them sailing. Port labors should have good communication through radio with each other to avoid conflicts and risks.

== Equipment ==
[[File:Melbourne--swanston-dock-container-crane.jpg|thumb|150x150px|waterside container crane in container terminal]]
The consideration of equipment includes plans for procurement and construction of terminal facilities to implement the function of terminal. Equipment involved in detailed design include [[container crane]]s which can be identified by mode: Rail Mounted Quay Crane (RMQC) or Ship to Shore (STS) Crane;   and [[Intermodal container|inter-modal container]] [[Material-handling equipment|transport facilities]] used for storage areas such as [[Reach stacker|Reach Stackers]], Tractor-Trailer Units (TTUs) and Vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Parameters for cranes and inter-modal cargo transport facilities considered in detailed design are: quantities, size limit, power requirement, handling capacity, handling speed, cost, load to land limit, and other working environment constraints.

The deployment of equipment shall be designed with a key mission to create enough cargo transportation to balance the cargo flow. [[Queueing theory]] shall be introduced to the quantity and quality of equipment required.

== Security clearance ==
Because of the characteristics of working at a port, some staff need to have personal security clearance to obtain a job at ports. Like coast guards or customs, because of the ability to have access to classified information. There are three levels of security clearance, confidential, secret and top secret. A critical investigation in it is a background investigation of face-to-face interview with officers. Sometimes staff just need to get interim security clearance. There will also be a periodic reinvestigation every 5 years to obtain a new security clearance. The investigation will again cover key aspects of the individual's life, but will start from one's previous background investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/c10978.htm|title=All About Security Clearances|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labors ===

[[File:Dockworker lashing a container.jpg|thumb|193x193px|container terminal worker]]
In the ports, operating systems and personnel development are based on skills acquired through experience which is easily undertaken in advanced industrial environments.

Several agreements we should take them into account:
* ILO code of practice --- Safety and Health in ports; (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety and health in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2003|isbn=92-2-115287-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO code of practice --- Security in ports; (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2004|isbn=92-2-115286-3|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO Maritime Labour Convention (2006)

=== Safety and security ===

''Safety is the condition of a "steady state" of an organization or place . ''Security is the process or means, physical or human, of delaying, preventing, and otherwise protecting against external or internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and other individuals or actions. The main documents related to terminal operations are the [[International Labour Organization|ILO convention]] 152 (1979) and the ILO code of practice (2003) which cope with health and safety of port labor.

=== Logistics ===

[[File:Schematic container-transport chain.png|thumb|Schematic container-transport chain.png]]
Logistics is the general [[supply chain]] of how resources are acquired, stored and transported to their final destination. It involves identifying prospective distributors and [[suppliers]], and determining their effectiveness and accessibility.

=== Customs ===

Customs and Border Protection exists to safeguard country's borders thereby protecting the public from dangerous people and materials while enhancing the nation's global economic competitiveness by enabling legitimate trade and travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about|title=About CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs at ports of entry has two main tasks: cargo security and protecting agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry|title=At Ports of Entry {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every port should have their own nation's customs. They should have base offices both at the administration building and the warehouse (check agriculture) and outside offices at both the entry gates leaving gates. Groups of customs at port should be consisted of Marine Interdiction Agents, Border Patrol Agents, Agriculture Specialists, Custom and Border Protection Officers and Import Specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp|title=Join CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Klahr''' (born 1939) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] whose research ranges across the fields of [[cognitive development]], [[psychology of science]], and [[educational psychology]] and has been a professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] since 1969. He is the [[Walter van Dyke Bingham]] Professor of Cognitive Development and [[Education Sciences]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and a member of the [[National Academy of Education]], a Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]], a Charter Fellow of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], on the Governing Board of the [[Cognitive Development Society]], a Member of the [[Society for Research in Child Development]], and the [[Cognitive Science Society]]. He was an Associate Editor of [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] and has served on the editorial boards of several cognitive science journals, as well as on the [[National Science Foundation]]'s subcommittee on Memory and Cognitive Processes, and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Human Development and Aging Study Section.

He has served on three Committees of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]: the Committee on Foundations of Educational Assessment (Knowing What Students Know, National Academies Press, 2001), the Committee on Research in Education (Advancing Scientific Research in Education, National Academies Press, 2004) and the Committee on Science Learning (Taking Science to School: Learning and Teaching Science in Grades K–8, National Academies Press, 2007). He also serves as member of the Advisory Board for the Brain, Mind &amp; Behavior Program of the [[James S. McDonnell Foundation]].

==Life==

He received his undergraduate degree from MIT in Electrical Engineering (1960), and his Ph.D. in 1968 from [http://www.tepper.cmu.edu/index.aspx Carnegie Mellon's Graduate School of Industrial Administration ("GSIA", now the Tepper School of Business)] in Organizations and Social Behavior. From 1966 to 1969, he was an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Chicago]] with joint appointments in the School of Business and the Department of Mathematics. In 1968–69 was a Visiting Research Fellow at the [[University of Stirling]], [[Scotland]], and a Visiting Fulbright lecturer at the London School of Business. He returned to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] with joint appointment in [[GSIA]] and Psychology in 1969, and became Professor of Psychology in 1976. He served as Head of the Psychology Department from 1983 to 1993, and is currently Director of the Program in Interdisciplinary Education Research (PIER), a doctoral training grant funded by the Office of Education.

==Scientific contributions==

Throughout his career, Klahr has focused on the analysis of complex cognitive processes in such diverse areas as voting behavior, college admissions, consumer choice, peer review, problem solving and scientific reasoning. He pioneered the application of information processing analysis to questions of cognitive development, and, in collaboration with Iain Wallace, formulated the first computer simulation models to account for children's performance on a variety of [[Jean Piaget|Piagetian tasks]] and other types of problems.

Dr. Klahr's most recent research has investigated the cognitive processes that support children's understanding of the fundamental principles underlying [[scientific thinking]]. This work includes both basic research with pre-school children and more applied classroom studies of how to improve the teaching of experimental science in elementary school. He has worked in a wide variety of schools in the [[Pittsburgh]] region, focusing on the relative effectiveness of different instructional methods for teaching children how to design and interpret simple experiments

'''Edward Carey''' (born April 1970, in North Walsham, Norfolk, England)&lt;ref&gt;Author's Website [https://edwardcareyauthor.com/about/]&lt;/ref&gt; is a playwright, and novelist. He has written several adaptations for the stage, including [[Patrick Süskind]]’s ''The Pigeon'', and [[Robert Coover]]’s ''Pinocchio in Venice''. His own plays include ''Sulking Thomas'' and ''Captain of the Birds''. He collaborated with Eddin Khoo, on the ''[[wayang kulit]]'' translation of ''Macbeth'' called ''Macbeth in the Shadows''.&lt;ref&gt;Bakar, Sharon (19 June 2005) [http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/6/19/features/11239908&amp;sec=features ''Writer who draws out books''], ''The Star'' (Malaysia){{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[University of Iowa]] [[International Writing Program]] and taught at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. He is married to the writer [[Elizabeth McCracken]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radcliffe.edu/research/fellows_2009emccracken.aspx ''2008–2009 Radcliffe Institute Fellows'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though Edward Carey seems to intend his first novel, Observatory Mansions, to be an unsentimental, surrealist romance, it's really a paean to loneliness. For the book is never so interesting as when its characters are despairing and alone. All goes well then for the first hundred pages, where Carey lays out the solitude housed in Observatory Mansions, a greying apartment building where Francis Orme, the book's narrator, cultivates a secret life of stillness and theft."&lt;ref&gt;Valdes, Marcela (18 April 2001). [http://www.citypages.com/2001-04-18/books/edward-carey-observatory-mansions/ ''Edward Carey: Observatory Mansions''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606031539/http://www.citypages.com/2001-04-18/books/edward-carey-observatory-mansions/ |date=6 June 2011 }}, ''Minneapolis City Pages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"From Richardson to Dickens to Ackroyd, English literary fiction seems to favour the elephantine. Miniaturists – Austen, Pym perhaps, Brookner – are rarer, less typical. Edward Carey is most decidedly a miniaturist. "Miniature things move people," he remarks, two dozen pages into his second novel; and again, a similar distance from the end."&lt;ref&gt;Greenland, Colin (17 May 2003). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 "Small world"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An imaginary city: this is a time for such a vision, especially for New Yorkers, whose city has always been in flux, though perhaps never more painfully and self-consciously than today. Entralla, the fictitious metropolis at the heart of Edward Carey's second novel, exists not only in our imagination and in the pages of ''Alva &amp; Irva'' (which serves as Entralla's one and only guidebook) but in the form of tiny plasticine models of its streets and houses, seen in the appealingly smudgy photographs that punctuate the novel. A re-creation of Entralla also appears in the story of ''Alva &amp; Irva,'' since the twins of the book's title are the designer and sculptor, respectively, of their native city in miniature."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Carey (23 March 2003). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E7DA113EF930A15750C0A9659C8B63 ''One Word: Plasticine''], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[business]], '''entrepreneurial networks''' are [[social organization]]s offering different types of [[resource (project management)|resources]] to start or improve [[entrepreneurial]] projects.  Having adequate [[human resources]] is a key factor for entrepreneurial achievements. Combined with [[leadership]], the entrepreneurial network is a social network not only necessary to properly run the business or project, but also to differentiate the business from similar projects. 

==Purpose==
The goal of most entrepreneurial networks is to bring together a broad selection of professionals and resources that complement each other's endeavors.  Initially, a priority is to aid successful [[business launch]]es.  Subsequently, to provide motivation, direction and increase access to [[business opportunity|opportunities]] and other skill sets.  Promotion of each member's talents and services both within the network and out in the broader market increases opportunities for all participants.

One of the key needs of any startup is [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and often entrepreneurial networks focus on providing such financial resources, particularly tailored to their membership [[demographic]].

Entrepreneurial networks may also become community involved, [[advocacy|endorsing]] reforms, [[legislation]] or other municipal drives that accommodate their organization's goals.

'''Extreme Blue''' is [[IBM]]'s premier [[intern]]ship program for both [[graduate student|graduate]] and [[undergraduate|undergraduate students]]; it also serves as a placement opportunity for future IBM employment due to the significant effort put into placement of the interns.

==History==
Extreme Blue was created in 1999 by Jane Harper.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} It began at the [[Lotus Software]] site in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 2003, Extreme Blue participants filed 98 [[U.S. patent|patents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Watson |title=Students swap beach for the lab bench in IBM internship scheme |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/computing/analysis/2075993/students-swap-beach-lab-bench-ibm-internship-scheme |publisher=Computing |date=23 Sep 2004 |accessdate=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 10,000 applications were received for 92 positions in the U.S.; over 10,000 students applied for 220 positions worldwide.  At the 2008 [[NCWE|National Council for Work Experience]] (NCWE) award ceremony, the UK Extreme Blue program received the "Over 250 Employees – Short term placement" award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mattwhitbourne.blogspot.com/2008/03/ncwe-awards-extreme-blue-wins-over-250.html NCWE Awards: Extreme Blue wins 'Over 250 Employees – Short term placement Award']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, according to an Extreme Blue manager, over 10,000 applications were received for fewer than 50 US positions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Since its inception, the program has expanded to include 15 active international locations.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Projects==
Extreme Blue uses IBM engineers, interns, and business managers to develop technology and business plans for new products and services. Each summer an Extreme Blue team also works on a project. These projects mostly involve [[rapid prototyping]] of high-profile software and hardware projects. Publicly released projects include the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4919">[[File:Blochmann.jpg|thumb|[[Elisabeth Blochmann]] (1892-1972), human science pedagogue, student of Herman Nohl and life-long correspondent with [[Martin Heidegger]].]]
Human Science Pedagogy is the branch of the [[Human science|Human Sciences]] concerned with education, upbringing, teaching and individual growth or formation (''[[Bildung]]''). It is oriented to teaching and learning practice, to the relational experience of the teacher and student, to questions of ethics, history and to what it is to be human. It was the dominant approach to educational scholarship [[teacher education]], and the [[philosophy of education]], and in [[Germany]] from the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Era]] to the late 1960s. Human Science Pedagogy is based on the educational work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], which was integrated by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] into his conception of a multidisciplinary human science. It was subsequently consolidated by Herman Nohl and developed further by [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]], Theodore Litt, Jakob Muth and others. Human science pedagogy has endured in the work of [[Klaus Mollenhauer]], [[Max van Manen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/|title=Max van Manen|website=www.maxvanmanen.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other recent and contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friesen|first=Norm|date=2017|title=The pedagogical relation past and present: experience, subjectivity and failure|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220272.2017.1320427?journalCode=tcus20|journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|volume=|pages=1-17|via=Taylor and Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common Themes ==
There are a number of common themes in this approach:
# It begins by affirming the primacy and the dignity of pedagogical practice. "Originally, parents undertook education, and as is commonly acknowledged, they did so without reference to a 'theory,'" as Schleiermacher points out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homepage.univie.ac.at/henning.schluss/seminare/043-Theorie-und-Praxis/Texte/01schleiermacher.pdf|title=Theorie der Erziehung: Vorlesungen aus dem Jahr 1826|last=Schleiermacher|first=Friedrich|date=1826|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practice exists independently from theory, and theory unavoidably comes later. Theory has much to learn from practice as it occurs today and has taken place in the past.
# It is develops from Schleiermacher's key question for education: "What does the older generation actually want of [or with] the younger?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing|last=Klaus|first=Mollenhauer|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-315-88300-7|location=London|pages=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that education and upbringing is an ethical and collective (or "political") questions, that ask after what we currently do and what we ''should'' do. It also means that education is part of our common everyday life, and that it is in this sense cultural. 
# Education is therefore a question of the lived, experienced relation of the teacher or adult and student or child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Researching Lived Experience: Human Science for an Action Sensitive Pedagogy|last=van Manen|first=Max|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-1629584164|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Hope and trust, shared by both educator and child, are fundamental to this relation. Hope and trust shared in a broader community (e.g. in a classroom or school) is known as the [[pedagogical atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Existentialism and Education: An Introduction to O.F. Bollnow|last=Koerrenz|first=Ralf|publisher=Palgrave|year=2016|isbn=978-3319486369|location=New York|pages=51-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bollnow|first=Otto Friedrich|date=1986|title=The Pedagogical Atmosphere|url=https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/pandp/index.php/pandp/article/view/15111/11932|journal=Phenomenology + Practice|volume=7|pages=1-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The teacher works towards this atmosphere and establishment of pedagogical relations through the exercise of pedagogical tact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friesen|first=Norm|date=Spring 2017|title=The pedagogical relation past and present: experience, subjectivity and failure|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220272.2017.1320427?journalCode=tcus20|journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|volume=|pages=1-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# This hope and trust are subject to unexpected disruptions: In the life of the child, in the work of the teacher (through errors or failure), or in the world shared by student and teacher (e.g. school life). These cannot be prepared for directly, but their impact on students and children can be lessened through the cultivation of the pedagogical relation, the pedagogical atmosphere and the educator's pedagogical tact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16262">'''Instructional leadership''' is generally defined as the management of curriculum and instruction by a [[Head teacher|school principal]]. This term appeared as a result of research associated with the [[Effective schools|effective school movement]] of the 1980s, which revealed that the key to running successful schools lies in the principals' role. However, the concept of instructional leadership is recently stretched out to include more distributed models which emphasize distributed and shared empowerment among school staff, for example [[Distributed Leadership|distributed leadership]], [[shared leadership]], and [[transformational leadership]].

==History==
The concept of instructional leadership emerged and developed in the United States within the [[Effective schools|effective school movement]] of the 1980s. The research resulting from this movement revealed that a principal is critical to success in children’s learning within poor urban elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, R. (1979). Effective schools for the urban poor. Educational Leadership, 37, 15-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leithwood, K., &amp; Montgomery, D. (1982). The role of the elementary principal in program improvement. Review of Educational Research, 52(3), 309-339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallinger2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallinger2009"&gt;Hallinger, P. (2009). Leadership for 21st century schools: From instructional leadership to leadership for learning.&lt;/ref&gt; This research revealed that the personality characteristics of the ideal principal are strong mindedness, directness, top-down management and charisma.

During the 1990s, a strong instructional leadership model was still at the center of the educational leadership discussion, because of its effectiveness in the schools. However, since then this concept has been criticized for focusing too much on the individual principal’s heroic role. As a result, the scholars started to explore leadership models to supplement these critics and point out the distributed nature of instructional leadership, such as [[transformational leadership]], [[Teacher Leadership|teacher leadership]], [[shared leadership]], and [[Distributed Leadership|distributed leadership]], all of which understand [[educational leadership]] as broader perspectives practice that includes school communities.&lt;ref name="Spillane"&gt;Spillane, Halverson, and Diamond (2004) Towards a theory of leadership practice: a distributed perspective. Journal of Curriculum Studies, 36(1), 3-34&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the accountability movement of the 21st century sheds new light on instructional leadership, since this paradigm puts more emphasis on the learning outcomes for students.&lt;ref name="Hallinger2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halverson, Grigg, Prichett, and Thomas(2006) The new instructional leadership: Creating data-driven instructional systems in schools. Journal of School leadership, January 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Researchers have further defined instructional leadership to include different approaches. First, the concept of instructional leadership could be divided into an "exclusive" and an ‘inclusive’ approach.&lt;ref name="RLR2008"&gt;Robinson, V. M., Lloyd, C. A., &amp; Rowe, K. J. (2008). The impact of leadership on student outcomes: An analysis of the differential effects of leadership types. Educational Administration Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who count instructional leadership as "exclusive" regard the principal as the sole holder of responsibility when it comes to setting goals for the school, supervision, and in developing instruction that enhances academic achievement. This perspective tends to focus only on the role of principals as instructional leaders (e.g. Hallinger &amp; Murphy, 1985&lt;ref name="HM1985"&gt;Hallinger, P., &amp; Murpht, J. (1985). Assessing the instructional leadership behavior of principals. Elementary School Journal, 86(2), 217-248.&lt;/ref&gt;).

However, other researchers have recently expanded the concept of instructional leadership to include not only principals, but also other school staff. They take an "inclusive" approach to instructional leadership. Especially, Marks and Printy (2003)&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;Marks, H. M., &amp; Printy, S. M. (2003). Principal leadership and school performance: An integration of transformational and instructional leadership. Educational Administration Quarterly, 39(3), 370–397&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out the importance of the collaboration between principals and teachers to develop curriculum and instruction for improving pupils' performance. Thus, they conceptualized this inclusive approach as “shared instructional leadership” and understood the role of principals as that of “leaders of instructional leaders”. Hallinger (2003)&lt;ref name="Hallinger2003"&gt;Hallinger, P. (2003). Leading educational change: Reflections on the practice of instructional and transformational leadership. Cambridge Journal of Education, 33(3), 329–352.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued the [[transformational leadership]] approach, in which leadership is shared with school staff; this approach is said to empower staff. [[Transformational leadership]] is a good supplement to the instructional leadership approach that focuses solely on principals and top-down strategies. For this reason, Hallinger has proposed the integration of instructional and transformational leadership approaches.

Second, researchers have classified modes of instructional leadership according to "direct" and "indirect" activities.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;Southworth, G. (2002). Instructional leadership in schools: Reflections and empirical evidence. School Leadership &amp; Management, 22(1), 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, K.D.(1989). Secondary principals and instructional leadership: Complexities in a diverse role. Madison: Wisconsin Center for Education Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleine"&gt;Kliene-Kracht, P. (1993). Indirect instructional leadership: an administrator’s choice, Educational Administration Quarterly, 18(4), 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepperd"&gt;Sheppard, B. (1996).Exploring the transformational nature of instructional leadership, The Alberta journal of Educational Research, 42(4), 325-344&lt;/ref&gt; The former is considered a "narrow" mode and the latter a"broad" mode of instructional leadership. This distinction is due to the fact that a direct perspective focuses only on immediate actions related to instruction, such as classroom observation and curriculum development, whereas an indirect perspective broadly focuses on indirect activities, such as creating the school climate, as well as direct activities.

==Characteristics==
Several researchers have outlined the characteristics and components of instructional leadership. Hallinger and Murphy's (1985)&lt;ref name="HM1985"/&gt; conceptual model has been most widely used in empirical studies of instructional leadership.&lt;ref name="Hallinger2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallinger2009"/&gt; The authors proposed the key role of instructional leaders in three dimensions: 1) ''Defining the school mission'', 2) ''Managing the instructional program'', and 3) ''Promoting a positive school-learning climate''. In these three dimensions, principals have different functions. First, their analyses of a leader's role in ''defining the school mission'' focuses on two functions: framing clear school goals and communicating clear school goals. Second, in the area of ''managing the instructional program'', principals have three functions: supervising and evaluating instruction, coordinating curriculum, and monitoring student progress. Third, in regards to''promoting a positive school-learning climate'' principals have five functions: protecting instructional time, promoting professional development, maintaining high visibility, providing incentives for teachers, and providing incentives for learning.

Murphy (1988)&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, J. (1988). Methodological, measurement, and conceptual problems in the study of instructional leadership. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 10(2), 117–139.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed four major dimensions of instructional leadership: 1) ''Developing mission and goals'', 2) ''Managing the education production function'', 3) ''Promoting an academic learning climate'', and 4) ''Developing a supportive work environment''.

Duke(1982)&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;Duke, D. (1982). Leadership functions and instructional effectiveness. NASSP Bulletin, 66(456), 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested six functions of instructional leadership related to teacher and school effectiveness: 1) ''Staff development'': recruitment, in-service education, and staff motivation, 2) ''Instructional support'': organized activities to maintain an environmentgeared towards improving teaching and learning, 3) ''Resource acquisition and allocation'': adequate learning materials, appropriate facilities, and skilled support personnel 4) ''Quality control'': evaluation, supervision, rewards, and sanctions, 5) ''Coordination'': activities that prevent cross-purposes or duplicate operations, and 6) ''Troubleshooting'': anticipation and resolution of problems in school operation. The first four functions of instructional leadership are directly related to instruction behaviors, whereas the remaining functions are indirectly relevant to instructional activities.

Andrew, Bascom, and Bascom (1991)&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;Andrews, R. L., Basom, M. R., &amp; Basom, M. (1991). Instructional leadership: Supervision that makes a difference. Theory into Practice, 30(2), 97–101.&lt;/ref&gt; defined four strategies that instructional leaders use to enhance student achievement: 1) ''Resource provider'': provision of resources to attain learning goals, 2) ''Instructional resource'': provision of strategies and skills to achieve better teaching practice, opportunities for professional development, and assessment for school performance related to instruction, 3) ''Communicator'': promoting discussion among school members about school vision, goals, and culture for successful learning, and 4) ''Visible presence'': showing up through face-to-face interaction as well as through informal exchanges in day-to-day activities.

Through extensive literature review, Spillane, Halverson, and Diamond (2004)&lt;ref name="Spillane"/&gt; identified that instructional leaders have several macro-school-level functions. "1) constructing and selling an instructional vision, 2) developing and managing a school culture conducive to conversations about the core technology of instruction by building norms of trust, collaboration, and academic press among staff, 3) procuring and distributing resources, including materials, time, support, and compensation, 4) supporting teacher growth and development, both individually and collectively, 5) providing both summative and formative monitoring of instruction and innovation, and 6) establishing a school climate in which disciplinary issues do not dominate instructional issues."

==Empirical study==
A study by Hallinger and Heck (1996, 1998)&lt;ref name="HH1996"&gt;Hallinger, P., &amp; Heck, R. H. (1996). Reassessing the principal’s role in school effectiveness: A review of empirical research, 1980-1995. Educational Administration Quarterly, 32(1), 5–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH1998"&gt;Hallinger, P., &amp; Heck, R. H. (1998). Exploring the Principal’s Contribution to School Effectiveness: 1980-1995∗. School Effectiveness and School Improvement, 9(2), 157–191.&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed extensive empirical research conducted between 1980 and 1995 about the effects of principals on student achievement and identified three models to describe these (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;16; 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;162).

-''A direct-effects model'', where principals directly affect student outcomes without mediating variables.

-''A mediated-effects model'', where principals indirectly affect student outcomes through mediating variables (e.g. features of school organization, teachers, and staff)

-''reciprocal-effects model'', where principals and features of the school have an interactive relationship

'''A indirect-effect model'''

With regard to the direct effect of principals on student outcomes, the result showed that the effects were "nonexistent, weak, conflicting or suspect in terms of validity"  (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;37). It indicates that principals do not directly affect student achievement or, if they do, the effects are quite small. Also, critics point out that this approach does not reveal through what hidden process school leaders impact on student performance.

'''A mediated-effects model'''

In comparison to this findings above, the mediated-effect model was based on more "sophisticated theoretical, strong research design, and powerful statistical methods"  (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;37). It found that principals significantly impact students' performance through other mediating variables, such as other school staff, events or organizational factors.

'''Reciprocal-effects model'''

In defining the reciprocal-effect model, the authors pointed out that there were no studies to demonstrate this effect yet. However, it is important to note this model because principals not only carry out their leadership role in ways that influence academic achievement, but school outcomes inversely affect principals’ activities as well. Thus, principals and school performance have a reciprocal relationship.

'''Other studies'''

Besides Hallingers and Heck’s broad review, several studies conducted in the 1990s and 2000s have also explored the effect of instructional leadership on teacher and student outcome. With respect to the effect of principals on teachers, Shepperd(1996)&lt;ref name="Shepperd"/&gt;  study in Canadian schools revealed that principals’ instructional leadership activities are positively related to the level of teacher commitment to the school, professional involvement, and innovativeness in the school.

==Stages in developing instructional leaders==
Marsh (1992)&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;Marsh, D. D. (1992). Enhancing Instructional Leadership: Lessons from the California School Leadership Academy. Education and Urban Society, 24(3), 386–409.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that instructional leaders develop in three stages; 1) ''Getting started'', 2) ''Doing the pieces of instructional leadership'', and 3) ''Understanding the whole of instructional leadership''. In the first stage, principals get to socialize themselves into the role of site administrator and develop routine management skills. However, they do not have real focus on instructional leadership yet. In the second stage, principals could improve their capacity for management. At this stage, principals reflect management and instructional leaderships as an isolated notion, and they still have a fragmented understanding about instructional leadership. In the third stage, principals fully understand the relation between management and instructional leadership. At this stage, they can integrate management and instructional leadership, activities and functions. Finally, they comprehend and reflect instructional leadership as an integrated view.

==Limitation==
With the extensive review of empirical studies, Hallinger (2003)&lt;ref name="Hallinger2003"/&gt; pointed out limitations of the concept of instructional leadership and the attentive point of empirical studies. First, the narrowed role of principals, which is confined to developing instructional activities for student performance, does not allow us to fully understand the nature of principals since a principal has various roles when managing a school.

Second, strategies of instructional leadership are influenced by the context of schools, such as school size, language background, community, and a school’s [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]].&lt;ref&gt;Heck, R. H. (1992). Principals’ instructional leadership and school performance: Implications for policy development. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 14(1), 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the effective activities of instructional leaders, which affect student achievement and school performance, should be considered in the context of school and community environment. In this sense, the effort to measure the effects of instructional leadership without consideration of the school context might be avoided in empirical research.

IPEDS consists of twelve interrelated survey components that are collected over three collection periods (Fall, Winter, and Spring) each year as described in the [http://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ViewContent.aspx?contentId=15 Data Collection and Dissemination Cycle].  The completion of all IPEDS surveys is mandatory for all institutions that participate in, or are applicants for participation in, any federal financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], as amended.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/aboutIPEDS/|title=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ViewContent.aspx?contentId=18  Statutory Requirements For Reporting IPEDS Data]

The IPEDS program department of NCES was created in 1992 and began collecting data in 1993.

==IPEDS Use the Data Page==
The [http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/home/Usethedata/ Use the Data Page], formerly called the IPEDS Data Center, allows users to retrieve IPEDS data, including the ability to view trends on most frequently asked subject areas, retrieve data on a single institution, download or customize an institution's Data Feedback Report, compare institutions on a single variable, calculate descriptive statistics of an institution with or without a comparison institution, generate standard reports for an institution, download data files, and access other resources for data users. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/home/UseTheData/|title=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPEDS Glossary==
The [https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx IPEDS Glossary] provides definitions for postsecondary-related terms used in the collection and dissemination of IPEDS data.

==Data collected in IPEDS&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;==
IPEDS collects data on postsecondary education in the United States in the following areas: institutional characteristics, institutional prices, admissions, enrollment, student financial aid, degrees and certificates conferred, student persistence and success (retention rates, graduation rates, and outcome measures), institutional human resources, fiscal resources, and academic libraries.

===Institutional characteristics===
Institutional characteristics data are the foundation of the entire IPEDS system. These include basic institutional contact information, tuition and fees, room and board charges, control or affiliation, type of calendar system, levels of awards offered, types of programs, and admissions requirements.

===Institutional prices===
IPEDS collects institutional pricing data from institutions for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. This includes tuition and fee data as well as information on the estimated student budgets for students based on living situations (on-campus or off-campus).

===Admissions===

Basic information is collected from institutions that do not have an open-admissions policy on the undergraduate selection process for first-time, degree/certificate-seeking students. This includes information about admissions considerations, admissions yields, and SAT and ACT test scores.

===Enrollment===

Because enrollment patterns differ greatly among the various types of postsecondary institutions, there is a need for both different measures of enrollment and several indicators of access. In IPEDS, the following enrollment-related data are collected:
*Fall enrollment — Fall enrollment is the traditional measure of student access to higher education. Fall enrollment data can be looked at by race/ethnicity; gender; enrollment status (part-time or full-time); and or level of study (undergraduate or graduate).
*Residence of first-time students — Data on the number of first-time freshmen by state of residence, along with data on the number who graduated from high school the previous year, serve to monitor the flow of students across state lines and calculate college-going rates by state. These data are collected in even-numbered years.
*Age data — The age distribution of enrolled students offers insight into the relationship between the changing demographics of college-going cohorts and enrollment in different types of postsecondary institutions. They also permit detailed projections of enrollment by institutional type and by age. Because a student’s dependency status is strongly related to age, the data can be used to provide estimates of the number of independent and dependent students attending postsecondary institutions. These data are collected in odd-numbered years.
*Unduplicated 12-month head count — Enrollment figures based on the unduplicated head count of students enrolled over a 12-month period is particularly valuable for institutions that use non-traditional calendar systems and offer short-term programs. Because this enrollment measure encompasses an entire year, it provides a more complete picture of the number of students these schools serve.
*Instructional activity — Data on instructional activity is measured in total credit and/or contact hours delivered by institutions during a 12-month period.
*Total entering class — Data on the number of incoming students (students enrolling for the first time in a postsecondary institution versus students transferring in from another postsecondary institution) at an institution. This measure permits the calculation of the graduation rate cohort as a proportion of the total entering student body.

===Student financial aid===

IPEDS collects data on the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive different types of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at each institution. IPEDS also collects data to show the average dollar amount of aid received by these students. Finally, as a result of the Higher Education Act (1965), as amended, IPEDS collects data to calculate the average net price at each institution for the following two groups: (1) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive grant and scholarship aid; and (2) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive Title IV federal student aid.

===Degrees and certificates conferred (completions)===

IPEDS collects data on the number of students who complete a postsecondary education program by type of program and level of award (certificate or degree). Type of program is categorized according to the [[Classification of Instructional Programs]] (CIP), a detailed coding system for postsecondary instructional programs. These data provide information on the number and location of completers by field. Business and industry, the military, and other groups that need to recruit individuals with particular skills use these data extensively. The data also help satisfy the mandate in the [[Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act]] for information on completions in postsecondary career and technical education programs.

===Student persistence and success===

IPEDS collects two types of data to help track postsecondary student progress and success.
*First–Year Retention Rates — The first-year retention rate measures the percentage of first-year students who had persisted in or completed their educational program a year later. These data have been collected since 2003.
*Graduation Rates — Graduation rate data provide information on institutional productivity and help institutions comply with reporting requirements of the Student Right-to-Know Act.
*Outcome Measures - Starting with the 2015-16 collection, IPEDS collects information on the number of awards conferred and the enrollment status of four degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate student cohorts: 1) Full-time, first-time, 2) Part-time, first-time, 3) Full-time, non-first-time, and 4) Part-time, non-first-time. The reported data are for two points in time: 6-years and 8-years after a cohort enters an institution.

===Institutional resources===

IPEDS collects institutional data on human resources and finances.
*Human resources — Human resources data measure the number and type of staff supporting postsecondary education. Because staffing patterns vary greatly across postsecondary institutions, IPEDS measures human resources in three ways:
**Employees by assigned position — These data classify all employees by full- or part-time status, faculty status, and occupational activity.
**Salaries — These data include the number of full-time instructional faculty by rank, gender, and length of contract/teaching period; total salary outlay; and fringe benefits.
**Staff — These data include demographic and occupational characteristics for staff at institutions.
*Finances — Finance data includes institutional revenues by source, expenditures by category, and assets and liabilities. This information provides context for understanding the cost of providing postsecondary education. It is used to calculate the contribution of postsecondary education to the gross national product. IPEDS collects finance data conforming to the accounting standards that govern public and private institutions. Generally, private institutions use standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and public institutions use standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
*Academic Libraries - Information on collections, expenditures, and services for libraries at degree-granting institutions. Data collected through the IPEDS system replaces the previous U.S. Census and NCES Academic Libraries Survey, which collected data from institutions every other even-number year and was not a mandatory collection.

==College Navigator==
College Navigator is a "''free consumer information tool designed to help students, parents, high school counselors, and others get information about over 7,500 postsecondary institutions in the United States - such as programs offered, retention and graduation rates, prices, aid available, degrees awarded, campus safety, and accreditation.''" Most of the data comes from IPEDS, although other data sources within the Department of Education are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?cx=1|title=College Navigator - National Center for Education Statistics|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website went live in September 2007 as a replacement for College Opportunities On-line (COOL) and was named in a December issue of [[Money (magazine)|Money magazine]] that year as "the best first screen" for researching colleges.

==IPEDS Peer Analysis System==
The IPEDS Peer Analysis System (PAS), replaced by the IPEDS Data Center and then the Use the Data portal, is no longer online. However, it was once a tool that allowed a user to build a comparison list of colleges and/or universities and compare them to a linchpin school.  This data is downloadable into various formats.  Information that can be retrieved in this manner include:
(1) Institutional characteristics and student charges, (2) Enrollments, (3) Completions, (4) Graduation rates, (5) Student financial Aid, (6) Finance, (7) Faculty salaries, (8) Fall staff, (9)Employees by assigned position.

A similar tool to the PAS was the Dataset Cutting Tool (DCT), which was available around the same time as the PAS. However, DCT is outdated and is no longer available.

==Controversy surrounding "Unit Record" data reporting==

In March 2005 The [[US Department of Education]] released a study on the Feasibility of a Student Unit Record System Within the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.  This Unit Record proposal met with immediate and vocal opposition from congressional leaders as well as colleges and universities.  The [[US Department of Education]] argued that the development of a national student unit record tracking system, with appropriate privacy safeguards, which collects, analyzes and uses [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] student progression data was a vital tool for accountability and policy-making.  This sparked an immediate reaction regarding the implications of what this means for Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unit Record reporting, as originally conceived, would require institutions that report to IPEDS to upload not summary data but rather to upload files that contain individual student records.  These files would contain a wide range of information on the student but would, most importantly, include the student's [[Social Security Number]].  Concerns were raised that attending even one course would mean you are added to a federal database for the rest of your life.  In a report issued in March 2006 by the [[US Department of Education]], [[Social Security Number]] was specifically excluded from the Unit Record upload data.  It has been suggested that SSN will still be collected but it will be done so by a third-party before it is uploaded to the IPEDS Unit Record Database.

===Huge IPEDS===
In January 2007 it had become clear that Unit Record reporting was on the upswing.  Some of the most vocal opposition was still coming from colleges/universities.  It was at this time that the notion of "Huge IPEDS" was floated by Mark S. Schneider, the Education Department’s commissioner for education statistics.  In a January 24, 2007, Federal Register notice, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced it is seeking comments on a set of proposed changes to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for 2007-08 through 2009-10.  The first installment of Huge IPEDS (optional in 07-08, mandatory in 08-09) would include:
*Collect website addresses for admissions and financial aid offices, instead of phone numbers.
*Add item to collect an estimate of the number of full-time and part-time students enrolled exclusively in online or distance education, by level.
*Add the following question: Does your institution have an online application? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Add the following question: Does your institution have its transfer of credit policy posted online? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Does your institution use the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE), Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA), National Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress (MAPP), or Other assessment tools (please specify)? Yes/No for each. If yes, and if your institution makes the results available on your website, provide URL/s. These links will be added to COOL.
*Does your institution have a Fact Book online? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Does your institution post information on its website regarding assessment and/or student outcomes? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Item in matrix format to collect information on accountability measures used by the institution, and scores. The matrix will have 3 columns: a column in which to write in the name of the accountability measures used by the institution, a column for the institution's score on that item, and a column for the data year for the score. Note: Once an institution adds a measure, the name of that measure will be added to a list which other institutions will be able to choose from, rather than having to write it in again.
*Collect more detailed student financial aid data. Currently, the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students receiving aid (fall or full-year cohort) and the average amount of aid received are collected for 4 aid categories: Federal grants, State grants, Institutional grants, and Loans. These categories will be expanded to the following list, and the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students receiving aid (fall or full-year cohort) and the average amount of aid received will be collected for each
*Collect additional information on aid recipients: 9-cell grid to collect numbers of students by dependency status (dependent, independent with dependents, independent without dependents) crossed by living arrangement (living on campus, living off campus without family, living off campus with family). For public institutions, this will be collected by in-district, in-state, and out-of-state status. This information will be posted on COOL.

'''Jotirao Govindrao Phule'''{{efn|There are numerous variant spellings of Phule's name. These include ''Jotirao'', ''Jotiba'', and ''Phooley''.}} (11 April 1827 – 28 November 1890) was an Indian social activist, a [[intellectual|thinker]], anti-caste [[social reformer]] and a writer from [[Maharashtra]].

His work extended to many fields including eradication of [[untouchability]] and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], women's emancipation and the reform of Hindu family life. On 24 September 1873, Phule, along with his followers, formed the [[Satyashodhak Samaj]] (Society of Seekers of Truth) to attain equal rights for people from lower castes. Phule is regarded as an important figure of the social reform movement in Maharashtra. He and his wife, [[Savitribai Phule]], were pioneers of women education in India. He is most known for his efforts to educate women and  lower caste people. The couple was among the first native Indians to open a school for girls in India.

==Early life==
Jyothirao Govindrao Phule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the agricultural Mali caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners and considered to be one of the vaishya varna in the ritual ranking system of Hinduism.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105-106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a chaugula, a lowly type of village servant, in that village but had to move to Khanwadi in [[Pune district|Poona district]] after exploitation by [[Brahmin]] with whom he had a dispute. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved himself and his family, including three boys, to [[Pune|Poona]] in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist, who taught them his trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1-3|ps=}} Their fulfilment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105-106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings, including Jyotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1-3|ps=}}

Govindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger. Chimnabai died before he was aged one.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1-3|ps=}} The Mali community did not set much store by education, and after attending primary school to learn the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, Jyotirao was withdrawn from school. He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm. However, a Christian convert from the same Mali caste as Phule recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule's father to allow Phule to attend the local Scottish Mission High School.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|The Scottish Mission school was operated by the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and educated pupils from a wide range of castes.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=105|ps=}}}} Phule completed his English schooling in 1847. As was customary, he was married young, at the age of 13, to a girl of his own community, chosen by his father.{{Cn|date=July 2017}}

The turning point in his life was in 1848, when he attended the wedding of a Brahmin friend. Phule participated in the customary marriage procession, but was later rebuked and insulted by his friend's parents for doing that. They told him that he being from a lower caste should have had the sense to keep away from that ceremony. This incident profoundly affected Phule on the injustice of the caste system.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Social activism==

In 1848, aged 23, Phule visited the first girls' school in [[Ahmednagar|Ahmadnagar]], run by Christian missionaries. It was also in 1848 that he read [[Thomas Paine]]'s book ''[[Rights of Man]]'' and developed a keen sense of social justice. He realised that lower castes and women were at a disadvantage in Indian society, and also that education of these sections was vital to their emancipation.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=110-113|ps=}}

To this end and in the same year, Phule first taught reading and writing to his wife, Savitribai, and then the couple started the first indigenously-run school for girls in Pune. Ostracised for this by their family and community, their friend Usman Sheikh and his sister [[Fatima Sheikh]] provided them their home to stay. They also helped to start the school in their premises.&lt;ref name="Fatima"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohan|first1=Siddhant|title=Remembering Fatima Sheikh, the first Muslim teacher who laid the foundation of Dalit-Muslim unity|url=http://twocircles.net/2017apr07/407472.html|website=Two Circles|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Phules started schools for children from the [[Mahar]] and [[Mang (caste)|Mang]] castes, which were both considered to be untouchable.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 1852, there were three Phule schools in operation but by 1858 they had all ended. [[Eleanor Zelliot]] blames the closure on private European donations drying up due to [[Mutiny of 1857|the Mutiny of 1857]], withdrawal of government support, and Jyotirao resigning from the school management committee because of disagreement regarding the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Sabyasachi|last2=Zelliot|first2=Eleanor (author)|title=Education and the disprivileged : nineteenth and twentieth century India.|date=2002|publisher=Orient Longman|location=Hyderabad|isbn=9788125021926|pages=35–37|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-jBIp3iWdEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=phule&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He championed [[widow remarriage]] and started a home for pregnant Brahmin widows to give birth in a safe and secure place in 1863.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=135|ps=}} His orphanage was established in an attempt to reduce the rate of [[infanticide]].{{sfnp|Figueira|2012|p=147|ps=}} Phule tried to eliminate the stigma of social untouchability surrounding the lower castes by opening his house and the use of his water-well to the members of the lower castes.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Views on religion and caste===
Phule recast the prevailing [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]] of history, proposing that the Aryan conquerors of India, whom the theory's proponents considered to be racially superior, were in fact barbaric suppressors of the indigenous people. He believed that they had instituted the caste system as a framework for subjugation and social division that ensured the pre-eminence of their Brahmin successors. He saw the subsequent [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent]] as more of the same sort of thing, being a repressive alien regime, but took heart in the arrival of the British, whom he considered to be relatively enlightened and not supportive of the ''varnashramadharma'' system instigated and then perpetuated by those previous invaders.{{sfnp|Figueira|2012|pp=147-148|ps=}}{{efn|''Varnashramadharma'' has been described by [[Dietmar Rothermund]] as the Indian societal system that "regulates the duty (''dharma'') of every man according to his caste (''varna'') and age-grade (''ashrama'')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Soundings in Modern South Asian History |editor-first=D.

Phule saw [[Rama]], the hero of the Indian epic [[Ramayana]], as a symbol of oppression stemming from the Aryan conquest.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharad Pawar, the Making of a Modern Maratha'' By P. K. Ravindranath&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=January 2018}} His critique of the caste system began with an attack on the [[Vedas]], the most fundamental texts of upper-caste Hindus.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=147-149|ps=}} He considered them to be a form of false consciousness.{{Sfnp|Figueira|2012|p=149|ps=}} 

He is credited with introducing the Marathi word ''[[dalit]]'' (broken, crushed) as a descriptor for those people who were outside the traditional varna system. The terminology was later popularised in the 1970s by the [[Dalit Panther]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayyankali&amp;nbsp;— Dalit Leader of Organic Protest |first1=M. |last1=Nisar |first2=Meena |last2=Kandasamy |authorlink2=Meena Kandasamy |publisher=Other Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-8-19038-876-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAIR983RvW4C |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an education commission hearing in 1884, Phule called for help in providing education for lower castes. To implement it, he advocated making primary education compulsory in villages. He also asked for special incentives to get more lower-caste people in high schools and colleges.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Sathyashodhak Samaj===
On 24 September 1873, Phule formed Satyashodhak Samaj to focus on rights of depressed groups such women, and the [[Shudra]], and the [[Dalit]].{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=135|ps=}}&lt;ref name="bhadru"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhadru|first=G.|title=Contribution of Shatyashodhak Samaj to the Low Caste Protest Movement in 19th Century |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=63 |year=2002 |pages=845–854 |jstor=44158153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unipune.ernet.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unipune.ernet.in/chairs/mahatmaphule/lifework.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311014003/http://www.unipune.ernet.in/chairs/mahatmaphule/lifework.htm |archivedate=2009-03-11 |title=Life &amp; Work of Mahatma Jotirao Pule |publisher=University of Pune}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this the samaj he opposed [[idolatry]] and denounced the caste system. Satyashodhak Samaj campaigned for the spread of rational thinking and rejected the need for priests. 

Phule established Satyashodhak Samaj with the ideals of human well-being, happiness, unity, equality, and easy religious principles and rituals.&lt;ref name="unipune.ernet.in"/&gt; A Pune-based newspaper, ''[[Deenbandhu]]'', provided the voice for the views of the Samaj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and Imperial Rule: Agriculture and Agrarian Society in the Bombay Presidency 1850-1935 |first=Neil |last=Charlesworth |edition=Revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-52152-640-1 |page=277 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jIbRhV00p6AC&amp;pg=PA277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The membership of the samaj included Muslims, Brahmans, and government officials.However,non-Brahman castes dominated. Phule's own Mali caste provided the leading members and financial supporters for the organization.&lt;ref name="bhadru"/&gt;

==Occupation==
Apart from his role as a social activist, Phule was a businessman too. In 1882 he styled himself as a merchant, cultivator and municipal contractor.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|p=172|ps=}} He owned {{convert|60|acre}} of farmland at [[Manjri]], near Pune..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Michael|editor-first=S.

==Recognition==
[[File:Jyotiba phule statue.jpg|thumb|A statue of Jyotiba Phule in the town of [[Karad]], Satara district]]
According to [[Dhananjay Keer]], Phule was bestowed with the title of [[Mahatma]] on 11 May 1888 by another social reformer from Bombay, Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|p=247|ps=}}

An early biography of Phule was the [[Marathi language|Marathi-language]] ''Mahatma Jotirao Phule yanche charitra'' (P. S. Patil, Chikali: 1927), which has to be treated with caution because its author was an activist.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|1992|p=107|ps=}} Two others are ''Mahatma Phule. Caritra Va Kriya'' (''Mahatma Phule. Life and Work'') (A. K. Ghorpade, Poona: 1953), which is also in Marathi, and ''Mahatma Jyotibha Phule: Father of Our Social Revolution'' ([[Dhananjay Keer]], Bombay: 1974). Unpublished material relating to him is held by the Bombay State Committee on the History of the Freedom Movement.{{sfnp|Sarkar|1975|pp=32-33, 40|ps=}}

There are many structures and places commemorating Phule. These include:

* The full-length statue inaugurated at the premises of Vidhan Bhavan (Assembly Building of Maharashtra State)
* [[Crawford Market|Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai]], also known as Crawford Market, in Mumbai
* [[Mahatma Phule Museum]] in Pune
* [[Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth]] (Agricultural University) in [[Rahuri]], [[Ahmednagar District]], Maharashtra.
* [[Mandai (Pune)|Mahathma Phule Mandai]], the biggest vegetable market in Pune
* [[M. J. P. Rohilkhand University]]
* [[Subharti College of Physiotherapy]] was ''formerly'' named after him
*[[G. P. Deshpande]]'s biographical play ''Satyashodhak'' (''The Truth Seeker'') was first performed by [[Jan Natya Manch]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Life As Message|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main53.asp?filename=hub160612LIFE.asp |date=16 June 2012 |publisher=[[Tehelka]] Magazine, Vol 9, Issue 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahatma Phule inspired [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the first minister of law of Republic India and the architect of Indian Constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12609">'''Luk Van Parijs''' was an associate professor of [[biology]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) Center for Cancer Research. After investigating for a year, MIT fired Van Parijs for research misconduct. Van Parijs admitted to fabricating and falsifying research data in a paper, several unpublished manuscripts, and grant applications. In March 2011, Van Parijs pleaded guilty in a U.S. District Court in Boston to one count of making a false statement on a federal grant application. The government asked Judge Denise Casper for a 6-month jail term because of the seriousness of the fraud, which involved a $2-million grant. After several prominent scientists including Van Parijs' former post-doc supervisor pleading for clemency on his behalf, on 13 June, Van Parijs was finally sentenced six months of home detention with electronic monitoring, plus 400 hours of community service and a payment to MIT of $61,117 - restitution for the already-spent grant money that MIT had to return to the National Institutes of Health [http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110628/full/474552a.html?s=news_rss].

Van Parijs' area of research was in the use of [[RNAi|short-interference RNA]] in studying disease mechanisms, especially in autoimmune diseases. He was studying normal [[immune cell]] function and defects in these cells during disease development.

The '''Mission Hill School''' is a small preK–8 public [[pilot school]] in the [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Founded in 1997 by [[Deborah Meier]], Elizabeth Knox Taylor, and colleagues, the school is administered by the [[Boston Public Schools]]. Meier has publicized the school in many of her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/|title=Bridging Differences |publisher=Education Week |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Schools We Trust |publisher=Beacon Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DemocraticEducation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayearatmissionhill.com/ |title=A Year at Mission Hill film series |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mission Hill School is a member of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialschools.org/d/41/Final_Program_Guide_2012.pdf?1352496266|title=CES Fall Forum 2012|date=|accessdate=2013-05-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116092840/http://www.essentialschools.org/d/41/Final_Program_Guide_2012.pdf?1352496266|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialschools.org/affiliates/119|title=Coalition of Essential Schools: Mission Hill School|date=|accessdate=2013-05-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208191554/http://www.essentialschools.org/affiliates/119|archivedate=2010-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has a diverse student body of approximately 220 students, with democratic decision-making at the school and classroom levels, a curricular focus on five democratic "Habits of Mind", school-wide thematic units, a strong emphasis on the arts, and graduation from the school upon creating and defending portfolios of student work for a panel of evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallery.carnegiefoundation.org/collections/castl_k12/hlyne/ |title=Heidi Lyne: Mission Hill School |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionhillschool.org/ |title=Mission Hill School website |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are admitted to the school based on a lottery, within the choice system of the Boston Public Schools (with consideration given to whether families live within the "walk zone" and whether a sibling already attends the school, among other factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/schoolchoices|title=BPS: What are my School Choices?|date=|accessdate=2013-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414050313/http://bostonpublicschools.org/schoolchoices|archivedate=2013-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates have been found to achieve academic success in high school and college at high rates.&lt;ref name="DemocraticEducation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Central Park East and its Graduates: Learning by Heart |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Meier's book ''[[In Schools We Trust]]'' included substantial attention to the Mission Hill School. It argued that the current climate of high-stakes testing makes running a school like Mission Hill much more difficult. She also wrote about the school in her books ''Will Standards Save Public Education?'' (2000) ''Keeping School: Letters to Families from Principals of Two Small Schools'' (with Ted and Nancy Sizer, 2005), ''Playing for Keeps: Life and Learning on a Public School Playground'' (with Beth Taylor and Brenda Engel, 2010), and ''Teaching in Themes: An Approach to Schoolwide Learning, Creating Community, and Differentiating Instruction'' (co-edited with Matthew Knoester, Katherine Clunis D'Andrea). The school is also the focus of the book by Matthew Knoester ''Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracyeducationjournal.org/home/vol22/iss1/10/ |title=Beating the Odds. A Book Review of ''Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School'' |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was controversially moved to a different location within Boston in 2012, despite resistance from the school community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missionhillgazette.com/2013/01/11/mission-hill-schools-fame-is-focus-of-new-book/ |title=Mission Hill School's fame is focus of a new book |publisher=Mission Hill Gazette |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaicaplaingazette.com/2013/03/15/letter-mission-hill-school-should-regain-citywide-status/ |title=Letter: Mission Hill School should regain citywide status |publisher=Jamaica Plain Gazette |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">'''National Share-a-Story Month''' (NSSM) is an annual event in the [[United Kingdom]] that is used to promote [[reading (process)|reading]] to [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.national-awareness-days.com/national-share-a-story-month.html|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used by librarians, schools, the book industry, bloggers and parents as a way to focus on storytelling in the broadest of senses. Local groups of [[The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] often hold special events to celebrate the month, such as author visits, book readings and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsforlife.org.uk/once-upon-story|title=Words for Life: National Share a Story month|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NSSM has originated as National Tell-A-Story Week in 1974, the idea of Pat Triggs, Vice-Chair of [[The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] at the time. In 1998 it was decided to extend the idea to one month and the event became the National Share-A-Story Month.

'''Officer training''' refers to the training that most [[military officer]]s must complete before acquiring an officer rank. A potential recruit becomes an [[officer cadet]], someone in training. An officer in training can either be trained in a [[Military academy|military college]], such as [[West Point]], or taken from the enlisted ranks. After this training is complete, the recruit in question becomes a fully fledged officer, taking on a commanding position in his or her military branch.

[[File:Oklahoma Historical Society.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Oklahoma Historical Society]]
The '''Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS)''' is an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[government of Oklahoma]] dedicated to promotion and preservation of [[Oklahoma's history]] and its people by collecting, interpreting, and disseminating knowledge and artifacts of [[Oklahoma]]. The mission of the OHS is to collect, preserve, and share the history and culture of the state of Oklahoma and its people. 

The Society has the rare distinction of being both a [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[National Archives and Records Administration]] affiliate.

==History==
The OHS was formed in May 1893, 14 years before Oklahoma became a state, by the Oklahoma Territorial Press Association. The initial function of the OHS was to collect and distribute newspapers published in [[Oklahoma Territory]]. The society was declared an agency of the territorial government in 1895, and it became an official state government agency when Oklahoma reached [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1907. The OHS is both a private, membership organization and an Oklahoma government agency. The OHS Board of Directors is made up of 25 members, 12 of whom are appointed by the governor and 13 elected by OHS members to three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odl.state.ok.us/sginfo/oksg/historical-society.pdf |title=Historical Society, Oklahoma Board |accessdate=May 23, 2007 |year=2007 |format=PDF |work=Oklahoma State Government Online  |publisher=Oklahoma Department of Libraries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The OHS today works statewide and nationally to preserve and nurture Oklahoma's history. The Oklahoma State Historic Preservation Office, also operated by the society, carries out federal preservation programs in Oklahoma under the [[National Historic Preservation Act]], to preserve Oklahoma's significant buildings, parks, objects, and sites. Projects are carried out in partnership with the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] and the [[National Park Service]], as well as other state and local governments, groups, and interested people. The society posts markers at historical sites.

==Publications==
The OHS has published ''[[The Chronicles of Oklahoma]]'', the society's scholarly journal, since 1921 and continues to issue four editions per year. The society's monthly newsletter, ''Mistletoe Leaves'', includes information about OHS activities and historical happenings throughout Oklahoma. Both publications and other historical works are available by subscription or per issue. The OHS has also published numerous other titles including ''The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma Culture and History''.

''The Chronicles of Oklahoma'' through 1962 are available online through the [[Oklahoma State University Library Electronic Publishing Center]]. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma Culture and History is available on the society's website.

==Archives and Collections==

The OHS Research Division houses more than 9 million photographs, more than 1 million pages of historical documents and manuscripts, 3,000 oral histories, historic film and video collections, and more than 4,400 titles of newspapers on available microfilm.

Many of the Oklahoma Historical Society's documents and materials are available online at little or no charge, including indexes to the [[Dawes Rolls]], Oklahoma military deaths, the 1890 Oklahoma Territorial Census, Territorial Incorporation Records, Hastain's Township Plats of the Creek Nation, Oklahoma County marriage records 1889-1951, Daily Oklahoman obituaries, and Smith’s First Directory of Oklahoma Territory. The online archives catalog also contains some of the photographs in the OHS Research Division Collection. Historic newspapers are available free of charge on the Society's Gateway to Oklahoma History. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.okhistory.org/about/index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==

===Oklahoma History Center===
The society operates the [[Oklahoma History Center]], the state's museum located in [[Oklahoma City]]. The Oklahoma History Center occupies 215,000&amp;nbsp;ft² (19,974m²) and contains more than 2,000 artifacts and exhibits featuring hands-on audio, video, and activities. A museum store is available online or at the Oklahoma History Center, and annual membership can be purchased for individuals, families, and institutions.

From 1919 to 1942, [[Czarina Conlan]] was in charge of collecting artifacts and documents for the museum from the various Native American tribes throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Indian Women of Oklahoma Active Workers in Clubs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6151459/the_decatur_daily_review/|accessdate=8 August 2016|agency=AP|publisher=''[[The Decatur Daily Review]]''|date=December 13, 1927|location=Decatur, Illinois|page=14|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=State Briefs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6151523/state_briefs_the_miami_daily/|accessdate=9 August 2016|publisher=''[[The Miami Daily News-Record]]''|date=February 23, 1942|location=Miami, Oklahoma|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The History Center also houses the OHS Research Division, which includes a large Research Center that is free and open to the public.

===Oklahoma Museum of Popular Culture (OKPOP) ===
In May 2009 the OHS announced plans to build a second museum, to be called the [[Oklahoma Museum of Popular Culture]], or [[OKPOP]], and located in Tulsa's [[Neighborhoods of Tulsa, Oklahoma#Brady Arts District|Brady District]].  It is planned as the state museum of [[popular culture]], including music, television, film and the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Krehbiel, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090519_298_0_Affybi520668 "New Tulsa museum announced by Oklahoma Historical Society"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', May 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  After lengthy delays, funding for the museum was obtained through a $25 million [[bond issue]] approved in 2015. In late 2016, the society announced that OKPOP will be located on North Main Street, across the street from [[Cain's Ballroom]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt Trotter, [http://publicradiotulsa.org/post/cains-ballroom-has-new-neighbor-okpop#stream/0 " Cain's Ballroom Has a New Neighbor: OKPOP"], [[KWGS]], December 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries analyzed documents detailing the operations of the law firm.&lt;ref name="Guardian: how the rich"/&gt; After more than a year of analysis, the first news stories were published on April 3, 2016, along with 150 of the documents themselves.&lt;ref name="DocumentCloudPP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20(Panama%20Papers)%22 |title=DocumentCloud 150 Results Source: Internal documents from Mossack Fonseca (Panama) |last= |first= |date= |website=DocumentCloud |publisher=Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319113221/https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20%28Panama%20Papers%29%22|archive-date=2017-03-19|dead-url=yes |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project represents an important milestone in the use of [[data journalism]] software tools and [[mobile collaboration]].

The documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from; however, the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name over concerns that it would tarnish the government's and country's image worldwide, as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere. This led to an advertising campaign some weeks after the leak, titled "Panama, more than papers".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Medoro.Madera.Oficial/posts/10153637852624779&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsroompanama.com/news/panama/panama-more-than-papers-us-ambassador&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.panamatoday.com/special-report/panama-papers-scandal-damaged-image-country-4615&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets covering the story have used the name "Mossack Fonseca papers".&lt;ref&gt;Sources using the term "Mossack Fonseca papers":

In addition to the much-covered business dealings of British prime minister [[David Cameron]] and Icelandic prime minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], the leaked documents also contain identity information about the shareholders and directors of 214,000 shell companies set up by [[Mossack Fonseca]], as well as some of their financial transactions. Much of this information does not show anything more than prudent financial management. It is generally not against the law (in and of itself) to own an offshore shell company, although offshore shell companies may sometimes be used for illegal purposes.

The journalists on the investigative team found business transactions by many important figures in world politics, sports and art. Many of these transactions are quite legal. Since the data is incomplete, questions remain in many other cases; still others seem to clearly indicate ethical if not legal impropriety. Some disclosures – [[tax avoidance]] in very poor countries by very wealthy entities and individuals for example – lead to questions on moral grounds. According to ''[[The Namibian]]'' for instance, a shell company registered to [[Beny Steinmetz]], Octea, owes more than $700,000 US in property taxes to the city of [[Koidu]] in [[Sierra Leone]], and is $150 million in the red, even though its [[export]]s were more than twice that in an average month in the 2012–2015 period. Steinmetz himself has personal worth of $6 billion.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Other offshore shell company transactions described in the documents do seem to have broken exchange laws, violated trade sanctions or stemmed from political corruption, according to ICIJ reporters. For example:

*Uruguay has arrested five people and charged them with [[money-laundering]] through Mossack Fonseca shell companies for a [[Mexican drug cartel]].&lt;ref name=ICIJuru&gt;{{cite news |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160425-cartel-arrests-uruguay.html |title=Cartel-Linked Suspects Arrested After Panama Papers Revelations |author=Martha M.

The ''Ouestaf'' article does not address the conduct of the trial, but does say that ''Ouestaf'' journalists found Mossack Fonseca documents showing payments to Wade via a DP subsidiary and a shell company registered to the friend.&lt;ref name=OuPiste&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ouestaf.com/Panama-papers-et-societes-offshore-sur-la-piste-des-fonds-de-Karim-Wade-Exclusif_a5988.html |title=" Panama papers " et sociétés offshore : sur la piste des fonds de Karim Wade ?

"The most obvious use of offshore financial centers is to avoid taxes", ''The Economist'' added.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt; [[Oxfam]] blamed tax havens in its 2016 annual report on income inequality for much of the widening gap between rich and poor.

The [[OECD]], the [[G20]], or the [[European Union]] could also institute another list for countries that are inadequate in more than one area.

Leaked documents also indicate that the firm would also backdate documents on request and, based on a 2007 exchange of emails in the leaked documents, it did so routinely enough to establish a price structure: $8.75 per month in the past.&lt;ref name=backdate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-04/unprecedented-leak-of-offshore-financial-records-exposes-secrets/7293524 |title=Panama Papers: Vladimir Putin associates, Jackie Chan identified in unprecedented leak of offshore financial records |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |publisher=ABC News online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417173225/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-04/unprecedented-leak-of-offshore-financial-records-exposes-secrets/7293524 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Mossack Fonseca hired a 90-year-old British man to pretend to be the owner of the offshore company of [[Marianna Olszewski]], a US businesswoman, "a blatant breach of anti-money laundering rules" according to the BBC.&lt;ref name=BBCPanama&gt;{{cite web |last=Bilton |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35956324 |title=Panama Papers: How a British man, 90, covered for a US millionaire |publisher=BBC News |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404082143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35956324 |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctioned clients ===
{{See also|Office of Foreign Assets Control|Due diligence| Know your customer |Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering |Politically exposed person|Economic sanctions |International sanctions}}
The anonymity of offshore shell companies can also be used to circumvent international sanctions, and more than 30 Mossack Fonseca clients were at one time or another blacklisted by the [[US Treasury Department]], including businesses linked to senior figures in Russia, Syria and North Korea.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher "A torrential leak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831141724/https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher |date=August 31, 2017 }}.

Three Mossack Fonseca companies started for clients of Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants were later sanctioned by the US Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC). Pangates International Corporation was accused in July 2014 of supplying the government of Syria with "a large amount of specialty petroleum products" with "limited civilian application in Syria". The other two, Maxima Middle East Trading and Morgan Additives Manufacturing Co, and their owners Wael Abdulkarim and Ahmad Barqawi, were said to have "engaged in deceptive measures" to supply oil products to Syria.&lt;ref name=CBClawyer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |title=Panama Papers: Quebec lawyer based pin Dubai linked to Mossack Fonseca: Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants worked to incorporate 3 companies that now face economic sanctions |author=Salimah Shivji |publisher=CBC News |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422135758/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossack Fonseca also ran six businesses for [[Rami Makhlouf]], cousin of Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]], despite US sanctions against him.&lt;ref name=bbcSyr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |title=Panama Papers: Mossack Fonseca 'helped firms subject to sanctions' |first=Simon |last=Cox |publisher=BBC |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405160118/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Mossack Fonseca documents show that in 2011 Mossack Fonseca rejected a recommendation by their own compliance team to sever ties to Mr. Makhlouf. They agreed to do so only months later. The firm has said it never knowingly allowed anyone connected with rogue regimes to use its companies.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

[[Frederik Obermaier]], co-author of the Panama Papers story and an investigative reporter at the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', told ''[[Democracy Now]]'': "[[Mossack Fonseca]] realised that [[Rami Makhlouf|Makhlouf]] was the cousin, and they realised that he was sanctioned, and they realised that he's allegedly one of the financiers of the Syrian regime. And they said, 'Oh, there is this bank who still does business with him, so we should still keep with him, as well'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: World Leaders from Iceland to Argentina Exposed in Massive Tax Evasion Scheme |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=Democracy Now! |date=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423181546/http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC]] also appeared to reassure [[Mossack Fonseca]] not only that it was "comfortable" with Makhlouf as a client but suggested there could be a rapprochement with the [[Al-Assad family|Assad family]] by the US. Makhlouf is already known to be a long-standing client of HSBC's Swiss private bank, holding at least $15 million with it in multiple accounts in 2006.&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt; The Panamanian files also show HSBC provided financial services to a Makhlouf company called Drex Technologies, which HSBC said was a company of "good standing".&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt;

DCB Finance, a Virgin Islands-based shell company founded by North Korean banker [[Kim Chol-sam]]&lt;ref name=USTreas&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1994.aspx |title=Treasury Sanctions Bank, Front Company, and Official Linked to North Korean Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs: Action Targets North Korea's Use of Deceptive Financial Practices to Support its Weapons Programs |author=US Department of the Treasury |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |date=June 27, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224019/https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1994.aspx |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and British banker [[Nigel Cowie]],&lt;ref name=Cowie&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-briton-set-up-firm-allegedly-used-by-north-korea-weapons-sales |title=British banker set up firm 'used by North Korea to sell weapons' |last=Garside |first=Juliette |date=April 4, 2016 |last2=Harding |first2=Luke |newspaper=The Guardian |language=English |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=2016-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404223335/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-briton-set-up-firm-allegedly-used-by-north-korea-weapons-sales |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; also ignored international sanctions and continued to do business with [[North Korea]] with the help of the Panamanian firm. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] in 2013 called DCB Finance a front company for [[Daedong Credit Bank]] and announced sanctions against both companies for providing banking services to North Korean arms dealer [[Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation]],&lt;ref name=USTreas /&gt; attempting to evade sanctions against that country, and helping to sell arms and expand North Korea's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons programme]]. Cowie said the holding company was used for legitimate business and he was not aware of illicit transactions.&lt;ref name=Cowie /&gt;

Mossack Fonseca, required by international banking standards to avoid [[money-laundering]] or fraudster clients, is, like all banks, supposed to be particularly alert for signs of corruption with [[politically exposed person]]s (PEP), in other words, clients who either are or have close ties to government officials. However they somehow failed to turn up any red flags concerning Tareq Abbas even though he shares a family name with the president of Palestine, and sat on the board of directors of a company with four fellow directors the firm did deem PEP because of their ties to Palestinian politics. Yet Mossack Fonseca actually did and documented [[due diligence]] research, including a Google search.&lt;ref name=son /&gt;

==Clients of Mossack Fonseca==
Mossack Fonseca has managed more than 300,000 companies over the years.&lt;ref name="to know" /&gt; The number of active companies peaked at more than 80,000 in 2009. Over 210,000 companies in twenty-one jurisdictions figure in the leaks. More than half were incorporated in the [[British Virgin Islands]], others in Panama, the Bahamas, the Seychelles, [[Niue]], and Samoa. Mossack Fonseca's clients have come from more than 100 countries. Most of the corporate clients were from Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Panama, and Cyprus. Mossack Fonseca worked with more than 14,000 banks, law firms, incorporators, and others to set up companies, foundations, and trusts for their clients.&lt;ref name="ICIJ graphs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/ |title=The Panama Papers Numbers |website=panamapapers.icij.org |access-date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403231300/https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 3,100 companies listed in the database appear to have ties to US offshore specialists, and 3,500 shareholders of offshore companies list US addresses.&lt;ref name=SeattleUS&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Kevin G. |last2=Taylor |first2=Marisa |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/americans-including-a-bellevue-man-show-up-in-panama-papers/ |title=Americans, including a Bellevue man, show up in Panama Papers |work=Seattle Times |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405023526/http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/americans-including-a-bellevue-man-show-up-in-panama-papers/ |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca has offices in Nevada and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=KCStar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article70008302.html |title=US scolds others about offshores, but looks other way at home |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |date=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224021/http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/world/article70008302.html |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaked documents indicate that about US$2&amp;nbsp;trillion has passed through the firm's hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/investigara-mossack-fonseca/23931813 |language=Spanish |trans-title=MP investigated Mossack Fonseca |title=MP investigará a Mossack Fonseca |work=El Siglo |author=Irving Delgado Nay |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405164458/http://elsiglo.com/panama/investigara-mossack-fonseca/23931813 |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the holding companies that appear in the documents did business with sanctioned entities, such as arms merchants and relatives of dictators, while the sanctions were in place. The firm provided services to a Seychelles company named Pangates International, which the US government believes supplied aviation fuel to the Syrian government during the current civil war, and continued to handle its paperwork and certify it as a company in good standing, despite sanctions, until August 2015.&lt;ref name=bbcSyr /&gt;

More than 500 banks registered nearly 15,600 [[shell company|shell companies]] with Mossack Fonseca, with [[HSBC]] and its affiliates accounting for more than 2,300 of the total. [[Dexia]] and [[J. Safra Sarasin]] of Luxembourg, [[Credit Suisse]] from the Channel Islands and the Swiss [[UBS]] each requested at least 500 offshore companies for their clients.&lt;ref name="ICIJ graphs" /&gt; An [[HSBC]] spokesman said, "The allegations are historical, in some cases dating back 20 years, predating our significant, well-publicized reforms implemented over the last few years."&lt;ref name="MyUser_Uk.reuters.com_5_April_2016c"&gt;{{cite news |title=Credit Suisse, HSBC dismiss 'Panama Papers' tax avoidance allegations |publisher=Reuters |location=United Kingdom |date=April 5, 2016 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-panama-tax-banks-idUKKCN0X208V |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405080736/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-panama-tax-banks-idUKKCN0X208V |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses by Mossack Fonseca ==
In response to queries from the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and ICIJ, Mossack Fonseca issued a 2,900-word statement listing legal requirements that prevent using offshore companies for [[tax avoidance]] and total anonymity, such as [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]] protocols which require identifying ultimate [[beneficial owner]]s of all companies (including offshore companies) before opening any account or transacting any business.

The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' printed the statement with an editor's note that said the statement "did not address any of the specific due diligence failings uncovered by reporters".&lt;ref name=MH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034835/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archivedate=2016-05-29 |author=Miami Herald staff |title=Mossack Fonseca responds to Miami Herald 'Secret Shell Game' series on offshore companies |date=April 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, April 4, Mossack Fonseca released another statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The facts are these: while we may have been the victim of a data breach, nothing we've seen in this illegally obtained cache of documents suggests we've done anything illegal, and that's very much in keeping with the global reputation we've built over the past 40 years of doing business the right way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Co-founder [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told [[CNN]] that the reports were false, full of inaccuracies and that parties "in many of the circumstances" cited by the ICIJ "are not and have never been clients of Mossack Fonseca". The firm provided longer statements to ICIJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |title=The Panama Papers: 7 things to know |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024845/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its official statement April 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement Regarding Recent Media Coverage |publisher=Mossack Fonseca|access-date=2016-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406213759/http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca suggested that responsibility for any legal violations might lie with other institutions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;approximately 90% of our clientele is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} professional clients&amp;nbsp;... who act as [[financial intermediary|intermediaries]] and are regulated in the [[jurisdiction]] of their business. These clients are obliged to perform [[due diligence]] on their clients in accordance with the [[Know your customer|KYC]] and [[Anti-money laundering|AML regulations]] to which they are subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''Bloomberg'', [[Jürgen Mossack]] said: "The cat's out of the bag, so now we have to deal with the aftermath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |author=Blake Schmidt |publisher=Bloomberg |title=A Conversation With Panama's Suddenly Notorious Offshore Lawyers |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163510/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |archivedate=February 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:00 am on April 3, as the news first broke, [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told television channel [[TVN (Panama)|TVN]] he "was not responsible nor he had been accused in any tribunal".&lt;ref name="tvn-2.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |title=Exclusiva: 'No soy responsable ni he sido acusado en un tribunal', Fonseca Mora |website=TVN |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506225050/http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 8, the government understood media reports were addressing tax evasion not attacking the country of Panama.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The president met on Wednesday April 7, with CANDIF, a committee of representatives from different sectors of the economy which includes the Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Industry and Agriculture, the National Lawyers Association, the International Lawyers Association, the Banking Association and the Stock Exchange, and entered full [[crisis management]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |title=Panama Launches Crisis Talks in Wake of Tax Haven Leaks |website=www.bna.com |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508162514/http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |archivedate=May 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced the creation of a new judiciary tribunal and a high-level commission led by Nobel Prize Laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]].{{when|date=November 2017}}

[[Isabel Saint Malo]] de Alvarado, Vice President of Panama, said in an op-ed piece published April 21 in ''The Guardian'' that President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and his administration have strengthened Panama's controls over [[money-laundering]] in the twenty months they have been in power, and that "Panama is setting up an independent commission, co-chaired by the Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], to evaluate our financial system, determine best practices, and recommend measures to strengthen global financial and legal transparency.

However, in early August 2016, Stiglitz resigned from the committee because he learned that the Panamanian government would not commit to making their final report public.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance of Panama, Dulcidio de la Guardia, formerly an offshore specialist at Mossack Fonseca competitor Morgan &amp; Morgan, said the legal but often "murky" niche of establishing offshore accounts, firms and trusts make up "less than half a percentage point" of Panama's [[GDP]].

The Attorney General's office issued a press release following the raid, which lasted 27 hours,&lt;ref name=Telraid&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/investigators-raid-property-of-panama-papers-law-firm-mossack-fo/ |title=Investigators raid property of 'Panama Papers' law firm Mossack Fonseca |author=Reuters |date=April 23, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423184402/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/investigators-raid-property-of-panama-papers-law-firm-mossack-fo/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the purpose was "to obtain documents relevant to the information published in news articles that establishes the possible use of the law firm in illegal activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/judicial/Registran-Mossack-Fonseca-Panama-Papers-panama-papers-efecto-panama-corrupcion-paraisos-fiscales_0_4459054130.html |title=Fiscalía panameña realizó allanamiento en Mossack Fonseca |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 13, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414193125/http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/judicial/Registran-Mossack-Fonseca-Panama-Papers-panama-papers-efecto-panama-corrupcion-paraisos-fiscales_0_4459054130.html |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search ended without measures against the law firm, confirmed prosecutor Javier Caraballo of the Second Prosecutor Against Organized Crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/evita-referirse-futuro-mossack-fonseca/23933897 |title=MP evita referirse al futuro de Mossack Fonseca |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415111605/http://elsiglo.com/panama/evita-referirse-futuro-mossack-fonseca/23933897 |archivedate=April 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22 the same unit raided another Panama location and "secured a large amount of evidence".&lt;ref name=Telraid /&gt;

The Municipality of Regulation and Supervision of Financial Subjects [not the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)] initiated a special review of the law firm Mossack Fonseca to determine whether it had followed tax law. Carlamara Sanchez, in charge of this proceeding, said at a press conference that the quartermaster had come to verify whether the firm had complied since April 8 with [[due diligence]], customer knowledge, the final beneficiary and reporting of suspicious transactions to Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) operations. She said that Law 23 of 2015 empowers regulation and supervision and said some firms had been monitored since late last year with special attention after the Panama Papers, and noted that the law carries fines $5,000 to $1 million or even suspension of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |title=MEF realiza auditoría a firma Mossack Fonseca |date=April 15, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417003806/http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICIJ investigation of Mossack Fonseca was reported to the Public Ministry. Samid Dan Sandoval, former candidate for mayor of Santiago de Veraguas (2014), filed the legal action against the journalists and all those who had participated. He said the project name damaged the integrity, dignity and sovereignty of the country. and that the consortium would have to assume legal responsibility for all damage caused to the Panamanian nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |title=ICIJ no puede ser investigado |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414104744/http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Change.org petition requested the ICIJ stop using the name of Panama as in the Panama Papers.

=== Suspension of investigation ===
Attorney General of Panama Kenia Isolda Porcell Diaz announced on January 24, 2017 that he was suspending the investigations against Mossack Fonseca because it filed an appeal for protection of constitutional rights before the First Superior Court of Justice of Panama and requested that he deliver all the original documents to issue a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers |first= |last=gestion.pe |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202041325/http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers – laprensalibre.cr |first= |last=www.laprensalibre.cr |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024609/https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |title=Panamá Papers: procuradora general anunció suspensión de investigación |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202025907/http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

==== European Union ====
Many senior EU figures have been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal.&lt;ref name="Politico EU figures"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quentin |first1=Ariès |last2=Paravinci |first2=Giulia |title=5 ways the Panama Papers swept up EU figures |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 7, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224018/http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud|European Commissioner for Taxation]], [[Pierre Moscovici]], has said that the [[European Union]] as a whole had a "duty" to prevent the kind of tax avoidance uncovered in the Panama Papers scandal. Moscovici told reporters the use of offshore companies to hide what he called "shocking amounts" of financial assets from tax authorities was "unethical". He estimated that the tax shelters resulted in an annual loss of some €1&amp;nbsp;trillion in public finances, adding that the [[European Commission]] has attempted to tighten tax rules across the union since November 2014 due to the [[Luxembourg Leaks]] scandal, also revealed by the ICIJ, and that he hoped the extent of the Panama Papers revelations would spur countries to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ariès |first1=Quentin |title=EU vows to act quickly on Panama Papers |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224450/http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 letter, unearthed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to the then president of the [[European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]], the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[David Cameron]] said that offshore trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency requirements as shell companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Cameron stepped in to shield offshore trusts from EU tax crackdown in 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407033153/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: Cameron's 2013 concern over trust reforms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=BBC News |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407000423/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Andorra ====
The Panama Papers revealed that the Minister of Finance of Andorra, [[Jordi Cinca]], while he was CEO of Orfund SA, maintained an offshore company called Mariette Holdings Inc, until its dissolution in 2002 for fear of discovery of his participation in these businesses. The business activities of Orfund had ties to the [[blood diamond]] trade, and the refining and sale of African gold. This company closed shortly before the [[civil war in Ivory Coast]].

The opposition demanded his resignation as a result. In response Cinca said that "if their connection would affect the Government of Andorra, will step down". Still, he did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama "Andorra Difusió]". {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423124656/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama "Andorra Difusió RTVA"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423135858/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 "Portada de El Periòdic d'Andorra"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612081501/http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 |date=June 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html "Europa Press – Orfund"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603170841/http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html |date=June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ "Libertad Digital"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422025514/http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ |date=April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Austria's financial market authority has announced that they will audit two Austrian banks that were mentioned in the Panama Papers – [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisenbank International]] (RBI) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Hypo Vorarlberg|de|3=Vorarlberger Landes- und Hypothekenbank}}. It will be specifically examining whether the banks have complied with their obligation to prevent money laundering.

Former French budget minister [[Jérôme Cahuzac]], who spearheaded a crackdown on tax fraud while in office, was a client of Mossack Fonseca and through them owned a Seychelles company named Cerman Group Limited, incorporated in 2009.

Prime Minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], elected after the 2008 banking collapse in Iceland, had pledged to clean up corruption in the banking system. But when Sigmundur Davíð took his seat he did not disclose his 50% interest of Wintris, a company that owned bonds of one of the bankrupt banks, nor divest himself of it, until the day before a new law took effect on January 1, 2010 that would have required him to declare this conflict of interest.

A 2012 investigation, by [[Radio Free Europe]] and the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP) discovered that through overseas holding companies, the daughters of Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] owned an interest in a gold mine operation created by a 2006 presidential decree forming a consortium, then awarding it a 30-year lease over environmental and transparency objections in Parliament.&lt;ref name=inv2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |title=Azerbaijan's President Awarded Family Stake in Gold Fields |date=May 3, 2012 |author1=By Khadija Ismayilova |author2=Nushaba Fatullayeva |publisher=OCCRP |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224142/https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |archivedate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Panama Papers made it possible to trace some of the elaborate network of shell companies that manage the ownership of the mines, and in 2016 OCCRP was able to establish that in fact the daughters control the mining operation.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

Aliyev awarded the gold mines to Globex International LLP, Londex Resources S.A., Willy &amp; Meyris S.A. and Fargate Mining Corporation. Thirty percent of the proceeds were allocated to the government of Azerbaijan; 11% of the remaining 70% went to Globex, 45% to Londex, 29% to Willy &amp; Meyris and the remaining 15% to Fargate.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

These companies were registered in Panama, according to the documents obtained from Panama Registry of Companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio RF/RFL, last updated in April 2016 |url=http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |publisher=RFRL |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218194532/http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |archivedate=December 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A one of them, Fargate Mining Corporation was founded by Tagiva Management Ltd., Tagiva Services Ltd. and Verda Management Ltd.

Founder of [[Nobel Oil Group]] also is Mr. N. Hasanov.

The 2012 investigation's reporters, established that Globex was owned through shell companies in Panama, and that these shell companies belonged to the president's daughters and a Swiss businessman whose name appears in other shell companies such as those that manage Azerphone, the family telecommunications monopoly. Villagers told reporters they hoped to work at the mine, which paid $12 a day, and asked them to intervene with the president about the problems the mine was causing with the water supply. They became angry and did not believe the reporters when they said the president's family had a stake in the mine.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

Following the May publication of this report, the National Assembly passed a law making it illegal to report company ownership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |title=Придет ли Азербайджан к открытости? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618114118/http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another giving former presidents and first ladies lifelong legal immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |title=Ильхам Алиев тоже получил пожизненный иммунитет |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616230020/http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |archivedate=June 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khadija Ismayilova, the Radio Free Europe reporter on the 2012 investigation was subjected to escalating legal and public harassment.

Leaked Mossack Fonseca documents made it possible to establish that the daughters also owned Londex, the majority partner in the gold enterprise. It is not entirely clear why they shut the operation down but industry experts familiar with the consortium say it did not seem very experienced and may have rushed into production.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

According to the ICIJ, Aliyev's daughter Arzu not only has financial stakes not only in gold rights but also in Azerfon, the country's largest mobile phone business. She has shares in SW Holding, which "controls nearly every operation related to Azerbaijan Airlines" (Azal), from meals to airport taxis. Both sisters and their brother Heydar own property in Dubai valued at roughly $75&amp;nbsp;million in 2010; Heydar is the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="icij"/&gt;

Some 600 Israeli companies and 850 Israeli shareholders are listed.

Weissglass' name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in May 2012, according to Haaretz, and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a [[Vienna]] bank.

Weissglass and Halkin told Haaretz that the company "was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation... [the] company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |title=600 Israeli companies, 850 shareholders listed in Panama data leak |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405085825/http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict followed months of dramatic news coverage and social media debates, the divisions falling largely along party lines.&lt;ref name="pk" /&gt;

Prior to the ruling, [[Maryam Nawaz]] had tweeted denial of wrongdoing, adding that she did not own "any company/property abroad," except as "a trustee" in a brother's corporation, "which only entitles me to distribute assets to my brother Hussain's family/children if needed."&lt;ref name=SamaaApr416&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam |title=I do not own any company or property abroad: Maryam Nawaz |date=April 4, 2016 |work=[[Samaa TV]] |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024906/http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked documents name her as a [[trustee]] of Nescoll, created in 1993, and Nielson, first registered in 1994. The two companies subscribed to Mossack Fonseca services in July 2006. Mossack Fonseca was managing Nescoll, Nielsen Holdings, and Coomber Group when the three companies obtained a £7 million mortgage from the Swiss bank, [[Deutsche Bank]] (Suisse) SA and purchased four flats in Avenfield House, at 118 [[Park Lane]] in London. Hassan, the other brother, bought Hangon Holdings and its stock in 2007 for £5.5 million; Hangon then bought property, financed through the [[Bank of Scotland]], at 1 Hyde Park Place in London.

Samina Durrani, mother of Shebaz Sharif's second wife, and Ilyas Mehraj, brother of his first, also figure in the documents. Habib Waqas Group/Ilyas Mehraj is listed as a shareholder with 127,735 shares in Haylandale Limited, registered July 24, 2003 in the Bahamas. Mehraj has denied knowing anything about "any company whether incorporated in the Commonwealth of Bahamas or anywhere else under the name: Haylandale Ltd."&lt;ref name=pklist /&gt; Rainbow Limited, the newest of the three offshore companies owned by Samina Durrani, was registered September 29, 2010 in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Armani River Limited, registered in the Bahamas on May 16, 2002, describes its assets as "property in London, which is not currently rented."&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Assets of Star Precision Limited, registered in BVI May 21, 1997, were reported as "cash as the investment portfolio.

=====Benazir Bhutto=====
The late [[Benazir Bhutto]] was also a Mossack Fonseca client. In 2001 the firm set up BVI company Petroline International Inc. for Bhutto, her nephew Hassan Ali Jaffery Bhutto, and her aide and head of security [[Rehman Malik]], who later became a Senator and Interior Minister in the government of [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]. Mossack Fonseca had deemed Bhutto's first company, the similarly named Petrofine FZC, politically sensitive and "declined to accept Mrs Bhutto as a client."&lt;ref name=MFBhutto&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |title=In oil-for-food shadow, Benazir Bhutto set up a firm too |author=Jay Mazoomdaar |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |publisher=Indian Express |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416230235/http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations]] committee chaired by former US [[Federal Reserve]] head [[Paul Volcker]] had determined in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|oil-for-food]] program that Petrofine FZC paid US$2 million to the [[Iraq]]i government of [[Saddam Hussein]] to obtain US $115–145 million in oil contracts.&lt;ref name=OfF&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |title=Panama Papers: Benazir Bhutto's oil firm paid huge bribes to Iraqi President Saddam Hussain for contracts |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=Ali Zain |publisher=Daily Pakistan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419125238/http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Pakistani [[National Accountability Bureau]] (NAB) accused Bhutto, Malik and Ali Jaffery of owning Petrofine, established since 2000 in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Bhutto and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] denied it. In April 2006 an NAB court froze assets owned in Pakistan and elsewhere by Bhutto and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]], saying that the assets, totaling $1.5 billion, were the result of corrupt practices, and that Swiss charges of criminal money laundering filed in 1997 were still in litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redcatsboards.yuku.com/topic/16603/Court-orders-confiscation-of-Zardaris-entire-property#.VxQPh_gXAlK |title=Court orders confiscation of Zardari's entire property |date=2 April 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=khaleejtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]], prime minister from 2007 to 2013, in 2002 acquired three shell companies incorporated in the Bahamas and another in the British Virgin Islands and through them moorage in [[Mallorca]] and a $300 million yacht named ''Al Mirqab''.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |title=Panama Papers Leak Helps Show That Qatar's Former Prime Minister Is A Billionaire |author=Chloe Sorvino |publisher=''Forbes'' |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420180845/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panama Papers indicate he owns or owned eight shell companies. Subsequent reporting by ''Forbes'' found that Al Thani bought $700 million in [[Deutsche Bank]] shares in 2014 through Paramount Services Holdings and in 2015 transferred roughly half the stock to Supreme Universal Holdings, owned by a relative who had left office as emir of Qatar, also in 2013.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar /&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
[[File:Salman bin Abdull aziz December 9, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]] ]]

[[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] is mentioned in the leaks in relation to two companies based in the British Virgin Islands—Verse Development Corporation, incorporated in 1999, and Inrow Corporation, incorporated in 2002. The companies took out mortgages totaling over US$34&amp;nbsp;million and purchased properties in central London.&lt;ref name=SalonClinton&gt;{{cite news |title=With Saudi and Russian ties, Clinton machine's tentacles are far reaching, according to Panama Papers |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=8 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502005935/http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the companies was not specified.

The vessel boasts a banquet hall and can comfortably sleep 30.&lt;ref name=Velite /&gt; King Salman is described in the documents as its "principal user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi King, UAE President at the Center of the Panama Papers |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |newspaper=[[TeleSUR]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024709/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Irish Times'' found a link to Iran-Contra in the Panama Papers, in the persons of one of America’s most colourful political donors Farhad Azima and multi-billionaire [[Adnan Khashoggi]], who both employed Mossack Fonseca’s services, and were both important figures in [[Iran-Contra]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/business/panama-papers-links-revealed-to-spies-and-iran-contra-affair-1.2599083&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mossack Fonseca files show Khashoggi appeared as early as 1978, when he became president of the Panamanian company ISIS Overseas S.A. The documents reveal that Fonseca’s clients included Sheikh [[Kamal Adham]], Saudi Arabia’s first intelligence chief (1963-79), brother-in-law of King Faisal, who was named by a US Senate committee as the CIA’s “principal liaison for the entire the Middle East from the mid-1960s through 1979”. Adham controlled offshore companies involved in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|B.C.C.I.]] banking sem as instruments for their official worcandal.&lt;ref name="goldf"&gt;Will Fitzgibbon and Nicolas Richter: [https://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/570e6affa1bb8d3c3495baf4 Panama Papers: CIA-Agents used companies from Panama] Operation Goldfinger, [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sri Lankan Finance Minister [[Ravi Karunanayake]] said his panel will investigate Sri Lankan names that come up in the Panama Papers, as well as the 46 who appear in the 2013 Offshore Leaks, according to the ''Daily Mail'', since earlier leadership apparently did not do so. The country has many large outstanding foreign loans taken out under the administration of former president [[Mahinda Rajapakse]], and the current government recently had to obtain a US$1.5 billion [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout. Rajapakse has denied diverting funds. The current government came to power in January 2016 on an anti-corruption platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka sets up panel to investigate 'Panama Papers' |date=May 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |author=AFP |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160726040317/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |archivedate=July 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria ====
[[Rami Makhlouf]], a maternal cousin of [[Bashar Al-Assad]], was worth an estimated $5 billion before the [[Syrian Civil War]], and had control of 60% of the economy.

==== Thailand ====
The ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' reported that the "[[Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand)|Anti-Money Laundering Office]] (AMLO) is seeking information from its foreign counterparts regarding twenty-one Thai nationals reportedly included in a list of people worldwide using a Panama-based law firm apparently specializing in money laundering and tax evasion." It is not clear why AMLO is investigating only twenty-one. The Panama Papers include at least 780 names of individuals based in Thailand and another 50 companies based in Thailand. Some are foreigners or foreign-owned companies, but 634 individual addresses in Thailand appear in the documents that have surfaced to date, including the CEOs of giant companies [[Bangkok Land]] and Phatra Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/920929/many-thais-implicated-in-global-scandal |title='Many' Thais implicated in global scandal |work=Bangkok Post |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations by ICIJ's sole [[East Asian]] partner ''CommonWealth Magazine'' in [[Taiwan]] found that at least 2,725 offshore companies had registered addresses in Taiwan.

The publisher concludes that: "Taiwanese companies and individuals are believed to be extensively using offshore shelters to avoid or evade taxes ... after scouring the Panama Papers documents that Mossack Fonseca has not been one of their main conduits. This time, it appears that big Taiwanese banks, law firms and accounting firms did not often use the services of Mossack Fonseca, which does not have a presence in Taiwan. The forty-six Taiwanese brokers that did work with Mossack Fonseca were relatively small-scale consulting firms operating in Greater China. Most of the Taiwanese entities that set up shell companies through the Panamanian law firm were small, unlisted companies or individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |title=CommonWealth Magazine |publisher=English.cw.com.tw |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531210910/http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |archivedate=May 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costa Rica ====
The administration of President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] suggested that some of the activity unveiled by the leaked documents suggests attempts to [[tax evasion|evade taxes]]. His administration's effort to implement tax increases and reforms has met strong resistance from opposition and business figures.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |title=Costa Rica in the Panama Papers leak |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233246/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents suggest that Mossack Fonseca helped tuna export company Borda Azul set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in order to avoid Costa Rican taxes. The firm, now out of business, was headed by Hermes Navarro, president of the [[Costa Rican Football Federation]] from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt; In the late 1990s the Finance Ministry and Prosecutor's Office investigated Borda Azul and other export companies for allegedly misusing tax credit certificates; in 1997 dozens of companies had been accused of using the certificates for fraud and to launder drug profits.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

According to ICIJ investigative partners DataBaseAR and Seminario Universidad, Mossack Fonseca helped Borda Azul fabricate invoices to allow it to report both inflated costs—to reduce its taxes—and inflated exports, to allow it to continue to qualify for the tax credit certificates. In a letter dated October 19, 1998, a Mossack Fonseca lawyer explained the investigation to the Panama City office and concluded:

{{Quote|In the worst of circumstances, being very fatalistic, the Costa Rican government could, after years of investigation, suspend the transfer of CATs to Borda Azul for irregularities but never send anyone to jail. |source=a Mossack Fonseca lawyer&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;}}

More than thirty Costa Rican law firms are mentioned in the Panama Papers as referring clients to Mossack Fonseca, resulting in the creation of more than 360 shell companies. in particular Gonzalo Fajardo &amp; Asociados, founded by former Finance Ministry official and later Economy Minister Gonzalo Fajardo Salas, and over nearly two decades helped Costa Rican companies set up 82 offshore corporations in tax havens, according to DataBaseAR.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

Finance Vice Minister Fernando Rodríguez said Costa Rica will push to sign a [[Tax Information Exchange Agreement]] with Panama.&lt;ref name=TTleg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |title=Panama Papers scandal cracks open window for Costa Rica tax reform |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |author=L.Arias |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233200/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators from several parties are trying to line up political consensus to seek approval of the administration's tax fraud bill and to form a legislative commission to investigate those named in the Panama Papers, according to [[Emilia Molina Cruz]] of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]].&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt; While opposition parties have maintained that the country's financial problems stem from excess spending, according to the Finance Department, the sums Costa Rica loses to tax evasion equal about 8% of the country's gross domestic product, while its deficits have run at about 6%.&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt;

===== Panama Free Trade Agreement =====

The [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Panama Free Trade Agreement]],&lt;!-- Majority of sources use phrase "Panama Free Trade Agreement --&gt; supported by Obama and Clinton, has been accused of enabling the practices detailed within the Panama Papers through regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mindock |first1=Clark |title=Panama Papers: Obama, Clinton Pushed Trade Deal Amid Warnings It Would Make Money Laundering, Tax Evasion Worse |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |work=International Business Times |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425114027/http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Obama administration official said the argument has "zero merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mauldin |first1=William |last2=Viswanatha |first2=Aruna |title=Sanders Says U.S. Helped Panama as a Tax Haven But Skips Over Tax Pact |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |accessdate=April 24, 2016 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423161258/http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cassidy of ''[[The New Yorker]],'' said the Panama Free Trade Agreement actually forced Panama to release information to the American regulatory authorities on "the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, and other persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |title=Panama Papers: Why Aren't There More American Names? |last=Cassidy |first=John |date=April 5, 2016 |newspaper=The New Yorker |issn=0028-792X |access-date=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424061651/http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- deleting eoin higgins again, no evidence he is anything other than some dude with an MA that isn't even in business, and I looked pretty hard.

Citing leaked diplomatic cables, ''Fortune'' writer Chris Matthews speculated that Obama and Clinton may have supported the agreement, after opposing it while campaigning for office, because it was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for Panamanian support of US efforts against drug trafficking. In any event, he notes, while it is true that the agreement abolished limits on fund transfers between the US and Panama, the Obama administration insisted that the two countries first sign a [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information and Exchange Agreement]] as well, which facilitated the exchange of tax information between the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |title=Panama Papers: Why Did Clinton and Obama Flip Flop on Trade with Panama |first=Chris |last=Matthews |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423073913/http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== After the leak =====

President Barack Obama addressed the overseas shell companies listed by the leak in a press conference: "It's not that they're breaking the laws," he said, "it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boland-Rudder |first1=Hamish |last2=Holmes |first2=Allan |last3=Chittum |first3=Ryan |title=Impact of Panama Papers rockets around the world; U.S. officials react cautiously |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034506/https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archivedate=2016-05-29 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=Center for Public Integrity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no leader in the US was mentioned in the Panama Papers, Obama said that "Frankly, folks in America are taking advantage of the same stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Revesz |first1=Rachael |title=Obama says Americans are doing the same Panama Papers tax avoidance as everyone else |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=The Independent |date=April 5, 2016 |location=New York, United States |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225248/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McClatchy Newspapers]] initially found four Americans with offshore shell companies named in the documents.

* Shell companies can be created in the United States.
* Major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands instead.
* US laws like the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) and the [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information Exchange Agreements]] (TIEAs) of 2010 have meant that the "tax evasion game [was] principally over for American taxpayers".

===== Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner =====
Daniel Muñoz, the private secretary and confidant of former Argentinian president [[Néstor Kirchner]] later also served for two years as an aide to Néstor Kirchner's wife, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], who was president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Muñoz and his wife were linked to Gold Black Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2010 to invest in US real estate. The origin of the company's funds was listed as "personal savings". From 2010 to the beginning of 2015, the company's ownership was through bearer shares, a financial instrument that can be used to hide an owner's identity. One of the directors, Sergio Tadisco, told ICIJ partner Canal Trece that he was just a figurehead who said he agreed to his name being used in 2011 because of his friendship with Muñoz and his wife. In January 2015, Muñoz and his wife became named shareholders, owning 50 percent each. By that time, Mossack Fonseca had become the registered agent of Gold Black. However, only three weeks later, its compliance department proposed resigning because Muñoz was identified in connection with the governments of the Kirchners. The resignation became effective in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|title=The Power Players|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404030817/https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|archivedate=April 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|title=Quién es Daniel Muñoz, el "valijero" de Kirchner {{!}} Revista Noticias|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907160557/http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|archivedate=September 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|title=Panama Papers: los Kirchner se desvincularon de la investigación sobre sociedades offshore|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002073628/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|archivedate=October 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Muñoz was investigated for illicit enrichment, a charge that was later dropped. In 2013, Argentinian media reported that Muñoz had helped transfer "bags of money" belonging to President Néstor Kirchner from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, to Santa Cruz, the Kirchner's home state. Charges in relation to the matter were dismissed in July 2015 for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |title=Un piloto confirmó los vuelos con dinero del secretario de Kirchner |last=Clarin.com |website=www.clarin.com |language=es |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012202312/https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |archivedate=October 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2016 he died from a cancer that he had for the last four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |title=Murió Daniel Muñoz, señalado como 'valijero' de Kirchner |work=Urgente24 |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013014101/https://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |archivedate=October 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
Five billionaires from Brazil, the sons of two Brazilian billionaires, and four former billionaire Brazilian families appear in the Panama Papers leak, according to [[Forbes]]. The Brazilian news website [[Universo Online|UOL]] has access to the leaked documents and has published an article and a list. Like many Panama Paper reports, their story cautions that some of the people mentioned in the documents may be doing nothing wrong: "In general there is nothing illegal per se in having an offshore company and in fact it is very common for an international business to set one up for transactions and joint ventures when they're doing business all over the world," said Brazil-based Marcello Hallake, a Brazil-based partner of the law firm [[Jones Day]].&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |title=Billionaires From Brazil And Mexico Named In The Panama Papers Leak |date=14 April 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Kerry Dolan |publisher=Forbes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422155920/http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three men ([[Marcel Herrmann Telles]], [[Carlos Alberto Sicupira]] and Jorge Felipe Lemann, son of their long-time business partner [[Jorge Paulo Lemann]], Brazil's richest man and a controlling shareholder of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]) set up three offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas tied to private equity firm [[3G]] and to beer firm Ambev, a unit of Anheuser-Busch Inbev, according to UOL. Two of the companies are no longer active and the men are no longer tied with the third. They told UOL the companies had been publicly disclosed and registered.

Police raided the [[São Paulo]] offices of Mossack Fonseca in January 2016, seeking records about offshore companies the firm opened for two former executives of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. ([[Petrobras]]) who were convicted in 2015 of corruption and money laundering. Police say the companies were used to hide illegally diverted funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |title=Panama Leak Involves Firm Probed in Petrobras Scandal — Energy Journal |author=Christopher Harder |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412041544/http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |archivedate=April 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Operation Car Wash =====
In January 2016, even before the Panama Papers were published, the Brazilian Federal Police, as part of a corruption investigation known as [[Operation Car Wash]], had already accused Mossack Fonseca's law firm of helping suspects create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. They alleged that the firm used a real estate company to help hide criminal proceeds from the scheme involving [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blankfeld |first1=Karen |title=Law Firm At Center of Panama Papers Leak Was Implicated In Brazil Corruption Scandal In January |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018055159/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |archivedate=October 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Impeachment ======
The leak complicated an already volatile political situation in Brazil, where a tanking economy had led to calls for the impeachment of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] amid many revelations of political corruption. As impeachment proceedings began, it became clear that the next two people in the order of succession have been implicated in the [[Petrobras]] scandal. According to ''[[O Estado de São Paulo]]'', a company belonging to [[Eduardo Cunha]], speaker of the lower house of the legislature and a leader of the impeachment drive, has surfaced in the Panama Papers.&lt;ref name=TTLatin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |title=Officials in Latin America linked to 'Panama Papers' |author=AFP |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233311/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseff herself is not mentioned in the papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |title=Dilma Rousseff, President of Brazil, Resists Calls for Her Resignation |publisher=New York Times |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Simon Romero |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416010838/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians from seven different political parties in Brazil were named as clients of Mossack Fonseca. Leaked files mention politicians from Brazil's largest party, the [[PMDB]], which broke away from President [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s coalition in 2016. Political figures from the [[PSDB]], the most prominent opposition party in the country, were also mentioned in the leaks, as well as others from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|PDT]], PP, PSB, PSD and the PTB parties. No politicians from [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Rousseff's party]] were mentioned in the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cascione |first1=Silvio |last2=Simon |first2=W |title=Brazil politicians linked to offshore companies in Panama leaks: paper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419084505/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Dutch journalists from the daily newspaper ''[[Trouw]]'' found evidence in the Panama Papers showing that [[TV Globo]] is cited "many times" in a money laundering investigation of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank]] which revealed that for years the media outlet conducted "irregular financial transactions" through tax havens in order to pay for broadcast rights for the [[Copa Libertadores]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html Brazilian Media Giant Globo Implicated in the Panama Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410094618/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html |date=April 10, 2016 }} by teleSUR (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice the requirement is widely ignored, and an investigation by African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) found examples in the leaked Mossack Fonseca documents of anonymous shell companies doing the sourcing. For a start, most of the DRC gold winds up in Dubai by way of Uganda. Dubai's $75 billion gold industry is regulated with a very light hand by the quasi-private [[Dubai Multi Commodities Centre]] (DMCC).&lt;ref name="Dgold" /&gt;

Citp was managed by Kane, a close friend of the president's chief of staff, Maixent Accrombessi, himself held in Paris and interrogated in August 2015. French officials wanted to ask Accrombessi about a contract between Marck and the Gabonese Ministry of the Interior for €7 million. The head of Marck, Philippe Belin, was also held and questioned.

[[File:Karim Wade.jpg|thumb|upright|Senegalese politician [[Karim Wade]] ]]
&lt;!-- this material draws heavily on the exclusive reporting of the French-language online news site Ouestaf as part of the year-long investigation of journalists world-wide into the data contained in the Panama Papers --&gt;
ICIJ partner Ouestaf.com was able to establish through the Panama Papers the existence of secret contracts between and [[DP World]] FZE (DP)and Mamadou Pouye, the [[bribery]] codefendant of [[Karim Wade]], son of former prime minister [[Abdoulaye Wade]]. This information was not available at their trial; Ouestaf confirmed their financial ties to the corporation for the first time during the Panama Papers investigation.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; &lt;!-- this material from Karim Wade article on French wikipedia start --&gt; Wade was sentenced in 2015 to a six-year prison term by the Cour de répression de l'enrichissement illicite (Crei), a specialized anti-corruption court.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Wade was accused of illegally amassing assets of more than $240 million; and his childhood friend Pouye was sentenced to five years for allegedly helping him.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Both denied wrongdoing and the United Nations and Amnesty International said their rights had been violated at trial.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Karim Wade And Mamadou Pouye Named In The Panama Papers Scandal! |url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409095013/http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal/ |archivedate=April 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouestaf's investigation did not address the legality of their trial. It did conclude that they had succeeded in tracing a payment to Pouye's oversea shell company from a subsidiary of DP.

Wade remains a member of the [[Senegalese Democratic Party]] (PDS) and is still the PDS candidate for the 2017 presidential election.&lt;!-- this material from Karim wade article on French wikipedia stop --&gt;

Mossack Fonseca documents show that Pouye owned three offshore companies, Seabury Inc, Regory Invest and Latvae Inc.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

* Through Seabury, a consulting contract worth €7.2 million with [[DP World]] materialized.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;
* A second contract for 2013–2015 was to focus on DP's African holdings, and would have paid Wade and Puye $3 million at signing;&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; however the pair were arrested.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

Seabury seems to have been set up solely for doing business with DP World. It was started in 2008, a year after Senegal signed a contract with DP World for rights to the container terminal at the [[Autonomous Port of Dakar]].&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; In April 2009 Wade became minister of international cooperation, of territorial development, air transport and infrastructure, which he remained until his father's defeat by [[Macky Sall]] in the 2012 election.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; Regory Invest acted as a Seabury subcontractor, receiving €65,000 euros a month, according to the documents.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

According to ''Ouestaf'' the documents make it clear that while Crei investigators were interested in the funds in Pouye's Monaco account, they did not know that their source was an offshore account he created himself.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; The two contracts prove that there was in fact a relationship between the defendants and [[DP World]]. Investigator Papa Alboury Ndao told the court in February{{when|date=May 2016}} that he had discovered two payments of $13 million each from a subsidiary of DP World FZE to a Singapore bank account belonging to Karim Wade. However the bank in Singapore refused to cooperate and Ndao was forced to drop that line of inquiry.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

===== Others =====
Mossack Fonseca opened several offshore companies for multinationals. For example: Anglogold, owner of Anglogold Investments Senegal Ltd et Anglogold Exploration Senegal Ltd (both based in the British Virgin Islands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529033915/https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archivedate=2016-05-29 |title=et sociétés offshore : sur la piste des fonds de Karim Wade? |author=ANCIR |work=#Panama Papers |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
{{See also|Mining in Sierra Leone|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306}}
The ICIJ investigation traces out many levels of offshore holdings in multiple countries related to the business dealings of [[Beny Steinmetz]], with many serious findings such as a request that Mossack Fonseca backdate the revocation of a power of attorney.&lt;ref name=NamStein&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |title=Sierra Leone's flawed diamond trade |author1=Khadija Sharife |author2=Silas Gbandia |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510111253/http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca records show that Sierra Leone diamond exporter Octea, based in the British Virgin Islands with the Steinmetz family as its beneficiaries, is wholly owned by Guernsey-based BSGR Resources, linked to a bribery scandal in Guinea. Foundations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, among them Nysco and Balda, own BSGR. In 2007, one of Nysco's bank accounts contained $27.7 million.

Steinmetz, who has a personal fortune of $6 billion, supplies diamonds to [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] and [[DeBeers]] and is Sierra Leone's largest private investor. Yet, according to a detailed report in ''The Namibian'', his Octea subsidiary owes, among other debts, property taxes of $700,000 to the city of [[Koidu]]. These unpaid taxes are discounted, according to mayor [[Saa Emerson Lamina]], because Octea promised a 5% profit−sharing agreement, and payment 1% of its annual profit to a community development fund, but it did not do this either.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Octea's subsidiary, Koidu Holdings, obtained the mine for $28 million, which was supposed to be a deposit, in 2002. Fighting had stopped in Sierra Leone, and the mine had previously been held and worked by South African firm Branch Energy, in payment for the services of its parent company, [[Executive Outcomes]], "effectively...a military battalion for hire,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |title=Diamond Hunters Fuel Africa's Brutal Wars |author=James Rupert |date=October 16, 1999 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510210155/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; against rebel fighters in the area. Steinmetz has since put $300 million into the project.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt;

According to reporting by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the company produces 60–90% of Sierra Leone's diamond exports, and in some months between 2012 and 2015 exported more than US$330 million in rough diamonds.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Octea owes US$150 million in unpaid loans.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Although government records show taxes paid by other diamond companies, none are listed for Octea.

The National Mineral Agency (NMA) until 2005 valued diamonds for export using a price book based on 1996 figures. Companies also often seek to minimize the value of their diamond exports to reduce taxes and move profits abroad. Once transferred to a subsidiary elsewhere where their value is not taxed, the same diamonds are frequently worth more.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Diamonds from Koidu average $330 a carat, roughly 50% more than De Beers's Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the world's biggest. Tiffany has first pick of some of the best stones mined at Koidu and the remainder are sold to other trade buyers, according to ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |title=Was Billionaire Steinmetz Betrayed by CEO Over Diamond Mine? |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |date=November 11, 2016 |author1=Thomas Biesheuvel |author2=Jesse Riseborough |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411202637/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |archivedate=April 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2016, Australia said it would create a public register showing the beneficial, or actual, owners of shell companies, as part of an effort to stamp out tax avoidance by multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |title=Australia to create public register of shell company owners, in wake of Panama Papers |publisher=South China Morning Post |date=April 22, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423193649/http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents examined by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] "pierced the veil of anonymous shell companies" and linked a Sydney businessman and a Brisbane geologist to mining deals in North Korea.&lt;ref name=ABCkor&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |title=Panama papers reveal evidence Australians are involved in deals with North Korea that could be in breach of sanctions |author1=Mark Willacy |author2=Lisa Main |author3=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=7.30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511224134/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rather than applying sanctions, the Australian Government and the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]] seem to have allowed a coach and horses to be ridden through them by the people involved in forming this relationship, corporate relationship with one of the primary arms manufacturers in North Korea," said Thomas Clark of the [[University of Technology Sydney]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

David Sutton was director of AAT Corporation and EHG Corporation when they held mineral licenses in North Korea and did business with Korean Natural Resources Development and Investment Corporation, which is under [[United Nations]] sanctions, and North Korea's "primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, responsible for approximately half of the arms exported by North Korea."&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; The geologist, Louis Schurmann, said British billionaire [[Kevin Leech]] was key to putting the deal together.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; Leaked documents also reveal the involvement of another Briton, Gibraltar-based John Lister.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; According to ABC, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] was aware of these mining deals, which had also been brought up in the [[Australian Senate]], but nobody ever referred the matter to the [[Australian Federal Police]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

On May 12, 2016, the names of former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and former [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Neville Wran]], were both found in the Panama Papers, due to the pair's former directorship of the Mossack Fonseca-incorporated company ''Star Technology Systems Limited''. Turnbull and Wran resigned from these positions in 1995, and the Prime Minister has denied any impropriety, stating "had [Star Technology] made any profits—which it did not regrettably—it certainly would have paid [[Taxation in Australia|tax in Australia]]."&lt;ref name="ABC Turnbull"&gt;{{cite web |title=Malcolm Turnbull denies any wrongdoing after being listed in Panama Papers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |accessdate=May 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512104823/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |archivedate=May 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
Media initially reported that the Panama Papers lists 500 entities created under the jurisdiction of the Cook Islands, population 10,000, almost as many as Singapore, whose population is 5.7 million.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt; After the [[Winebox Inquiry|Winebox affair]], the Cook Islands gave New Zealand jurisdiction over tax matters.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Panama Papers whistleblower cites Pacific isles, NZ, for good reasons |author=Simon Louisson |work=The Standard |url=http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |date=May 8, 2016 |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510031659/http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
New Zealand's [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] said that they were working to obtain details of people who have [[tax residence]] in the country who may have been involved in arrangements facilitated by Mossack Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |title=Tax authorities begin probes into some people named in Panama Papers leak |date=April 4, 2016 |first1=Jane |last1=Wardell |first2=Elida |last2=Moreno |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404020808/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gerard Ryle]], director of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], told Radio New Zealand on April 8, 2016 that New Zealand is a well-known tax haven and a "nice front for criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/78694086/nz-a-nice-front-for-criminals-panama-papers-journalist |title=NZ a 'nice front' for criminals |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand provides overseas investors with foreign trusts and [[Look-through company|look-through companies]]. New Zealand government policy is to not request disclosure of the identity of either the settlor or the beneficiaries of the trust, and thus the ownership remains secret, and as a consequence, thus hiding the assets from the trust-holder's home jurisdictions. These trusts are not taxed in New Zealand. These trusts can then be used to acquire and own New Zealand registered companies, which become a vehicle by which the trust owners can exercise day to day control over their assets. These New Zealand-registered companies can be designed not to make a profit using loans from tax havens and other profit shifting techniques: the result being tax free income with the general respectability that has typically been associated with companies registered in New Zealand.

Prime Minister [[John Key]] responded May 7 to [[John Doe (Panama Papers' whistleblower)|John Doe]]'s remark that he had been "curiously quiet" about tax evasion in the [[Cook Islands]] by saying that the whistleblower was confused and probably European. While the Cook Islands use New Zealand currency, "I have as much responsibility for tax in the Cook Islands as I do for taxing Russia." New Zealand does represent the Cook Islands on defence and foreign policy, but not taxation, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/79731038/panama-papers-whistleblower-calls-out-john-key-over-silence-on-fraud-mecca |title=Panama Papers whistleblower confused – John Key |author1=Tracy Watkins |author2=Ellen Read |author3=Simon Maude |date=May 7, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In distancing New Zealand from the Cook Islands, Key ignored the close ties between the two countries and the crucial role New Zealand had in setting up the Cook Island taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/8515361/Money-trail-leads-home-to-New-Zealand |title=Money trail leads home to New Zealand |work=Stuff |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Niue ====
Mossack Fonseca approached [[Niue]] in 1996 and offered to help set up a tax haven on the tiny South Sea island. The law firm drafted the necessary legislation, permitting offshore companies to operate in total secrecy. They took care of all the paperwork, the island got a modest fee for each filing, and it seemed like quite a deal, even if they were required by law now to provide all banking paperwork in Russian and Chinese as well as English.&lt;ref name=DBNiue&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |title=Polynesian 'Rock' That Made Millions From Panama Papers' Crooks: How Niue, a coral outcropping with just 1,190 residents, rolled out the welcome mat for Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the center of the massive records leak—and made a tidy profit |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2016 |author=Michael Daly |work=Daily Beast |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502191518/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon the filings almost covered the island's year budget. The US government however made official noises in 2001 about laundering criminal proceeds and [[Chase Bank]] blacklisted the island and [[Bank of New York]] followed suit. This caused inconvenience to the population so they let their contract with Mossack Fonseca expire and many of the privacy-seekers on the banking world moved on.&lt;ref name=DBNiue /&gt; Some did stay however, apparently; the Panama Papers database lists nearly 10,000 companies and trusts set up on Niue, population 1200.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt;

==== Samoa ====
Many recently created shell companies were set up in Samoa, perhaps after Niue revised its tax laws. The Panama Papers database lists more than 13,000 companies and trusts set up there. Samoa has a population of roughly 200,000.&lt;ref name=APNZ&gt;

== FIFA investigation ==
On May 27, 2015, the US Department of Justice indicted a number of companies and individuals for conspiracy, corruption and racketeering in connection with bribes and kickbacks paid to obtain media and marketing rights for FIFA tournaments. Some immediately entered guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417221705/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those indicted were [[Jeffrey Webb]] and [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], the current and former presidents of [[CONCACAF]], the continental confederation under FIFA headquartered in the United States. They were charged with racketeering and bribery offenses. Others were US and South American sports marketing executives who paid and agreed to pay well over $150 million in bribes and kickbacks.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

On December 12, 2014, [[José Hawilla]], the owner and founder of the [[Traffic Group]], the Brazilian sports marketing conglomerate, waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a four-count information charging him with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Hawilla also agreed to forfeit over $151 million, $25 million of which was paid at the time of his plea.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

'''''Quamut''''' is a collection of how-to guides launched in March 2008 by the bookstore chain [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]. The core line of guides are all editorially written but there is also a section of user-contributed [[wiki]] guides. ''Quamut'' is the [[Latin]] for "how-to" and is pronounced ''kwómut''.

Like its competitors  [[Google Knol]], [[Squidoo]], and [[WikiAnswers]], it generates revenue by the placement of relevant advertisement using Google's [[AdSense]] program. Additionally, ''Quamut'' guides are sold online as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]s, and a selection are available for purchase as laminated charts in Barnes &amp; Noble stores and from bn.com.

In August, 2009 Barnes &amp; Noble shut down ''Quamut'', though the [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/c/quamut print charts continue to be available].

In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing [[Tejano music]]—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for [[Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]] in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. Selena signed with [[Capitol Latin|EMI Latin]] in 1989 and released her [[Selena (album)|self-titled debut album]] the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter.

Selena released ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]'' (1992), which peaked at number one on the US ''Billboard'' [[Regional Mexican Albums]] chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the "breakthrough" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, "[[Como la Flor]]", became one of her most popular [[signature song]]s. ''[[Selena Live!|Live!]]'' (1993) won [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/American Album]] at the [[35th Grammy Awards|1994 Grammy Awards]], becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, Selena released ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'', which became one of the [[List of best-selling Latin albums in the United States|best-selling Latin albums in the United States]]. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] subgenres at the time. ''Amor Prohibido'' has been ranked among the most essential Latin recordings of the past 50 years by ''Billboard'' magazine while the publication nominated it for its list of the top 100 albums of all-time. It ranked number 19 on [[NPR]]'s list of the 150 greatest albums made by women.

Aside from music, Selena was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. Coca-Cola appointed her its spokesperson in Texas. Selena became a sex icon; she was often criticized for wearing suggestive outfits in light of her comments about being a role model for young women. Selena and her guitarist, [[Chris Pérez]], eloped in April 1992 after her father raised concerns over their relationship. On March 31, 1995, Selena was [[Murder of Selena|shot and killed]] by [[Yolanda Saldívar]], her friend and former manager of her [[Selena Etc.|Selena Etc. boutiques]]. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee, and threatened to kill herself, but was convinced to give herself up and was sentenced to life in prison with a possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks later, [[George W. Bush]]—governor of Texas at the time—declared Selena's birthday Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous [[crossover (music)|crossover]] album, ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995), debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],  making Selena the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat.  In 1997, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'', a film about her life and career, which starred [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Selena and [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as Saldívar. {{As of|2015}}, Selena has sold over 65 million albums worldwide, making her the best-selling [[Women in Latin music|female artist in Latin music history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selena Quintanilla's Walk of Fame Star Ceremony Attracts Record Crowd in Hollywood|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8023165/selena-quintanilla-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-ceremony|website=''Billboard.com''|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Murder of Selena|Trial of Yolanda Saldívar}}
The Quintanilla family appointed Yolanda Saldívar as manager of Selena's boutiques in early 1994.&lt;ref name=orlando /&gt; Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her [[registered agent]] in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}} In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=182}} According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she personally disliked.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar's behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena's fashion venture.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} According to Quintanilla, Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar's behavior. Quintanilla, Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to "be careful" and said Saldívar may not be a good influence.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} Selena dismissed her father's inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} By January 1995, Selena's fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients expressed their concerns over Saldívar's behavior and management skills.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}}{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=171}} During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}}

According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995 he began receiving telephone calls from fans who said they had paid for membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liebrum|first1=Jennifer|last2=Jamieson|first2=Wendell|title=Selena's Killer Gets 30 Years|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/selena-killer-30-years-article-1.703778|website=NY Daily News|language=en|date=October 27, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at [[Q-Productions]] to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential to the success of the clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}

In the days before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank statements and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico.&lt;ref name="queen" /&gt; Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey.{{efn|Testimony given by nurse Carla Anthony at the Saldívar trial indicated that Saldívar and Selena's visit to her clinic occurred March 24, not March 31.&lt;ref name="Rape"&gt;{{cite news|title=October 12, 1995 testimony of Carla Anthony |url=http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html |access-date=September 27, 2015 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=October 12, 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406191637/http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The predominance of other sources indicate that Nurse Anthony is mistaken.}} During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this did not include a gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Rape"&gt;{{cite news|title=October 12, 1995 testimony of Carla Anthony |url=http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html |access-date=September 27, 2015 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=October 12, 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406191637/http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Selena again met with Saldívar in her hotel room at the [[Days Inn]] in Corpus Christi.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt; At the hotel, Selena demanded the financial papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">'''TIME-ITEM''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of ''Topics'' that describes the content of undergraduate [[medical education]].  TIME is an acronym for "Topics for Indexing Medical Education"; ITEM is an acronym for "Index de thèmes pour l’éducation médicale."  Version 1.0 of the taxonomy has been released and the [[web application]] that allows users to work with it is still under development.  Its developers are seeking more collaborators to expand and validate the taxonomy and to guide future development of the web application.

== History ==

The development of TIME-ITEM began at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 2006.  It was initially developed to act as a content [[Index (publishing)|index]] for a [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum map]] being constructed there.  After its initial presentation at the 2006 conference of the [http://www.came-acem.ca/ Canadian Association for Medical Education],&lt;ref&gt;Willett T &amp; Clarke M. A Map of Medical Concepts: A General-use Database for Applications in Medical Education.  AFMC Resource Group on Medical Informatics Reception.  At the Canadian Association for Medical Education Conference (May 2006) London, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; early collaborators included the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McMaster University]] and [[Queen's University]].

== Features ==

The TIME-ITEM ontology is unique in that it is designed specifically for undergraduate medical education.  As such, it includes fewer strictly biomedical entries than other common medical [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabularies]] (such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] or [[SNOMED CT]]) but more entries relating to the medico-social concepts of communication, collaboration, professionalism, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willett | first1 = TG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = KC. | last3 = Broudo | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = M. | title = It's about TIME: a general-purpose taxonomy of subjects in medical education | journal = Med Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–8 |date=Apr 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03012.x | pmid = 18298447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics within TIME-ITEM are arranged poly-[[Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchically]], meaning any Topic can have more than one [[Tree (data structure)|parent]].  Relationships are established based on the logic that learning about a Topic contributes to the learning of all its parent Topics. 

In addition to housing the ontology of Topics, the TIME-ITEM web application can house multiple [[Curriculum framework|Outcome frameworks]].  All [[Outcome-based education|Outcomes]], whether private Outcomes entered by single institutions or publicly available medical education Outcomes (such as [[CanMeds 2005]]) are hierarchically linked to one or more Topics in the ontology.  In this way, the contribution of each Topic to multiple Outcomes is made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Willett TG, Marshall KC, Broudo M &amp; Clarke M.  TIME as a generic index for outcome-based medical education.  ''Medical Teacher'' 2008; 29(7):655-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the [[XML]] documents exported from TIME-ITEM (which contain the hierarchy of Outcomes and TIME-ITEM Topics) is being developed alongside the [http://www.medbiq.org MedBiquitous] Competency standards.  

The taxonomy currently exists in English only but translation to Canadian French is in progress.

== Applications ==

TIME-ITEM is intended to be a general-use ontology for medical [[Education Informatics|education informatics]].  It has two primary potential applications:
# Inclusion in [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum maps]].  By mapping learning objects or sessions to TIME-ITEM Topics in a curriculum map, the map becomes searchable for both granular and broad concepts.  If one or more Outcome frameworks are included with the Topic ontology, then the contribution of each curricular element to one or more Outcomes is made explicit.  This also facilitates curriculum [[evaluation]] in terms of one or more outcome frameworks.
# Indexing learning, assessment and portfolio objects.  Metatagging [[learning object]]s or [[assessment objects]] with a controlled vocabulary enhances the organization and retrieval of objects from a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]].  Metatagging [[electronic portfolio]] entries allows one to show how multiple entries "add up" to a demonstration of competence with respect to certain educational outcomes.

The possibility of expanding or modifying TIME-ITEM for use in postgraduate/continuing medical education and in nursing education is currently being explored.

'''The [[Gay Straight Alliance]] [[Bermuda]] (GSA Bermuda)''' is a support and advocacy group for persons in the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[queer]]/[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] [[LGBT community]]. It was founded by Jordan Ess in 2013. Jordan Ess is a [[Hedge Fund]] Trader, [[Consultant]], [[lobbying]] professional and [[Human Rights]]. The group was founded to address the needs of the [[LGBTQ community]] in the Island of [[Bermuda]] but it also engages in advocacy activities in persons in the [[LGBTQ community]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsabermuda.org/gsabermuda|title=GSA Bermuda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2010/03/11/iran-or318-memorial-to-blogger-death-in-priso/|title=Juliana Rincon Parra (March 11, 2010). “Iran: Or318 memorial to blogger’s death in prison”|work=Global voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Objective==
The [[Gay Straight Alliance]] Bermuda was founded on October 25, 2013. It was a break out group from the Rainbow Alliance. It branched out to get more work done as a result of enough not being done by the rainbow alliance. It was set up primarily as a lobby group, sending out emails and  letters and publishing articles in order to influence policies and public opinion. It has a blog which is run by the founder Jordan Ess which he uses to promote the group’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20131025/news/131029780|title=Ceola Wilson (October 2015 2013). “Gay rights campaigner forms advocacy group”|work=The Royal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven network for members of the [[LGBTQ community]] and for all other persons being discriminated against in any way. It has a large presence of non-gay volunteers and anonymous financial partners.

==Current and Recent Issues==

===Hotline dedicated to persons in the LGBTQ COMMUNITY===
In response to a 2016 article written by the [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|Royal Gazette]], the need for support services for young person’s dealing with [[sexual identity]] issues in Bermuda was addressed, the Gay Straight Alliance Bermuda have set plans in motion to set up a telephone hotline to help young people dealing with sexual identity issues in [[Bermuda]]. In an interview with the [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|Royal Gazette]], GSA founder Jordan Ess said: “There are sufficient crisis services available on the island to meet demand. Our goal in creating a help desk for LGBTQ youth, especially, is to deal not with emergency situations but with coping skills and life strategies to handle issues that LGBTQ youth may face, like parental disapproval, [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]]”.
“Other people who may be concerned or dealing with their child being LGBTQ or simply other people in the community [will be] welcome to call as well on LGBTQ-related matters.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsabermuda.org/gsabermuda/2016/02/23/royal-gazette-article-on-the-gsa/|title=Royal Gazette Article on the GSA|work=GSA Bermuda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy for Same Sex Marriage===
On February 9, 2016, members of the LGBTQ community came to stand against hundreds of members of Preserve Marriage, a group dedicated to preserving the virtues of traditional marriage held a demonstration on the grounds of the Cabinet Building of the government of [[Bermuda]] where they submitted their objectives against [[civil union]]s and [[same-sex marriage]]. The major goal of their protest was to oppose the rights of same-sex couples to raise kids. Jordan Ess, founder of the Gay Straight Alliance Bermuda was also present to lend support to the LGBTQ community. Saying, “I am for every human being having human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160210/NEWS/160219988|title=Same-sex marriage issue stirs passions|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160204/NEWS/160209829|title=Group calls for same-sex marriage referendum|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160304/NEWS01/160309833|title=Dunkley: Why we called marriage referendum|work=The royal gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental and public response to gay rights in Bermuda===
In 1944, [[homosexuality]] was decriminalized by the government of [[Bermuda]] but since then, no further action has been taken to prevent discrimination of persons in this group with discrimination based on [[gender identity]] issues not criminalized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-bermuda/|title=Gay Life in Bermuda|work=The Global gayz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On recent response to gay rights, the [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermudian parliament]] recently called for a referendum on the marriage rights of persons in the LGBTQ community and with a poll conducted by the Royal Gazette in 2015 showing that 44% of Bermudans were against same-sex marriage and 48% for it, it leaves one guessing as to what will be the result of the referendum due to be debated on in a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20160304/NEWS01/160309833|title=Dunkley: Why we called marriage referendum|work=The Royal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Amongst the challenges being encountered by the gay straight alliance Bermuda include insufficient staff strength and funds to carry out some of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsabermuda.org/gsabermuda/2016/02/20/we-need-you-volunteer-with-us/|title=We need you!

'''''The Principal''''' is a 1987 [[crime-thriller|crime thriller]] [[action film]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] and [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] It was written by Frank Deese and directed by [[Christopher Cain]]. It was filmed in [[Oakland, California]] and distributed by [[TriStar Pictures]] on [[Panavision]]. Belushi reprised his role as Rick Latimer in the 1990 film ''[[Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe]]''.

==Plot==
Rick Latimer ([[Jim Belushi]]) is a high-school teacher with a drinking problem. Spotting his ex-wife Kimberly ([[Sharon Thomas|Sharon Thomas Cain]]) in a bar one night, Rick gets into a fight with the man she is with, culminating in his beating the hapless man's car with a baseball bat.

The board of education finds that Rick's behavior is reflecting poorly on the school district's image. They unanimously decide to transfer him to another school, in another district: Brandel High, a crime-ridden and gang-dominated institution, where he is made the new principal.

Believing he can repair his image by cleaning up the school, Rick attempts to have an assembly to declare his intentions: "No more." No more drugs, running in the hallways or being late to class. While he's giving his speech, Victor Duncan ([[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]]), the leader of the main gang in the school, walks in, derides Rick in front of everyone, then walks out, which eventually results in a small riot, which earns Rick the enmity of not only the teachers but also school head of security Jake ([[Lou Gossett Jr.]]).

Eventually, Rick manages to enforce his policy of getting rid of the drugs being dealt in the bathrooms and clearing out the hallways — but not always with success. Because the students are now forced to go to class, some of the more unruly students become increasingly disruptive, including White Zac ([[J.J. Cohen]]), who eventually attempts to [[rape]] one of the teachers, Ms. Orozco ([[Rae Dawn Chong]]), with whom Rick is beginning to form a close friendship.

Victor, meanwhile, continues to assert his influence on the school, going so far as to brutally beat a former member of his gang and hang him by his ankles when the member warms to Rick and actually starts learning. The clash between Rick and Victor eventually leads to a showdown in the school halls, where Jake is temporarily locked inside a supply closet while Victor and his gang hunt Rick down. In the end, Victor and Rick fight each other with their fists, with Victor seemingly having the upper hand until Rick overpowers him.

Rick beats Victor, much to the shock of the rest of the school who witness the beating. Several students cheer Rick on, much to the chagrin of Victor's gang members. After a small fight breaks out Rick again declares, "No more!" Victor is taken away in a police car, and as a student derisively asks, "Hey man, who the hell do you think you are?", Rick responds "I'm the principal, man!" and rides away on his motorcycle.

All three completed their medical studies and each of them was the first woman from their respective countries to obtain a degree in Western medicine.]]
This is a '''timeline of women's education'''.

== 11th century ==

* Italy: allegedly the University of Bologna,  the first university in the Western world, allows women to study, earn degrees and teach since its foundation in 1088.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unibo.it/en/university/who-we-are/our-history/famous-people-guests-illustrious-students|title=Famous people, guests and illustrious students  - University of Bologna|website=www.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205145127/http://www.unibo.it/en/university/who-we-are/our-history/famous-people-guests-illustrious-students|archivedate=2017-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 13th century ==
'''1237'''

* Italy: Bettisia [[Bettisia Gozzadini|Gozzadini]] earns a law degree at the University of Bologna. 

'''1239'''

* Italy: Bettisia [[Bettisia Gozzadini|Gozzadini]] teaches Law at the University of Bologna. First woman believed to teach at a university (first university established in 1088).

== 14th century ==

* Italy: Dorotea [[Dorotea Bucca|Bucca]] holds a chair of medicine and philosophy in the university of Bologna for 40 years from 1390.

* Italy: Novella [[Novella d'Andrea|d'Andrea]] teaches Law at the University of Bologna.

== 15th century ==

* Poland: queen Sophie establishes first school for girls in Cracow. 

== 16th century ==

* Spain: Luisa de [[Luisa de Medrano|Medrano]] teaches at the University of Salamanca and writes works of philosophy, now lost.

* Spain: Isabella   [[Isabella Losa|Losa]]   gets a D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) theology degree.

* Spain: Francisca de [[Francisca de Lebrija|Lebrija]] teaches rhetorics at a University of Alcala.

* Spain: Beatriz [[Beatriz Galindo|Galindo]] excels in Latin, studies at one of the institutions dependent on the University of Salamanca, writes commentary on Aristotle and becomes a teacher of the queen. Married, has five children.

==17th century==
'''1608'''
* Spain: [[Juliana Morell]], a Spanish woman, earns a Law doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Juliana Morell|Herbermann, Charles, ed. (1913). "Juliana Morell". Catholic Encyclopedia. Robert Appleton Company.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul F. Grendler 1988 328"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul F.

O'Malley|publisher=Center for Information Research|year=1988|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lope de Vega, she taught "all the sciences from professorial chairs".

'''1636'''
* Netherlands: German-born Dutch [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], proficient in 14 languages, studied as the first female student at the university of Utrecht, Netherlands, but without obtaining a degree.

'''1639'''
* Acadia: The French colony of [[Acadia]], which at the time included part of Maine, had an Ursuline boarding school by 1639 that was geared toward the education of young girls. The school was founded in Quebec City and is still in operation today, though this part of Canada no longer includes the part of Maine that it once did.

'''1644'''
* Sweden: first female college students, Ursula Agricola and [[Maria Jonae Palmgren]].

'''1674'''
*  New Spain: In this year Bishop Calderon of Santiago wrote to Queen Mother Marie Anne of Spain concerning the Spanish efforts at colonizing Florida. In his letter he included some comments about the state of education and stated, "The children, both male and female, go to church on work days, to a religious school where they are taught by a teacher whom they call ''Athequi'' of the church; [a person] whom the priests have for this service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/documentsofameri00elli#page/22/mode/2up|title=Ellis, John Tracy. Documents of American Catholic History. 1962. Milwaukee, WI: Bruce Publishing Company. p. 22-23.|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description indicates that the colonies of New Spain had facilities for female education at least by the 1600s. It is not clear how far back this goes; the 1512 laws of Burgos, from over a hundred years earlier, did not specify whether instruction should be for males only: it uses the word ''hijos'', which means sons, but can include daughters if they are mixed in with the boys.

'''1678'''
* Italy: [[Elena Cornaro Piscopia]], an Italian woman, earns a Ph.D. - [[Philosophy doctorate]] degree from the University of Padua in Italy&lt;ref name="Paul F.

'''1685'''
* Italy: Saint Rosa Venerini opens the first gratuitous school for girls in Italy, in the town of Viterbe.

==18th century==
'''1727'''
* United States: Founded in 1727 by [[Ursulines|the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula]], [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy, New Orleans]], is both the oldest continuously operating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States. The Ursuline Sisters founded this school out of the conviction that the education of women was essential to the development of a civilized, spiritual and just society, and has influenced culture and learning in New Orleans by providing an exceptional education for its women.

'''1732'''

'''1742'''
* United States: At only 16&amp;nbsp;years of age, Countess Benigna von Zinzendorf established the first all-girls boarding school in America, sponsored by her father Count Nicholas von Zinzendorf. Originally known as the Bethlehem Female Seminary upon its 1742 founding, it changed its name to Moravian Seminary and College for Women by 1913. 1863 proved the Germantown, Pennsylvania-based school’s most landmark year, however, when the state recognized it as a college and granted it permission to reward bachelor's degrees. As a result, most tend to accept Moravian as the oldest—though not continuously operational because of its current co-ed status—specifically female institute of higher learning in the United States.&lt;ref name="thenewagenda1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewagenda.net/2011/07/28/11-momentous-female-firsts-in-academia/#more-31148 |title=Blog Archive » 11 Momentous Female Firsts in Academia |publisher=The New Agenda |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318113432/http://www.thenewagenda.net/2011/07/28/11-momentous-female-firsts-in-academia/#more-31148 |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title&amp;nbsp;IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh.

The '''University of Greenland''' ({{lang-kl|Ilisimatusarfik}}; {{lang-da|Grønlands Universitet}}) is [[Greenland]]'s only [[university]]. It is in the capital city of [[Nuuk]]. Most courses are taught in [[Danish language|Danish]], a few in [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] and classes by exchange lecturers often in [[English language|English]].

The university had an enrollment of approximately 650 students in 2015, composed of mostly Greenlandic inhabitants. It has around fourteen academic staff and five technical-administrative employees.&lt;ref name=statistic&gt;[http://www.ilisimatusarfik.gl/Home/OmIlisimatusarfik/tabid/60/Default.aspx About the University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928222948/http://www.ilisimatusarfik.gl/Home/OmIlisimatusarfik/tabid/60/Default.aspx |date=2007-09-28 }}. "ca. 150 studenter; 14 lærere foruden rektor samt 5 teknisk-administrativt ansatte."&lt;/ref&gt; The modest student population is due in part to the government's policy allowing students a free university education anywhere in Europe or North America, with most Greenlandic students going to university in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchronicle.com%2Fche-data%2Farticles.dir%2Fart-42.dir%2Fissue-49.dir%2F49a04001.htm |title=Modest University Aims to Serve Greenland's Particular Needs |author=Kim A.

==History==
The University of Greenland was established in 1987 to provide local [[higher education]] for Greenland. It was originally located in the former [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] mission station of [[Neu Herrnhut]], and moved into a dedicated research complex, Ilimmarfik, in 2009. The university has a [[Danish krone|DKK]] 14.8 million budget. {{Cn|date=May 2016}}

== Institutes ==
[[File:Ilimmarfik.jpg|thumb|right|''Ilimmarfik'' university Campus in [[Nuuk]]]]
The university has four institutes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uarctic.org/formsOnOrgs.aspx?m=392&amp;CompanyID=32 |title=Member survey report for: Ilisimatusarfik/University of Greenland |publisher=uarctic |accessdate=2007-12-03 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Institute of Learning
* Institute of Nursing and Health Science
* Institute of Social Science, Economics and Journalism
* Institute of Culture, Language and History

The university awards [[Baccalaureate degree]]s in all departments and [[Master's Degree]]s in all areas except Theology. Ph.D.-programmes have been offered and at the moment five students are taking the degree.

==Rector==
[[Tine Pars]] became director of Ilisimatusarfik at the beginning of 2009 after the former rector, Ole Marquardt, resigned in protest on the new University Law in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://sermitsiaqag.wordpress.com/2007/11/15/rektorer-kvitter-jobbet-i-protest/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guest faculty==
Due to the small number of faculty, many specialized classes are offered by guest faculty, often coming from Danish universities, but also coming from other countries. 
Guest faculty at Ilisimatusarfik are often specialists for research on Greenland, combining teaching at Ilisimatusarfik with their research while staying on Greenland.

== Library ==
The university library holds approximately 30,000 volumes.

'''Winifred Gertrude Helmes''' (March 6, 1913 – July 24, 2005) was an American educator, historian, public servant, and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Helmes, Dr. Winifred G.|url=http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/6077497/?fullname=helmes,-dr-winifred-g|website=Star Tribune|publisher=Minnesota Star Tribune|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Helmes graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] where she earned her Bachelor of Science, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees. Her doctoral dissertation, published by the University Minnesota Press in 1949, was a political biography of former Minnesota governor [[John Albert Johnson]]. Helmes taught history at the University of Minnesota and at Louisiana State University as a teaching assistant. She became a member of the faculty at Bradford Junior College in Massachusetts in 1943 where she taught history and directed a bi-weekly radio program for the college. It was at Bradford that Helmes met her lifelong friend, [[Bertha Adkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisbury.edu/library/archives/docs/SUA-022_Winifred%20Helmes.pdf Winifred Helmes Papers], Nabb Research Center (Salisbury University), Salisbury, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Helmes joined the executive staff of the [[American Association of University Women]] and directed its Status of Women program. Even after leaving the executive staff in 1954, she remained active with the AAUW as a member of the Maryland State Division Board, President of the Salisbury branch, and membership on the Educational Foundation, Communications Advisory, and Bertha Adkins Fellowship Committees.

In 1954 she became Assistant Director of the [[United States Women's Bureau]]. For three years she was a member of the Secretary of Labor's special staff to develop the department's Manpower Program, writing articles about "womanpower" and touring the country to speak to various women's organizations. In October 1959, she was appointed Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of [[Health, Education and Welfare]], Bertha Adkins. In this position, she worked primarily in the area of public affairs, particularly in connection with the Under-Secretary's official relations with educational institutions, national organizations, and other groups. She also served as liaison with various agencies of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

From 1961 to 1967, Helmes served as Academic Dean at the [[Foxcroft School]] in Middleburg, Virginia under the school's new Head, Bertha Adkins, and at the [[Samuel Ready School]] in Baltimore, Maryland from 1967 to 1968. In 1968 she joined the faculty of Salisbury State College (now [[Salisbury University]]) as Associate Professor of History. She introduced the school's first courses on the history of women and, beginning in 1973, initiated and organized three annual Eastern Shore Conferences on Women. Helmes received a grant from the Maryland Bicentennial Commission to edit ''Notable Maryland Women'', in addition to directing a two-year project involving Maryland AAUW branches that led to ''Who's Who of Maryland Women, 1930-1976'', ''Baltimore County Women, 1930-1975'', and ''Who's Who of Wicomico Women, 1930-1976''. Helmes retired from teaching in 1981.

Helmes received an honorary LL.D. degree from [[Hobart and William Smith College]] in 1958. She was a national consultant for the Women's Archives at Radcliffe College (now the [[Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]]). She also served on both the Virginia and Maryland Commissions on the Status of Women, as well as the Maryland Humanities Council.

She was the author of the book ''Orchids in the Icebox: The Story of Bertha Adkins and Other Influential Women in the Eisenhower Administration,'' which was published by Chapel Hill Press in 2002.

'''Xi'an Polytechnic University''' ({{zh|s=西安工程大学|p=Xī'ān Gōngchéng Dàxué}}) is a college located in [[Xi'an]], in the [[Shaanxi]] [[Province (China)|province]], [[China]].

== History ==
Xi'an Polytechnic University enjoys a long history which can be traced back to 1912 when it was the Weaving Division of the Beijing Higher Industrial School. The school was approved in 1978 to set up the Northwest Textile Institute, one of the three national institutions controlled directly by the national Ministry of Textiles. In 1998, control transferred to the Shaanxi Province Ministry of Education, and the name of the school was changed to Xi'an Polytechnic University in 2001.
