'''Anglo-Irish''' ({{Lang-ga|Angla-Éireannach}}) is a term which was more commonly used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to identify a [[social class]] in [[Ireland]], whose members are mostly the descendants and successors of the [[English people|English]] [[Protestant Ascendancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish ''The Anglo-Irish'', Fidelma Maguire, University College Cork] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502065641/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish |date=2 May 2006 }} and [[Donnchadh Ó Corráin]]&lt;/ref&gt; They mostly belong to the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]], which was the [[established church]] of Ireland until 1871, or to a lesser extent one of the [[English Dissenters|English dissenting]] churches, such as the [[Methodism|Methodist church]], though some were also Catholic. Its members tended to follow English practices in matters of [[English culture|culture]], [[science]], [[law]], [[agriculture]] and [[politics]] but often defined themselves as simply "Irish" or "British", and rarely "Anglo-Irish" or "English".&lt;ref name="Irish"/&gt; Many became eminent as administrators in the [[British Empire]] and as senior [[Irish military diaspora#Britain|army and naval officers]]. Others were prominent [[Irish nationalists]].

The term is not usually applied to [[Presbyterians]] in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]], whose ancestry is mostly [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scottish]], rather than English or Irish, and who are sometimes identified as [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]].  The Anglo-Irish held a wide range of political views, with some being outspoken [[Irish Nationalists]], but most overall being [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]]. And while many of the Anglo-Irish were part of the [[English diaspora]] in Ireland, some were of native Irish origin in part and Catholic but had converted to Anglicanism.&lt;ref name ="Wolff"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Anarchy in the Mind and in the Heart: Narrating Anglo-Ireland|last=Wolff|first=Ellen M.|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYFLR2jsDnMC&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Bucknell University Press|place=Lewisburg |page=37|isbn=0838755569|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Irish social class ==
{{See also|Protestant Ascendancy}}

The term "Anglo-Irish" is often applied to the members of the [[Church of Ireland]] who made up the professional and landed class in Ireland from the 17th century up to the time of Irish independence in the early 20th century.  In the [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|course of the 17th century]], this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the [[Gaelic Aristocracy|Gaelic Irish]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland.  They were also referred to as "'''New English'''" to distinguish them from the "[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]", who descended from the medieval [[Hiberno-Normans|Hiberno-Norman]] settlers.

A larger but less socially prominent element of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Irish population were immigrant French [[Huguenot]]s and the English and Scottish [[Nonconformism|dissenters]] who settled in Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries in the plantation period. Many of these, especially the Scots-Irish or their descendants, emigrated to the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], particularly in the eighteenth century before the American Revolutionary War.

Under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which were in force between the 17th and 19th centuries (although enforced with varying degrees of severity), [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Recusancy|recusants]] in Great Britain and Ireland were barred from holding public office, while in Ireland they were also barred from entry to the [[Trinity College, Dublin|University of Dublin]] and from professions such as law, medicine, and the military. The lands of the recusant Roman Catholic [[landed gentry]] who refused to take the prescribed oaths were largely confiscated during the [[Plantations of Ireland]]. The rights of Roman Catholics to inherit landed property were severely restricted. Those who converted to the Church of Ireland were usually able to keep or regain their lost property, as the issue was considered primarily one of allegiance. In the late 18th century, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in Dublin won legislative independence, and the movement for the repeal of the [[Test Acts]] began.

[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Marble bust of [[The Very Reverend|The V. Rev.]] [[Jonathan Swift]], inside [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Dublin]].  Swift was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of St Patrick's from 1713 to 1745.]]

Not all Anglo-Irish people could trace their origins to the Protestant English settlers of the Cromwellian period; some were of Welsh stock, and others descended from Old English or even native Gaelic converts to Anglicanism.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; Members of this ruling class commonly identified themselves as Irish,&lt;ref name="Irish"&gt;[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish ''The Anglo-Irish'', Movements for Political &amp; Social Reform, 1870–1914, Multitext Projects in Irish History, University College Cork] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502065641/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish |date=2 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining English habits in politics, commerce, and culture. They participated in the popular English sports of the day, particularly [[horse racing|racing]] and [[fox hunting]], and intermarried with the ruling classes in Great Britain. Many of the more successful of them spent much of their careers either in Great Britain or in some part of the [[British Empire]]. Many constructed large [[country house]]s, which became known in Ireland as [[Anglo-Irish big house|Big Houses]], and these became symbolic of the class' dominance in Irish society.

The Dublin working class playwright [[Brendan Behan]], a staunch [[Irish Republicanism|Irish Republican]], saw the Anglo-Irish as Ireland's [[The Theory of the Leisure Class|leisure class]] and famously defined an Anglo-Irishman as "a Protestant with a horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|'''Pat''': He was an Anglo-Irishman.&lt;br&gt;
'''Meg''': In the name of God, what's that?&lt;br&gt;
'''Pat''': A Protestant with a horse.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ropeen''': Leadbetter.&lt;br&gt;
'''Pat''': No, no, an ordinary Protestant like Leadbetter, the plumber in the back parlour next door, won't do, nor a [[Belfast]] [[Orange Institution|orangeman]], not if he was as black as your boot.&lt;br&gt;
'''Meg''': Why not?&lt;br&gt;
'''Pat''': Because they work.  An Anglo-Irishman only works at riding horses, drinking whiskey, and reading double-meaning books in [[Irish language|Irish]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].|From act one of ''The Hostage'', 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Irish novelist and short story writer [[Elizabeth Bowen]] memorably described her experience as feeling "English in Ireland, Irish in England" and not accepted fully as belonging to either.&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;Paul Poplowski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1OpUU_ShWvsC&amp;pg=PA27 "Elizabeth Bowen (1899-1973),"] ''Encyclopedia of Literary Modernism'', (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2003), pp. 26–28. {{ISBN|0-313-31017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their prominence in the military and their conservative politics, the Anglo-Irish have been compared to the [[Prussian Junker]] class by, among others, [[Correlli Barnett]].&lt;ref&gt;"Roberts, Kitchener and Wolesley were three national heroes of the nineteenth century whom Correlli Barnett sees as prime examples of the Anglo-Irish gentry, "the nearest thing Britain ever possessed to the Prussian Junker class". Desmond and Jean Bowen, ''Heroic Option: the Irish in the British Army'', Pen &amp; Sword, Barnsley, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business interests===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Anglo-Irish owned many of the major indigenous businesses in Ireland, such as [[Jacob's|Jacob's Biscuits]], [[Bewley's]], [[Beamish and Crawford]], [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson's Whiskey]], [[Odlums Group|W. P. &amp; R. Odlum]], [[Condensed Milk Company of Ireland|Cleeve's]], [[R&amp;H Hall]], [[Crawford McCullagh|Maguire &amp; Patterson]], [[Maurice Dockrell (1850–1929)|Dockrell's]], [[Arnotts (Ireland)|Arnott's]], [[Goulding Chemicals]], the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the Irish Railways, and the [[Guinness brewery]], Ireland's largest employer. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} They also controlled financial companies such as the [[Bank of Ireland]] and [[Goodbody Stockbrokers]].

Salmon was provost of Trinity from 1888 until his death.]]

===Prominent members===
Prominent Anglo-Irish poets, writers, and playwrights include [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[George Darley]], [[Bram Stoker]],  [[Oscar Wilde]], [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Giles Cooper]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]], [[Elizabeth Bowen]], [[William Trevor]] and [[William Allingham]].

In the 19th century, some of the most prominent mathematical and physical scientists of the British Isles, including [[Sir William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Sir George Stokes]], [[John Tyndall]], [[George Johnstone Stoney]], [[Thomas Romney Robinson]], [[Edward Sabine]], [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]], [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]], [[George Salmon]], and [[George FitzGerald]], were Anglo-Irish. In the 20th-century, scientists [[John Joly]] and [[Ernest Walton]] were also Anglo-Irish, as was the polar explorer Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]].  Medical experts included [[Sir William Wilde]], [[Robert James Graves|Robert Graves]], [[Thomas Wrigley Grimshaw]], [[William Stokes (physician)|William Stokes]], [[Robert Collis]], [[Sir John Lumsden]] and [[William Babington (physician)|William Babington]].

The Anglo-Irish were also represented among the senior officers of the [[British Army]] by men such as [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], first honorary Colonel of the [[Irish Guards]] regiment, who spent most of his career in [[British India]];  Field Marshal [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Viscount Gough]], who served under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], himself a Wellesley born in Dublin to the [[Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington|Earl of Mornington]], head of a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Dublin; and in the 20th century Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Lord Alanbrooke]], Field Marshal [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Lord Alexander of Tunis]], Field Marshal [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]] and Field Marshal [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]]. (see also [[Irish military diaspora]]).

[[Frederick Matthew Darley]] emigrated to Australia, where he became Chief Justice of New South Wales.

Prolific [[art music]] composers included [[Michael William Balfe]], [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[George Alexander Osborne]], [[Thomas Roseingrave]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], [[John Andrew Stevenson]], [[Robert Prescott Stewart]], [[William Vincent Wallace]], and [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]].

[[William Desmond Taylor]] was an early and prolific maker of [[silent film]]s in [[Hollywood]].

[[Philanthropist]]s included [[Thomas John Barnardo|Thomas Barnardo]] and [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Lord Iveagh]].

Discussing what he considered the lack of Irish civic morality in 2011, former [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] remarked that before 1922: "In Ireland a strong civic sense did exist – but mainly amongst Protestants and especially Anglicans".&lt;ref&gt;"Ireland's lack of civic morality grounded in our history", ''[[Irish Times]]'', 9 April 2011, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitude towards Irish independence==
The Anglo-Irish, as a class, were mostly opposed to the notions of [[Irish independence (disambiguation)|Irish independence]] and Home Rule.&lt;ref&gt;Alan O'Day, ''Reactions to Irish Nationalism, 1865–1914'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1 Jul 1987), 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were supporters of continued political [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|union with Great Britain]], which existed between 1800 and 1922. This was for many reasons, but most important were the economic benefits of union for the landowning class, the close personal and familial relations with the British establishment, and the political prominence held by the Anglo-Irish in Ireland under the union settlement.&lt;ref&gt;D. George Boyce, ''Nationalism in Ireland'' (Routledge, 2 Sep 2003), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Anglo-Irish men served as officers in the [[British Army]], were clergymen in the established Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] or had land (or business interests) across the British Isles – all factors which encouraged political support for [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]]. Between the mid-nineteenth century and 1922, the Anglo-Irish comprised the bulk of the support for movements such as the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]], especially in the southern three provinces of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Alan O'Day, ''Reactions to Irish Nationalism, 1865–1914'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1 Jul 1987), 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Protestants in Ireland, and the Anglo-Irish class in particular, were by no means universally attached to the cause of continued political union with Great Britain. For instance, author [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, vigorously denounced the plight of ordinary Irish people under British rule. Reformist politicians such as [[Henry Grattan]] (1746–1820), [[Wolfe Tone]] (1763–1798), [[Robert Emmet]] (1778–1803), [[John Gray (Irish politician)|Sir John Gray]] (1815-1875), and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846–1891), were also [[Protestant Irish nationalists|Protestant nationalists]], and in large measure led and defined Irish nationalism. The [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was led by members of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots  class, some of whom feared the political implications of the impending union with Great Britain.&lt;ref name="D. George Boyce 2003"&gt;D. George Boyce, ''Nationalism in Ireland'' (Routledge, 2 Sep 2003), 309.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Irish nationalism became increasingly tied to a [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Roman Catholic]] identity.&lt;ref name="D. George Boyce 2003"/&gt; By the beginning of the twentieth century, many Anglo-Irishmen in southern Ireland had become convinced of the need for a political settlement with Irish nationalists. Anglo-Irish politicians such as [[Sir Horace Plunkett]] and [[Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon|Lord Monteagle]] became leading figures in finding a peaceful solution to the 'Irish question'.

During the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921), many Anglo-Irish landlords left the country due to [[Destruction of country houses in the Irish revolutionary period|attacks on their family homes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/cork.htm|title=Welcome reform.org - BlueHost.com|website=www.reform.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animosity towards them continued after the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. Many members of the Anglo-Irish class subsequently left Ireland forever, fearing that they would be subject to discriminatory legislation and social pressures. The Protestant proportion of the Irish population dropped from 10%  (300,000) to 6% (180,000) in the Irish Free State in the twenty-five years following independence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish ''The Anglo-Irish''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502065641/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_Anglo-Irish |date=2 May 2006 }}, Fidelma Maguire, University College of Cork&lt;/ref&gt; with most resettling in Britain. In the whole of Ireland the percentage of Protestants was 26% (1.1 million).

The reaction of the Anglo-Irish to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which envisaged the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] was mixed. [[John Gregg (archbishop of Armagh)|J. A. F. Gregg]], the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin]], stated in a sermon in December 1921 (the month the Treaty was signed):

{{quote|It concerns us all to offer the Irish Free State our loyalty. I believe there is a genuine desire on the part of those who have long differed from us politically to welcome our co-operation. We should be wrong politically and religiously to reject such advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AG19211214.2.36.2&amp;srpos=12&amp;e=-------10--11----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all|title=Papers Past - RATIFICATION QUESTION. (Ashburton Guardian, 1921-12-14)|first=National Library of New|last=Zealand|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1925, when the Irish Free State was poised to outlaw divorce, the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] delivered a famous eulogy on the Anglo-Irish in the Free State's Senate:

{{quote|I think it is tragic that within three years of this country gaining its independence we should be discussing a measure which a minority of this nation considers to be grossly oppressive. I am proud to consider myself a typical man of that minority. We against whom you have done this thing, are no petty people. We are one of the great stocks of Europe. We are the people of [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]; we are the people of [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]]; we are the people of [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], the people of [[Robert Emmet|Emmet]], the people of [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]]. We have created the most of the modern literature of this country. We have created the best of its political intelligence. Yet I do not altogether regret what has happened. I shall be able to find out, if not I, my children will be able to find out whether we have lost our stamina or not. You have defined our position and have given us a popular following. If we have not lost our stamina then your victory will be brief, and your defeat final, and when it comes this nation may be transformed.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izMWO_4_8WgC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34 ''Modern Irish Poetry: Tradition and Continuity from Yeats to Heaney''], Robert F. Garratt, University of California Press, 1989, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nowadays, the term "Anglo-Irish" is not as commonly used to describe southern Irish Protestants of English descent, or Protestant citizens of the Republic of Ireland as a group, since &amp;mdash;despite retaining a certain distinctive identity&amp;mdash; they mostly are also keen to stress their Irishness and loyalty to the [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Anglo-Irish peers ==
{{See also|Irish House of Lords|Peerage of Ireland}}

Following the English victory in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603), the "[[Flight of the Earls]]" in 1607, the traditional Gaelic [[Irish nobility]] was displaced in Ireland, particularly in the Cromwellian period.  By 1707, after further defeat in the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] and the subsequent Union of England and Scotland, the aristocracy in Ireland was dominated by Anglican families who owed allegiance to the Crown.  Some of these were Irish families who had chosen to conform to the established [[Church of Ireland]], keeping their lands and privileges, such as the [[Duke of Leinster|Dukes of Leinster]] (whose surname is [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGerald]], and who descend from the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] aristocracy), or the Gaelic [[Guinness family]].  Some were families of British or mixed-British ancestry who owed their status in Ireland to the Crown, such as the [[Earl of Cork|Earls of Cork]] (whose surname is Boyle and whose ancestral roots were in [[Herefordshire]], England).

Among the prominent Anglo-Irish peers are:
[[File:Lord Arthur Wellesley the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|Field Marshal [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], from a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence]]

*[[James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy|The 1st Baron Glenavy]], second-last [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] and first [[Cathoirleach]] (or Chairman) of the [[Seanad Éireann|Irish Senate]] (1922).
*[[Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham|The 8th Marquess Conyngham]], owner of the [[Slane Castle]] rock venue and candidate for [[Fine Gael]] in recent Irish [[general election]]s.
*[[Benjamin Guinness, 3rd Earl of Iveagh|The 3rd Earl of Iveagh]], of Gaelic Irish descent; head of the [[Guinness]] family who sat in the Irish [[Seanad Éireann|Senate]] (1973–1977).
*[[Valerie Goulding|Valerie, Lady Goulding]], founder of the Rehabilitation Institute and close associate of former [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) [[Charles Haughey]].

Until the year 1800, the peers of Ireland were all entitled to a seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]], the [[upper house]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]], in [[Dublin]].  After 1800, under the provisions of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]], the Parliament of Ireland was abolished and the Irish peers were entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the British [[House of Lords]], in London, as [[representative peer]]s.  During the [[Georgian Era]], titles in the peerage of Ireland were often granted by the British monarch to Englishmen with little or no connection to Ireland, as a way of preventing such honours from inflating the membership of the British House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''Their Noble Lordships: Class and Power in Modern Britain'', (New York: Random House, 1984), p. 202, {{ISBN|0-394-52418-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bajju''' are an ethnic group found in the [[Middle Belt]] Region of [[Nigeria]]. They are found in the Southern part of [[Kaduna State]] in [[Kachia]], [[Zangon Kataf]] and [[Jama'a]] Local Government Areas.  Bajju people are also commonly known as "Kaje" which is a pejorative name used to refer to both the Bajju people and [[Jju language|Jju]] language by the larger Hausa people who could not pronounce the name '''Kajju''' (meaning the land of the Bajju people) well. The '''Bajju''' people are predominantly farmers, hunters, blacksmiths and petty traders.

The Bajju paramount Leader is called '''Agwam Bajju'''. The current leader is His Royal Highness the Agwam Bajju, '''Agwam Nuhu Bature Achi'''.

The Bajju People, speak the [[Jju language]] , which is one of the [[Central Plateau languages]], and seems to be a variant of [[Tyap language|Tyap]].

==History and origin==

According to oral history, the origin of the Bajju can be traced as far as Bauchi State where a group of people lived in hill caves and had watchers atop the hill to watch for enemies. These people were called 'mutanen duwatsu' (literal translation in English is 'the stone people'). It was believed that their migration was for the search of better hunting grounds. They migrated from Bauchi State to Plateau State (of Nigeria) and settled on a hill called 'Hurruang'. The hill was already occupied by a tribe called the Jarawa, but the Jarawa people left and lived on another hill called 'Tsok-kwon'.

The Jarawa were a faction of a larger tribe called 'Miango'. The Bajju, [[Miango]], and [[Jarawa (Nigeria)|Jarawa]] tribes collectively called themselves 'Dangi' (meaning 'those of same stock') because they share cultural and linguistic similarities. 

Two brothers named Zampara and Wai were said to have left ‘Dangi’ settlement and migrated South of the Plateau.
The Chawai  people of today are the descendants Wai. Wai settled at a place and named it [[Chawai]]. Considering that the forefathers of both the Bajju and Chawai people had family ties made both nations affiliated. 

Zampara migrated further and settled at Hurbuang , which is now called [[Ungwan Tabo]]. Zampara had a wife named Adama (who was a Fulani woman) and gave birth to two sons, [[Baranzan]] and Akad. When Zampara, their father died Akad left his elder brother Baranzan and stayed near the hills. He did so and became the ancestor of the Atakat people. That was how the Atakat tribe got associated with the Bajju. It was because of this close relationship that the Atakat and Bajju people made it a tradition and a religious law never to intermarry. 

However, some stubborn Bajju and Atakat people intermarried, and this caused the widespread death of 1970, Gaiya (2013). The Gado of Bajju, along with his people, met with the Gado of Atakat, along with his people, to discuss the crisis of frequent deaths of people of both tribes as a result of the intermarriages. 

They reached a decision to abolish the law religiously and traditionally so that there would not be any consequence for the intermarriage. That was how the Atakat and Bajju people began to intermarry freely.

The previously mentioned Baranzan (son of Zampara, and brother of Akad) left Hurbuang and cleared a place by a riverside called 'Duccuu Cheng'. He settled the Kajju there (Kajju was the initial name of the Bajju). The name 'Kajju' was derived from the name which Baranzan gave the new settlement, which was 'Kazzu'. 

Although it is unclear from oral history when the migration occurred, but evidence suggests that the Bajju were in their current location since the early 1800s, Gaiya (2013).

==Bajju witchcraft and rites==

There are many rites in Kajju land such as things like rain, farming, harvest, new house, pregnancy, and child-naming. 
Tyyi Tson (Euthanasia): Tyyi Tson means 'to give hungry rice' (hungry rice was a type of rice which the Bajju thought of as the most sacred and perhaps elite). This practice involved offering an elderly woman poisoned hungry rice (called 'Kasap') to end her suffering of physical infirmity. It was usually done by one of her children or her sister. 

Nkut: (witchcraft) This is the power to exert spiritual influence over another person. People who use Nkut are referred to as 'Akut', and are believed to have a second set of eyes. The first set allows one to see the physical, while the other is used to see into the spiritual realm.

Gajimale (water spirit): A gajimale comes out of rivers, or streams to seduce its victims by transforming into a good looking opposite sex of the victim. It was a belief that many rich people got their wealth from Gajimale, and in return, they gave children to it. Epliepsy (known as 'rong ncen' meaning 'fire of the river') was believed to be caused by the Gajimale.

Abvoi: The Bajju worshipped the god Abvoi. The leader of the Abvoi shrine was called the 'Gado Abvoi' or 'Dodo'. The 'Magajin Abvoi' is the one who translates the messages of Abvoi to the people. The celebrations involved masquerade dances.

Masquerades (Abusak): They represented the spirits in Abvoi celebrations. The Abusak danced with women and disciplines them by beating them.

==Taboos and superstitions==

Children were not to eat eggs, and they were not to eat meat offered to them at other households, for it may be Nkut meat neither were they to go out in the heat of the midday sun, for they may accept food from Akut.

Women:
* Were not to eat eggs, for they would be 'eating' their own children;
* Were not allowed to eat chicken and birds in general;
* Were not to cook or carry out farm activities for 7 days following child birth;
* Were not allowed to hit the wall with their hands or feet, for they would be calling the Abvoi;
* Were not allowed to hit people with brooms, especially men, for they would be sweeping away all of his charms and power (including the power to impregnate a woman);
* Pregnant women were not to eat sugarcane; for their babies would grow too fat;
* Women were not to eat animal heads.

Men:
* Were not to allow their hair shaved halfway, for a spirit would come to finish the job, and cause the man to go mad;
* Were not to eat food prepared by menstruating women, for they would be exposed to blindness or bad luck in hunting;
* Were not to share secrets of the ancestor cult with women.

===General taboos===
* Spirit snakes should not be killed. It may be the spirit of a person sleeping or having a fever;
* Do not whistle at night; for it would call a spirit;
* Do not whistle in the house of a hunter; for his charms would stop working;
* Do not blow food to cool it;
* A visitor must not eat food alone. A person from the visited household must eat with the guest to prove the food is not poisoned;
* People were not to talk while eating. Even though a stranger came in, they should not greet until they finished eating;
* One should not answer a call at night; for the person might die;
* One should not step over arrows;
* A cock that crows between dusk and midnight must be killed; for it calls the spirits.

===Rules===
* Men are buried facing east (direction of Bajju origin) while women were buried facing west.
* Those who died as a result of falling off a tree, falling off the roof of a house, or shot during hunting, were buried where the incident took place, and do not receive a burial ceremony.
* Women who died during child birth were buried at the backyard of their home.
* Someone with small pox was isolated because they believed he was a wizard. They are not given a burial ceremony after dying.
* Before drinking, elders were to pour a few drops on the ground for the ancestors.
* The Bajju believed in reincarnation.
* The Bajju believed that when a shooting star passes across the sky, a great man has died somewhere and is going to land somewhere else for reincarnation.

===Taking oaths===
Men could swear the following oaths:

* Sshi anok: To swear on one's hoe. The oath was 'If I did this, may the hoe cut my leg'. 
* Sshi kata: To swear on one's bow.
* Sswa mbyin: To swear on a drum. A drum was kept with each village's gado (village head) and was used for matters affecting the entire village and used to settle local disputes. 

Women could swear the following oaths:

* Sshi abyai: To swear on one's headboard (the item used to rest loads atop women's heads). If her oath was false, her child birth would not be a safe delivery.
* Sswa a abubvo: To swear on one's skin. The skin is the piece of clothing used to secure a child on her back. If the oath was false, the child in the skin would die.
* Sswa katssong: To swear on one's axe. 'May her axe cut her if her oath is false'.

The Bajju people are governed by a traditional leader appointed by the Kaduna State government- A̱gwam Nuhu Bature A̱chi, who governs the affairs of the people majorly settled in Zonkwa.  [[Jju]] appears to be a variety of or a dialect of [[Tyap language]] together with Gworok, Fantswam, Takat and others, whose speakers are ethnically distinct.

The '''Budu people''' (Babudu) are a [[Bantu people]] living in the [[Wamba Territory]] in the [[Orientale Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. They speak the [[Budu language]].

==Location==

The Budu people live on both sides of the [[Nepoko River]], speaking different dialects.
However, the people of the [[Ibambi]] side of the river and those of the [[Wamba, Haut-Uele District|Wamba]] side consider themselves one people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=buu
 |title=Budu: A language of Democratic Republic of the Congo
 |work=Ethnologue
 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Budu territory is within tropical rain forest.
It is isolated, with roads inaccessible to vehicles other than bicycles.&lt;ref name=Joshua/&gt;

==Economy==

The Budu people mainly live by subsistence agriculture, growing cassava, yams, corn, rice, peanuts, plantains and pulses.
Palm oil is the main cash crop, giving an income per capita of about $120 a year.&lt;ref name=JesusFilm/&gt;
Animal husbandry is rare, limited to poultry and some goats.
They obtain meat and other forest resources through trade with the [[Mbuti people]] (Pygmies), who share their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |author=Giuseppe M. Carpaneto &amp; Francesco P. Germi
 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The people wear  loin cloths made from beaten bark, or second-hand western clothes. 
They live in square huts with mud walls, thatched with palm leaves.&lt;ref name=JesusFilm/&gt;

==Culture==

The family organization is patriarchal.
Important decisions are made by a consensus of elders.&lt;ref name=JesusFilm/&gt;
Both the Catholic church and, later [[WEC International]] (Worldwide Evangelisation for Christ), have been active with the Budu. 
[[Charles Studd]], founder of WEC, died in Budu territory and is buried in [[Ibambi]].&lt;ref name=Joshua/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12461">The '''Cachirules''' scandal was a 1988 [[association football]] scandal in which the [[Mexican Football Federation]] (FEMEXFUT) was found to have knowingly used at least four overage players on the [[Mexico national under-20 football team|Mexico under-20 team]] which played at the [[1988 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament]], a qualification tournament for the [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. [[FIFA]], the world governing body, imposed a severe sanction on FEMEXFUT, banning its senior and underage teams from all international competition for two years (1988–1990). As a result, the [[Mexico national football team]] were absent from the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].  The scandal has been considered a turning point in the history of [[football in Mexico]]&lt;ref name=universal&gt;{{Cite web| last =| author =| title = Caso 'cachirules': negro recuerdo| publisher = Diario El Universal| url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/deportes/99513.html| accessdate = 2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915110201/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/deportes/99513.html| archivedate= 15 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reportajedos&gt;[http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/videohub/video/clipDeportes?id=813353 Video del reportaje del 20 aniversario del escándalo de Los Cachirules – Parte 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145051/http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/videohub/video/clipDeportes?id=813353# |date=2011-06-29 }} ''[[ESPN]].''

== CONCACAF U-20 Tournament ==
Mexico and other national youth teams of the [[CONCACAF]] region were required to finish in first or second place in the [[1988 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament]] hosted in [[Guatemala]] during April 1988 in order to qualify for the [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].

Earlier in the same year, [[FIFA]] issued a statement warning all national associations not to attempt to deceive the footballing authorities regarding the age of players participating in youth tournaments (in response to what was common practice by youth teams across the world of including players of age over the regulatory limit). The maximum age established by FIFA for participation of footballers in the Youth World Championship was 20 years.

Mexico first played two matches against [[Guyana national football team|Guyana national team]], whom they beat by scores of 9–0 and 2–0, and then against locals [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala national team]], winning again both matches 2–1 and 3–0. This last victory occurred on 20 April 1988 with forward Gerardo Jiménez scoring a goal, which secured the first place of the group for Mexico and their qualification to the World Youth Championship.

== Investigation ==
Journalist Antonio Moreno from the Mexican public TV network [[Imevisión]] (now ''[[TV Azteca]]'') and author of a football-dedicated column for Mexican newspaper ''Ovaciones'', discovered in an April 1988 yearbook (1986–87 edition) published by FEMEXFUT itself, a discrepancy between the players' ages shown in the publication and the ones submitted by the federation to [[CONCACAF]] for the qualification tournament in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=universal/&gt; On 20 April 1988 Moreno published an article emphasizing the risks of "''trying to create an advantage over the opponents by including players over the permitted age''". In response, the then FEMEXFUT president Rafael del Castillo played down the matter and verbally attacked the reporter.&lt;ref name=reportajeuno&gt;[http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/videohub/video/clipDeportes?id=813354 Video del reportaje del 20 aniversario del escándalo de Los Cachirules – Parte 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145055/http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/videohub/video/clipDeportes?id=813354# |date=2011-06-29 }} ''[[ESPN]].'' Retrieved 2010-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Moreno, however, was backed up by fellow ''Imevisión'' journalist [[José Ramón Fernández (journalist)|José Ramón Fernández]], from the show ''La Misma Hora'', who broadcast the news on television. The initial reaction of the FEMEXFUT was to deny and ignore the accusations, but once the public realized the magnitude of the scandal, many Mexican journalists began to interview the players and to insistently look for the team members' birth certificates; eventually, the real birth dates of players Gerardo Jiménez and José de la Fuente, both two years older than the established limit by the FEMEXFUT, were found. Forward José Luis Mata was over the age limit by three years, and defender Aurelio Rivera was four years over.&lt;ref name=reportajeuno/&gt; Rivera, at the time the team captain, has declared in later interviews that every one of the members of the squad was over age, although such affirmation has not been verified.&lt;ref name=notaElUniversal&gt;{{Cite web| last = | first = | title = Negro recuerdo: a 20 años del caso de los "cachirules"| author = Correo de Guanajuato| publisher = El Universal| url = http://www.correo-gto.com.mx/notas.asp?id=66014| accessdate = 06-10-2009| language = es| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721223946/http://www.correo-gto.com.mx/notas.asp?id=66014#| archive-date = 2011-07-21| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information was widely spread on televised and written media in Mexico and inevitably reached the [[United States Soccer Federation]], who submitted an official complaint to CONCACAF demanding the case to be investigated after its youth team failed to qualify for the U-20 World Cup in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=Complaint&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Mexico apoya la CONCACAF en caso de juveniles, pg. 49 |publisher=La Nacion |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880525&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216040923/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880525&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federación Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala|Guatemalan Football Federation]] joined the protest.&lt;ref name=Complaint /&gt; The discovery was conducted by [[El Salvador|Salvadorean]] José Ramón Flores, who promptly verified the falsity of the ages submitted by the FEMEXFUT for the tournament's squad members.&lt;ref name=aficion&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| title = Francisco Avilán no quiere hablar sobre los "cachirules"| publisher = Diario La Afición| url = http://www.laaficion.com/futbol_mexicano/nota/17258| accessdate = 2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918004849/http://www.laaficion.com/futbol_mexicano/nota/17258| archivedate= 18 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
As a result, CONCACAF initially determined on June 19, 1988 that the ages of the four said players were in fact false and Mexico was disqualified from participation in the Saudi Arabia Youth World Championship; further, several officials were sidelined for life (but not the team coach Francisco Avilán), among them José de Jesús Alvarez Guzmán, Rafael Castellanos, Rafael del Castillo, Víctor Manuel González, Ramón Martínez, Manuel Acevez Montenegro, Gerardo Gallegos, Gilberto Morfín Salazar, and Héctor Antonio Pérez.&lt;ref name=aficion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Complaint2&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Descalificacion a seleccion juvenil de Mexico, pg. 39 |publisher=La Nacion |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880621&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216042841/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880621&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the expulsion of Mexico, it was the Guatemalan team who replaced them at the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics]], and along with the United States were the two sole CONCACAF representatives. Meanwhile, the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] replaced Mexico and, along with Costa Rica, they were the two CONCACAF nations to qualify to the World Youth Championship.

Rafael del Castillo traveled to [[Zurich]] on June 22, 1988 and attempted to appeal before [[FIFA]], hoping to overturn the lifeban issued by CONCACAF; no regard was given to the situation of Mexico's football suspension&lt;ref name=reportajedos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Complaint3&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Mexico apelara a la FIFA, pg. 46 |publisher=La Nacion |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880622&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216040808/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BZGggv0hN9sC&amp;dat=19880622&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexico executives arrived at the FIFA headquarters confident on the influence that Guillermo Cañedo might have within the world football's governing body, but they did not achieve the expected results.

On June 30, 1988, FIFA not only backed the measures dictated by CONCACAF, which had punished only the Mexican youth team, but in addition, increased the sentence by disqualifying all Mexico national teams, including the senior team, from every FIFA-sanctioned international competition for a period of two years; therefore, Mexico was left out of the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic tournament]] in [[Seoul]], as well as the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] having been precluded from participation in the preliminary qualification rounds.&lt;ref name="FIFA ban Mexico"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico given ban in Soccer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/sports/mexico-given-ban-in-soccer.html|work=The New York Times, July 1st, 1988|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previous violators of age limits had only received bans from underage competitions; FIFA said the harsher punishment was intended "to serve as a strong warning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World soccer's governing body has banned Mexico from international competition |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/06/30/World-soccers-governing-body-has-banned-Mexico-from-international/4575583646400/ |accessdate=2 July 2018 |work=UPI |date=30 June 1988 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week FIFA made the United States host for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]; a conspiracy theory holds that Mexico's disqualification from the 1990 tournament was intended to make it easier for [[United States men's national soccer team|the U.S. team]] to qualify, and so drum up [[Soccer in the United States|interest in the sport there]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sugden |first1=John |last2=Tomlinson |first2=Alan |title=Football, Corruption and Lies: Revisiting 'Badfellas', the book FIFA tried to ban |date=2017 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=63 |isbn=9781134811670 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=2CclDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |language=en |accessdate=2 July 2018}}; {{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Alan |last2=Sterry |first2=David Henry |date=2010 |title=The Glorious World Cup: A Fanatic's Guide  |location=New York, N.Y. |url=http://www.penguin.com/ajax/books/excerpt/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name "cachirules" ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=July 2014}}
A possible origin of the word refers to the slang word ''cachirul'' or ''cachirulo'', term used in Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century to designate a patch or repair of bad quality on clothing. Alternatively, the term ''cachirul'' or ''cachirulo'' was employed for all things of questionable quality, origin, or reputation. Football used the adjective in the yards of lower amateur categories in cities and towns of Mexico, referring to players whom without being part of the team roster, would take the field in order to complete the team and thus avoid losing the game due to lack of players. This implicated deceiving the referee, as players used other player's identity, creating a "''cachirul''". As time passed, and especially after the 1988 scandal, the term ''cachirul'' in Mexico has become almost exclusively a footballing term.

'''Charles Henry Parkhurst''' (April 17, 1842 &amp;ndash; September 8, 1933) was an American clergyman and social reformer, born in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]]. Although scholarly and reserved, he preached two sermons in 1892 in which he attacked the political corruption of [[New York City]] government. Backed by the evidence he collected, his statements led to both the exposure of [[Tammany Hall]] and to subsequent social and political reforms.

==Early years==
He was born on a farm on April 17, 1842 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; Parkhurst did not attend a formal school until he was twelve. Despite this, he showed a strong interest in education and graduated from [[Amherst College|Amherst]] in 1866.  He became principal of the high school in Amherst in 1867. He married Ellen Bodman on November 23, 1870, she being one of his former students.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; Parkhurst studied [[theology]] at [[University of Halle|Halle]] in 1869, and became a professor at the [[Williston Seminary]] in [[Easthampton, Massachusetts]], in 1870–1871.

After further studies in [[Leipzig]] in 1872–1873, he was ordained as a [[Presbyterian]] minister.  He was pastor of a congregational church at [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], from 1874 until 1880, when he was called to the [[Madison Square Presbyterian Church, New York City (1906)|Madison Square Presbyterian Church, New York City]], where he served from 1880 to 1918.

==Later life==
Interested in municipal affairs, Parkhurst was elected president of the [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Society for the Prevention of Crime]] in 1891, and he challenged the methods of the city police department.&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;{{cite book|title=Famous American Statesmen &amp; Orators|editor=Alexander K. McClure|publisher=F. F. Lovell Publishing Company|location=New York|year=1902|volume=VI|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He inaugurated a campaign against the political and social corruption of Tammany Hall.  The hall had begun innocently as a social club, but had drifted into politics and [[Political corruption|graft]]. It acquired a lock on elections in the city, and its bosses protected crime and vice in [[Manhattan]] and surrounding boroughs. Grand jury investigations were ineffective, despite the appeals of social reformers.  Few in Parkhurst's congregation recognized that Tammany Hall, the police, and organized crime were interconnected.

On February 14, 1892, he challenged Tammany Hall from the pulpit.  Pointing to the hall's political influence and their connection with the police, he noted that men fed upon the city while pretending to protect it saying,

{{quote|text=While we fight iniquity, they shield and patronize it; while we try to convert criminals, they manufacture them ... |author=Parkhurst on Tammany Hall corruption}}

When the municipal grand jury asked him for hard evidence, Parkhurst personally hired a private detective and, with his friend John Erving, went to the streets in disguise to collect proof of the corruption.  From the pulpit on March 13, 1892, he preached a sermon backed with documentation and [[affidavit]]s.  Parkhurst's campaign led to the appointment of the [[Lexow Committee]] to investigate conditions, and to the election of a reform mayor in 1894.  Although Tammany Hall did publicly clean house, it remained influential on both the political front and in organized crime until the 1950s.

==Women's suffrage==

Parkhurst was opposed to women voting. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That quality of feminine blatancy which is being at present so extensively advertised here and in England, that disposition toward self-exploitation indulged in by short-haired women and encouraged by long-haired men, is of a sort to chill and then freeze over those masculine impulses that seek restful and satisfying companionship in a member of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/326269618/?terms=%22feminine%2Bblatancy%22 "Perhaps a Fighting Woman Is Not So Very Pleasing," Hearst Wire, ''New York Evening Journal,'' March 9, 1909, image 10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family==
His first wife, Ellen Bodman, died on May 28, 1921. He married Eleanor Marx on April 18, 1927, in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

==Death==
Parkhurst died on September 8, 1933, by [[sleepwalking]] and walking off the porch roof in his [[Ventnor City, New Jersey]], home.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Parkhurst Dies of a Fall in His Sleep|quote=Reformer, 91, a Somnambulist, Plunges From Porch Roof of New Jersey Home.

The '''Chatinos''' are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]]. Chatino communities are located in the southeastern region of the state of [[Oaxaca]] in southern central Mexico. Their native [[Chatino language]] is spoken by about 23,000 people (Ethnologue surveys), but ethnic Chatinos may number many more. They call themselves ''qne-a tnya-e'' and their language ''Chaq-f tnya-b''.

Chatino populations are found in the following [[Municipalities of Oaxaca|Oaxacan municipalities]], mostly in the area around Juquila: [[Santos Reyes Nopala]], [[San Juan Quiahije]], [[San Miguel Panixtlahuaca]], [[Santiago Yaitepec]], [[Santa Cruz Zenzontepec]], [[San Juan Lachao]], [[Santa María Temaxcaltepec]], [[Santa Catarina Juquila]] and [[Tataltepec de Valdés]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.mexicantextiles.com/grouppages/chatino.html
 |title=Chatino of Oaxaca
 |work=Mexican Textiles
 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region that the Chatinos inhabit is rich in natural resources. Traditionally many Chatino people have been involved in [[agriculture]], which depends very much on the climate, so some Chatinos have had to emigrate to the corners of the district of Juquila to work on coffee plantations. Most Chatino communities have public services, and there are [[runway]]s for airports in many [[municipality|municipalities]]. Federal bilingual schools, high schools, and ''[[telesecundaria]]s'' (distance education programs for secondary and high school students) have been established.

The traditional authorities of this people are organized in a system based on civil and religious roles, in which advice from elders is treated as the greatest authority. They believe in the Holy Grandmother, the Holy Father Sun, the Holy Mother Earth, and the Holy Mother Moon. In addition, they worship the deities of water, wind, rain, the mountain, and fire.

==Chatino language==
{{main|Chatino language}}
Chatino language is an [[indigenous languages of Mesoamerica|indigenous Mesoamerican language]], which is classified under the [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] branch of the   [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] [[language family]]. The Chatino have close cultural and linguistic ties with the [[Zapotec people]]s, whose [[Zapotec language]] is the other member of the Zapotecan languages.
According to Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Eric. 2013. "The Internal Diversification and Subgrouping of Chatino," International Journal of American Linguistics 79:395-420.&lt;/ref&gt; there are three main Chatino languages, which exhibit varying degrees of [[mutual intelligibility]]: Zenzontepec Chatino, Tataltepec Chatino, and Eastern Chatino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE|sep=,|size=100}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|ŋ|k|h|ər|s|t}}; 22 September 1880 – 13 February 1958), was a British [[suffragette]] born in [[Manchester]], England. A co-founder of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]]&amp;nbsp;(WSPU), she directed its militant actions from exile in France from 1912 to 1913. In 1914 she supported the war against Germany. After the war she moved to the United States, where she worked as an evangelist for the [[Second Adventist]] movement.

==Early life==
Christabel Pankhurst was the daughter of women's suffrage movement leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; and radical socialist [[Richard Pankhurst]]  and sister to [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Sylvia]] and [[Adela Pankhurst]]. Her father was a barrister and her mother owned a small shop. Christabel assisted her mother, who worked as the Registrar of Births and Deaths in Manchester. Despite financial struggles, her family had always been encouraged by their firm belief in their devotion to causes rather than comforts.

[[Historians#R 3|Nancy Ellen Rupprecht]] wrote, "She was almost a textbook illustration of the first child born to a middle-class family. In childhood as well as adulthood, she was beautiful, intelligent, graceful, confident, charming, and charismatic." Christabel enjoyed a special relationship with both her mother and father, who had named her after "Christabel", the poem by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] ("The lovely lady Christabel / Whom her father loves so well").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fulford|first=Roger|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's death in 1928 had a devastating impact on Christabel.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillberg|first=Isabelle|title=Pankhurst, Christabel Hariette (1880–1958)|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=SUIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA148364172&amp;mode=view|publisher=Detroit:Gale|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale two"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christabel Pankhurst|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=WHIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1616000037&amp;mode=view|publisher=Gale|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pankhurst learned to read at her home on her own before she went to school. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls. She obtained a law degree from the [[University of Manchester]], and received honours on her [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]]&amp;nbsp;exam but because she was a woman she was not allowed to practice law. Later Pankhurst moved to [[Geneva]] to live with a family friend, but returned home to help her mother raise the rest of the children, when her father died in 1898.&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt;

==Activism==

===Suffrage===
[[File:Christabel Pankhurst, c.1913. (22322829053).jpg|thumb|Christabel Pankhurst, c.1913.]]
In 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist [[Annie Kenney]],&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. Emmeline Pankhurst began to take more [[Militant (word)|militant]] action for the women's suffrage cause after her daughter's arrest and was herself imprisoned on many occasions for her principles.

After obtaining her law degree in 1906, Christabel moved to the London headquarters of the WSPU, where she was appointed its organising secretary. Nicknamed "Queen of the Mob", she was jailed again in 1907 in [[Parliament Square]] and in 1909 after the "Rush Trial" at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court|Bow Street]]. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, France, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the [[Cat and Mouse Act|Prisoner's (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act]], better known as the "Cat and Mouse Act". The start of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. Pankhurst engaged in a [[hunger strike]], ultimately serving only 30 days of a three-year sentence.

She was influential in the WSPU's "anti-male" phase after the failure of the [[Conciliation Bills]]. She wrote a book called ''The Great Scourge and How to End It'' on the subject of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and how sexual equality (votes for women) would help the fight against these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/CHIC/suffrage/document/greatsco.htm Pankhurst C, 1913. The Great Scourge and How to End It] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010303095852/http://www.worc.ac.uk/CHIC/suffrage/document/greatsco.htm |date=3 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her sister Sylvia did not get along. Sylvia was against turning the WSPU towards solely upper- and middle-class women and using militant tactics, while Christabel thought it was essential. Christabel felt that suffrage was a cause that should not be tied to any causes trying to help working-class women with their other issues. She felt that it would only drag the suffrage movement down and that all of the other issues could be solved once women had the right to vote.&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt;

===White feathers===
On 8 September 1914, Pankhurst re-appeared at London's [[Royal Opera House]] after her long exile, to utter a declaration on "The German Peril", a campaign led by the former General Secretary of the WSPU, Norah Dacre Fox in conjunction with the British Empire Union and the National Party.&lt;ref name='McPherson &amp; McPherson'&gt;{{cite book| last =McPherson| first =Angela| authorlink =| author2 =McPherson, Susan| title =Mosley's Old Suffragette – A Biography of Norah Elam| publisher =| year =2011| location =| pages =| url =http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk| doi =| id =| isbn =978-1-4466-9967-6| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]), Pankhurst toured the country making recruiting speeches. Her supporters handed the [[white feather]] to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress. ''The Suffragette'' appeared again on 16 April 1915 as a war paper and on 15 October changed its name to ''Britannia.'' In its pages, week by week, Pankhurst called for the military conscription of men and the industrial conscription of women into [[national service]]. She called also for the internment of all people of enemy nationality, men and women, young and old, found on these shores. Her supporters bobbed up at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] meetings with placards: "Intern Them All". She also championed a more complete and thorough enforcement of the blockade of enemy and neutral nations, arguing that this must be "a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]". She demanded the resignation of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], General [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|Sir William Robertson]] and Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Eyre Crowe]], whom she considered too mild and dilatory in method. ''Britannia'' was many times raided by the police and experienced greater difficulty in appearing than had befallen ''The Suffragette.'' Indeed, although occasionally Norah Dacre Fox's father, John Doherty, who owned a printing firm, was drafted in to print campaign posters,&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; McPherson"/&gt; ''Britannia'' was compelled at last to set up its own printing press. Emmeline Pankhurst proposed to set up Women's Social and Political Union Homes for illegitimate girl "war babies", but only five children were adopted. [[David Lloyd George]], whom Pankhurst had regarded as the most bitter and dangerous enemy of women, was now the one politician in whom she and Emmeline Pankhurst placed confidence.

After some British women were granted the right to vote at the end of World War&amp;nbsp;I, Pankhurst stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]] as a [[Women's Party (UK)|Women's Party]] candidate, in alliance with the Lloyd George/Conservative Coalition in the [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|Smethwick constituency]]. She was narrowly defeated, by only 775&amp;nbsp;votes to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate [[John Davison (politician)|John Davison]].

===Move to California===
Leaving England in 1921, she moved to the United States where she eventually became an evangelist with [[Plymouth Brethren]] links and became a prominent member of [[Second Adventist]] movement.

===Prophetic interests===

Marshall, Morgan, and Scott published her works on subjects related to her prophetic outlook, which took its character from [[John Nelson Darby]]'s perspectives. Pankhurst lectured and wrote books on the [[Second Coming]]. She was a frequent guest on TV&amp;nbsp;shows in the 1950s and had a reputation for being an odd combination of "former suffragist revolutionary, evangelical Christian and almost stereotypically proper 'English Lady' who always was in demand as a lecturer". While in California, she adopted her daughter Betty, finally having recovered from her mother's death.

===Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire===

She returned to Britain for a period in the 1930s and was appointed a [[Knight Commander|Dame Commander]] of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christabel-Pankhurst Christabel Panhurst], Britannica.com, Retrieved 21 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At the onset of World War&amp;nbsp;II she again left for the United States, to live in [[Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles]], California.

==Death==
Christabel died 13 February 1958, at the age of 77, sitting in a straight-backed chair. Her housekeeper found her body and there was no indication of her cause of death. She was buried in the [[Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Santa Monica]], California.&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt;

'''Cieszyn Vlachs''' ({{lang-pl|Wałasi cieszyńscy}}, {{lang-cs|Těšínští Valaši}}) are a [[Poles|Polish]] ethnographic group (subgroup of [[Silesians]]) living around the towns of [[Cieszyn]] and [[Skoczów]],&lt;ref name="SCDK"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w.scdk.pl/zroznicowanie_etnograficzne_obecnego_wojewodztwa_slaskiego.php|title=Zróżnicowanie etnograficzne obecnego województwa śląskiego|publisher=Śląskie Centrum Dziedzictwa Kulturowego w Katowicach|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the four major ethnographic groups in [[Cieszyn Silesia]], the one mostly associated with wearing [[Cieszyn folk costume]]&lt;ref name="SCDK"/&gt; but not the only one speaking [[Cieszyn Silesian dialect]]. The name, identical to [[Vlachs]] ({{lang-pl|Wołosi/Wałasi}}), is probably not directly associated with that group (as [[Gorals]] are) but was coined by adjacent groups as a nickname.&lt;ref name="Dembiniok2010"&gt;{{Cite book |author = Marian Dembiniok| title = O Góralach, Wałachach, Lachach i Jackach na Śląsku Cieszyńskim| chapter=Wałasi cieszyńscy| publisher = REGIO| place = | year = 2010| pages = 47| isbn = 978-80-904230-4-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of this group blossomed in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dembiniok2010"/&gt; The exact extent of its habitat is hard to determine due to overlapping of various cultural elements with adjacent groups, especially on the borderlands. Cieszyn Vlachs dwell on [[Silesian Foothills]] and on the north-western slopes of [[Silesian Beskids]]&lt;ref name="Dembiniok2010"/&gt; in the watershed of [[Vistula]] and [[Olza (river)|Olza]] rivers, within Cieszyn Silesia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|surname=Malicki|first=Longin|title=Strój Górali Śląskich|publisher=Polskie Towarzystwo Ludoznawcze|place=Wrocław|date=1956|pages=23|series=Atlas polskich strojów ludowych ; cz. 3.

According to several public surveys in [[Kosovo]] and reports from institutions such as the [[European Commission]], levels of corruption and impunity among politicians are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Communication on a Feasibility Study for a Stabilisation and Association  Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/ks_analytical_2012_en.pdf|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 85th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
The European Commission reports that electoral fraud persists in Kosovo representing serious shortcomings in the electoral process. Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2013 points out that political parties are considered the second most corrupt institution in Kosovo by a significantly high number of households, second only to the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Communication on a Feasibility Study for a Stabilisation and Association  Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/ks_analytical_2012_en.pdf|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is considered the largest obstacle to doing business in Kosovo, and businesses frequently resort to bribes when interacting with public officials. Sectors such as customs, manufacturing, electricity, gas and water supply are identified as those most affected by corruption. There are a number of burdensome and costly procedures for companies to undergo in order to obtain business licences and permits, these lead to increased opportunities for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kosovo Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/kosovo/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to decreasing fertility, the proportion of children below the age of 15 is decreasing, while the proportion of elderly is increasing. The median age has increased from 21.6 in 1980, 24.1 in 1990, 28.1 in 2000 to 32.6 in 2011.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt;
The estimated mid-year population of 2014 is 1,344,000 (medium fertility scenario of The 2012 Revision of the World Population Prospects).&lt;ref name="WPP 2012"/&gt;

===Emigration===
Emigration from Trinidad and Tobago, as with other Caribbean nations, has historically been high; most emigrants go to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[UK|Britain]]. Emigration has continued, albeit at a lower rate, even as the birth-rate sharply dropped to levels typical of industrialised countries. Largely because of this phenomenon, as of 2011, Trinidad and Tobago has been experiencing a low [[List of countries by population growth rate|population]] growth rate (0.48%). More recently, there has been some return migration, chiefly from the United States after the recession of 2008, which caused a population jump in the last census in 2011.

===Indo-Trinidadian===
[[Indo-Trinidadians]] make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 37.6%).&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt; They are primarily descendants from indentured workers from [[South Asia]], or the then [[British Raj]], brought to replace emancipated Africans who refused to continue working under the violent, exploitative conditions on the sugar plantations. The Indian community is divided roughly half-and-half between those who maintained their original religions, and those who have converted to Christianity or have no religious affiliation. Through cultural preservation groups, Trinidadians of Indian descent maintain many of their customs, traditions, and language.

===African-Trinidadian and Tobagonians===
[[Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]] make up the country's second largest ethnic group (approximately 36.3%).&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt; Although enslaved Africans were first imported in 1517, they constituted only 11 percent of the population (310) in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/caribbean-islands/39.htm|title=Trinidad and Tobago - HISTORY|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of the enslaved Africans were brought in the last few years of Trinidad's Spanish Colonial era, and the beginning of the British colonial period. The [[Cedula of Population]] transformed a small colony of 1,000 in 1773 to 18,627 by 1797. In the census of 1777 there were only 2,763 people recorded as living on the island, including some 2,000 Arawaks. In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] that abolished the trading of enslaved persons, and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] abolished the practice of slavery itself.

===White-Trinidadians===
The [[White Trinidadian|White-Trinidadian]] (or Euro Trinidadian) population is primarily descended from early settlers and immigrants. The recent census counted 7,832 people of European descent.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt; These numbers do not include people who have at least some European ancestry or self-identify as African or Indian.

The French arrived mostly during the Spanish period to take advantage of free agricultural lands. Some Portuguese arrived in mid nineteenth century and more came  at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;The Portuguese of Trinidad and Tobago Jo-Anne S Ferreira Institute of Social and Economic Research  The University of. The West Indies St Augustine Trinidad&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans who remained in Trinidad live in areas in and around [[Port of Spain]]. Furthermore, British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean and descendants of English indentured workers brought in as overseers following the end of the Second World War. 

The Portuguese came to Tobago and Trinidad as early as the 17th century, including groups of [[Portuguese Jews]], Catholics and Protestants. For over 140 years, from 1834 up to 1975, the ancestors of the modern Portuguese community in Trinidad and Tobago hailed mostly from the archipelago of [[Madeira]], starting from 1846, with the earliest registers being from the Azores in 1834.   

The Portuguese came directly from Madeira, and also via Guyana, St Vincent, Antigua and St Kitts.

Important communities settled in Port of Spain, Arima, Arouca, Chaguanas, San Fernando and Scarborough. 

In 2011, the Madeiran Portuguese Community of Trinidad and Tobago celebrated their 165th Anniversary of arrival of the first Madeirans in Trinidad back in 1846. 

Recalling the presence of the Portuguese in the nation today are over 100 Portuguese surname,   some of which have become street nomenclature. As an independent nation, the country has recognised several members of the Portuguese community, through official awards.&lt;ref&gt;[Trinidad &amp; Tobago 50 Years of Independence, THE PORTUGUESE OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, Locating an important minority, Dr Jo-Anne Ferreira Lecturer in Linguistics, UWI, St Augustine Campus, Trinidad,September 28, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tobago]], many white residents are retirees who have recently arrived there. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Mixed ethnicity===
Given the large number of ethnic identities in Trinidad and Tobago, many citizens have a mixed ethnic heritage due to influences from [[French people|French]], [[West Africa]]n, [[Creole peoples|Creole]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Liberia]]n, [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indians]], [[Scottish people|Scotts]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[English people|English]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Arab]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and [[Russian people|Russian]] ancestors. Additionally, there are also nationals of [[Hispanic]] [[Spaniards|Spaniard]], [[Mestizo]], [[Mulatto]], and [[Pardo]] ancestry, mainly from [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]], along with a small number from [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. Common ethnic mixtures include people of European and African descent, [[mulattos|mulatto-creoles]], and Indian and African descent (often colloquially known as [[dougla]]). This mixed population is estimated at around 22.8%; however, it is much higher when considering the various degrees of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]], [[Europe]]an, and indigenous [[Amerindian]] ancestry of the total population. A person might self identify as African based on physical appearance, for instance, but he or she might be genetically more similar to a person of Indian descent ([[dougla]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Icr9Klvm6wC&amp;dq=Race+Relations+in+Colonial+Trinidad+1870-1900&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GVYDm2_Ab2&amp;sig=RatFBWm3O6oWoCK4_g58gxbkfik&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2DfnSv_9DYmXlAf5l-CICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=french+creole&amp;f=false|title=Race Relations in Colonial Trinidad 1870-1900|first=Bridget|last=Brereton|date=6 June 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/definitions/trinidad.html ''Trinidad French Creole''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328025807/http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/definitions/trinidad.html |date=2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=HHE2005060003129|title=''Estimates of African, European and Native American Ancestry in Afro-Caribbean Men ''.|website=Content.karger.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sino-Trinidadians and Arab-Trinidadians===
There are groups of [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese]] who, like the  Indians, are descended from [[indentured labourers]]. They account for about 4,003 people and live mostly in Port-of-Spain and San Fernando. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Trinidad there were, about twenty years ago [i.e. about 1886], 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese, but they have decreased to probably about 2,000 or 3,000, [2,200 in 1900]. They used to work in sugar plantations, but are now principally shopkeepers,as well as general merchants, miners and railway builders,etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Things Chinese or Notes Connected with China''. 4th Edition. J. Dyer Ball (1906), New York, Charles Scribner's Son, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are also about 1,062 [[Arabs]], originating from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] who live mostly in Port-of-Spain. The Syrian and Lebanese communities of Trinidad are predominantly Christian, migrating from the Middle East in the 19th century from the [[Ottoman Empire]] later landing in the Caribbean and Latin America. Other Lebanese and Syrians came in the early to middle 20th century to escape the war and turmoil in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nalis.gov.tt/Resources/Subject-Guide/Syrian-Lebanese|title=Syrian Lebanese|website=Nalis.gov.tt|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous (Caribs)===
Finally there are the mixed raced [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] who are descended from the native, precolonial people of the islands. They are organized around the [[Santa Rosa Carib Community]] and live mostly in and around [[Arima]].

In 2011, according to census, Roman Catholicism was again the largest religious denomination with 285,671 followers (21.6% of the total population), having declined from a membership of 289,711 in 2000 (26% of the population).&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt; Other religious denominations that experienced decreases in their membership in 2011 were Hinduism (from 22.5% in 2000 to 18.2% in 2011), Anglican (from 7.8% to 5.7%), Presbyterian/Congregational (from 3.3% to 2.5%) and Methodist (from 0.9% to 0.7%). The number of persons claiming affiliation to Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full Gospel more than doubled from 76,327 in 2000 (6.8%) to 159,033 in 2011 (12.0%). The number of Muslims slightly increased but as proportion of the total population there was a decrease from 5.8% in 2000 to 5.0% in 2011. The category ‘None’ witnessed a small increase from 1.9% to 2.2%, while those who did not state a religion increased significantly, from 1.4% to 11.1%. 1.2% of the population are adherents of [[Baha'i]]. The African religions and specifically Orisha have become institutions in Trinidad and Tobago's society.They serve not only the obvious religious needs but also as a source of inspiration for personal identity. Many people, motivated by the need to re-claim their African heritage can now openly support these religions because they see in them a source of understanding and a coming to terms with their enslavement and the colonial past.&lt;ref&gt;"Most Baha'i Nations (2010)" QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions.

The '''Emerald Society''' is an organization of American police officers or fire fighters of [[Irish people|Irish]] heritage. The Emerald Society for firemen was founded by Michael C. Donohue in New York City on March 17, 1956 (St. Patrick's Day) to preserve the music, culture, language and traditions of Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;Urbanowicz, G. R. (2002). Badges of the Bravest: A Pictorial History of the Fire Departments in New York City. Paducah, KY: Turner Publishing Company &lt;/ref&gt; but primarily to protect Irish firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;http://fdnyemerald.org/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerald Societies are now found in most major U.S. cities such as [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Milwaukee, WI]], [[Jersey City, NJ]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[History of the Irish in Saint Paul|Saint Paul]], [[Colorado]], [[Baltimore]] and [[Cincinnati]].  Federal law enforcement officers such as Special Agents and Customs and Border Protection officers and who are of Irish/Gaelic descent are eligible to join the Emerald Society of the Federal Law Enforcement Agencies. 

The organization known as the '''National Conference of Law Enforcement Emerald Societies''' ('''NCLEES''') states that its objectives are:

*To unite all public safety Emerald Societies in order to develop fraternalism amongst its members.
*To preserve the Irish culture and to promote the contributions of our ancestors.
*To recognize the accomplishments of Irish-Americans in Law Enforcement and other public safety professions.
*To exchange information and enhance communications among member organizations and to start new public safety Emerald Societies.
*To provide a unified and effective voice for its member organizations to the Congress of the United States and other government institutions.
*To work with civic and public safety associations on areas of mutual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nclees.org/ N.C.L.E.E.S&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the organization is geared toward Irish-American culture, Irish heritage is not listed as a requirement for membership.

[[File:Eternity ring 1.jpg|thumb|right|Eternity ring]]
An '''eternity ring''', also known as an '''infinity ring''', is a woman's [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]]&lt;ref&gt;https://thinkengraved.com/blogs/news/awesome-guide-on-infinity-rings-what-are-they-used-for&lt;/ref&gt; comprising a band of [[precious metal]] (usually [[gold]]) set with a continuous line of identically cut [[gemstone]]s (usually [[diamond]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Primestyle. "[http://www.primestyle.com/news/diamond-eternity-bands/ Why Eternity Bands Are So Popular – Top 4 Reasons]" November 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; to symbolize neverending [[love]], usually given by a spouse to their [[wife]] on the occasion of a significant [[anniversary]], {{citation needed span|text=typically after  50 or more years of marriage date|date=June 2017}}
Because the presence of stones all the way round the eternity ring can make it cumbersome to wear, the alternative is to have the stones across the face of the ring only.  This is sometimes referred to as a "half-eternity" ring rather than a "full" eternity ring.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cooksongold.com/blog/trends-and-inspiration/the-eternity-ring&lt;/ref&gt;

Eternity rings featuring [[paste gem]]s, white [[topaz]] or a mix of stones appeared in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="taylor88"&gt;{{cite book |title=Finger Rings From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day |last=Taylor |first=Gerald |last2=Scarisbrick |first2=Diana |year=1978 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |isbn=0-900090-54-5 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of the diamond eternity ring was created in the 1960s by diamond merchant [[De Beers]].&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite news |title= Have you ever tried to sell a Diamond? |author= Edward Jay Epstein |newspaper= The Atlantic Monthly  |date= February 1982  |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/82feb/8202diamond2.htm |accessdate= October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kempton&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kempton|first1 = Daniel|title = Russia and de beers: Diamond conflict or cartel?|journal = South African Journal of International Affairs|volume = 3|pages = 94|year = 1995|doi = 10.1080/10220469509545165|issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American investigative journalist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] stated that at the time the company had a secret agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] which, in return for the creation of a "single channel" controlling the world's supply of diamonds, 'required' the purchase of 90-95% of the uncut gem diamonds produced by Russia.&lt;ref name=Kempton/&gt;  The prevailing fashion at the time, particularly for [[engagement ring]]s, was for them to be set with a single, large diamond.  The Soviet gems, however, were small, often less than 0.25 carats.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  To avoid stockpiling, De Beers embarked on a campaign of promotion of [[Jewellery|jewelry]] containing a number of small diamonds culminating in the eternity ring, which was aimed at older, married women.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  One campaign slogan aimed at husbands was, "She married you for richer or poorer. Let her know how it’s going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Maybe diamonds are a girl’s best friend |author= Joan McAlpine  |newspaper= The Times |date= March 1, 2009 |url= http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Migration/article153287.ece |accessdate= December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group conflict''', or hostilities between different groups, is a feature common to all forms of human social organization (e.g., sports teams, ethnic groups, nations, religions, gangs)&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;, and also occurs in social animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.05.004 |title=The logic of animal intergroup conflict: A review |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization |year=2017 |last1=Rusch |first1=H. |last2=Gavrilets |first2=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although group conflict is one of the most complex phenomena studied by social scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2018.01.020 |title=The Psychology of Intergroup Conflict: A Review of Theories and Measures |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization |year=2018 |last1=Böhm |first1=R. |last2=Rusch |first2=H.  |last3=Baron |first3=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the history of the human race evidences a series of group-level conflicts that have gained notoriety over the years. For example, from 1820 to 1945, it has been estimated that at least 59 million persons were killed during conflicts between groups of one type or another.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (1994) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Literature suggests that the number of fatalities{{clarify |reason=What number of fatalities? Per year? Per capita per year? Per conflict? Per what?|date=May 2015}} nearly doubled between the years 1914 to 1964 as a result of further group conflict.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (1984) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Group conflict can be separated into two sub-categories of conflict: inter-group conflict (in which distinct groups of individuals are at odds with one another), and intra-group conflict (in which select individuals that are part of the same group clash with one another). Although both forms of conflict have the ability to spiral upward in severity, it has been noted{{by whom|date=May 2015}} that conflict present at the group level (i.e., inter-group rivalries) is generally considered to be more powerful than conflict present at an individual level – a phenomenon known as the [[discontinuity effect]].&lt;ref name=F&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intergroup conflict==

===Sources===
[[Social psychology]], specifically the [[discontinuity effect]] of inter-group conflict, suggests that "groups are generally even more competitive and aggressive than individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith/Diane M.Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; Two main sources of intergroup conflict have been identified: "competition for valued material resources, according to [[realistic conflict theory]], or for social rewards like respect and esteem...as described by [[relative deprivation theory]]"&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;

Group conflict can easily enter an escalating spiral of hostility marked by [[Splitting (psychology)|polarisation]] of views into black and white, with comparable actions viewed in diametrically opposite ways: "we offer concessions, but they attempt to lure us with ploys. We are steadfast and courageous, but they are unyielding, irrational, stubborn, and blinded by ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely believed that intergroup and intragroup hostility are (at least to some degree) inversely related: that "there is, unhappily, an inverse relationship between external wars and internal strife".&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (1994) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "in politics, for example, everyone can get an extraordinarily comforting feeling of mutual support from their group by focussing on an enemy".&lt;ref&gt;R. Skinner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1993) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]] described a similarly quasi-benign version, whereby "it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other{{spaced ndash}} like the Spaniards and Portuguese, for instance...[as] a convenient and relatively harmless satisfaction of the inclination to aggression, by means of which cohesion between the members of the community is made easier".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; The harder version of the theory would suggest that "pent-up sub-group aggression, if it cannot combine with the pent-up aggression of other sub-groups to attack a common, foreign enemy, will vent itself in the form of riots, persecutions and rebellions".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief domains that contribute===
Through an extensive literature review, Roy J. Eidelson and Judy I. Eidelson, identified parallels between individuals and the collective world views of groups on the basis of five key belief domains.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"&gt;Eidelson, R. J., &amp; Eidelson, J. I. (2003). "Dangerous Ideas: Five Beliefs That Propel Groups Toward Conflict". ''[[American Psychologist]]''. Vol. 58. No. 3, 182&amp;ndash;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Superiority''': At an individual level, this belief revolves around a person's enduring conviction that he or she is better than other people in important ways.  At the group level, superiority includes shared convictions of moral superiority, entitlement, being the chosen and having a special destiny.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"/&gt;  Being chosen, the belief that one's own group has a superior cultural heritage (e.g., history, values, language, tradition) is common among groups who base their identity on their ethnicity. The development of Hitler's ideology of Aryans as a "[[master race]]" is one example of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonen|first=J. Y.|title=The roots of Nazi psychology: Hitler's utopian barbarism.|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|location=Lexington}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This belief can be unconscious, with group members unaware – "The power and influence of such a worldview are directly related to its operation as an invisible veil, which makes it difficult for individuals, groups, and institutions to see their harmful consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Sue, D. W., Bingham, R. P., Porche-Burke, L., &amp; Vasquez, M. (1999). The Diversification of Psychology: A Multi-Cultural Revolution. American Psychologist, 1061&amp;ndash;1069.&lt;/ref&gt;   These authors noted that several committees studying racism were using the term ethnocentric [[monoculturalism]] to describe this belief in the superiority of your own group's cultural heritage (including history, values, language, traditions, arts and crafts, etc.) over that of other groups.  As part of this belief system they also noted a corresponding belief in the inferiority of all other group's heritage, the ability to impose their standards and beliefs on less powerful groups, evidence of the group's core beliefs and values in their practices, programs and policies as well as in the institutions and structures of the group's society, and that they were able to operate outside the level of conscious awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Sue, D. W., Bingham, R. P., Porche-Burke, L., &amp; Vasquez, M. (1999). "The Diversification of Psychology: A Multi-Cultural Revolution". ''[[American Psychologist]]''. 1061&amp;ndash;1069.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Injustice''': At the individual level, this belief revolves around perceived mistreatment by others, and/or the world at large. At the group level, this translates to a world view that the ingroup has significant and legitimate grievances against an outgroup.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"/&gt;  This belief is seen as contributing greatly to the impetus for war over the past two centuries, as the majority of wars in that time period have centered on issues of ''justice'' rather than security or power (Welch, 1993).  Injustice, in a group setting, can be based on the shared belief that their group has not achieved desired outcomes due to the actions or inactions of a more powerful group that has created a biased or undesirable outcome, and not due to the inadequacies or actions of the group itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sue, D. W., Bingham, R. P., Porche-Burke, L., &amp; Vasquez, M. (1999). The Diversification of Psychology: A Multi-Cultural Revolution. ''[[American Psychologist]]''. 1061&amp;ndash;1069.&lt;/ref&gt;  Volkan termed the phrase Chosen Traumas  to refer to the "mental representation of an event that has caused a large group to face drastic losses, feel helpless and victimized by another group"&lt;ref&gt;Volkan, V. D. (1999). "Psychoanalysis and Diplomacy: Part 1. Individual and Large Group Identity". ''[[Journal of Applied Psychoanlytic Studies]]''. pp. 29&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; that are distorted to perpetuate the injustice belief.
* '''[[Vulnerability]]''': At the individual level, vulnerability refers to a person's belief that he or she is perpetually in harm's way. At the group level, this belief is manifested in the form of fears about the future.  This vulnerability can manifest itself in a group as catastrophic thinking – when the envisioned worst-case scenario is seen as being inevitable.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"/&gt;  Chirot (2001) notes that the genocides of Armenia, Germany, Cambodia, and Rwanda shared a common belief that "if they did not destroy their real or imagined enemies first, they would themselves be annihilated" (p.&amp;nbsp;10).
* '''Distrust''': At the individual level, this belief focuses on the presumed intent of others to cause harm and/or exhibit hostility. The notion of trust is often seen by psychologists as the first challenge of psychosocial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erikson|first=E. H.|title=[[Childhood and Society]]|publisher=Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the group level, this worldview focuses specifically on the perspective that outgroups are dishonest, untrustworthy and have negative intentions toward the in group.  In more extreme manifestations, this belief is similar to ''collective paranoia'', which is defined as collectively held beliefs, either false or [[exaggerated]] that cluster around ideas of being harmed, harassed, threatened, or otherwise disparaged by malevolent outgroups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kramer, R. M.  |author2=Messick, D. M|title=Getting by with a little help from our enemies: Collective paranoia and its role in intergroup relations. In: Intergroup cognition and intergroup behavior. C. Sedikides, J. Schopler, &amp; C. A Insko (Eds.)|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=233–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when no such hostility exists, this distrust belief can cause group members to see any behavior by the other as hostile and malevolent.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"/&gt;
* '''Helplessness''': At the individual level, helplessness focuses on the belief that even carefully planned and executed actions will fail to produce the desired outcome. When taken at the group level, it translates into a collective mindset of powerlessness and dependency.  The group shares a pessimistic approach which focuses on their own weaknesses, and attributes setbacks to their own limitations.&lt;ref name="Eidelson, R. J. 2003"/&gt;   Helplessness, when it exists as a shared belief within a group, serves as a constraint on organized political movement, as those who participate in a social movement must see themselves as capable of righting the wrongs they perceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamson|first=W. A.|title=Constructing social process. In H. Johnston &amp; B. Klandermans (Eds.), Social movements and culture|year=1995|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|pages=85–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Horowitz also argues that the belief, regardless of its accuracy, that ones group is behind another group can also contribute to conflict and that such groups often face severe anxiety about threats emanating from other groups. The backwards group fears it will be ultimately dominated by more advanced groups. Backwards groups tend to view their individual members with negative qualities, such as laziness and lack of intelligence, while collectively they view themselves as unorganized and lacking unity, with members looking out only for themselves and not their group. In contrast, advanced groups' members are perceived as possessing positive qualities, such as conscientiousness, intelligence and industriousness, while collectively they are perceived as well-organized, cohesive and committed to advancing their group interests. Thus advanced groups are perceived as possessing superior attributes on both individual and collective levels. The resultant anxiety felt by backwards groups can cause them to believe their very survival as a group is a stake and that they risk disappearing, replaced by more advanced groups. Horowitz argues this means backwards groups are more likely to initiate violence.&lt;ref&gt; Horowitz, David, (2001).

==Intragroup conflict (infighting)==
{{anchor|Intragroup conflict}}
{{main|Intragroup conflict}}

===Sources===
*'''Task conflict''': Task conflict arises when intra-group members disagree on issues that are relevant to meeting shared goals. Effective groups and organizations make use of these conflicts to make plans, foster creativity, solve problems and resolve misunderstandings. However, people who disagree with the group do so at their own peril, even when their position is reasonable. [[Dissent]]ers often receive a high level of animosity from other group members, are less well-liked, assigned low-status tasks, and are sometimes ostracized.
*'''Process conflict''': Process conflict refers to disagreement over the methods or procedures the group should use in order to complete its tasks. It occurs when strategies, policies, and procedures clash. For example, some group members may suggest discussing conflicting ideas, while other group members prefer to put conflicting ideas to a vote. In essence, during procedural conflicts, group members disagree on ''how'' to disagree. Situations of procedural conflict can be preemptively minimized by adopting formal rules (e.g., bylaws, constitutions, statements of policies) that specify goals, decisional processes, and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houle|first=Cyril O.|title=Governing boards: Their nature and nurture|year=1989|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=1-55542-157-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Personal conflict''': Personal conflicts, also known as affective conflicts, personality conflicts, emotional conflicts, or relationship conflicts, are conflicts that occur when group members dislike one another. Personal dislikes do not always result in conflict, but people often mention their negative feelings toward another group member when complaining about their groups. Also, there is evidence that a large proportion of group conflicts are indeed personal conflicts. One study of high level corporate executives revealed that 40% of disputes were due to "individual enmity between the principals without specific reference to other issues" (Morrill, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;69). Criticism, when one person evaluates another, or his/her work negatively, is one common cause of personal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ilgen|first=D. R.|author2=Mitchell, T. R. |author3=Fredrickson, J. W. |title=Poor performers: Supervisors' and subordinates' responses.|journal=Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance|year=1981|volume=27|issue=3|pages=386–410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
Opinion is divided about the merits of infighting in political movements. Whereas "the majority of scholars view infighting as sapping political potency", others argue that "infighting's value lay in its potential to generate strategic possibilities and promote...accountability", and that (at least with respect to [[identity politics]]) "infighting is a key site for culture...concretizes cultural conversations".&lt;ref&gt;Amin Ghaziani, ''The Dividends of Dissent'' (2008) p. 15&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;

Among extremists "threatened by the existence of ''anyone'' else, unless that other person's views seem identical to his own", however, infighting and group fissions become the destructive norm: "they're all splitting up so fast...they seem to attack each other more than they attack their real enemies on the other side of the political spectrum".&lt;ref&gt;R. Skinner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1994) p. 132&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small group===
Within small groups, the same dichotomy exists. Granted that both constructive and destructive conflict occurs in most small groups, it is very important to accentuate the constructive conflict and minimize the destructive conflict. Conflict is bound to happen, but if used constructively need not be a bad thing.
 
Using constructive conflict within small groups by bringing up problems and alternative solutions (while still valuing others) allows the group to work forward.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N.; Wynn, Dianna R. (2007) (In English). working in groups 175–193 (4th ed.). Boston New York: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; While "conflict may involve interpersonal as well as task issues", keeping a window open for dissent can prove very advantageous, as where a company "reaped big benefits because it did not simply try to suppress conflict, but allowed minority influence to prevail".&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there is evidence that an organizational culture of disrespect unproductively "generates a morass of [[Social status|status]] games and infighting...'it's made people turn against each other'" - so that for example "[[sexual harassment]] becomes a chronic accompaniment to broader patterns of infighting".&lt;ref&gt;Randy Hodson, ''Dignity at Work'' (2001) p. 215 and p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] saw the roots of intra-group aggression in a regression to the "[[Narcissism|narcissistic]] moment in the subject", highlighting "the aggressivity involved in the effects of all regression, all arrested development, all rejection of typical development in the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neville Symington]] also saw narcissism as a key element in group conflict, singling out "organizations so riven by narcissistic currents that...little creative work was done".&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Such settings provide an opening for "many [[Egotism|egoistic]] instinct-feelings - as the desire to dominate and [[humiliate]] your fellow, the love of conflict - your courage and power against mine - the satisfaction of being the object of [[jealousy]], the pleasures derived from the exercise of cunning, deceit and concealment".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens J. France, in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] (2012) distinguished between two forms of intragroup conflict in organizations. In a "restorative" form, [[Object relations theory|paranoid-schizoid]] "splitting" can be transformed through [[scapegoating]] dynamics to produce reparative ("[[Object relations theory|depressive]]") intragroup relations. In a contrasting "perverse" form, intragroup trauma causes paranoid-schizoid functioning to fragment, resulting in an intersubjective "entanglement" with [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have not been able to evade the constraints of group conflict themselves: "Envy, rivalry, power conflicts, the formation of small groups, resulting in discord and intrigue, are a matter of course" in the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] world, for example, with institutions being "caught up in the factionalism of the ...struggle between the ins and the outs".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 106 and p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girard===&lt;!--Linked from 'René Girard'--&gt;
[[René Girard]] saw "collective violence as sacred...[as] the ''great remedy'' for communal life".&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''Job'' (1987) p. 29 and p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the violence directed at the group [[scapegoat]] as "absorbing all the internal tensions, feuds, and rivalries pent up within the community...a deliberate act of collective substitution".&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''Violence and the Sacred'' (1977) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

His view parallels the Freudian approach, rooted in ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', which considers that "transgression... is at the origin of a higher complexity, something to which the realm of civilization owes its development".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1992) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Freud saw violence as standing at the root of the social bond{{spaced ndash}} "what prevails is no longer the violence of an individual but that of a community"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}} and thus "politics made out of delinquency...the social contract establishes corporate virtue as an asylum for individual sin".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Brown, in John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard concluded therefore that regression and 'the dissolution of differences encourages the proliferation of the [[double bind]]...spells the disintegration of social institutions',&lt;ref&gt;Girard, ''Violence and the Sacred'' p. 188 and p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; to reveal the group conflict latent at their core.

==Literary examples==
* [[Sallust]] considered that the civil feuds which brought down the Roman Republic "had set in when the destruction of Rome's mighty enemy Carthage left her without an incentive to self-discipline".&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman et al eds. ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shakespeare]] had Henry IV urge his son, 'Be it thy course to busy giddy minds/With foreign quarrels'&lt;ref&gt;P. Alexander ed., ''William Shakespeare: The Complete Works'' (1962) p. 544&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s view of the divided Tory party at the end of Queen Anne's reign was that "a ship's crew quarrelling in a storm, or while their enemies are within gunshot, is but a faint idea of this infatuation".&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''The Peace and the Protestant Succession'' (1965) p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Mac Donald calls herself a secular conservative. She has argued that conservative thinking is superior to liberalism by virtue of the ideas alone, and that [[religion]] should not affect the argument and is unnecessary for conservatism.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Oppenheimer |title= A Place on the Right for a Few Godless Conservatives |publisher= ''New York Times'' |date=February 18, 2011 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/us/19beliefs.html| accessdate= 2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has criticized the treatment of boys as a victim group, and criticized universities for seeking to hire "diversity consultants" to help boys succeed.&lt;ref name=twsNovD42&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac Donald has criticized welfare and blamed [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] institutions such as the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Carnegie Corporation]] for suggesting that welfare is a [[rights|right]]; in particular, she has criticized welfare because "generations have grown up fatherless and dependent".&lt;ref name=twsNovD15/&gt; She has written that welfare programs serve as a "dysfunction enabler"&lt;ref name=twsNovD21/&gt; and that [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] cause an "unhealthy dependence".&lt;ref name=twsNovD22/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsNovD23/&gt; She has criticized American immigration policy as "importing another underclass", referring to [[Hispanic-Americans|Hispanics]], which has the "potential to expand indefinitely".&lt;ref name="twsNovD24"/&gt;

Mac Donald has also argued that the reduction in crime in American cities since 1991 is a result of efficient policing, high incarceration rates, more police officers working, data-driven approaches such as CompStat in which police efforts target high-crime areas, and holding precinct commanders accountable for results.&lt;ref name=twsNovD25/&gt; She has defended the [[Patriot Act]] and argued for secrecy and speed in handling problems as well as the sharing of information between departments within the intelligence community, and advocated that the benefits of government power be balanced against the risks of abuse.&lt;ref name=twsNovD44/&gt; She has advocated for religious profiling by the police on the grounds that "you cannot be an [[Islamic terrorist]] unless you're a member of the [[Islam|Muslim]] faith".&lt;ref name=twsNovD45/&gt; She has said that the [[Abu Ghraib prison scandal]]'s fallout was overblown and that opponents of then-President [[George W.

In a break with some other conservatives, Mac Donald has criticized [[talk radio]] for fueling "heightened rhetoric" and argued that criticism of President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] on talk radio programs was overdone.&lt;ref name=twsNovD51a/&gt; She views Obama as a moderate or "standard-issue" liberal, not a radical.&lt;ref name=twsNovD51a/&gt; She has also condemned conservative "hate gestures", such as an incident in which the doors and windows of Democrats who voted in favor of a health care bill were broken, as "cowardly and juvenile" acts.&lt;ref name=twsNovD51a/&gt;

She has been a very vocal critic of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, and was among the first to suggest a "[[Ferguson effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437548/ferguson-effect-real-heather-mac-donald-crime-stats-prove-it | title=The Dangerous War on Cops | work=National Review | date=8 July 2016 | accessdate=24 October 2016 | author=Russello, Gerald J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-the-racist-cop-1477261025 | title=The Myth of the Racist Cop | work=Wall Street Journal | date=24 October 2016 | accessdate=24 October 2016 | author=Mac Donald, Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also an outspoken critic of [[criminal justice reform]], such as the [[Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act]], which she testified against in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/myth-criminal-justice-racism-10231.html | title=The Myth of Criminal-Justice Racism | work=City Journal | date=22 October 2015 | accessdate=24 October 2016 | author=Mac Donald, Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 talk given at [[Hillsdale College]], Mac Donald criticized the #MeToo social media movement, arguing that it is the latest in a long line of leftist victimhood culture "frenzies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/265864406 | title=The Danger of the #metoo Movement | work=Imprimis | date= 18 April 2018| accessdate =21 April 2018 | author = Mac Donald, Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by an audience member whether women who wear revealing bathing suits should share fault with their aggressors in cases of sexual assault, Mac Donald responded: “What you just did would be referred to as slut shaming...

==Opposition==
In spring 2017, a protest group announced plans to "shut down" Mac Donald's speech on the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement at a college campus in California, on the grounds that she is racist, fascist, and anti-black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslow|first1=Samuel|title=Students Blockade Athenaeum to Protest Conservative Speaker|url=http://tsl.news/news/6695/|website=The Student Life|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, around 250 protesters surrounded audience members and prevented them from entering the building where she was speaking at [[Claremont McKenna College]], whose president, Hiram Chodosh, afterward said, "Based on the judgment of the Claremont Police Department, we jointly concluded that any forced interventions or arrests would have created unsafe conditions for students, faculty, staff, and guests." Mac Donald ultimately gave the talk to a small audience in the [[Claremont McKenna College#Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum|Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum]] that was live-streamed on Claremont McKenna's website.

A '''hill figure''' is a large visual representation created by cutting into a steep hillside and revealing the underlying geology. It is a type of [[geoglyph]] usually designed to be seen from afar rather than above. In some cases trenches are dug and rubble made from material brighter than the natural [[bedrock]] is placed into them. The new material is often [[chalk]], a soft and white form of [[limestone]], leading to the alternative name of '''chalk figure''' for this form of art.

Hill figures cut in grass are a phenomenon especially seen in [[England]], where examples include the [[Cerne Abbas Giant]], the [[Uffington White Horse]], the [[Long Man of Wilmington]], as well as the "lost" carvings at [[Cambridge]], [[Oxford]] and [[Plymouth Hoe]]. From the 18th century onwards, many further ones were added.  Many figures long thought to be ancient have been found to be relatively recent when subjected to modern archaeological scrutiny, at least in their current form. Only the Uffington White Horse appears to retain a prehistoric shape, while the Cerne Abbas Giant may be prehistoric, Romano-British, or Early Modern. Nevertheless, these figures, and their possible lost companions, have been iconic in the English people's conception of their past. 

==History==
The creation of hill figures has been practised since [[prehistory]] and can include human and animal forms. Cutting of horses is common, as well as more abstract symbols and, in the modern era, advertising brands.

The reasons for the creation for the figures are varied and obscure. The Uffington Horse probably held political significance, since the figure dominates the valley below. It probably dates to the [[British Iron Age]] since coins have been found exhibiting the symbol. The Cerne Abbas Giant might have been a work of [[political satire]].&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/cerne-abbas-giant.htm|title=Cerne Abbas Giant|author=|date=|work=sacred-destinations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wiltshire]] is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]] with a large number of White Horses; 14 have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk/index.html|title=Wiltshire White Horses|author=|date=|work=wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are usually created by the cutting away of the top layer of relatively poor soil on suitable hillsides. This exposes the white chalk beneath, which contrasts well with the short green hill grass, and the image is clearly visible for a considerable distance. Despite most of the figures being of great age, many are relatively new. [[Devizes]] in Wiltshire created a large white horse for the 2000 Millennium celebrations and in October 2009 celebrated this with an aerial photo of volunteers making the figure 10 for an aerial photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roundway Hill and covert, Oliver's castle and Millennium White Horse|url=http://www.devizesheritage.org.uk/olivers_castle_and_roundway_hill.html|website=devizeheritage.org.uk|accessdate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304180203/http://www.devizesheritage.org.uk/olivers_castle_and_roundway_hill.html|archivedate=4 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures must be maintained to remain visible, and local people often work regularly to restore or maintain a local landmark, though two cuttings of military badges at [[Sutton Mandeville]], Wiltshire, are becoming lost. A map of [[Australia]] at [[Compton Chamberlayne]], Wiltshire, was lost in 2005.

Similar pictures exist elsewhere in the world, notably the far larger [[Nazca Lines]] in [[Peru]], which are on flat land but visible from hills in the area. However these were made in desert terrain rather than on grassy hillsides, so have not become overgrown and thus have survived much longer without maintenance. The Nazca Lines were formed by removing loose stones from the lines to expose the whiteish underlying soil, which is not itself dug.

===Terminology===

[[Geoglyph]] is the usual term for structures carved into or otherwise made from rock formations.

In 1949, Morris Marples "half-humorously" coined the words "leucippotomy for the cutting of white horses and gigantotomy for the cutting of giants on rare occasions".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Marples, "White horses and other hill figures", Publisher: A. Sutton, 1949 (reprint), {{ISBN|0904387593}}, 9780904387599, 223 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=t1B3UOLHFcWr0QWd3YGQAw&amp;id=5Q4aAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Gigantotomy+morris&amp;q=Gigantotomy+Leucippotomy#search_anchor page 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timpson, "Timpson's Other England: A Look at the Unusual and the Definitely Odd", Publisher: Jarrold, 1994, {{ISBN|071170645X}}, 9780711706453, 224 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v3KCYyLL8bEC&amp;q=Gigantotomy+Leucippotomy.&amp;dq=Gigantotomy+Leucippotomy.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OtUHgPVsF9&amp;sig=usNFWidsu94Pd2LfevxpNffiVI8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CFyFUM22LIb80QXPyoDIBA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg page 68]

==Construction==
Until recently, three methods were used to construct white hill figures.

*The stripping method: where the soil is thin, the turf or soil is stripped away to expose the chalk underneath. This produces quick results but the figure needs regular maintenance, as it would soon become overgrown. This was a practice for hill figures but not as much for horses. The Laverstock Panda at [[Laverstock]] near Salisbury, Wiltshire was constructed this way in 1968 and is now lost. Traces of figures of this type are not usually found after the figure is overgrown.
*The covering method: rocks are placed on top of the turf. This method is normally used when there is no underlying chalk, the chalk is deep or tools are not available. The maintenance for these figures is very high. There are several examples, such as the [[Woolbury White Horse]] in Hampshire. This method leaves no trace of the figure's existence when overgrown, as is the case of the lost [[Fovant Badges]] in Wiltshire.
*The trenching method, which is by far the most common method of hill figure construction. The underlying chalk where some white horses are constructed is not near the surface, so a trench is dug and chalk from another site is used to fill it. The [[Uffington White Horse]] in Oxfordshire is the prime example of this method. This method is invasive in the hillside and allows traces of the figure to be seen even when the figure has been overgrown for many years, an example being the original [[Devizes White Horse]], cut in 1845 and lost sometime in the mid 20th century, but rediscovered when traces reappeared.

The biggest threat to white horses and other hill figures is natural vegetation covering the figures. In the case of chalk figures, natural vegetation encroaches from the edges and can grow on soil washed onto the figure by rain. Water erosion can also be a problem on steep or gentle slopes, because rain can wash the chalk off the horse, or soil onto the horse. Larger horses are more susceptible to this. If chalk is washed off the horse, the horse gradually creeps down the slope; or if soil is washed onto the horse, it collects onto the lower edges and the horse gradually climbs up the slope. A solution is to provide drainage, either using run-off drains, as at Uffington White Horse, or a [[french ditch]].

==Human figures==
While presumed to be of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] origin, surviving examples may have been created only within the last four hundred years.&lt;ref Name="Bergamar"&gt;Bergamar, Kate (1997). Discovering Hill Figures. Pub. Shire. {{ISBN|0-7478-0345-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these giants only two survive: one near the village of [[Cerne Abbas]], to the north of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], in [[Dorset]] and one at Wilmington, [[Long Man]] [[civil parish]] in the [[Wealden District|Wealden]] District of [[East Sussex]]. Examples located at [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge]], and on [[Plymouth Hoe]] can no longer be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref Name="Bergamar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilt&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistorical Wiltshire|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/statue/1287/English/Salisbur/stoneh1.htm|website=fortunecity.com|accessdate=5 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040315152542/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/statue/1287/English/Salisbur/stoneh1.htm|archivedate=15 March 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="giants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waysideofwiltshire.co.uk/holiday-accommodation-chippenham.html|title=Wayside of Wiltshire|author=|date=|work=Bed &amp; Breakfast and Self Catering Holiday Accommodation in beautiful Wiltshire|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410044604/http://www.waysideofwiltshire.co.uk/holiday-accommodation-chippenham.html|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Osmington White Horse]] carries a rider ([[King George III]]) but is not considered an example of gigantotomy due to the name of the figure referring to the horse.

===Cerne Abbas Giant===
{{main|Cerne Abbas Giant}}
The [[Cerne Abbas Giant]], also referred to as the "Rude Man" or the "Rude Giant", is a hill figure of a giant naked man {{convert|180|ft|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|167|ft|abbr=on}} wide&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt; figure is carved into the side of a steep hill, and is best viewed from the opposite side of the valley or from the air. The carving is formed by a [[trench]] {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide,&lt;ref name="sd" /&gt; and about the same depth, which has been cut through grass and earth into the underlying [[chalk]]. In his right hand the giant holds a knobbled [[Club (weapon)|club]] {{convert|120|ft|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name="sd" /&gt;

Its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the [[British Iron Age|Celtic]], [[Roman Britain|Roman]] or even [[Early Medieval]] periods difficult to prove. Above and to the right of the Giant's head is an [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] known as the "Trendle", or "Frying Pan". [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] writings refer to this location as "Trendle Hill", but make no mention of the giant, leading to the conclusion that it was probably only carved about 400 years ago. In contrast, the [[Uffington White Horse]]{{snd}} an unquestionably [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] hill figure on the [[North Wessex Downs|Berkshire Downs]]{{snd}} was noticed and recorded by medieval authors.&lt;ref name="sd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutchins&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutchins |first=John |authorlink=John Hutchins (antiquary) |others=Robert Douch (Contributor) |title=The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset |origyear=1742 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1973 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Oxford |language= |isbn=0-87471-336-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long Man of Wilmington===
[[File:Long Man of Wilmington.jpg|thumb|The [[Long Man of Wilmington]] seen from a distance]]
{{main|Long Man of Wilmington}}
The [[Long Man of Wilmington]] is a located on one of the steep slopes of Windover Hill, six miles (9.6&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Eastbourne]]. The figure is 227 feet (69&amp;nbsp;m) tall and designed to look in proportion when viewed from below, and is shown holding two staves. The earliest record was made by the surveyor John Rowley in the year 1710. This drawing suggests that the original figure was a shadow or indentation in the grass, rather than the solid outline of a human figure. The staves were not depicted as a rake and scythe as was once thought, and the head was a helmet shape. Sir William Borrow's drawing of 1766 shows the figure holding a rake and a scythe, both shorter than the staves.&lt;ref name="cope"&gt;''The Modern Antiquarian'', Julian Cope, Thorsons 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1874, the Long Man's outline was only visible in certain light conditions as a different shade in the hillside grass, or after a light fall of snow. In that year an antiquarian marked out the outline with yellow bricks, later cemented together. It has been claimed that the 'restoration' process distorted the position of the feet, an assertion backed up by several who had been familiar with the figure before 1874, and also by later resistivity surveys.&lt;ref name="Castleden2002"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-285-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_140/Castleden.pdf |title=Shape-shifting: The changing outline of the Long Man of Wilmington |journal=Sussex Archaeological Collections |first=Rodney |last=Castleden |issue=140 |pages=83–95 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been suggested that it removed the Long Man's genitalia, though there is no historical or archaeological evidence which supports that claim.&lt;ref name="cope"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unknown'', Issue Jan 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide range of dates of origin have been proposed for the Long Man, but more recent archaeological work done by the [[University of Reading]] suggests that the figure dates from the 16th or 17th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Derbyshire |title=Prehistoric Long Man is '16th century new boy' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1443003/Prehistoric-Long-Man-is-16th-century-new-boy.html |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2 October 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plymouth Hoe giants===
{{main|Plymouth Hoe}}

[[Firle Corn]] in [[Firle]], [[Sussex]] is a nearly-lost hill figure whose existence can be seen by [[infrared photography]]. Now looking more like a small [[maize|ear of corn]] or a strange weapon than a human figure, there is a legend suggesting that a giant called Gill was once cut on this same hill and that he was considered an adversary of the Long Man of Wilmington not far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/hillfigs/lost/firle.htm|title=Firle Corn|author=|date=|work=hows.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one story, the giant on Firle Beacon threw his hammer at the Wilmington giant and killed him, and that the figure on the hillside marks the place where his body fell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/63/long_man_of_wilmington.html Scraps of Folklore Collected by John Philipps Emslie, C.

==Horse figures==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
There are 16 known white horse hill figures in the UK, or 17 including the painted one at [[Cleadon#Cleadon Hills|Cleadon Hills]].

The Luzley White Horse near [[Mossley]], cut in 1981, was neglected in 1992 after its creator died, but was not completely lost for some time.

Eight of the current white horses, and at least five of the lost figures, are in Wiltshire. The white horse is now generally considered a symbol of Wiltshire. An 1872 sketch of the Cherhill White Horse was later featured in the unofficial flag of Wiltshire, the [[Flag of Wiltshire#White Horse Flag|White Horse Flag]]. It was designed after its designer, Chrys Fear, decided the white horse symbol had a stronger connection to Wiltshire than the Great Bustard on the official flag. Additionally, for the third millennium, it was proposed that a white horse should feature on one of the surrounding hills in [[Devizes]] (It became the [[Devizes White Horse|Devizes Millennium White Horse]]). Smaller white horses now feature in Wiltshire, such as a replica of the Devizes White Horse in a Devizes primary school and two proposed white horses to feature on a roundabout in Marlborough (both towns already have larger white horses.) Liddington Hill near [[Swindon]] is the latest location in Wiltshire to have a proposed white horse, in the early 2000s, although the idea was abandoned.

If the names of the horses are not capitalised, it is because these are an adopted nickname, rather than a general consensus on its name or the official name.

==Lost figures==
Since hill figures must be maintained by the removal of regrown turf, only those that motivate the local populace to look after them survive. Surviving ancient figures all have an associated fair or ceremony that involves maintaining them.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Unmaintained figures gradually fade away.&lt;ref name="hows"&gt;{{cite web|last = Hows|first=Mark|title=Lost Figures|work=Hillfigure site|url=http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/hillfigs/lost/lostfig.htm|accessdate = 2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Firle Corn]] at [[Firle Beacon]], [[Sussex]] could be a lost figure. Its existence is suggested by [[infrared photography]]. If it is a lost figure, its age is uncertain, and unlikely [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] in origin, as only one figure in the UK has been shown to be of this age, the [[Uffington White Horse]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

There have been horses at Devizes and [[Pewsey]], both in Wiltshire, that have been lost but replaced by new ones in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="hows"/&gt;

==Influence on other art forms==
The white horses of Wiltshire, of which there are currently nine, have inspired other sculptures in the county. Julive Livsey's sculpture ''White Horse Pacified'' (1987) in Shaw, [[Swindon]] was inspired by the white horses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/10638539.Staying_in_the_public_eye/ Staying in the public eye (From Swindon Advertiser)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Charlotte Moreton created the steel sculpture ''White Horse'' (2010) for Solstice Park, [[Amesbury]], taking influence from the white horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOLSTICE PARK SCULPTURES|url=http://www.solsticepark.com/files/2713/9284/1982/solstice-park-sculptures-leaflet-Nov-2013.pdf|website=Solsticepark.com|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A roundabout in Westbury, which features views of Westbury White Horse, features a canvas of the horse, with the horse also featuring in a mosaic in the town. When the county was choosing an [[Flag of Wiltshire|official flag]] in 2006–07, a suggested nominee was the "[[Flag of England|White Horse Flag]]", featuring Cherhill White Horse. The Town Flag of [[Pewsey]], registered in September 2014, features the Pewsey White Horse at its centre.

==Some of the most significant figures==

===England===
In England there are at least fifty landscape figures, the majority of which are in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Clarke, ''The Rude Man of Cerne Abbas and Other Wessex Oddities'', Lyme Regis, Nigel J. Clarke Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-907683-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The phrase "forensic photo", relating to a few lost figures, refers to photos taken with appropriate filters, in optimum lighting, often at times of severe drought or snow covering, to bring out features no longer normally visible.)

'''Inkshares''' is a publishing and literary [[Collective rights management|rights-management]] platform founded in 2013.  It is an open platform with a community of over 100,000 authors and readers.  Authors post partial manuscripts which are sorted based on reader interest.  Selected manuscripts are edited by Inkshares for [[publishing]] in North America, sale into foreign territories, and development in television and film.

Inkshares investors include [[Ingram Ventures]], [[Indicator Ventures]], and prominent angels in the media and entertainment space.  Inkshares has strategic relationships with Ingram for North American [[book distribution]] and [[The United Talented Agency]] for representation and packaging in television and film.

Inkshares has been called “the future of publishing” by ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/02/07/star-wars-writer-gary-whitta-journeys-to-the-future-of-publishing/|title=‘Star Wars’ Writer Gary Whitta Journeys to the Future of Publishing|last=Calia|first=Michael|date=2015-02-07|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/futurebook/meet-inkshares-studio-books-making-waves-london-book-fair-511001|title=Meet Inkshares, the "studio for books" hoping to conquer London Book Fair {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==

===  Founders and Founding ===
Inkshares was founded in 2013 by Thaddeus Woodman, Lawrence Levitsky, Adam Gomolin, and Jeremy Thomas. The original notion for Inkshares was developed by Woodman, whose parents founded a successful computer-book publishing company called Ventana Press in the 1990s. Spurred by the success of Kickstarter and the promise of the equity crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act, Woodman initially sought to create an equity crowdfunding portal for books.

Woodman discussed the concept with Levitsky, a former founding vice president of RealNetworks, who had worked at Ventana Press with Woodman’s parents after running Microsoft Press.  Levitsky introduced Woodman to Gomolin, a securities attorney and represented screenwriter.  After the three raised a small $250k friend-and-family-round in late 2013, they hired Thomas as a co-founder and Chief Technical Officer.

=== Funding Rounds ===
Woodman, Gomolin, and Levitsky raised a $250k friends-and-family round in late 2013.  In the summer of 2014, Inkshares raised its first seed round with participation from Ingram Ventures (the venture arm of the largest book distributor in the world) and Indicator Ventures.  The round also had participation from prominent publishing angels including Nion McEvoy, CEO of Chronicle Books.

Inkshares raised follow-on seed rounds in 2016 and 2017, including participation from 555 Capital and prominent Hollywood angels including Warner Brothers president of film and chief creative officer Greg Silverman.

=== Early Premise and Formation ===
The original notion presented by Woodman was to create a platform akin to “Kickstarter meets Random House” but complete with the ability to sell shares in a book so that readers could participate in the revenue stream for titles.  At the time, while the Jobs Act had directed the SEC to create “equity crowdfunding,” the SEC had yet to promulgate rules, ultimately doing so multiple years late.  Inkshares initially launched without the equity component, receiving extensive press in outlets including Fast Company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3027396/can-a-startup-help-publishers-cut-out-twitter-facebook-and-flipboard|title=Can A Startup Help Publishers Cut Out Twitter, Facebook, And Flipboard?|date=2014-03-07|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Publishers Weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63694-inkshares-looks-to-marry-the-old-with-the-new.html|title=Inkshares Looks to Marry the Old with the New|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of Inkshares ==

=== Evolution of Funding Model ===
The original Inkshares model was premised on donations.  Inkshares generated funding goals based on page length and projected design and print costs, and patrons could donate as much as they would like.  Multiple successful projects were funded during this period, including ''The Astronaut Instruction Manual'' and ''The Show''.

Beginning in 2015, Thomas, Woodman, and Gomolin moved the model from donations to pre-orders, starkly limiting the amount any one person could donate to a project.  The first project to fund under this new model was ''Abomination'', the debut novel of Gary Whitta, screenwriter of The Book of Eli and Star Wars: Rogue One.  Though this “pre-order” model made it harder for books to fund, Thomas, Woodman, and Gomolin believed that it would stop the type of vanity publishing that frequently occurred on Kickstarter and help map to genuine reader interest.  During this period, Levitsky left the company to pursue his own imprint.

In late 2016, Inkshares began measuring non-monetary engagement such as shares, likes, and total times spent by readers on selected manuscripts.  The first book published on the basis of engagement rather than pre-orders was ''Devil’s Call'' by J. Danielle Dorn.

=== Evolution of Rights Management ===
By early 2016, Inkshares was experiencing significant growth in not just publishing but rights management.  This had always been a significant focus for Gomolin, who had been represented in Hollywood and as Inkshares general counsel had written rights-management contracts into Inkshares’ first contracts in 2014.  In 2015, Inkshares sold the streaming television rights for Filip Syta’s ''The Show'' to Blackpills in a large deal publicized by Business Insider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/filip-syta-the-show-google-film-movie-2016-3?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=They're going to make a movie of the Google employee's novel which describes all the sex and drugs at a fictional search ad company|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately following this, Inkshares sold the audiobook rights to Penguin Random House in a six-figure deal that was rumoured to be the largest debut-author audio deal of the year.  Later that year, Inkshares would sell Mike Mongo’s ''The Astronaut Instruction Manual'' to Legendary Entertainment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/astronaut-instruction-manual-heading-tv-910221|title='Astronaut Instruction Manual' Heading to TV From Legendary, Matt Tolmach (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J-F Dubeau’s ''A God in the Shed'' to Skydance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/skydance-lands-hot-manuscript-a-god-in-the-shed-from-j-f-dubeau-with-akiva-goldsman-set-to-produce-exclusive/|title=Skydance Lands Hot Manuscript "A God In The Shed" from J.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">'''James Walter Miller''' (1890–1950) was an American citizen and an alleged asset of the San Francisco Office of the [[KGB]] from 1943 to 1945.  Miller worked in the [[United States Government]]  wartime mail censorship office. Miller was allegedly [[Agent handling#Recruitment|recruited]] into [[espionage]] for the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Isaac Folkoff]] of the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA). His cover name was "Vague".

Born '''Milawski''' in [[Russia]], he changed his name to Miller after coming to the United States in 1907.  He became a member of the Communist Party in Los Angeles.  Miller was associated with Victor Milo while in the California Communist Party. Miller at one time worked for ''Russky Golos'' ''(Russian Voice)'', the [[American-Russian Institute]], and ''[[People's World]]''.

Miller was one of Folkoff's most valuable agents. Miller spoke Russian, and was a Russian-language translator with the financial and trade section of the U.S. government wartime mail censorship office. Miller worked in an area of considerable interest to Soviet intelligence.  In 1943 Folkoff passed on to the KGB material from Miller on several occasions. San Francisco ''Rezident'' [[Grigory Kheifets]] attested to Miller's ''bone fides'' in a Venona decrypt, putting to rest reservations from Moscow that because of Miller's eagerness, he may be a double agent.

Miller began passing information to [[Harrison George]] at the ''People's World''.  In 1943 Miller reported the Mail Censor's office found secret writing in a letter that a Naval [[GRU]] Officer sent to Moscow.  In 1944 Miller came to the attention of the [[FBI]] in the "Comintern Apparatus" investigation. The FBI witnessed Miller meeting Kheifets at least six times in early 1944. Miller was eventually forced out of the government office.  He died in 1950.

'''Javindo''', also known by the [[pejorative]] name '''Krontjong''', was a [[Dutch-based creole languages|Dutch-based creole language]] spoken on [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The name Javindo is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Java'' and ''[[Indo people|Indo]]'', the Dutch word for a person of mixed [[Indonesia]]n and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent. This contact language developed from communication between [[Javanese language|Javanese]]-speaking mothers and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking fathers in [[Indo people|Indo]] families. Its main speakers were Indo-Eurasian people. Its grammar was based on Javanese while the vocabulary was based on Dutch. Dutch lexicon was pronounced in a Javanese manner.&lt;ref&gt;Willems, Wim ''Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600–1942).'', Part III by de Gruiter, V.E. (COMT, Leiden, 1994) {{ISBN|90-71042-44-8}} P.140-143&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though most words are derived from the Dutch language its grammar and sentence construction is mostly Javanese including elements such as: morphology; lack of verbs; no past tense; no [[finite verb]].&lt;ref&gt;Willems, Wim ''Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600–1942).'', Part III by de Gruiter, V.E. (COMT, Leiden, 1994) {{ISBN|90-71042-44-8}} P.150&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with [[Petjo language|Petjo]], a different Dutch- and Malay-based creole also spoken by Indo-Eurasians. With the loss of the generation that lived in the [[Dutch East Indies]] era, this language has almost died out.

They include the [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Rakhine people|Arakanese]] (Rakhine), [[Marma people|Marma]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]], [[Chak people|Chak]], [[Pankho people|Pankho]], [[Mru]], [[Bawm]], [[Lushai]], [[Khyang people|Khyang]], [[Gurkha]], [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese]], [[Jalia Kaibarta|Keot (Kaibarta)]],  [[Santal]], and [[Khumi people|Khumi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Schendel|first=Willem|title=Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World |year=2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1860642616 |page=141 |editor=Willem van Schendel, Erik J.

The name ''jumma'' ("''jum'' farmer") is derived from ''jum'' cultivation, or [[slash-and-burn]] farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Rajkumari Chandra Kalindi|title=Land Rights of the Indigenous Peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQShJjSoF-MC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2000|publisher=IWGIA|isbn=978-87-90730-29-1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[reappropriate]]d term originally used by outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghanea-Hercock|first1=Nazila|last2=Xanthaki|first2=Alexandra|last3=Thornberry|first3=Patrick|title=Minorities, Peoples and Self-determination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkupctPeacEC&amp;pg=PA115 |year=2005|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-14301-7|page=115|quote= It differentiates them from their plains neighbours and was initially used in a derogatory manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as ''Pahari'', which simply means "hill people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=International Labour Office|title=Traditional occupations of indigenous and tribal peoples: Emerging trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_84Gg-o5BhYC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2000 |publisher=International Labour Organization| isbn=978-92-2-112258-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jummas are native people, unrelated to [[Bengali language|Bangla]] spoken by [[ethnic Bengali]]s. Religiously they are distinct as well, most being Buddhist, some Hindu and some are Christianized, with only a small number having converted to Islam. In addition, they have retained some traditional religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samaddar|first=Ranabir|title=Refugees and the State: Practices of Asylum and Care in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cuGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|date=2003-07-04|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0377-6|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in which Bangladesh achieved independence, the country's majority [[Bengali Muslims]] began strategically colonising the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), which has displaced the Jumma people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asaa.asn.au/ethnic-violence-bangladesh-assault-minority-peoples-continues/|title=Ethnic violence in Bangladesh: assault on minority peoples continues - Asian Studies Association of Australia|date=2017-08-02|work=Asian Studies Association of Australia|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1978 and 1984, the government incentivised over 400,000 Bengali Muslims to settle in the CHT, by offering each family 5 acres of land and free food rations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Nationalism and Intra-State Conflicts in the Postcolonial World|last=I|first=Fonkem Achankeng|date=2015-09-28|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9781498500265|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1979 and 1997, Bengali Muslim settlers and the Bangladesh military carried out over 15 major massacres of Buddhist peoples in the CHT.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the outbreaks of violence, communal and social unrest, many fled to the Indian states of Mizoram and Tripura, or to Burma (now Myanmar).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Bangladesh government has also forcibly converted Marmas from Buddhism to Islam and destroyed Buddhist temples ([[kyaung]]), as means of integrating them into Bangladeshi society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] reports document systematic accounts of torture and extrajudicial executions of tribal inhabitants of the Chittagong Hill Tracts by security forces during 1989 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/196000/asa130091991en.pdf|title=Human rights violations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts: An update|last=|first=|date=1991-09-13|website=Amnesty International|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Human Rights Watch]] has consistently reported that "indigenous groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) have for decades faced discrimination, forced displacement, assaults, evictions, and destruction of property by both Bangladeshi security forces and Bengali settlers from the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/bangladesh#807546|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in Bangladesh|date=2017-12-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/bangladesh#807546|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Bangladesh|date=2017-01-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali settlers and soldiers have raped native Jumma (Chakma) women "with impunity" with the Bangladeshi security forces doing little to protect the Jummas and instead assisting the rapists and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/10141|title=Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh – rapists act with impunity|last1=McEvoy|first1=Mark|last2=|first2=|date=3 April 2014|website=Survival International - The movement for tribal peoples|publisher=|access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Bengali rioters burned 100 indigenous homes in [[Langadu Upazila|Langadu]], reportedly even as army and police looked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/spotlight/the-run-1417459|title=Longadu burning|date=2017-06-09|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lactation consultant''' is a [[health professional]] who specializes in the clinical management of [[breastfeeding]]. The International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLCE) certifies lactation consultants who meet its criteria and have passed its exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iblce.org/|title=IBLCE|website=Iblce.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Lactation consultants are trained to assist mothers in preventing and solving [[breastfeeding difficulties]]{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} such as sore nipples and [[low milk supply]]. They commonly work in hospitals, [[physician]] or [[midwife]] practices, [[public health]] programs, and private practice. In the United States, lactation consultants are often nurses, midwives, [[nurse practitioner]]s, and dieticians who have obtained additional certification.{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} 

==History and organization==
The IBLCE was founded by a group of [[La Leche League]] leaders who wanted to professionalize the skills they had developed while working with breastfeeding mothers.&lt;ref name="The LLL Leader and the IBCLC--A Partnership in Breastfeeding History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvjunjul00p52.html|title=LLLI - The LLL Leader and the IBCLC - A Partnership in Breastfeeding History|work=www.llli.org|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} Candidates can choose various pathways to qualify, including options for current health professionals and volunteers, through college or university academic programs, or through mentoring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iblce.org/continuing-education-review/application-information/|title=IBLCE Continuing Education Review / Application Information|website=Iblce.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and may use the [[post nominals]] IBCLC and/or RLC after her name. The International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA) is the [[professional association]] for lactation consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilca.org/home|title=ILCA Home|website=Ilca.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Exclusive and partial breastfeeding are more common among mothers who gave birth in IBCLC-equipped hospitals.&lt;ref name=ussg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/executivesummary.pdf|title=US Surgeon General Breastfeeding Executive Summary|author=|date=|website=surgeongeneral.gov|accessdate=6 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513032923/https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/executivesummary.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[maternity hospital]]s, a ratio of one IBCLC for every 15 [[postpartum period|postpartum mothers]] is suggested.{{sfn|Lawrence|2016|p=246}} The [[U.S. Surgeon General]] recommends that all communities ensure access to services provided by lactation consultants.&lt;ref name=ussg/&gt; Evidence found that breastfeeding interventions including lactation consultants and counselors increased the number of women initiating breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Sanjay|last2=Patel|first2=Shveta|date=August 2016|title=The Effectiveness of Lactation Consultants and Lactation Counselors on Breastfeeding Outcomes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26644419|journal=Journal of Human Lactation: Official Journal of International Lactation Consultant Association|volume=32|issue=3|pages=530–541|doi=10.1177/0890334415618668|issn=1552-5732|pmid=26644419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries or dependencies by [[income inequality metrics]]''', including [[Gini coefficient]]s. The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds with perfect equality (where everyone has the same income) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality (where one person has all the income{{mdash}}and everyone else has zero income). Income distribution can vary greatly from wealth distribution in a country (see [[List of countries by distribution of wealth]]).

==Society==
The Mal Paharias who live in the southern hills of [[Damin-i-koh]] and in the south and east of [[Santhal Parganas]] have been Hinduised. Among themselves they speak a corrupt form of Bengali, but with others they speak Bengali and Hindi. The Bengali and Devenagari scripts are used by them.

[[File:Dwayne Jones in Car.jpg|thumb|Dwayne Jones sitting in a car's driver seat]]
'''Dwayne Jones''' was a Jamaican 16-year-old who was killed by a [[mobbing|violent mob]] in [[Montego Bay]] in 2013, after he attended a dance party dressed in women's clothing.{{efn|While some media commentators describe Jones as [[transgender]],&lt;ref name="PinkNewsVigil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; his best friend described him using male pronouns,&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; and so other sources refer to him as a [[cross-dressing|cross-dresser]]&lt;ref name="Gleaner28"/&gt; or [[gender variance|gender non-conforming]].&lt;ref name="J-FLAG"/&gt;}} The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of [[LGBT rights in Jamaica]].

Perceived as [[effeminancy|effeminate]], Jones was [[bullying|bullied]] in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with [[transgender]] friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the [[Irwin, Jamaica|Irwin]] area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the [[cross-dressing]] Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.

The event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was also the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's [[Cabinet of Jamaica|Justice Minister]]. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to [[LGBT rights by country|LGBT rights]] and [[human rights]] – among them [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Jamaicans for Justice]], and the [[J-FLAG|Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays]] – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.

Raised in an impoverished slum in [[Montego Bay]], a city in northwest Jamaica, Jones faced bullying at high school from students who perceived his behaviour as [[effeminacy|effeminate]].&lt;ref name="McFadden"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/jamaica-transgender-teen-murdered-mob|title=In Jamaica, transgender teen killed by mob|work=[[Associated Press]]|author=McFadden, David|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103213141/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/jamaica-transgender-teen-murdered-mob|archivedate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webpronews.com/transgender-teen-dwayne-jones-murdered-by-mob-2013-08|title=Transgender Teen Dwayne Jones Murdered by Mob|publisher=Web Pro News|author=Wills, Courtney|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MLxS4Ckk?url=http://www.webpronews.com/transgender-teen-dwayne-jones-murdered-by-mob-2013-08|archivedate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jones was 14, his father ejected him from the family home and encouraged neighbours to chase him out of the neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; After a period sleeping in bushes and on beaches, he began [[squatting]] in a derelict house in the hills above Montego Bay with two transgender friends, Keke and Khloe, both 23 at the time of Jones' death.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Jones was known among friends as "Gully Queen",&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; a reference to the storm drainage systems in which many homeless LGBT Jamaicans live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2014/07/31/watch-go-underground-jamaicas-gully-queens|title=WATCH: Go Underground with Jamaica's 'Gully Queens'|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|Advocate]]|date=31 July 2014|accessdate=5 July 2015|author=Senzee, Thom|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnrysiKo?url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2014/07/31/watch-go-underground-jamaicas-gully-queens|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends noted that Jones desired to become a teacher or to work in the [[Tourism in Jamaica|tourist industry]].&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/11/homophobia_a_way_of_life_in_jamaica.html|title=Homophobia a way of life in Jamaica|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|author=Quinn, Jennifer|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MLxmvhJe?url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/11/homophobia_a_way_of_life_in_jamaica.html|archivedate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to become a performer like the American pop star [[Lady Gaga]], and had won a local dancing competition.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Khloe described him as "a diva" who was "always very feisty and joking around".&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;

===Anti-LGBT sentiment in Jamaica===
In 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said that Jamaica may be the most [[homophobia|homophobic]] country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Padgett, Tim|title=The Most Homophobic Place on Earth?|date=12 April 2006|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101043423/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1182991%2C00.html|archivedate=1 January 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's [[LGBT rights in Jamaica#Laws, policies, and the Jamaican constitution|laws criminalising same-sex activity]] between males were introduced in 1864, during the [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial administration]]. According to the [[Sexual Offences Act of 2009]], any man convicted under these laws must register as a [[sex offender]].&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt; These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace,&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt; including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any criminal act.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] songs, among them [[Buju Banton]]'s "Boom Bye Bye", call for the killing of gays.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Writing for the ''[[International Business Times]]'' in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was "awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality."&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, [[Brian Williamson]] and [[Lenford Harvey|Steve Harvey]], were murdered.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; In the summer of 2013, [[Human Rights Watch]] carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt;

==Murder==
On the evening of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female clothing and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the [[Irwin, Jamaica|Irwin]] area.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrieFM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iriefm.net/news/headline/cross-dressing-teen-killed-mob|title=Cross dressing teen killed by mob|publisher=Irie FM|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=22 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCdlc9nP?url=http://www.iriefm.net/news/headline/cross-dressing-teen-killed-mob|archivedate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGBTNation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/07/cross-dressing-gay-teen-hacked-stabbed-to-death-by-jamaican-mob/|title=Cross-dressing gay teen hacked, stabbed to death by Jamaican mob|publisher=LGBTQ Nation|author=Littauer, Dan|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnsazdVb?url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/07/cross-dressing-gay-teen-hacked-stabbed-to-death-by-jamaican-mob/|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived by taxi at around 2&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Jones [[passing (gender)|passed]] as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing [[homophobia|homophobic]] persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl with whom he had previously been to church.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, "Are you a woman or a man?"&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Discovering his sex, they started calling him "[[batty boy]]" and other homophobic epithets.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Khloe tried to get him to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt;

When someone pulled on Jones' bra strap, he ran away, and the crowd pursued and attacked him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car.

==Reaction==

===In Jamaica===
Jones' murder made headline news across Jamaica.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator [[Mark Golding]], condemned the killing and called for an end to "depraved acts of violence" in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="JamaicaObserver"/&gt; He added that "all well-thinking Jamaicans" should embrace "the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons" and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/boom-bye-bye-murder-cross-dresser-lifts-lid-jamaicas-violent-homophobia-1370173|title=Boom Bye Bye: Murder of Cross-Dresser Lifts Lid on Jamaica's Violent Homophobia|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|author=Ghosh, Palash|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=2 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211045826/http://www.ibtimes.com/boom-bye-bye-murder-cross-dresser-lifts-lid-jamaicas-violent-homophobia-1370173|archivedate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; Newton&amp;nbsp;D. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the "overwhelming majority" of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] of an [[African Americans|African-American]] man in [[Harper Lee]]'s novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130901/focus/focus4.html|title=To Kill a Cross-Dresser - Jamaica Flirts with Jim Crow|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Duncan, Newton D.|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=1 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705230144/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130901/focus/focus4.html|archivedate=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portia Miller Shoot.Jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Domestic and foreign human rights organisations called on then Prime Minister [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] to improve LGBT rights in Jamaica, as she had promised during her election campaign.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PinkNewsArson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinez"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130727/news/news3.html|title=JFJ Condemns Mob Killing of Cross-Dresser|newspaper=The Gleaner|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=27 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705231423/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130727/news/news3.html|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Writing in the Jamaican broadsheet ''[[The Gleaner (newspaper)|The Gleaner]]'', Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, condemned the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective use of the [[Bible]], noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which [[The Bible and homosexuality|condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing]], they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as [[adultery]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130804/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Dressed for Murder|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Cooper, Carolyn|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=4 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222191011/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130804/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime.&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed it off with a humorous comment.&lt;ref name="Cooper2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130811/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Sexual Falsehood Top to Bottom|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Cooper, Carolyn|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222205646/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130811/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaevion Nelson, an [[HIV/AIDS]] campaigner and human rights advocate, also published an article on the subject in ''The Gleaner''. He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's [[Underground culture|underground]] gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in "the culture of violence" by which a [[victim blaming|victim is blamed]] for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130801/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Make Space for Pariahs|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Nelson, Jaevion|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=1 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802004039/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130801/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in ''The Gleaner'', Sheila Veléz Martínez, a law professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], condemned the murder as "alarming evidence" of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.&lt;ref name="Martinez2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130813/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Gov't Shouldn't Let Dwayne Jones' Death Go in Vain|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Veléz Martínez, Sheila|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=13 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705231423/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130727/news/news3.html|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July, the [[J-FLAG|Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays]] (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, issued a public statement expressing their "deep concern" regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people to aid the police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy.&lt;ref name="J-FLAG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jflag.org/2013/07/violence-against-lgbt-people-is-an-affront-to-democracy/|title=Violence is an Affront to Democracy|publisher=Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCeQaWv7?url=http://www.jflag.org/2013/07/violence-against-lgbt-people-is-an-affront-to-democracy/|archivedate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaner24"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=46697|title=J-FLAG Condemns Mob Killing of Alleged MoBay Cross-Dresser|newspaper=The Gleaner|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=24 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnuEKr1x?url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/power/46697|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieczkowski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/dwayne-jones-cross-dressing-jamaican-stabbed_n_3652665.html|title=Dwayne Jones, 'Cross-Dressing' Jamaican Teen, Allegedly 'Chopped and Stabbed' to Death by Mob|newspaper=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|author=Sieczkowski, Cavan|accessdate=14 August 2013| date=25 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114211847/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/dwayne-jones-cross-dressing-jamaican-stabbed_n_3652665.html|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/12/murdered-jamaican-trans-teenager-dwayne-jones-suffered-bullying-from-father-and-at-school/|title=Murdered Jamaican trans teenager Dwayne Jones suffered bullying from father and at school|publisher=PinkNews|author=Roberts, Scott|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=12 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705225641/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/12/murdered-jamaican-trans-teenager-dwayne-jones-suffered-bullying-from-father-and-at-school/|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another LGBT rights organisation, [[Quality of Citizenship Jamaica]], issued a press release calling for the government and churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of "true respect for all," found in the nation's [[Jamaica, Land We Love|National Anthem]].&lt;ref name="QCJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qcjm.org/press-release-murder-of-17yr-old-irwin-st-james/|title=Press Release – Murder of 17yr old, Irwin St. James|publisher=Quality of Citizenship Jamaica|accessdate=15 October 2013| date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705225243/http://qcjm.org/press-release-murder-of-17yr-old-irwin-st-james/|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organisation [[Jamaicans for Justice]] called on Prime Minister [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that "we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people."&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

===Internationally===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The story of Dwayne Jones lies at one extreme end of a continuum of violence experienced by Jamaicans who identify as lesbian, gay, transgender, or bisexual.

News of Jones' murder attracted international media attention, resulting in condemnation of the killing by human rights groups.&lt;ref name="JamaicaObserver"/&gt; Graeme Reid, the LGBT Rights Program director at Human Rights Watch in New York, issued a statement that the Jamaican government should send an "unequivocal message" that there would be "zero tolerance" of anti-LGBT violence.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23544130|title=Call for probe into death of Jamaica 'cross-dresser'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=2 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101013331/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23544130|archivedate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid noted that Jamaica's Prime Minister had vowed to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity in her [[Jamaican general election, 2011|2011 election campaign]] but had yet to implement that promise. He encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take action to investigate Jones' murder and to promote respect for the country's LGBT citizens.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;

In a February 2014 briefing, the U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], [[Uzra Zeya]], cited Jones' case as well as the torture and murder of Cameroonian HIV/AIDS activist [[Eric Ohena Lembembe]] as examples of the "troubling acts of violence" against LGBT individuals that had happened across the globe in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeya, Uzra|title=Briefing on the Country Reports on Human Rights|date=27 February 2014|website=United States Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2014/222659.htm|accessdate=19 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113022755/http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2014/222659.htm|archivedate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction to an academic study of "queerness and children's literature", Laura Robinson, an Associate Professor of English at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], cited Jones' murder alongside the 2013 [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] as an example in which youth issues intersected with LGBT issues. She added that Jones was a "child who did not end up having what [[Judith Butler]] calls a 'livable life'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Laura|title=Queerness and Children's Literature: Embracing the Negative|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|volume=52|number=1|date=January 2014|pages=v–vi|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bookbird/v052/52.1.robinson01.html|doi=10.1353/bkb.2014.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuristani languages''' ({{lang-ps|نورستاني}}) are one of the three groups within the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language family]], alongside the much larger  [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[SIL International|SIL]] [[Ethnologue]] [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90795]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstierne, G. ''Irano-Dardica''. Wiesbaden 1973; Morgenstierne, G. "Die Stellung der Kafirsprachen". In ''Irano-Dardica'', 327–343. Wiesbaden, Reichert 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strand, Richard F. (1973) "Notes on the Nûristânî and Dardic Languages."  ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', '''93'''(3): 297–305.&lt;/ref&gt; They have approximately 130,000 speakers primarily in eastern [[Afghanistan]] and a few adjacent valleys in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]'s [[Chitral District]], [[Pakistan]]. The region inhabited by the Nuristanis is located in the southern [[Hindukush]] mountains, and is drained by [[Alingar River]] in the west, [[Pech River]] in the center, and [[Landai Sin River|Landai Sin]] and [[Kunar River]] in the east. The languages were previously often grouped with Indo-Aryan or Iranian until they were finally classified as forming a third branch in Indo-Iranian.

==Languages==
* [[Askunu language|Askunu]] (Ashkun) 40,000 speakers
* [[Kamkata-viri language|Kamkata-viri]] (Bashgali, includes the [[dialect]]s [[Kata-vari]], [[Kamviri]] and [[Mumviri]]) 40,000 speakers
* [[Vasi-vari language|Vasi-vari]] (Prasuni) 8,000 speakers
* [[Tregami language|Tregami]] (Gambiri) 3,500 speakers
* [[Waigali language|Waigali]] (Kalasha-ala)  12,000 speakers
* [[Zemiaki language|Zemiaki]] 500 speakers

==History==
The Nuristani languages were not described in literature until the 19th century. The older name for the region was [[Kafiristan]] and the languages were termed [[Kafir]]i or Kafiristani, but the terms have been replaced by the present ones since the conversion of the region to [[Islam]] in 1896.

There are four different theories about the origins of the Nuristani languages and their place within the [[Indo-Iranian languages]]:
* following the studies of [[Georg Morgenstierne]], Nuristani has generally been regarded as one of three primary sub-groups of Indo-Iranian (alongside [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]);
* suggestions that Nuristani may instead be a branch of the Indo-Aryan subgroup, due to the evident similarity with [[Dardic languages]], and;
* it has also been proposed that Nuristani originated within the Iranian sub-group, and was later influenced by an Indo-Aryan language, such as Dardic.
* Descendants of [[Alexander The Great]] and his army. 
The languages are spoken by tribal peoples in an extremely isolated mountainous region of the [[Hindu Kush]], one that has never been subject to any real central authority in modern times. This area is located along the northeastern border of present-day Afghanistan and adjacent portions of the northwest of present-day [[Pakistan]]. These languages have not received the attention linguists would like to give them. Considering the very small number of peoples estimated to speak them, they must be considered [[endangered languages]].

Many Nuristani people now speak other languages, such as [[Dari language|Dari]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] (two [[official language]]s of Afghanistan) and Chitrali in Pakistan.

==Features==
The earliest divergence of Nuristani from the other Indo-Iranian languages may be indicated by the fact that the [[Ruki sound law]] does not apply after *u: e.g. Kam-viri /muˈsə/ 'mouse'.{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

Nuristani shares with Iranian the merger of the plain and breathy voiced consonants, and the fronting of the Proto-Indo-Iranian primary palatal consonants. The latter were retained as dental affricates in Proto-Nuristani, in contrast to simplification to sibilants (in most of Iranian) or interdentals (in Persian). Later on *dz has however shifted to /z/ in all Nuristani varieties other than Kam-viri and Tregami.{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

Many Nuristani languages have [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) word order, like most of the other Indo-Iranian languages, and unlike the adjacent [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] [[Kashmiri language]], which has [[V2 word order|verb-second word order]].{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''Qixingmin''' ({{zh|七姓民}}) are an unofficially recognized ethnic group of western [[Guizhou]] province, China. They are officially classified as [[Bai people|Bai]] by the Chinese government. The Qixingmin speak a [[Yi people|Yi]] ([[Loloish languages|Loloish]]) language known as [[Luoji language|Luoji]]. The ''Guizhou Province Ethnic Gazeteer'' (2002:692) reports that, in 1982, there were about 700 speakers among the more easterly Qixingmin.

==Names==
''Qixingmin'' literally means "Seven Surname People" in Chinese. This is because the Qixingmin historically had the seven surnames of Zhang 张, Su 苏, Li 李, Zhao 赵, Xu 许, Qian 钱, and Yang 杨. In Guizhou, they are also known as:&lt;ref name="gz"&gt;贵州"六山六水"民族调查资料选编. 回族, 白族, 瑤族, 壮族, 畲族, 毛南族, 仫佬族, 满族, 羌族卷 (2008). 贵州民族出版社.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hezhang County Almanac'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Baini 白尼
*Boren 僰人
*Luoju 罗苴
*Zhuoluoju 卓罗苴
*Baizi 白子
*Minjia 民家

In [[Zhaotong]] Prefecture, northeastern Yunnan, there is also an ethnic group known to the local Han Chinese as Bai'erzi 白儿子, and to the local Miao as Mudou 母斗.&lt;ref name="gz"/&gt;

Traditionally, the Qixingmin have also been considered an Yi subgroup. The Yi of the western extreme of Guizhou province have been divided into five subgroups, namely the Black Yi 黑彝, Red Yi 红彝, White Yi 白彝, Green Yi 青彝, and Luoju 罗苴 (a traditional name for the Qixingmin).

==Distribution==
The Qixingmin are distributed in the following villages.&lt;ref name="gz"/&gt; According to the Guizhou Ethnic Gazetteer, several centuries ago the Qixingmin used to live primarily in Caohai 草海 of Weining County.
*[[Weining County]] (1,500 people as of 1982): Guala 瓜拉, Baodu 抱都, Jinshui 金水, Lushan 炉山, Kuadu 夸都, Jieli 结里, Kaiga 开嘎, Meihua 梅花, Caoping 草坪, Longchang 龙场, Xiushui 秀水, Yina 迤那, Mawo 麻窝, Yangjie 羊街, Shejie 蛇街, Yanjia 严家, Songlin 松林, Jinhai 金海, Xiaohai 小海, Sandaohe 三道河, Yancang 盐仓, Sifu 四甫, Yaodian 幺店, Chengguan 城关. Small numbers in the Banliang Mountains 半凉山 area of Caohai Township 草海镇 (''Weining County Almanac'' 1994:114). Also possibly in Ningxia Township 宁下乡 and Xiangshui Village 响水村.
*[[Hezhang County]] (407 people as of 1982): in Qingshan 青山 and Xinfa 新发 of Gemoye Mountain 各摩野山, Wumeng Mountain Range 乌蒙山脉

Also, the Nanjingren 南京人 of [[Hezhang County]] are called Awutu 阿武吐 by the local Yi (''Hezhang County Almanac'' 2001).

Qixingmin of the following surnames are distributed in (''Guizhou Ethnic Gazetteer'' 2002:690):&lt;ref name="ethnic"&gt;Guizhou Province Gazetteer: Ethnic Gazetteer [贵州省志. 民族志] (2002). Guiyang: Guizhou Ethnic Publishing House [貴州民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Zhang'' 张: Shejie 蛇街, Yangjie 羊街, Jieli 结里, Sandaohe 三道河, Yaodian 幺店, Jinzhong 金钟, Jinhai 金海
*''Su'' 苏: Xiaohai 小海, Yanjia 严家
*''Li'' 李: Shejie 蛇街, Jinhai 金海, Jinzhong 金钟
*''Zhao'' 赵: Shejie 蛇街, Baodu 抱都

==Language==
{{see|Luoji language}}
The Qixingmin speak the [[Luoji language]]. It is closely related to the local [[Nasu language|Yi language]], which is intermediate between the Western and Eastern Yi dialects of [[Weining County]] (Weining 1997:328).&lt;ref name="Weining1997"&gt;威宁彜族回族苗族自治县民族事务委员会编. 1997.

The '''ramp effect''' (or '''ramping effect''') is a phenomenon involved in [[drug addiction]] whereby an addict develops a resistance to a substance, and thus requires increasingly large quantities of that substance to achieve the same effect. This can lead the addict to [[exponential growth|rapidly increase]] their dosages, which can lead to a variety of health maladies.

After the ramp effect has begun, it may be very difficult to deprive an addict of their substance, or even to reduce the dosage. Much of [[drug rehabilitation]] consists of resisting and reversing the ramping effect.

Membership is open to all firefighters: active, retired, volunteer, professional or industrial, who have access to a motorcycle and hold a valid motorcycle driver's license.

== History ==
During the summer of 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redknightsmc.com/history.py Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club - History]. RKMC official website&lt;/ref&gt; several firefighters met in Randy's Cycle Shop in Boylston, [[Massachusetts]], United States. They discussed the fact that police officers had established their own motorcycle club, the Blue Knights, but there was still no motorcycle club for firefighters. B owner Randy Wilson said to Ed Wright, a firefighter from Northboro, [[Massachusetts]], that he should stop talking about it and establish a motorcycle club. Wright made some hand-made cards to invite firefighters from the region. He planned to organize a meeting to determine whether there was enough interest to start a motorcycle club. 

On August 17, 1982, Fire Chief Jack Pierce allowed a small group of avid motorcycle riding firefighters to meet in the headquarters of the Fire Department for the purpose of starting a club.

On October 19, 1982, firefighters Colin Mackey, Bob Bourassa, Ed Wright, Roger Wentzell, Dave Hamilton, Bob Goulet, David Hunt, Jon Tripp, Don Parker, Norm Beausoleil and Fire Chief Jack Pierce met again. It was decided that the club would be called the "Red Knights Motorcycle Club" and the first chapter would be Massachusetts 1.

In July 1983, a chapter was founded in Connecticut. In October of that year, a second chapter in Massachusetts was founded. Soon there were startups in remote locations such as [[Nevada]] and [[Louisiana]]. In August 1983, the founding members realized that the organization had quickly exceeded their original expectations. To properly handle this growth they elected a board of directors, the National Board of Directors. With the founding of chapters in [[Ontario]] and Saskatchewan, the club was the renamed the "Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club".

There are now 350 chapters and over 9,800 members worldwide.

== Memorial ==
[[File:RKMC Memorial Boylston.jpg|thumb|RKMC memorial, Boylston]]
The memorial is located in [[Boylston, Massachusetts]] near the local fire station, where in 1982 the RKMC was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redknightsmc.com|title=Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club|website=www.redknightsmc.com|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, RKMC Massachusetts Chapter 1 began preparations for the site. On August 18, 2007, the memorial was officially opened. In addition to a memorial stone which commemorates the founding of the RKMC, there is also a memorial with the names of all deceased RKMC members.

In 2011, the Board of the International RKMC received a piece of [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] steel from the Port Authority of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rk-mass2.org/Newsletters/I_spring2011.pdf|title=Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909085223/http://rk-mass2.org/Newsletters/I_spring2011.pdf|archive-date=2016-09-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece bears the numbers 149 and C-N-176, which indicates that it came from the area of impact between the 94th and 98 floors of [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|WTC]] Tower 1. An honor guard escorted the steel from New York to Boylston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rk-mass2.org/RK_video.htm RKMC chapter Massachusetts 2].

The '''Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941''' was an encounter between [[Adolf Hitler]] and the highest-ranking officials of the [[Nazi Party]]. Almost all important party leaders were present to hear Hitler declare the ongoing destruction of the [[Jew]]ish race, yet it remains less known than the later [[Wannsee Conference]].

==Background==
The announcement Hitler made on 12 December to the ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' and ''[[Gauleiter]]'' refers to an earlier statement he had made on 30 January 1939:

{{quote|If the world of international financial Jewry, both in and outside of Europe, should succeed in plunging the Nations into another world war, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the world and thus a victory for Judaism. The result will be the extermination of the Jewish race in Europe.{{sfn|Cesarani|Kavanaugh|2004|p=81}}}}

With the entry of Japan and the United States into the Second World War on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|7 December 1941]] and [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|the resulting declaration of war on the US by Nazi Germany on 11 December]], the war, especially in regard to the above statement, had become truly a ''World War''.{{sfn|Cesarani|Kavanaugh|2004|p=81}} Hitler announced this declaration of war on 11 December in the German ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'', a speech also broadcast on radio. On 12 December 1941, he had a meeting with the most important Nazi leaders.

==The meeting==
On the afternoon of 12 December, Hitler ordered the leading members of the Nazi Party to a meeting in his private rooms at the [[Reich Chancellery]].{{sfn|Aly|1997}} Because the meeting took place in private rooms rather than Hitler's office, no official record of it exists. However, entries in the diaries of [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Hans Frank]] confirm it.{{sfn|Bedürftig|2001}}  Goebbels made the following entry in his diary for 12 December:
{{quote|''Bezüglich der Judenfrage ist der Führer entschlossen, reinen Tisch zu machen. Er hat den Juden prophezeit, daß, wenn sie noch einmal einen Weltkrieg herbeiführen würden, sie dabei ihre Vernichtung erleben würden. Das ist keine Phrase gewesen. Der Weltkrieg ist da, die Vernichtung des Judentums muß die notwendige Folge sein.''

Regarding the Jewish Question, the Führer has decided to make a clean sweep. He prophesied to the Jews that, if they yet again brought about a world war, they would experience their own annihilation. That was not just a phrase. The world war is here, and the annihilation of the Jews must be the necessary consequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaust-history.org/hitler-final-solution/#note-07 Essay by Gord McFee quoting Die Zeit, edition of January 9, 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602232947/http://www.holocaust-history.org/hitler-final-solution/ |date=2 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apart from the fact that the European war had turned into a world war, another reason for this shift must be seen in the fact that the entry of the United States into the war meant that the Jewish population had lost its value for Hitler as hostages deterring the United States from becoming an active member of the Allied coalition, and he was finally free to act according to his long-term plans.{{sfn|Cesarani|Kavanaugh|2004|p=82}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=164, 209}} 

Hitler's presence at the Chancellery meeting undermines claims that he was ignorant of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and that it was carried out by subordinates without his knowledge.{{sfn|Aly|1997}}

The meeting marked a turning point in the Nazi regime's attitude towards the Jewish people. It was part of a shift from propaganda, intimidation and attacks to outright and planned extermination. The latter step had already been taken in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]] as early as August 1941.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=207}} The much more well-known [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942 marked the next step in the Nazis' plans to exterminate the Jews.

==Attendance==
Attendance in this meeting was obligatory for Nazis in high party offices. No official list of the people who attended this meeting exists, but the following leaders of Nazi Germany, out of the about 50 present, are known to have been there:{{sfn|Aly|1997}}{{sfn|Cesarani|Kavanaugh|2004|pp=81–82}}{{sfn|Rubenstein|Roth|2003|pp=189}}
* [[Adolf Hitler]]
* [[Heinrich Himmler]]
* [[Joseph Goebbels]]
* [[Martin Bormann]]
* [[Hans Frank]]
* [[Philipp Bouhler]]

Known to have been absent from this meeting were [[Hermann Göring]] and probably [[Reinhard Heydrich]].{{sfn|Rubenstein|Roth|2003|pp=189}} Neither one of them held a party office.

The '''Shor language''' (Шор тили) is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken by about 2,800 people in a region called [[Mountain Shoriya]], in the [[Kemerovo Oblast|Kemerovo Province]] in southwest [[Siberia]], although the entire Shor population in this area is over 12000 people. Presently, not all ethnic Shors speak Shor, and the language suffered a decline from the late 1930s to the early 1990s. During this period the Shor language was neither written nor taught in schools. However, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] brought about the Shor language revival. The language is now taught at the [[Novokuznetsk]] branch of the [[Kemerovo State University]].

Like its neighbor languages, Shor has borrowed many roots from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], as well as words from [[Russian language|Russian]]. The two main dialects are Mrassu and Kondoma, named after the rivers in whose valleys they are spoken. From the point of view of classification of Turkic languages, these dialects belong to different branches of Turkic: According to the reflexes of the Proto-Turkic (PT) intervocalic -d- in modern languages (compare PT *adak, in modern Turkic languages meaning 'foot' or 'leg'), the Mrassu dialect is a -z- variety: azak, the Kondoma dialect is a -y- variety: ayak. This feature normally distinguishes different branches of Turkic which means that the Shor language has formed from different Turkic sources.

Each Shor dialect has subdialectal varieties. The Upper-Mrassu and the Upper-Kondoma varieties have developed numerous close features in the course of close contacts between their speakers in the upper reaches of the Kondoma and Mrassu rivers.

The Mrassu dialect served as a basis for literary Shor language both in the 1930s and in the 1980s when the written form of the Shor language was revitalized after almost of 50 years of break in its written history. However, the Kondoma dialect norms are also largely accepted.

Shor was first written with a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabet introduced by [[Russian Orthodox|Christian]] [[missionaries]] in the middle of the 19th century. After a number of changes, the modern Shor alphabet is written in another modified Cyrillic alphabet.

In 2005, to highlight the endangered status of the language, Gennady Kostochakov published a book of poems in Shor, entitled "I am the Last Shor Poet".&lt;ref&gt;

==Writing system==
=== History ===
Before the 19th century the Shor language had remained unwritten; in the 1870s Orthodox missionaries made the first effort to create a Cyrillic Shor alphabet. In spite of all the efforts by the missionaries, the percentage of literacy among the native population increased very slowly — by the beginning of the 20th century they constituted only about 1% of the Shors.

The Shor written language had its 'golden age' in the 1920s. In 1927, a second attempt was made to create a Shor alphabet based on Cyrillic. In 1932-1933, Fedor Cispijakov wrote and published a new primer based on the Latin alphabet. This however considerably complicated the process of learning; thus in 1938, the same author together with Georgij Babuskin created a new variant of the primer based on the Cyrillic alphabet, of which several editions have been published since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Irina Nevskaya|title=Exploring the Eastern Frontiers of Turkic|volume=(Turcologica 60)|editor-first= M.|editor-last=Erdal|publisher=[[Harrassowitz Verlag]]|pages=245–247|date=2006|isbn=3447053100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missionary alphabet ===
The first book written in the Shor language was published in 1885.
It used a modified [[Russian alphabet]] (excluding Ё ё, Ф ф, Щ щ, and Ѣ ѣ) with additional letters Ј ј, Ҥ ҥ, Ӧ ӧ, and Ӱ ӱ.

In 1927 an official alphabet was adopted, being the Russian alphabet (excluding Ё ё and ъ) with additional letters Ј ј, Ҥ ҥ, Ӧ ӧ, and Ӱ ӱ.

=== Latin alphabet ===
A Latin alphabet for the Shor language was introduced in 1930: A a, B в, C c, D d, Ə ə, F f, G g, Ƣ ƣ, I i, J j, K k, Q q, M m, N n, N̡ n̡, O o, Ө ө, P p, R r, S s, T t, U u, V v, Ş ş, Z z, Ƶ ƶ, L l, Ь ь, Y y, Į į.

The order of the letters was later changed to correspond with alphabets for other languages in the [[Soviet Union]], the letter Ә ә was replaced with E e, and the letter Į į was dropped.

=== Modern alphabet ===
In 1938 the Latin alphabet was replaced with a Cyrillic one.  It used the Russian alphabet with additional letters Ӧ ӧ, Ӱ ӱ, and Нъ нъ.
After reforms in 1980 it reached its present form: А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Ғ ғ, Д д, Е е, Ё ё, Ж ж, З з, И и, Й й, К к, Қ қ, Л л, М м, Н н, Ң ң, О о, Ӧ ӧ, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Ӱ ӱ, Ф ф, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, Щ щ, Ъ ъ, Ы ы, Ь ь, Э э, Ю ю, Я я.

'''Split custody''' refers to a custody arrangement in which the children are essentially split up, with some of the children living with one parent, and some of the children living more with the other parent.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple"&gt;{{cite book|author=Webster Watnik|title=Child Custody Made Simple: Understanding the Laws of Child Custody and Child Support|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrFXX8H1NT8C&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=April 2003|publisher=Single Parent Press|isbn=978-0-9649404-3-7|pages=16–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Split custody is generally chosen because it creates a situation in which children do not have to constantly travel back and forth between their parent's homes and it creates a situation in which siblings that do not get along can be separated.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Split custody arrangements are criticized for a number of reasons.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt; One such reason is that the siblings are separated from each other, which also has the negative aspect of eliminating the emotional support they give one another.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt; Additionally, in this form of arrangement, this effect could be compounded by the fact that they have one primary parent, which has been shown to cause distress in children.&lt;ref name= "Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Joint Custody Best for Most Children"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lerche Davis|first=Jeanie|title=Joint Custody Best for Most Children|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20020325/joint-custody-best-for-most-children|work=WebMD Health News|publisher=WebMD, Inc.|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Joint Custody Best for Kids After Divorce"&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Karen S.|title=Joint Custody Best for Kids After Divorce|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/child/2002-03-25-joint-custody.htm|work=USATODAY.com|accessdate=27 September 2011|date=24 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of custody==
*[[Alternating custody]] is an arrangement whereby the child/children live for an extended period of time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent.  While the child/children are with the parent, that parent retains sole authority over the child/children.
*[[Bird's nest custody]] is an arrangement whereby the parents go back and forth from a residence in which the child/children reside, placing the burden of upheaval and movement on the parents rather than the child/children.
*[[Joint custody]] is an arrangement whereby both parents have legal custody and/or both parents have physical custody.
*[[Sole custody]] is an arrangement whereby only one parent has physical and legal custody of a child.
*[[Third-party custody]] is an arrangement whereby the children do not remain with either biological parent, and are placed under the custody of a third person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12171">{{distinguish|systemic risk}}

In [[finance]] and [[economics]], '''systematic risk''' (in economics often called '''aggregate risk''' or '''undiversifiable risk''') is vulnerability to events which affect aggregate outcomes such as broad [[Financial market|market]] returns, total economy-wide resource holdings, or aggregate income. In many contexts, events like earthquakes and major weather catastrophes pose aggregate risks that affect not only the distribution but also the total amount of resources. If every possible outcome of a [[stochastic]] economic process is characterized by the same aggregate result (but potentially different distributional outcomes), the process then has no aggregate risk.

==Properties of systematic risk==

Systematic or aggregate risk arises from market structure or dynamics which produce shocks or uncertainty faced by all agents in the market; such shocks could arise from government policy, international economic forces, or acts of nature. In contrast, [[Modern portfolio theory#Systematic risk and specific risk|specific risk]] (sometimes called residual risk, '''unsystematic risk''', or [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]]) is risk to which only specific agents or industries are vulnerable (and is uncorrelated with broad market returns). Due to the idiosyncratic nature of unsystematic risk, it can be reduced or eliminated through [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]]; but since all market actors are vulnerable to systematic risk, it cannot be limited through diversification (but it may be insurable). As a result, assets whose returns are negatively correlated with broader market returns command higher prices than assets not possessing this property.

In some cases, aggregate risk exists due to institutional or other constraints on [[Complete market|market completeness]]. For countries or regions lacking access to broad [[Hedge (finance)|hedging markets]], events like earthquakes and adverse weather shocks can also act as costly aggregate risks. [[Robert Shiller]] has found that, despite the [[globalization]] progress of recent decades, country-level aggregate income risks are still significant and could potentially be reduced through the creation of better global hedging markets (thereby potentially becoming idiosyncratic, rather than aggregate, risks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Robert Shiller |last=Shiller |first=R. |year=1995 |title=Aggregate Income Risks and Hedging Mechanisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=119–152 |doi=10.1016/1062-9769(95)90018-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Shiller advocated for the creation of macro [[Futures exchange|futures markets]]. The benefits of such a mechanism would depend on the degree to which macro conditions are correlated across countries.

==Systematic risk in finance==

Systematic risk plays an important role in [[Asset allocation|portfolio allocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maginn |first=J. |last2=Tuttle |first2=D. |last3=McLeavey |first3=D. |last4=Pinto |first4=J. |year=2007 |title=Managing Investment Portfolios: A Dynamic Process |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=231–245 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk which cannot be eliminated through diversification commands returns in excess of the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]] (while idiosyncratic risk does not command such returns since it can be diversified). Over the long run, a well-diversified portfolio provides returns which correspond with its exposure to systematic risk; investors face a trade-off between expected returns and systematic risk. Therefore, an investor's desired returns correspond with their desired exposure to systematic risk and corresponding asset selection. Investors can only reduce a portfolio's exposure to systematic risk by sacrificing expected returns.

An important concept for evaluating an asset's exposure to systematic risk is [[Beta (finance)|beta]]. Since beta indicates the degree to which an asset's return is correlated with broader market outcomes, it is simply an indicator of an asset's vulnerability to systematic risk. Hence, the [[capital asset pricing model|capital asset pricing model (CAPM)]] directly ties an asset's equilibrium price to its exposure to systematic risk.

===A simple example===

Consider an investor who purchases stock in many firms from most global industries. This investor is vulnerable to systematic risk but has diversified away the effects of idiosyncratic risks on his portfolio value; further reduction in risk would require him to acquire risk-free assets with lower returns (such as [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]]). On the other hand, an investor who invests all of his money in one industry whose returns are typically uncorrelated with broad market outcomes ([[beta (finance)|beta]] close to zero) has limited his exposure to systematic risk but, due to lack of diversification, is highly vulnerable to idiosyncratic risk.

==Aggregate risk in economics==

Aggregate risk can be generated by a variety of sources. [[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]], [[Monetary policy|monetary]], and [[Regulation|regulatory]] policy can all be sources of aggregate risk. In some cases, shocks from phenomena like weather and natural disaster can pose aggregate risks. Small economies can also be subject to aggregate risks generated by international conditions such as [[terms of trade]] shocks.

Aggregate risk has potentially large implications for economic growth. For example, in the presence of credit rationing, aggregate risk can cause bank failures and hinder capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elosegui |first=P. L. |year=2003 |title=Aggregate Risk, Credit Rationing, and Capital Accumulation |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics and Finance |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=668–696 |doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(03)00040-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks may respond to increases in profitability-threatening aggregate risk by raising standards for quality and quantity [[credit rationing]] to reduce monitoring costs; but the practice of lending to small numbers of borrowers reduces the diversification of bank portfolios ([[concentration risk]]) while also denying credit to some potentially productive firms or industries. As a result, capital accumulation and the overall productivity level of the economy can decline.

In economic modeling, model outcomes depend heavily on the nature of risk. Modelers often incorporate aggregate risk through shocks to endowments ([[budget constraint]]s), [[productivity]], monetary policy, or external factors like terms of trade. Idiosyncratic risks can be introduced through mechanisms like individual labor productivity shocks; if agents possess the ability to trade assets and lack borrowing constraints, the welfare effects of idiosyncratic risks are minor. The welfare costs of aggregate risk, though, can be significant.

Under some conditions, aggregate risk can arise from the aggregation of micro shocks to individual agents. This can be the case in models with many agents and [[strategic complements|strategic complementarities]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jovanovic |first=B. |year=1987 |title=Micro Shocks and Aggregate Risk |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=395–410 |doi=10.2307/1885069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; situations with such characteristics include: innovation, search and trading, production in the presence of input complementarities, and information sharing. Such situations can generate aggregate data which are empirically indistinguishable from a data-generating process with aggregate shocks.

===Example: Arrow–Debreu equilibrium===

The following example is from Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mas-Colell |first=A. |last2=Whinston |first2=M. |last3=Green |first3=J. |year=1995 |title=Microeconomic Theory |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=692–693 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a simple exchange economy with two identical agents, one (divisible) good, and two potential states of the world (which occur with some probability). Each agent has expected utility in the form &lt;math&gt;\pi_1*u_i(x_{1i})+\pi_2*u_i(x_{2i})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; are the probabilities of states 1 and 2 occurring, respectively. In state 1, agent 1 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 2 is endowed with nothing. In state 2, agent 2 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 1 is endowed with nothing. That is, denoting the vector of endowments in state ''i'' as &lt;math&gt;\omega_i,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\omega_1=(1,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_2=(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the aggregate endowment of this economy is one good regardless of which state is realized; that is, the economy has no aggregate risk. It can be shown that, if agents are allowed to make trades, the ratio of the price of a claim on the good in state 1 to the price of a claim on the good in state 2 is equal to the ratios of their respective probabilities of occurrence (and, hence, the marginal rates of substitution of each agent are also equal to this ratio). That is, &lt;math&gt;p_1/p_2=\pi_1/\pi_2&lt;/math&gt;. If allowed to do so, agents make trades such that their consumption is equal in either state of the world.

Now consider an example with aggregate risk. The economy is the same as that described above except for endowments: in state 1, agent 1 is endowed two units of the good while agent 2 still receives zero units; and in state 2, agent 2 still receives one unit of the good while agent 1 receives nothing. That is, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1=(2,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_2=(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, if state 1 is realized, the aggregate endowment is 2 units; but if state 2 is realized, the aggregate endowment is only 1 unit; this economy is subject to aggregate risk. Agents cannot fully insure and guarantee the same consumption in either state. It can be shown that, in this case, the price ratio will be less than the ratio of probabilities of the two states: &lt;math&gt;p_1/p_2&lt;\pi_1/\pi_2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p_1/\pi_1&lt;p_2/\pi_2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for example, if the two states occur with equal probabilities, then &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is the well-known finance result that the contingent claim that delivers more resources in the state of low market returns has a higher price.

===Aggregate risk in heterogeneous agent models===

While the inclusion of aggregate risk is common in [[macroeconomic model]]s, considerable challenges arise when researchers attempt to incorporate aggregate uncertainty into models with [[heterogeneous agents]]. In this case, the entire distribution of allocational outcomes is a [[state variable]] which must be carried across periods. This gives rise to the well-known [[curse of dimensionality]]. One approach to the dilemma is to let agents ignore attributes of the aggregate distribution, justifying this assumption by referring to [[bounded rationality]]. Den Haan (2010) evaluates several algorithms which have been applied to solving the Krusell and Smith (1998) model, showing that solution accuracy can depend heavily on solution method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=den Haan |first=W. |year=2010 |title=Comparison of Solutions to the Incomplete Markets Model with Aggregate Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Economics Dynamics and Control |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=4–27 |doi=10.1016/j.jedc.2008.12.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krusell |first=P. |last2=Smith Jr. |first2=A. |year=1998 |title=Income and Wealth Heterogeneity in the Macroeconomy |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=867–896 | doi = 10.1086/250034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers should carefully consider the results of accuracy tests while choosing solution methods and pay particular attention to grid selection.{{says who?|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6805">The '''Urban hierarchy''' ranks each [[city]] based on the size of population residing within the nationally defined statistical urban area. Because urban population depends on how governments define their metropolitan areas, urban hierarchies are conventionally ranked at the national level; however, the ranking can be extended globally to include all cities. Urban hierarchies tell us about the general organization of cities and yield some important insights. First, it tells us that within a system of cities, some cities will grow to be very large, but that number will be small relative to the universe of cities. Second, it refutes the expectation of an optimally sized city. Lastly, it establishes cities as belonging to an inter-related network where one city's growth affects others'.

== Theoretical distribution ==
The hierarchy is usually related to the empirical regularity with which cities are distributed. The pattern has been formulated in a number of ways, but usually as a variation of the [[power law]]. Formally, it is a frequency distribution of rank data where frequency is inversely proportional to rank such that cities with population larger than ''S'' are approximately proportional to ''S&lt;sup&gt;−a&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''a'' is normally close to 1. There are no good explanations for the exponent consistently being close to 1. This is problematic because an exponent of 1 in the power law implies an infinite population. Paul Krugman proposes that, in the case of cities, the power law operates according to the [[percolation theory]]. This relaxes the condition on the exponent approaching the value of 1 and breaking down the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=Confronting the Mystery of Urban Hierarchy|journal=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies|date=December 1996|volume=10|issue=4|pages=399–418|doi=10.1006/jjie.1996.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the application of a percolation model leads to one of the key insights regarding city sizes: geography and economic conditions give cities advantages that allow them to grow more than cities with a relative scarcity of these benefits. 
 
A simpler formulation of the relationship between rank and frequency is expressed with reference to [[Zipf's Law]]. The law applied to cities states that "if cities are ranked in decreasing population size, then the rank of a given city will be inversely proportional to its population." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zipf|first1=George, Kingsley|title=, Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort|date=1949|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading MA|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this intuitive formulation, in a country where the largest city has a population of 10 million, the second largest will have population size of 5 million, the third largest 3 .33 million, etc.

== Empirical evidence ==

The urban hierarchy has been described in detail in the United States where the power law has held consistently for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Glenn|title=National city-size distributions what do we know after 67 years of research?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|date=1982|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–43|doi=10.1177/030913258200600101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, there were 40 U.S. [[Metropolitan Areas]] with population above 1 million, 20 above 2 million, and 9 with more than 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=Confronting the Mystery of Urban Hierarchy|journal=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies|date=December 1996|volume=10|issue=4|pages=399–418|doi=10.1006/jjie.1996.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in data collection have allowed researchers to test the theoretical distribution against global data. Shlomo Angel finds that the pattern holds remarkably well for a global sample of 3,646 cities. The predicted distribution based on Zipf's law and the actual distribution are virtually identical. The most common size ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 and constitutes about half of the entire sample. The distribution extends to the largest cities with population over 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Angel|first1=Shlomo|title=Planet of cities|date=2012|publisher=Lincoln Institute of Land Policy|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-1-55844-249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==

While the frequency distribution of urban hierarchies is empirically simple, the set of factors that create it are complex and no individual explanation can account for the distribution. The unequal distribution of city sizes and lack of convergence on one equilibrium size are relatively well understood. Henderson's model of urban system relies on three sets of factors that influence the size of cities: land inputs, labor, and capital. The model formally relates the benefits of [[economies of agglomeration]] and congestion cost. Cities benefit from economies of scale that attract firms and workers, making them larger. But, the limited supply of land means that the price of locating near the center of production increases as the population size increases. Eventually, the greater costs lead to diminishing returns to scale and cities tend towards an optimal equilibrium size, assuming they all share the same attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=J. V.|title=The sizes and types of cities|journal=The American Economic Review|date=1974|volume=64|issue=4|pages=640–656|jstor=1813316 .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson relaxed the assumption of identical cities to explore the implications of a diversified economy of [[Tradability|traded goods]]. The extension of the model underlies the urban system literature and gives rise to the finding that cities will differ in size to account for the factor rewards associated with traded goods of varying degrees of return to scale and intensity of land use.

== Alternative hierarchy ==

While the pattern of urban hierarchy tends to conform to the power law, it is not universal. Especially at the country level, we observe significant deviations from the theoretical distribution. Countries with a [[primate city]], a city that dominates in population size and, usually, economically, have a deficit of intermediate size cities. Examples of primate cities include [[Paris]] in France, [[London]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Tokyo]] in Japan. The history of these countries play a large role in the persistence of their primate city. Particularly, the concentration of political power in one city early on has a large degree of path dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jefferson|first1=Mark|title=Why geography? The law of the primate city|journal=Geographical Review|date=1989|volume=79|issue=2|pages=226–232|jstor=215528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''V. E. Christopher''' is President Emeritus of the [[Protestant]] Lutheran Church Society, the  [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref name="LWF"&gt;The Lutheran World Federation, New President for India's Largest Lutheran Church.  Internet, accessed 14 September 2008.  [http://www.lutheranworld.org/News/LWI/EN/1760.EN.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Portal|Lutheranism}}

==Early years==
Ernest Christopher was born into a pastoral family in [[Bhimavaram]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to [[The Reverend|Rev.]] Vardanapu Krupadas and [[Smt.]] Bhagyamma.  His father, [[The Reverend|Rev.]] V. Krupadas was a pastor of the AELC.&lt;ref name="Prema"&gt;''Prema Sakshi'', National Christian Telugu Monthly, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had his schooling in [[Bhimavaram]] and collegiate education in [[Rajahmundry]].&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt;  Later, he pursued degree studies in [[Sri]] Y. N. College ''(an [[National Assessment and Accreditation Council|NAAC]]-A grade college affiliated to the [[Andhra University]])'', [[Narsapur, West Godavari|Narsapur]] in [[West Godavari]] District.

==Divinity==
Like his father, Christopher had an inclination to pursue the ultimate profession of priesthood.  His Church society (the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]]) readily sponsored him for his priestly studies.  The AELC was then headed by [[The Reverend|Rev.]] [[Dr.]] S. W. Schmitthener.

Armed with a sponsorship letter from his Church society, Christopher enrolled&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt; for the graduate degree of [[Bachelor of Theology]] ([[B. Th.]]) offered by the [[ecumenical]] [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] ''(affiliated to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]])'', [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].  Later, the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] under the Registrarship of [[D. S. Satyaranjan]] awarded him with a degree.

The then Principal of the College was the [[Cantabrigian]] [[Victor Premasagar]].  With disciplined faculty at ACTC, the young Christopher had a sound priestly formation.  He was taught New Testament by [[Muriel Carder]] and K. David while [[Victor Premasagar]] and G. Babu Rao, taught him Old Testament, the core subjects in any seminary or theological faculty of a [[University]].  Christopher was known to be studious and disciplined.

==Ordination &amp; Pastorship==
After Christopher's ordination, his Church President, the India-born [[The Reverend|Rev.]] [[Dr.]] S. W. Schmitthener posted&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt; him to [[East Godavari]] District to minister in a rural parish.  He also served in Lutheran parishes in [[Rajahmundry]] and [[Bhimavaram]].

==Higher Studies==
Christopher later enrolled for the degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity]] ([[B. D.]]) at his ''[[alma mater]]'', the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and upgraded himself to earn a [[B. D.]] degree.

==Synod of the AELC==
Rev. Christopher was twice&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt; elected as the Synod President of the West Godavari Synod, one of the six Synods of the AELC.

==Presidentship==
In due course of time, Christopher was elected to the Vice-Presidency&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt; of the Church Society.  Later on 1 June 2005,&lt;ref name="Prema"/&gt; he was declared elected as the President of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">'''Walter Reckless''' (January 19, 1899, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] – September 20, 1988 [[Dublin, Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walter-Reckless|title=Walter Reckless|author=Thomas J. Bernard|year=2012|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American [[criminology|criminologist]] known for his [[containment]] theory (see [[social control theory]]).

==Biography==
Reckless earned his PhD in sociology (1925) from the [[University of Chicago]]. While at the [[Chicago School (sociology)]], he joined with sociologists [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]] and [[Ernest Burgess]] in conducting observation studies of crime in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walter-Reckless|title=Walter Reckless profile|author=Thomas J. Bernard|year=2012|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research led to his dissertation, ''The Natural History of Vice Areas in Chicago'' (1925), which was published as "Vice in Chicago" (1933) - a landmark sociological study of [[fraud]], [[prostitution]], and [[organized crime]] in the city's "vice" districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walter-Reckless|title=Walter Reckless|author=Thomas J. Bernard|year=2012|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Vanderbilt University]] (1925 – 1940), Reckless shifted his focus to the study of [[juvenile delinquency]]. In their 1932 book "Juvenile Delinquency", he and Mapheus Smith (professor at the [[University of Kansas]]) focused on juvenile offenders; the book included court dispositions as well as physical and social characteristics of the delinquents (i.e., physical and mental traits, social backgrounds, and school maladjustments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/216387|title=Book Review: Juvenile Delinquency. Walter C. Reckless, Mapheus Smith|author=William Healy|year=1933|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=39|issue=2|pages=259–60|doi=10.1086/216387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a professor (of social administration and, later, of criminology) at the [[Ohio State University]] (1940–69)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walter-Reckless|title=Walter Reckless profile|author=Thomas J. Bernard|year=2012|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he published his "containment theory" on delinquency and crime (Reckless, Dinitz, &amp; Murray, 1956;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|jstor= 2088428|title=Self Concept as an Insulator Against Delinquency|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=21|issue=6|pages=744-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reckless, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url= http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/fedpro25&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=292|title=A New Theory of Delinquency and Crime|journal=Federal Probation|volume=25|pages=42-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Building of the early work of Albert J. Reiss (1951), Reckless' theory posits that [[social control]] - which constrains deviance, delinquency, and crime - included 'inner' (i.e., strong conscience or a "good self-concept") and 'outer' forces of containment (i.e., supervision and discipline by parents and the school, strong group cohesion, and a consistent moral front).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1963, the [[American Society of Criminology]] awarded him the [[Edwin Sutherland|Edwin H. Sutherland]] Award for outstanding contributions to theory or research in criminology on the etiology of criminal and deviant behavior, the criminal justice system, corrections, law, or justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Edwin H.
