[[File:Pariangan.jpg|thumb|The ''nagari'' of [[Pariangan]], [[West Sumatra]].]]

An '''administrative village''' is the lowest level of government administration in [[Indonesia]]. It can refer to a ''desa'' or a ''kelurahan''. A ''desa'' is headed by a ''kepala desa'', who is elected by popular vote. A kelurahan is headed by ''lurah'', a civil servant appointed by local government (city or regency). A village is divided non-administratively into local communities which manage a certain number of households. In [[Aceh]], a village is called as ''[[kampung|gampong]]''. Since the implementation of regional autonomy in 2001, the larger ''[[Nagari (settlement)|nagari]]'' has been introduced in place of the ''desa'' as the lowest government unit in West Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;Franz and Keebet von Benda-Beckmann, "Recentralization and Decentralization in West Sumatra," in Holtzappel and Ramstedt (eds.), ''Decentralization and Regional Autonomy in Indonesia: Implementation and Challenges'', Singapore and Leiden, 2009, pp. 233ff. at 302.  Ardimas Sasdi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080125094822/http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20030108.F02 "West Sumatra reinvents its original roots,"] ''The Jakarta Post'', 25 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia. A village is divided into several community groups (''[[Rukun Warga|rukun warga]]'' (RW)), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'' (RT)).

'''Aymara''' ({{IPA-ay|ajÀàma.…æa|IPA|Ay_aymara_001.ogg}}; also {{lang|ay|Aymar aru}}) is an [[Aymaran languages|Aymaran]] language spoken by the [[Aymara people]] of the [[Andes]]. It is one of only a handful of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] with over one million speakers.&lt;ref name="INE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolivia: Idioma Materno de la Poblaci√≥n de 4 a√±os de edad y m√°s- UBICACI√ìN, √ÅREA GEOGR√ÅFICA, SEXO Y EDAD |work=2001 Bolivian Census |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica, La Paz&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Bolivia |url=http://www.ine.gov.bo/BEYOND/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=993 }}{{dead link| date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millionspeakers"&gt;The other native American languages with more than one million speakers are [[Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages]], and [[Guarani language|Guaran√≠]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Aymara, along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is one of the official languages of [[Bolivia]] and parts of [[Peru]]. It is also spoken, to a much lesser extent, by some communities in northern [[Chile]], where it is a [[Minority language|recognized minority language]].

Some linguists have claimed that Aymara is related to its more widely spoken neighbor, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. That claim, however, is disputed. Although there are indeed similarities, like the nearly-identical phonologies, the majority position among linguists today is that the similarities are better explained as [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]] rising from prolonged cohabitation, rather than natural genealogical changes that would stem from a common [[protolanguage]].

Aymara is an [[agglutinating language|agglutinating]] and, to a certain extent, a [[polysynthetic language]]. It has a [[subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb]] word order.&lt;!-- It is based on a three value logic system. --&gt;

== Etymology ==
The ethnonym "Aymara" may be ultimately derived from the name of some group occupying the southern part of what is now the Quechua speaking area of Apur√≠mac.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem Adelaar]] with [[Pieter Muysken]], ''Languages of the Andes'', CUP, Cambridge, 2004, pp 259&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the use of the word "Aymara" as a label for this people was standard practice as early as 1567, as evident from Garci Diez de San Miguel's report of his inspection of the province of Chucuito (1567, 14; cited in Lafaye 1964). In this document, he uses the term ''aymaraes'' to refer to the people. The language was then called [[Qulla people|Colla]]. It is  believed that Colla was the name of an Aymara nation at the time of conquest, and later was the southernmost region of the Inca empire Collasuyu. However, [[Rodolfo Cerr√≥n Palomino|Cerr√≥n Palomino]] disputes this claim and asserts that Colla were in fact [[Puquina language|Puquina]] speakers who were the rulers of [[Tiwanaku]] in the first and third centuries (2008:246). This hypothesis suggests that the linguistically-diverse area ruled by the Puquina came to adopt Aymara languages in their southern region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coler |first=Matt |year=2015 |title=A Grammar of Muylaq' Aymara: Aymara as spoken in Southern Peru |series=Brill's Studies in the Indigenous Languages of the Americas |publisher=Brill |page=9 |isbn=978-9-00-428380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the use of "Aymara" to refer to the language may have first occurred in the works of the lawyer, magistrate and tax collector in [[Potos√≠]] and [[Cusco]], Juan Polo de Ondegardo. This man, who later assisted Viceroy Toledo in creating a system under which the indigenous population would be ruled for the next 200 years, wrote a report in 1559 entitled ‚ÄòOn the lineage of the Yncas and how they extended their conquests‚Äô{{source needed|date=July 2018}} in which he discusses land and taxation issues of the Aymara under the Inca empire.

More than a century passed before "Aymara" entered general usage to refer to the language spoken by the Aymara people (Briggs, 1976:14). In the meantime the Aymara language was referred to as "the language of the Colla". The best account of the history of Aymara is that of Cerr√≥n-Palomino, who shows that the ethnonym Aymara, which came from the glottonym, is likely derived from the Quechuaized toponym ''ayma-ra-y'' ‚Äòplace of communal property‚Äô. The entire history of this term is thoroughly outlined in his book, ''Voces del Ande'' (2008:19‚Äì32) and ''Ling√º√≠stica Aimara''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodolfo Cerr√≥n-Palomino]], ''Ling√º√≠stica Aimara'', Centro de Estudios Regionales Andinos "Bartolom√© de las Casas", Lima, 2000, pp 34-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion that "Aymara" comes from the Aymara words "''jaya''" (ancient) and "''mara''" (year, time) is almost certainly a mistaken [[folk etymology]].

== Classification ==
It is often assumed that the Aymara language descends from the language spoken in [[Tiwanaku]] on the grounds that it is the native language of that area today. That is very far from certain, however, and most specialists now incline to the idea that Aymara did not expand into the Tiwanaku area until rather recently, as it spread southwards from an original homeland that was more likely to have been in Central Peru.&lt;ref name=HegBer2013&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aymara placenames are found all the way north into central Peru. Indeed, (Altiplano) Aymara is actually the one of two extant members of a wider language family, the other surviving representative being [[Jaqaru language|Jaqaru]].

The family was established by the research of Lucy Briggs (a fluent speaker) and Dr. Martha Hardman de Bautista of the Program in Linguistics at the University of Florida. Jaqaru [''jaqi aru'' = human language] and Kawki communities are in the district of Tupe, Yauyos Valley, in the Dept. of Lima, in central Peru. Terminology for this wider language family is not yet well established. Hardman has proposed the name 'Jaqi' ('human') while other widely respected Peruvian linguists have proposed alternative names for the same language family. Alfredo Torero uses the term 'Aru' ('speech'); Rodolfo Cerr√≥n-Palomino, meanwhile, has proposed that the term 'Aymara' should be used for the whole family, distinguished into two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymara and Central Aymara (Jaqaru and Kawki). Each of these three proposals has its followers in Andean [[linguistics]]. In English usage, some linguists use the term [[Aymaran languages]] for the family and reserve 'Aymara' for the Altiplano branch.

== Dialects ==
There is some degree of regional variation within Aymara, but all dialects are mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;SIL's [http://www.ethnologue.com/ Ethnologue.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227170852/http://www.ethnologue.com/ |date=2007-12-27 }} and the ISO designate a [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayc Southern Aymara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001211815/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayc |date=2007-10-01 }} dialect found in between Lake Titicaca and the Pacific Coast in southern Peru and a [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayr Central Aymara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211054355/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayr |date=2012-02-11 }} dialect found in western Bolivia and northeastern Chile. Such classifications, however, are not based upon academic research and are probably a misinterpretation of Cerr√≥n-Palomino's classification of the language family.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies of the language focused on either the Aymara spoken on the southern Peruvian shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] or the Aymara spoken around [[La Paz]]. Lucy Therina Briggs classifies both regions as being part of the Northern Aymara dialect, which encompasses the department of La Paz in Bolivia and the department of [[Puno]] in Peru. The Southern Aymara dialect is spoken in the eastern half of the [[Iquique]] province in northern Chile and in most of the Bolivian department of [[Oruro Department|Oruro]]. It is also found in northern [[Potos√≠]] and southwest [[Cochabamba]] but is slowly being replaced by Quechua in those regions.

Intermediate Aymara shares dialectical features with both Northern and Southern Aymara and is found in the eastern half of the [[Tacna]] and [[Moquegua]] departments in southern Peru and in the northeastern tip of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Therina Briggs, ''Dialectal Variation in the Aymara Language of Bolivia and Peru'', Dissertation, University of Florida, Gainesville, 1976; Adalberto Salas and Mar√≠a Teresa Poblete, "El aimara de Chile (fonolog√≠a, textos, l√©xico)", ''Revista de Filolog√≠a y Ling√º√≠stica de la Universidad de Costa Rica'', Vol XXIII: 1, pp 121-203, 2, pp 95-138; Cerr√≥n-Palomino, 2000, pp 65-8, 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical distribution ==
[[File:Aymara-language-domain-en-001.svg|thumb|Aymara language domain as of 1984]]
[[File:El aymara como lengua materna (censo nacional 2007).png|thumb|Distribution of Aymara limited to three southern departments in Peru: Puno, Moquegua, Tacna.]]
There are roughly two million Bolivian speakers, half a million Peruvian speakers, and perhaps a few thousand speakers in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue: 1.785 million in Bolivia in 1987; 442 thousand of the central dialect in Peru in 2000, plus an unknown number of speakers of the southern dialect in Peru; 900 in Chile in 1994 out of a much larger ethnic population.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century, Aymara was the dominant language over a much larger area than today, including most of highland Peru south of [[Cusco]]. Over the centuries, Aymara has gradually lost speakers both to Spanish and to Quechua; many Peruvian and Bolivian communities that were once Aymara-speaking now speak Quechua.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Alb√≥, "Andean People in the Twentieth Century," in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas. Vol. III: South America'', ed. Frank Salomon and Stuart B. Schwartz (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 765-871.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Aymara has three [[phonemic]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/a i u/}}, which, in most varieties of the language, distinguish two degrees of length. Long vowels are indicated with a [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in writing: ''√§'', ''√Ø'', ''√º''. The high vowels are lowered to mid height when near uvular consonants ({{IPA|/i/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|/u/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|[o]}}).

Vowel deletion is frequent in Aymara. Every instance of vowel deletion occurs for one of three reasons: (i) phonotactic, (ii) syntactic, and (iii) morphophonemic.&lt;ref name="brill.com"&gt;Matt Coler, ''[http://www.brill.com/products/book/grammar-muylaq-aymara A Grammar of Muylaq' Aymara: Aymara as spoken in Southern Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220041616/http://www.brill.com/products/book/grammar-muylaq-aymara |date=2014-12-20 }}''. Brill: Leiden, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Phonotactic vowel deletion, hiatus reduction, occurs when two vowels become adjacent as a consequence of word construction or through the process of suffixation. In such environments one of the two vowels deletes: (i) if one of the two vowels is {{IPA|/u/}}, that vowel will be the only one that surfaces, (ii) if the vowels are {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, the {{IPA|/i/}} will surface. (iii) If the sequence is composed of two identical vowels, one will delete.
* Vowel elision can be syntactically conditioned. For example, in nominal compounds and noun phrases, all adjectival/nominal modifiers with three or more vowels in a modifier + nucleus NP lose their final vowel.
* Morphemic vowel deletion is the most common. Some suffixes always suppress the preceding vowel, and some lose their own nucleus under predictable conditions. The class of vowel-suppressing suffixes cannot be defined in terms of some common morphological, morpho-syntactic, or semantic feature. Suffixes from all categories in the language suppress the preceding vowel.

=== Consonants ===
As for the [[consonant]]s, Aymara has phonemic stops at the [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar]] and [[uvular]] points of articulation. Stops show no distinction of voice (e.g. there is no phonemic contrast between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}), but each stop has three forms: plain ([[Tenuis consonant|tenuis]]), [[glottalization|glottalized]], and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]. Aymara also has a trilled {{IPA|/r/}}, and an alveolar/palatal contrast for nasals and laterals, as well as two semivowels ({{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}).

=== Stress ===
Stress is usually on the second-to-last syllable, but long vowels may shift it. Although the final vowel of a word is elided except at the end of a phrase, the stress remains unchanged.

=== Syllable structure ===
The vast majority of roots are bisyllabic and, with few exceptions, [[suffix]]es are [[monosyllabic]]. Roots conform to the template (C)V(C)CV, with CVCV being predominant. The majority of suffixes are CV, though there are some exceptions: CVCV, CCV, CCVCV and even VCV are possible but rare.

The agglutinative nature of this suffixal language, coupled with morphophonological alternations caused by vowel deletion and phonologically conditioned constraints, gives rise to interesting surface structures that operate in the domain of the morpheme, syllable, and phonological word/phrase.  The phonological/morphophonological processes observed include syllabic reduction, epenthesis, deletion, and reduplication.&lt;ref name="brill.com" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
[[File:Acta de Independencia de las Provincias Unidas en Sud Am√©rica - Espa√±ol - Aymara.jpg|thumb|250px|Declaration of Independence of the [[United Provinces of South America]] (present-day Argentina) in Spanish and Aymara]]
Beginning with Spanish missionary efforts, there have been many attempts to create a writing system for Aymara. The colonial sources employed a variety of writing systems heavily influenced by Spanish, the most widespread one being that of [[Ludovico Bertonio|Bertonio]]. Many of the early grammars employed unique alphabets as well as the one of Middendorf's ''Aymara-Sprache'' (1891).

The first official alphabet to be adopted for Aymara was the Scientific Alphabet. It was approved by the ''III Congreso Indigenista Interamericano de la Paz'' in 1954, though its origins can be traced as far back as 1931. Rs. No 1593 (Deza Galindo 1989, 17). It was the first official record of an alphabet, but in 1914, Sisko Chukiwanka Ayulo and Juli√°n Palacios R√≠os had recorded what may be the first of many attempts to have one alphabet for both Quechua and Aymara, the ''Syentifiko Qheshwa-Aymara Alfabeto'' with 37 graphemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Several other attempts followed, with varying degrees of success. Some orthographic attempts even expand further: the ''Alfabeto Funcional Triling√ºe'', made up of 40 letters (including the voiced stops necessary for Spanish) and created by the Academia de las Lenguas Aymara y Quechua in Puno in 1944 is the one used by the lexicographer Juan Francisco Deza Galindo in his ''Diccionario Aymara ‚Äì Castellano / Castellano ‚Äì Aymara''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This alphabet has five vowels ‚ü®a, e, i, o, u‚ü©, aspiration is conveyed with an ‚ü®h‚ü© next to the consonant, and ejectives with ‚ü®‚Äô‚ü©. The most unusual characteristic is the expression of the uvular /œá/ with ‚ü®jh‚ü©. The other uvular segment, /q/, is expressed by ‚ü®q‚ü©, but transcription rules mandate that the following vowel must be ‚ü®a, e, o‚ü© (not ‚ü®i, u‚ü©), presumably to account for uvular lowering and to facilitate multilingual orthography.

The alphabet created by the Comisi√≥n de Alfabetizaci√≥n y Literatura Aymara (CALA) was officially recognized in Bolivia in 1968 (co-existing with the 1954 Scientific Alphabet).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Besides being the alphabet employed by Protestant missionaries, it is also the one used for the translation of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Also in 1968, de Dios Yapita created his take on the Aymara alphabet at the Instituto de Lenga y Cultura Aymara (ILCA).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Nearly 15 years later, the ''Servicio Nacional de Alfabetizaci√≥n y Educaci√≥n Popular'' (SENALEP) attempted to consolidate these alphabets to create a system which could be used to write both Aymara and Quechua, creating what was known as the Alfabeto Unificado. The alphabet, later sanctioned in Bolivia by Decree 20227 on 9 May 1984 and in Peru as la Resoluci√≥n Ministerial Peruana 1218ED on 18 November 1985, consists of 3 vowels, 26 consonants and an [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] to mark vowel length.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Morphology ==
Aymara is a highly agglutinative, suffixal language. All suffixes can be categorized into the nominal, verbal, transpositional and those not subcategorized for lexical category (including stem-external word-level suffixes and phrase-final suffixes),&lt;ref name="brill.com" /&gt; as below:

* Nominal and verbal morphology is characterized by derivational- and inflectional-like suffixes as well as non-productive suffixes.
* Transpositional morphology consists of verbalizers (that operate on the root or phrasal levels) and nominalizers (including an action nominalizer, an agentive, and a resultative).
* Suffixes not subcategorized for lexical category can be divided into three stem-external, word-level suffixes (otherwise known as "independent suffixes") and around a dozen phrase-final suffixes (otherwise known as "sentence suffixes").

=== Nominal suffixes ===
* Non-productive nominal suffixes vary considerably by variant but typically include those below. Some varieties additionally also have (1) the suffix -''wurasa'' (&lt; Spanish 'horas'), which expresses ‚Äòwhen‚Äô on ''aka'' ‚Äòthis‚Äô, ''uka'' ‚Äòthat‚Äô and ''kuna'' ‚Äòwhat‚Äô; (2) temporal suffixes -''unt'' ~ -''umt''; and (3)  -''kucha'', which attaches to only two roots, ''jani'' ‚Äòno‚Äô and ''jicha'' ‚Äònow‚Äô:
** kinship suffixes, including -''la'', -''lla'', -''chi'', and/or -''ta''
** the expression of size with -''ch‚Äôa''
** the suffix -''sa'' ‚Äòside‚Äô, which attaches to only the demonstratives and ''kawki'' ‚Äòwhere‚Äô
* Nominal derivational-like suffixes:
** diminutive suffixes
** delimitative suffix -''chapi''
* Nominal inflectional-like suffixes:
** Attributive suffix -''ni''
** Possessive paradigm
** Plural -''naka''
** Reciprocal/inclusor -''pacha''
** Case suffixes - Syntactic relations are generally case-marked, with the exception of the unmarked subject. Case is affixed to the last element of a [[noun phrase]], usually corresponding to the head. Most varieties of Aymara have 14 cases (though in many, the genitive and locative have merged into a single form): [[ablative]] -''ta'',  [[accusative]] (indicated by vowel suppression), [[allative]] -''ru'', [[benefactive]] -''taki'', [[comparative]] -''jama'',  [[genitive]] -''na'',  [[instrumental case|instrumental/comitative]] -''mpi'', interactive -''pura'', [[locative]] -''na'', limitative -''kama'', [[nominative case|nominative]] (zero), [[perlative case|perlative]] -''kata'', purposive -''layku''.

=== Verbal suffixes ===
All verbs require at least one suffix to be grammatical.

* Verbal derivational-like suffixes
** Direction of motion ‚Äî Although these suffixes are quite productive, they are not obligatory. The meaning of a word which is affixed with a member of this category is often but not always predictable, and the word formed may have a different meaning than the root.
** Spatial location ‚Äî The nine spatial locations suffixes are likewise highly productive and not obligatory. Similarly, the meaning of the word that contains a member of this category is typically (but not consistently) predictable. There are also contexts in which the word formed has a meaning that significantly differs from that of the root to which it attaches.
** Valency-increasing ‚Äî The five valency increasing suffixes may occur on a wide range of verbs but are not obligatory. The meaning expressed when a word receives one of these suffixes is predictable.
** Multipliers/reversers ‚Äî The two multipliers/reversers are comparatively less productive and are not obligatory. In some contexts, attachment to a verb conveys a reverser meaning and effectively express the opposite of the meaning of the plain root. In this respect, the multipliers/reversers are the most derivational-like of all the suffixes discussed so far.
** Aspect ‚Äî This category is complicated insofar as it is made up of a diverse array of suffix types, some of which are more productive and/or obligatory than others.
** Others ‚Äî In some varieties of Aymara, there are three suffixes not classified into the categories above: the verbal comparative -''jama'', the category buffer -''(w)jwa'', and the intensifier -''paya''. Semantically, these three suffixes do not have much in common. They also vary with respect to the degree which they may be classified as more derivational-like or more inflectional-like.
* Verbal inflectional-like suffixes:
** Person/tense ‚Äî Person and tense are fused into a unitary suffix. These forms are among the most inflectional-like of the verbal suffixes insofar as they are all obligatory and productive. The so-called personal-knowledge tenses include the simple (non-past) and the proximal past. The non-personal knowledge tenses includes the future and distal past.
** Number ‚Äî The plural verbal suffix, -''pha'' (just as the nominal one,-''naka'') is optional. Thus, while pluralization is very productive, it is not obligatory.
** Mood and modality ‚Äî Mood and modality includes mood, evidentials, event modality, and the imperative. These suffixes are both productive and obligatory. Their semantic affect is usually transparent.

=== Transpositional suffixes ===

A given word can take several transpositional suffixes:
* Verbalizers: There are six suffixes whose primary function is to verbalize nominal roots (not including the reflexive -''si'' and the propagative -''tata''). These forms can be subdivided into two groups, (1) phrase verbalizers and (2) root verbalizers.
* Nominalizers: There are three suffixes are used to derive nouns: the agentive -''iri'', the resultative -''ta'', and the action nominalizer (sometimes glossed as the "infinitive" in some descriptions) -''√±a''.

=== Suffixes not subcategorized for lexical categories ===

There are two kinds of suffixes not subcategorized for lexical categories:
* Stem external word-final suffixes (sometimes known as "independent suffixes") ‚Äî There are three suffixes that are not classifiable as members of either nominal or verbal morphology and are not phrase-final suffixes: the emphatic -''puni'', the delimitative -''ki'', and the additive -''raki''
* Phrase-final suffixes (sometimes known as "sentence suffixes" in the literature) ‚Äî Most Aymara phrases have at least one of the eleven (depending on variant) possible phrase-final suffixes to be grammatical. The phrase-final suffix must appear minimally on a noun, noun phrase, verb, or verb phrase (note that two phrase-final suffixes, the additive -''sa'' and the confirmatory -''pi'' appear exclusively on nouns but otherwise pattern with phrase-final suffixes and so may not be best treated with nominal morphology). Exceptions to the requirement that a phrase has at least one phrase-final suffix are mainly limited to imperative constructions.

== Idiosyncrasies ==
{{original research|date=October 2011}}
Linguistic and gestural analysis by [[Rafael E. N√∫√±ez|N√∫√±ez]] and [[Eve Sweetser|Sweetser]] also asserts that the Aymara have an apparently-unique (or at least very rare) understanding of time. Aymara is, with Quechua, one of very few [N√∫√±ez &amp; Sweetser, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;403] languages in which speakers seem to represent the past as in front of them and the future as behind them. Their argument is mainly within the framework of [[conceptual metaphor]], which recognizes in general two subtypes of the metaphor "the passage of time is motion:" one is "time passing is motion over a landscape" (or "moving-ego"), and the other is "time passing is a moving object" ("moving-events"). The latter metaphor does not explicitly involve the individual/speaker. Events are in a queue, with prior events towards the front of the line. The individual may be facing the queue, or it may be moving from left to right in front of him/her.

The claims regarding Aymara involve the moving-ego metaphor. Most languages conceptualize the ego as moving forward into the future, with ego's back to the past. The English sentences ''prepare for what lies before us'' and ''we are facing a prosperous future'' exemplify the metaphor. In contrast, Aymara seems to encode the past as in front of individuals and the future behind them. That is [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] a rare phenomenon [N√∫√±ez &amp; Sweetser, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;416].

The fact that English has words like ''before'' and ''after'' that are (currently or archaically) [[polysemy|polysemous]] between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims regarding Aymara uniqueness.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, those words relate events to other events and are part of the moving-events metaphor. In fact, when ''before'' means ''in front of '''ego''''', it can mean only ''future''. For instance, ''our future is laid out '''before us''''' while ''our past is '''behind us'''''. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as ''qhipa uru'', literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua-speakers, whose expression ''qhipa p'unchaw'' corresponds directly to Aymara ''qhipa uru''. Possibly, the metaphor is from the fact that the past is visible (in front of one's eyes), but the future is not.

== Pedagogy ==
There is increasing use of Aymara locally and there are increased numbers learning the language, both Bolivian and abroad. In Bolivia and Peru, [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs with Aymara and Spanish have been introduced in the last two decades. There are even projects to offer Aymara through the internet, such as by ILCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcanet.org/ciberaymara|title=CIBERAYMARA|author=|date=|website=www.ilcanet.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011132938/http://www.ilcanet.org/ciberaymara/|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buru''' is a [[Southern Bantoid languages|Southern Bantoid language]] of uncertain classification spoken in a single village in [[Nigeria]]. It is spoken in [[Sardauna, Nigeria|Sardauna LGA]], [[Taraba State]].

The only data on Buru is a wordlist collected by Robert Koops in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Bantoid/General/Blench%20Bantu%20IV%20Berlin%20Bantoid%202011.pdf|title=The membership and internal structure of Bantoid and the border with Bantu|last=Roger Blench|first=|date=7‚Äì9 April 2011|website=|page=20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only published discussion of the classification of Buru is Piron (1998),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which treats it as [[Tivoid]], although apart from sharing some lexical items with Northwest Tivoid probably due to proximity, there is little evidence to classify it. It is treated as an isolate within [[Bantoid]] by Blench (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Bantoid/Tivoid/General/Tivoid%20comparative.pdf|title=THE TIVOID LANGUAGES: OVERVIEW AND COMPARATIVE WORDLIST|last=Roger Blench|first=|date=15 September 2016|website=|page=14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
A 2000 report by [[UNODC]] estimated the prevalence of adult use of cannabis in Bahrain to be between .1-.4%.&lt;ref name="Hawdon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hawdon|title=Drug and Alcohol Consumption as Functions of Social Structures: A Cross-cultural Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpMbAQAAMAAJ|date=January 2005|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=978-0-7734-6187-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
In 2014 a Bahraini citizen was arrested for growing cannabis plants at his house, and possessing 767 grams of hashish.

The '''Cascade Center at the Riverplex''' is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the [[Warner Bros.]], hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.

==History==
The [[Warner Bros.|Warners]], residents of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], were sons of [[Polish Jew]]s wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]]'' in Youngstown,&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.&lt;ref name="Warner54-55"&gt;Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.&lt;ref name="ohiomag-march83"&gt;{{cite news

{{cite news
  | title = Jack L. Warner's Death Closes Out Pioneer Clan of 'Talkies'

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby [[Cascade Park (amusement park)|Cascade Park]]. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.

Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a [[parking lot]]. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other [[Rust Belt]] cities, saw the collapse of the [[steel]] industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general [[suburbanization]] effect that had been happening throughout the [[United States]] since the 1950s.

By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers &amp; Custom Tailors, is a men's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O Railroad]] Federal Credit Union, a [[credit union]] that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the [[Neshannock Creek]] and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.

In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a [[Occupancy|condemnation]] notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.

==Development==
The city took most of the property by [[eminent domain]] and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the [[sidewalk]] in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&amp;O Credit Union‚Äînow the First Choice Federal Credit Union‚Äîto temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring [[Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]].) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by [[screen-printing]] [[T-shirt]]s as well as serving as the area's [[J. C. Penney]] Catalog Center after [[Rite Aid]] acquired [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd Pharmacy]] in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] open in the building.

Although the downtown streets &amp; sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The [[alley]] that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a [[Esplanade|promenade]] that leads to an outdoor [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]] between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.

Much like [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the complex is an example of [[adaptive reuse]], and focuses on the early years of [[Film|motion pictures]] much like Station Square focuses on [[train]]s. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.

Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with [[Time Warner]], the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of [[Harry Warner]], did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncnewsonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_112013504?start:int=30{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.
 
It should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.

Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

'''Central Tibetan''', also known as '''Dbus''', '''√ú''' or '''√ú-Tsang''', is the most widely spoken [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic language]] and the basis of [[Standard Tibetan]].

''Dbus'' and ''√ú'' are forms of the same name. ''Dbus'' is a transliteration of the name in [[Tibetan script]], &lt;big&gt;{{lang|bo|‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡Ω¥‡Ω¶‡ºã}}&lt;/big&gt;, whereas ''√ú'' is the pronunciation of the same in Lhasa dialect, {{IPA-bo|wyÀßÀ•Àß î|}} (or {{IPA|[yÀßÀ•Àß î]}}). That is, in Tibetan, the name is spelled ''Dbus'' and pronounced ''√ú''. All of these names are frequently applied specifically to the [[prestige dialect]] of Lhasa.

There are many [[mutually intelligible]] Central Tibetan dialects besides that of Lhasa, with particular diversity along the border and in Nepal:&lt;ref&gt;N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tib√©taine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n¬∞25, p.&amp;nbsp;7‚Äì56 [http://www.nicolas-tournadre.net/wp-content/uploads/multimedia/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnologue'' reports that Walungge is highly intelligible with Thudam, ''Glottolog'' that Thudam is not a distinct variety.  Tournadre (2013) classifies Tseku with [[Khams Tibetan|Khams]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5562">The '''Climate Summit 2014''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''Leader's Climate Summit''') was a meeting on climate change in [[New York City|New York]] on September 23, 2014. UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] announced it in September 2013 and invited leaders of governments, the private sector, and civil society to unite in taking concrete action towards a low-carbon world.

The Summit's focus was on initiatives and actions rather than on negotiations between countries. It was seen as a milestone on the path towards closing the ''emissions gap'' between reduction pledges and the necessary emission cuts for the [[Climate change mitigation|2 ¬∞C scenario]] (with "pursue efforts to" limit the temperature increase to 1.5&amp;nbsp;¬∞C), and to a new legal agreement on climate change, to be approved by the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]] in December 2015. One product of the Summit was the [[New York Declaration on Forests]].

== Developments and positions prior to the Summit ==
After the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP19 in Warsaw]], the Climate Summit was the next high-level gathering on climate change. Since the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s second commitment period expires in 2020, the [[UNFCCC]] process attempts to establish a new worldwide contract about climate protection and emission reduction objectives, that is to be drafted in 2014 at the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP20 in Lima]] and adopted in 2015 at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]]. The Climate Summit in September 2014 is not part of this negotiating process, but is expected to serve as a kick-off for a year of intense activity in climate policy and an indicator on the countries' ambitions to reduce emissions and support climate protection. Having this in mind, UN Secretary-General Ban invited leaders of governments, the private sector and [[civil society]] from all over the world to unite in action:

{{quote|I challenge you to bring to the Summit bold pledges. Innovate, scale-up, cooperate and deliver concrete action that will close the emissions gap and put us on track for an ambitious legal agreement through the UNFCCC process.|UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/climatechange/summit2014 ''Climate Summit 2014''], un.org; visited March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 2013, Secretary-General Ban appointed the former President of Ghana, [[John Kufuor]], and [[Jens Stoltenberg]], former Prime Minister of Norway, as special envoys on climate change, to assist Ban in connection with the Climate Summit and provide strategic advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://summit.sites.unicnetwork.org/2013/12/23/secretary-general-appoints-special-envoys-on-climate-change-to-engage-global-leaders-ahead-of-2014-climate-summit/#more-113 ''Secretary-General appoints special envoys on climate change''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175308/http://summit.sites.unicnetwork.org/2013/12/23/secretary-general-appoints-special-envoys-on-climate-change-to-engage-global-leaders-ahead-of-2014-climate-summit/#more-113#more-113 |date=2014-04-16 }}, unicnetwork.org; visited March 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation of the Climate Summit, on May 4 and 5 the ''Abu Dhabi Ascent'' was held in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]], as a meeting in order to cross-link initiatives between governments, the private sector and civil society and to "generate momentum" for the Climate Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47073 ''United Arab Emirates to host meeting ahead of UN chief‚Äôs climate summit''], un.org; visited March 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Ban Ki-moon appointed former [[President of Ireland]], and former [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Mary Robinson]], a special envoy for climate change to interact with global leaders ahead of the Climate Summit, to forge political commitment towards finalizing an agreement in 2015.&lt;ref name="ClimateChange"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robinson to head United Nations effort on climate change|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/223797021/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Robinson-to-head-United-Nations-effort-on-climate-change|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715110732/http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/223797021/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Robinson-to-head-United-Nations-effort-on-climate-change|archive-date=2014-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with '''disabilities in Togo''' face many unique challenges. Disability in [[Togo]] is often seen as a [[curse]] or sign of [[witchcraft]], leading to poor outcomes for people with disabilities. [[Accessibility]] in the country is lacking. However, Togo has signed onto the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and has created plans to encourage greater inclusion for people with disabilities in the country. 

== Demographics ==
[[Census]] data from 2010 shows that approximately 1.36% of the population of Togo has a disability of some type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://togo.opendataforafrica.org/xurbfzd/population-with-disabilities|title=Population With Disabilities - Portail de donn√©es du Togo|last=Cheryshev|first=Denis|date=26 May 2015|work=Knoema|access-date=2018-07-29|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other countries in Africa, children in Togo often become disabled due to various complications, disease, poor diet and other causes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/togo/relieving-disabled-children-crippling-customs|title=Relieving disabled children from crippling customs|last=|first=|date=19 June 2012|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729212154/https://reliefweb.int/report/togo/relieving-disabled-children-crippling-customs|archive-date=29 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Cultural attitudes towards disability ==
Children who are born with a disability in [[Togo]], like in some other [[West Africa|West African]] countries, can face violence at home, school or from other members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/about/news-publications/news/2018/february/children-with-disabilities-in-west-africa-experience-violence-fr|title=Children with Disabilities in West Africa Experience Violence from the Day they are Born|last=|first=|date=1 February 2018|website=NYU|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability is seen as a sign of [[witchcraft]] and is considered [[taboo]] by some communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thisisafrica.me/togo-disabled-childrens-labeled-witchcraft-prisoners/|title=Togo where disabled children‚Äôs accused of witchcraft are imprisoned and ostracised|last=Obera|first=Fred|date=2017-05-16|work=This Is Africa|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, the disability is considered the "result of a [[demon]] in the family."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children with disabilities might also face [[neglect]] at home.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Hashemi|Cameron|Cameron|2018|p=4}} Children born with a physical disability are viewed as "a non-human spirit," by some families.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Hashemi|Cameron|Cameron|2018|p=5}} Some parents deliberately keep their children out of school to protect them from abuse there.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Hashemi|Cameron|Cameron|2018|p=5}} People with disabilities in Togo in general were considered [[Curse|cursed]] and that the disability could be [[Contagious disease|contagious]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/togo-sees-progress-struggle-rights-people-disabilities|title=Togo sees progress in the struggle for the rights of people with disabilities|last=Abi|first=Samir|date=26 July 2014|work=D+C|access-date=2018-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503134631/http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/togo-sees-progress-struggle-rights-people-disabilities|archive-date=3 May 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against children with disabilities and their deaths often goes unreported to authorities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often entire families are [[Ostracism|ostracized]] because of one family members' disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

People with [[Mental disorder|mental disabilities]] in Togo may be chained up in places known as [[prayer camps]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/health/the-chains-of-mental-illness-in-west-africa.html|title=The Chains of Mental Illness in West Africa|last=Carey|first=Benedict|date=11 October 2015|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These camps are religious institutions where individuals are restrained, not given [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] help and are [[Prayer|prayed over]] in an attempt to heal the individuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Togo, there are several prayer camps which use different methods, often based on the camp's head [[Pastor|pastors]]' personality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Policy ==
There is a lack of inclusion for people with disabilities in leadership positions in Togo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2013, [[J√©r√©mie Yao Vidja]], who is [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]], became the first person with a disability to run for elected office in Togo and he was later elected to the [[National Assembly (Togo)|Togolese National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://visionssolidaires.com/2013/08/07/revue-de-presse-jeremie-yao-vidja-premier-malvoyant-depute-au-togo/|title=Revue de presse: J√©r√©mie Yao Vidja, premier malvoyant d√©put√© au Togo|date=2013-08-07|work=Visions Solidaires|access-date=2018-07-29|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Politics of Togo|government in Togo]] signed on to the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2016, Togo's [[Ministry of Social Action]] created a committee dedicated to "fostering social inclusion for people with disabilities."{{Sfn|ICRC|2017|p=3}} In 2017, [[Universal health care|Universal Health Coverage]] was given to all students living in Togo.{{Sfn|ICRC|2017|p=1}}  

=== Infrastructure ===
Togo's public buildings are still not fully accommodating to people with physical disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, there is no legislation requiring [[accessibility]] in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.countryreports.org/travel/Togo/accessibility.htm|title=Disability Access In Togo|last=|first=|date=|website=Country Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Education ===
[[File:15_10_01_CISTEM_Training_CIC2.png|thumb|Students with disabilities taking CISTEM courses at the United States Embassy in Lome, Togo in October of 2015.]]
People with disabilities were first allowed to attend public schools in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also in the 1970s, [[Germany|German]] and [[United States|American]] charities set up special-needs schools, focusing on students with visual impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2014, there were nine schools and centers for children with intellectual disabilities, with most located in [[Lom√©]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also by 2014, schools for those with hearing impairment had been created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Efforts at including students with disabilities has started to increase. In 2014, there were hundreds of students with various physical disabilities were enrolled in universities around Togo, including 27 visually impaired students at the [[University of Lom√©]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Non governmental organizations ===
[[Non-governmental organization|Non governmental organizations]] recognize that they need to work closely with the [[Ministry of Health (Togo)|Ministry of Health]] and the [[Ministry of Education (Togo)|Ministry of Education]] in Togo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Handicap International|Humanity &amp; Inclusion]] (HI), started a trial program in Togo and other African countries to help produce [[3D printing|3D-printed]] [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] limbs for [[Amputation|amputees]] in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/3d-printing-trial-launched-to-help-amputees-in-madagascar-togo/|title=3D printing trial launched to help amputees in Madagascar, Togo|last=Osborne|first=Charlie|date=9 July 2018|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729185217/https://www.zdnet.com/article/3d-printing-trial-launched-to-help-amputees-in-madagascar-togo/|archive-date=29 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also demonstrates how women can defend themselves from attacks, and interviews women who have been attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Interview "I have always had my eye on the exit", Choice Magazine, December 2007, p23 - p25, Choice Publishing Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; De Paul reports that 180,000 rapes and sexual assaults are recorded each year in England and Wales, while research in the United States suggests that women can double their chances of avoiding being raped if they resist their attacker.&lt;ref&gt;11th August 1992, The Times&lt;/ref&gt; It was first shown on [[BBC One]] on 10 August 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/55f2f6b71d70462eac60885148e62c99|title=Eve Strikes Back|date=6 August 1992|publisher=|issue=3580|pages=48|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=BBC Genome}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated on 29 March 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/ad30fc93a56b496e84f76419e55f6841|title=Eve Strikes Back|date=25 March 1993|publisher=|issue=3612|pages=80|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=BBC Genome}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program won a [[Royal Television Society Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29457228|title=Singer Lynsey de Paul dies aged 64|date=2 October 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2014/obituary-lynsey-de-paul/|title=Obituary: Lynsey de Paul - Obituaries - The Stage|date=10 October 2014|website=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lynsey-de-paul-mn0000170321/biography|title=Lynsey de Paul - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Paul also produced a video distributed by PolyGram Video and, in 2007, an updated DVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.easier.com/28914-lynsey-de-paul-s-self-defence-for-women.html|title=Lynsey De Paul‚Äôs Self Defence For Women |website=Easier.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; called ''Taking Control'' that provides further instruction with de Paul and John Steadman, a ninth dan ju-jitsu black belt expert, acting out defence strategies as well de Paul presenting facts and figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/womens-issues/self+defence-3224.html|title=Taking Control DVD|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of the video and DVD is on disabling any assailant for long enough to get away. Confrontation is always the last option, but infinitely preferable to being a passive victim, and the popular view that fighting back increases the risk of serious injury is refuted. The evidence for this was drawn from the work of Dr Pauline Bart at the University of Chicago showing that women who screamed, shouted, resisted were at no greater risk from retaliation by their aggressors, but were more likely to successfully fend off an attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Dirty marks: the education of self, media, and popular culture by John F. Schostak
Pluto Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Keal interviewed de Paul for the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' in 2007 and she is quoted as saying ""Don't address the area where he's attacking," she said. "That's might against might, and he's stronger than you. But his main weapons - his arms - are in use while yours are free to attack his vulnerable areas. If you target them quickly, you turn the control around." Keal wrote "It's a persuasive argument which looks even more convincing when you see Lynsey in action. And at a fighting weight of six-and-a-half stone, you realise that if little Lynsey can do it, anyone can".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Vital+lives:+MY+FIRST+LINE+OF+DEFENCE;+SINGER-SONGWRITER+LYNSEY+DE...-a0161366660|title=Vital lives: MY FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE; SINGER-SONGWRITER LYNSEY DE PAUL IS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT WOMEN STANDING UP TO ATTACKERS THAT SHE'S BROUGHT OUT A DVD ON THE SUBJECT. |website=Thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was released in other countries such as Spain and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/selbstverteidigung-fur-frauen-das-komplette-trainingsprogramm-die-wichtigsten-taktiken-psychologisches-training/oclc/838099620&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Selbstverteidigung f√ºr Frauen Das komplette Trainingsprogramm ; Die wichtigsten Taktiken ; Psychologisches Training|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=Worldcat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314754/|title=Taking Control|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in the official magazine of the British Jujitsu Association and the United Kingdom Taekwando Association ''Fighters: The Martial Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 15, Number 9, September 1992, ''Fighters: The Martial Arts Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Mackenzie ([[Brian Mackenzie, Baron Mackenzie of Framwellgate]]), former president of the [[Police Superintendents' Association]] endorsed the self-defence advice presented by de Paul, saying: "It is a very positive contribution to crime prevention and the protection of women and I will be recommending it."&lt;ref name="standard.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/pop-star-lynsey-de-paul-reveals-the-truth-about-her-love-life-7170842.html|title=Pop star Lynsey de Paul reveals the truth about her love-life|website=Standard.co.uk|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book, authored by de Paul and TV producer Claire McCormack, was also published in 1993 entitled "Taking Control: Basic Mental &amp; Physical Self Defence for Women" to underscore the lessons presented in ''Eve Strikes Back'' and ''Taking Control''.&lt;ref&gt;Boxtree Ltd March 31, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1852834289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/29135512|title=Takingcontrol|first1=Lynsey|last1=De Paul|first2=Clare|last2=McCormick|date=7 April 1993|publisher=London : Boxtree|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=Trove}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Paul also toured schools and universities in order to encourage them to get the self defence techniques included in their curricula.&lt;ref name="standard.co.uk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28380">'''Gangs in Canada''' are mostly present in the major urban areas of [[Canada]], although their activities are not confined to large cities.

==Types==
The most prevalent gangs in Canada include:

*[[Gang|Street gangs]]
*[[Outlaw motorcycle club|Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]
*[[Mafia]]s and [[Organized crime]] groups, including [[Aboriginal Based Organized Crime]], [[Indo-Canadian organized crime|Indian organized crime]], and [[Triad (underground society)|East Asian organized crime]]
*[[Drug cartel]]s

According to a 2004 police report, "The [[Hells Angels]] remain some of the largest and most powerful motorcycle gangs in the country, with growing influence in British Columbia and Ontario. Its presence has declined in other provinces due to police efforts, internal conflict and increased competition from other crime groups."&lt;ref name="canada.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/national/features/crime_report/story.html |title=Canadian news, entertainment, television, newspapers, free email and more |publisher=canada.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/08/20/crime_report040819.html |work=CBC News |title=Asian gangs pose major threat, police report says |date=2004-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517083241/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/08/20/crime_report040819.html |archivedate=May 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same report stated that Aboriginal street gangs are not as highly organized as other criminal organizations in Canada, but are amongst the most violent. Aboriginal people also constitute a significant portion of prison populations throughout Canada, and the number of [[First Nation]] inmates continues to rise at a considerable rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/cmslib/general/NAOs.pdf|title=Number of Aboriginal People in Canada‚Äôs Prisons Growing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=July 6, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502154419/http://www.afn.ca/cmslib/general/NAOs.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005 it is believed over 1000 Aboriginal youths were members of street gangs.&lt;ref name="by insideprison.com, May 2006"&gt;{{cite web|author=insideprison.com, May 2006 |url=http://www.insideprison.com/prison-gangs-canada.asp |title=Prison Gangs in Canada |publisher=Inside Prison |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Criminal Intelligence Service Canada]] (CISC), "The established, well-financed and -connected [[Hong Kong]] [[Triad (underground societies)|Triad]] groups and crime syndicates remain, to our mind, the biggest long-term threat to Canadian law enforcement and society."&lt;ref&gt;Lavigne, Yves. Teeth of the Dragon. Death Dealers: p. 104; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Triad Societies, other Asian criminal groups, such as [[Big Circle Gang|The Big Circle Gang]], have also established national networks based in the major cities of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=Alex|title=The big circle boys: Revisiting the case of the flaming eagles|journal=Global Crime|year=2008|volume=9|issue=4|pages=306‚Äì331|doi=10.1080/17440570802543540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Peng|title=Vicious circles - Gang legacy of the Cultural Revolution|journal=Jane's intelligence Review|year=2011|volume=23|issue=08|pages=46‚Äì49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2002-2009 there was a bloody gang war between two rival East Asian gangs the FK and FOB gangs which resulted in 25 gang related murders.  Not only East Asians were involved but there were also White, (East) Indian, and in some cases Black gang members part of these gangs.&lt;ref&gt;http://theses.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/11023/2372/4/ucalgary_2015_hoang_michael.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronshoulders.ca/eight-years-bloodshed.htm|title=Eight Years of Bloodshed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes over the illegal distribution of fentanyl have broken out within the Middle Eastern community (with some being Lebanese).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/crime/fentanyl-trafficking-behind-recent-drug-violence-say-calgary-police|title=Fentanyl trafficking behind recent drug violence, say Calgary police|date=2015-12-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Asian street gangs of the early 2000s, these are not therefore from exclusively one ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/calgary/calgary-police-gang-war-guns-violence-1.3364874|title='Off the hook' violence and family connections define Calgary's all-out gang war|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However recently the arrival of Mexican drug traffickers, along with increased activity by outlaw motorcycle gangs, is changing the face of organized crime in Alberta especially in the major cities of Edmonton along with Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com//news/canada/biker-gangs-and-mexican-drug-traffickers-the-new-face-of-organized-crime-in-alberta-rcmp-commander|title=Biker gangs and Mexican drug traffickers the new face of organized crime in Alberta: RCMP commander|website=www.nationalpost.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halifax===
&lt;!-- *** DO NOT name gangs. *** Naming gangs will be deleted --&gt;
Biker gangs have, at various points, played a major role in Halifax's crime scene, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="SherMarsden2010a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julian Sher|author2=William Marsden|title=The Road to Hell: How the Biker Gangs are Conquering Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ToCy5cH253YC&amp;pg=PT115|year=2010|publisher=Knopf Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36586-6|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a crackdown on biker gang activity throughout Eastern Canada, in the wake of the [[Quebec Biker War]].&lt;ref name="Totten2012a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Totten|title=Nasty, Brutish, and Short: The lives of gang members in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnGAvtxtugUC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2012|publisher=James Lorimer Limited, Publishers|isbn=978-1-4594-0039-9|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most biker gangs are composed of extended families or of close associates, providing little scope for recruitment or promotion from outside. The well-known [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]] have been part of Halifax's gang environment as well.&lt;ref name="Totten2012a"/&gt;

===Hamilton===
The area in and around Hamilton was once home to organized crime figure [[Rocco Perri]], so-called ''Canada's [[Al Capone]]'', and [[Johnny Papalia|Johnny ''Pops'' Papalia]].&lt;ref name="Langton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Langton|title=Showdown: How the Outlaws, Hells Angels and Cops Fought for Control of the Streets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MIDKlXj60AC&amp;pg=PA37|date= 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-67878-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murders of traditional mobsters in 2017 and 2018 indicate that the group is still active. After the September 2018 killing of real estate agent Al Iavarone, police sources told the [[Toronto Star]] that the hit was in retaliation for previous actions against the [[Musitano crime family]] as part of a "dispute between two Niagara Region groups of mobsters who are both tied to the New York State [Buffalo] mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2018/09/17/buffalo-mob-playing-role-in-deadly-ontario-dispute-sources-say.html/|title=Buffalo mob playing role in deadly Ontario dispute, sources say|publisher=Toronto Star|date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A news report stated that "there has been a resurgence of mafia-related crime in the greater Toronto and Hamilton areas in the last couple of years, leading police to believe there may be a 'power struggle'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8907237-family-of-murder-victim-albert-iavarone-asks-to-be-left-in-peace-//|title=Family of murder victim Albert Iavarone asks to be ‚Äòleft in peace‚Äô|publisher=Hamilton Spectator|date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A police survey found that most youth gangs in Ontario and the GTA are ethnically African/Caribbean (Somali/Jamaican/Haitian/Guyanese), Caucasian (Italian/Russian/Portuguese/Albanian/Polish/Greek/Spanish), and South Asian (Indian/Punjabi/Pakistani/Tamil).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astwood.ca/assets/gangs_e.pdf|title=Results of the 2002 Canadian Police Survey on Youth Gangs|last=|first=|date=December 2003|website=|publisher=|isbn=0-662-68124-X|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of Asian (Filipino/Chinese-Tibetan/Vietnamese/Cambodian/Korean) and Latino gangs in the area. Other minor groups are Biker gangs, Supremacist groups, and Mexican drug cartels, Middle Eastern (Persian/Afghan) gangs and Aboriginal street gangs.

Although Toronto's murder rate remains low, there has been a recent rise in gun violence in the downtown core of the [[greater Toronto area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-cities-largely-safe-but-rising-gun-violence-disturbing-1.1129887|title=Canadian cities largely safe but rising gun violence ‚Äòdisturbing‚Äô|date=18 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most focal incidents were the [[Boxing Day shooting]], a shootout between rival gangs that resulted in the death of 15-year-old bystander [[Jane Creba]] on December 26, 2005 on [[Yonge Street]], and a [[Eaton centre shooting|mall food court shooting at the Eaton Centre]] on June 2, 2012, which left two dead and injured seven others, including a 13-year-old boy.

During the investigation of the apparent mob hit of Albert Iavarone in September 2018, a Police investigator made this comment. "If you look back over the last couple years there has been a number of murders, a number of bombings, a number of arsons throughout the GTA and up to as far as Montreal. It is our belief that there is something going on in the underworld. We are not sure if this particular case factors into that but is something we are alive to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/real-estate-agent-shot-dead-in-ancaster-had-ties-to-organized-crime-world-police-1.4093829|title=Real estate agent shot dead in Ancaster had ties to organized crime world: police|date=14 September 2012|work=CTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known crime groups in [[Brampton]] include mainly South Asian and Black gangs but there are a few White, Portuguese, and Filipino gangs in the city. Members in SPG(Springdale) are 85% Punjabi, 10% Pakistani, 5% Tamil, while TGOD(Turner) was made up of 90% Punjabi and 10% Pakistani. Current feuds in the city have led to alliances such as Northside and TGORE, with Northside being made up of SPG, F-block(Fletchers), NPG(North Park Gang) and MLT(Malton), TGORE is made up of TGOD, Swood, Gore and Ray Lawson. Most areas are claimed by the Punjabi gangs and racial tensions between gang members in the city are mostly between South Asians and Blacks and to a less extent with Afghans feuding with Pakistanis such as KNK and AFG. Most black gangs in the city claim Crip and are gang members formerly living in Toronto and moving to Brampton townhouse complexes and apartments. Several alliances between notorious drug dealers such as Young Plug and Crip Fueler are also considered a gang (Gore Rippers). Many of the identities of the Gore Rippers is unknown, but they are well respected within the community. Young Plug is known to have gone ghost in 2012, but it is rumoured he has resurfaced in early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ikimap.com/map/brampton-indian-gangs|title=Brampton Indian Gangs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ikimap.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gurma''' (also called '''Gourma''' or '''Gourmantch√©''') is an [[ethnic group]] living mainly in [[Burkina Faso]], around [[Fada N'gourma|Fada N'Gourma]], and also in northern areas of [[Togo]] and [[Benin]], as well as southwestern [[Niger]]. They number approximately 1,750,000.

They might include the Bassaries who live in northern Togo and the Northern Volta of [[Kingdom of Dagbon (Northern Territories)|Kingdom of Dagbon]], [[Ghana]].

''Gurma'' is also the name of a language spoken by the Gurma (or bigourmantcheba - as they call themselves) people, which is part of the [[Gur languages|Gur]] language family. See [[Gurmanchema language]] and [[Oti-Volta languages]] for related languages spoken by the Gurma.

==Overview==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dolk TMnr 2416-25a.jpg|thumb|right|Gurma weapon]]
In 1985, Dr. [[Richard Alan Swanson]] wrote a book about these people, ''Gourmantch√© [[cultural anthropology|Ethnoanthropology]]: A Theory of Human Being''.  The book presents Gourmantch√© perception of 'human being' from the perspective of the people themselves, using their own language texts to illustrate concepts. Concepts of God (''Otienu''), destiny (''licabili''), the body (''gbannandi''), life (''limiali''), death (''mikuuma''), and all known terms for human body parts are also discussed.

In 2006, in Burkina Faso, Salif Titamba Lankoande published a book on the History and Ethnography of the Gourmantch√© (‚ÄúLes Gourmantche‚Äù, Presses Africaines du Burkina, Ouagadougou, 2006, 211 p.).

In 2012, the Portuguese Dr. Jo√£o Pedro Galhano Alves, published in Paris a book on the Gourmantch√© people and culture, and on the Ethnobiology of the coexistence among humans, lions and biodiversity in the region of the W of Niger, in Niger ("Anthropologie et √©cosyst√®mes au Niger. Humains, lions et esprits de la for√™t dans la culture gourmantch√© ", Editions l‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris, 2012, 448 p.). Since 2005, he also published other books and several articles about this subject and about  Gourmantch√© people. This publications are the result of research fieldwork made by the author in the W of Niger (Niger), between 2002 and 2010. Also, in 2010 and 2011, the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Madrid, Spain), from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (Spain) presented a public exhibition mainly based on the research works of this Anthropologist and Ethnobiologist, showing his main data, analysis and concepts, a selection of his photographic archive and his collection of ethnographic and ethnobiological objects collected in several research fields; One part of this exhibition was about the Gourmantch√© culture and the coexistence among humans, lions and biodiversity in the W of Niger; The title of this exhibition was "Vivir en biodiversidad total con leones, tigres o lobos".

[[Guatemala]] is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women and children subjected to [[Trafficking in human beings|trafficking]] in persons, specifically sexual servitude and forced labor. Guatemalan women and children are found in forced [[prostitution]] within the country, as well as in Mexico and the United States. Guatemalan men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor within the country, often in agriculture or domestic service, and particularly near the border with Mexico and in the highland region. Guatemalan men, women, and children are also found in conditions of forced labor in Mexico and the United States in agriculture and the garment industry. Indigenous Guatemalans are particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation. In the Mexican border area, Guatemalan children are exploited for forced begging on streets and forced labor in municipal dumps. Guatemala is a destination country for women and girls from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in forced prostitution. Migrants from these Central American countries transit through Guatemala en route to Mexico and the United States; some may become human trafficking victims. Child [[sex tourism]] is a problem in certain tourist areas such as [[Antigua]] and [[Lake Atitlan]], and child sex tourists predominately come from Canada, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The border with Mexico remains a top concern due to the heavy flow of irregular migrants, some of whom are trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Government of Guatemala does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these significant efforts, including prosecuting its first trafficking cases under the recent anti-trafficking law and establishing a new anti-trafficking office, the government did not show overall evidence of increasing efforts to address human trafficking through providing adequate victim services or addressing official complicity in trafficking; therefore, Guatemala is placed on Tier 2, for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the significant number of foreign trafficking victims identified by the government, foreign victims were not generally offered [[Asylum Records|asylum]] or [[temporary residency]], although the anti-trafficking law provides that authority. As such, most foreign trafficking victims were deported or required to remain in locked migrant detention facilities with no access to specialized victim services.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Guatemala".

[[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government maintained anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the last year and achieved its first convictions under its new anti-trafficking law. Article 202 of the Guatemalan penal code, which came into force in early 2009, prohibits the transport, transfer, retention, harboring, or reception of persons for the purposes of exploitation, including forced prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, begging, slavery, illegal adoptions, or forced marriage, in addition to other prohibited purposes. Penalties prescribed under Article 202 are from eight to 18 years‚Äô imprisonment; under aggravated circumstances, such as when the crime involves kidnapping, threats, violence, weapons, or a public official, penalties increase by one-third. Such penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. Many trafficking cases, however, continued to be prosecuted under other statutes, such as corruption of minors or [[Pandering (prostitution)|pandering]], that carry lesser sentences. The government maintained a small prosecutorial unit to investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases; approximately 60 percent of this unit‚Äôs investigations focused on illegal adoptions, which do not fall within the international definition of human trafficking. During the reporting period, authorities achieved seven convictions for human trafficking offenses, four of which were charged under the new anti-trafficking law, and one of which related to forced labor; sentences ranged from three to eight years‚Äô imprisonment. In comparison, during the previous year, the Guatemalan government reported no convictions for human trafficking offenses. Anti-trafficking police and prosecutors suffered from a lack of funding, resources, and training. Credible reports from international organizations, [[NGOs]], and several government officials indicated that corrupt public officials continued to impede anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and facilitated trafficking activity by accepting or extorting bribes, falsifying identity documents, leaking information about impending police raids to suspected traffickers, and ignoring trafficking activity in commercial sex sites. The government did not report prosecuting or convicting any officials complicit in human trafficking, although one congressman accused of corruption of children was stripped of his immunity. Guatemalan authorities collaborated with foreign governments on several trafficking investigations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
Although Guatemalan authorities reported rescuing 387 suspected trafficking victims during the reporting period, the government made insufficient efforts to protect trafficking victims, relying largely on [[NGOs]] and international organizations to provide the bulk of victim services. In spite of existing protocols for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as brothel workers, there was no evidence that these were implemented systematically or proactively. Government-funded services dedicated to trafficking victims remained virtually non-existent, and authorities provided no funding or subsidies to organizations that provided these services. Child victims were referred to one NGO-operated shelter dedicated for girl trafficking victims, or placed in state-run group homes designed for orphans or homeless children. The government sought to place adult victims in shelters for victims of domestic violence operated by NGOs or religious groups, but these shelters were overburdened and underfunded. Of the 387 trafficking victims identified, 326 were adult women, and most foreign adult victims were placed in migration detention centers without freedom of movement or access to specialized victim services. Although Guatemalan authorities encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, most victims did not file complaints due to fear of violence or reprisals and the inadequacy of the government‚Äôs limited witness protection program. A recent advisory opinion issued by the Supreme Court allowing for victim testimony via video could improve low rates of victim participation in prosecutions. The government did not detain, fine, or otherwise penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Many foreign trafficking victims, however, may not have had their victim status recognized by Guatemalan authorities before being deported as undocumented migrants. Guatemalan law establishes legal alternatives to removal of foreign victims who may face hardship or retribution upon repatriation. The authorities offered these alternatives on a case by case basis, but provided no evidence that any victims had accepted. In practice, any victim choosing to remain in Guatemala under an alternative legal status must stay in the closed migration detention center. Guatemalan consular officials in the United States and Mexico received training sessions on trafficking legislation and victim services. The government assisted in the repatriation of 14 Guatemalan trafficking victims from abroad and provided some care services to these victims, 12 of whom were children.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government sustained efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. In collaboration with an international organization, the government carried out a public awareness campaign using radio announcements about trafficking in persons in seven departments near the Mexican border. The government conducted workshops on the commercial [[sexual exploitation of children]] in 20 public schools. During the reporting period the government established the Secretariat Against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons to coordinate the government‚Äôs anti-trafficking efforts; however, this office received under five percent of the designated funding and subsequently took no discernible actions beyond evaluating current government efforts. Despite reports of child sex tourism, there were no reported prosecutions of child sex tourists. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce demand for forced labor or commercial sexual acts. Authorities provided training on human trafficking to Guatemalan troops prior to their deployment for international peacekeeping operations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Intimization''' is "a revelatory process which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as [an individuals‚Äôs] personal life ‚Äì broadly defined. It is a [[publicity]] process (involving the media) that takes place over time and involves flows of personal information and imagery into the [media]".&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It has mainly been studied as a society wide process in the context of politics although it can apply to other contexts.

==Definitions==
The term intimization was first used and defined as a process by Van Zoonen in her study of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television news in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  She defines it as a process whereby "values from the private sphere are transferred to the public sphere".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen"&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen not only in the greater focus on ‚Äòhuman interest subjects‚Äô but also in "the way the relation between audience and news reader is constructed... through carefully picked personalities and intimate modes of address".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen" /&gt;

Hirdman [[et al.]] use the term in their study of changes in [[Sweden|Swedish]] journalism from the 1880s. They define intimization as a process which sees increased journalistic attention on the family, sexuality and the private, what they term the ‚Äòintimate sphere‚Äô as opposed to the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Hirdman"&gt;Hirdman, A., Kleberg, M and Widestedt, K. 2005: Intimization of Journalism: Transformations of Medialized Public Spheres from 1880s to Current Times. Nordicom Review, 2 109-117. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that "modes of address, relations to sources, visual representations and focus of texts are seen to interact to create a kind of medial pseudo intimacy."&lt;ref name="Hirdman" /&gt;

The term [[privatization]] has sometimes also been used to signify the same process. Rahat and Sheafer, for example, define privatization as "a media focus on the personal characteristics and personal life of individual candidates."&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of this term is problematic as the word, most commonly associated the sale of state-owned assets, means the reverse, privatizing of something that is public not publicizing the private.

Stanyer argues that Intimization as a process relates primarily to media content formation and dissemination in any society and should not be conflated with [[Parasocial interaction|para-social]] or tele-mediated intimacy between audiences and those who appear on TV.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl, writing in the 1950s were particularly interested in the relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, D. and Whol, R Richard. (1956) Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction: Observations on Intimacy at a Distance. Psychiatry, 19: 215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl were not interested in the information and imagery to which audience members were exposed and made no distinction between the public and private matters but were rather interested in their illusory (para-social) relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. While not downplaying the importance of the audience, Stanyer observes it is the information and imagery to which an audience is exposed that is important in the intimization process. It is the mass exposure of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as the personal / private life of a public figure as opposed to their public/ professional life. Information and imagery we might expect only to be exchanged between those in a close relationship. In other words, public figures (politicians, celebrities, sports stars etc.) are not just familiar to us (that is recognisable) but potentially more information about their personal life circulates in the media, and the audience are exposed to more information from the private lives of public figures. An important distinction is made in this respect between familiarity and intimacy.

Stanyer suggests that flows of information can come from three specific areas or domains of the personal life. ‚ÄòThe first domain concerns the ‚Äòinner life‚Äô of [a person]. This includes, for example, his or her health, well being, sexuality, personal finances, deeds, misdeeds, key milestones (such as birthdays), life experiences and achievements, but also choices about the way an individual wants to live his or her life: for example, life-style choices, ways of behaving, choice of religion or questions of taste. The second domain concerns significant others in a person‚Äôs personal life and his or her relationship with these actors. This includes relationships with partners, other immediate and extended family members, friends and extra-marital lovers. The third domain concerns an individual‚Äôs life space: this includes his or her home but it also includes happenings in locations outside the home where the individual is not performing a public function and might want privacy, such as on family holidays‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Stanyer observes that intimization consists of "the publicizing of information and imagery from these three domains," he also notes such information can enter the public sphere with or without expressed or implied consent of those in public life and can either be [[scandal]]ous in nature (it reveals a transgression of societal norms) or non-scandalous.&lt;ref name="Stanyer"&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the former "might be an act of self-disclosure on a talk show or in an [[autobiography]] which is then recycled in the media." Example of the latter "might include, [[paparazzi]] photographs of politicians backstage or off-duty, taken without the subject‚Äôs permission" revealing an [[extra-marital affair]]&lt;ref name="Stanyer" /&gt;

In sum, drawing on these definitions initimization can be seen as a society wide ‚Äòrevelatory process‚Äô which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from the different domains of public figures‚Äô personal lives, either with or without expressed or implied consent of the individual involved.

==Intimization and the media coverage of conventional politics==
The growing visibility of the private lives of public figures has been much commented on but has received little systematic attention. The findings that emerge are somewhat mixed. Errera analyzed coverage of French politicians‚Äô private lives in two magazines ''[[Paris Match]]'' and ''[[VSD (French magazine)|VSD]]'' over a seven-year period between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Errera C (2006) 'La vie priv√©e des politiques, un tabou de la politique fran√ßaise.' Communication et langages 148(1): 81-102.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that politicians‚Äô relationships, personal health, their home and family life, personal financial issues and their past life were very much to the fore in the magazines‚Äô coverage especially of leading French politicians, such as, [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Fran√ßois Mitterrand]].

In terms of newspaper articles referring to UK national leaders‚Äô personal lives, Langer found a clear upward trend over time.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2007) 'A Historical Exploration of the Personalisation of Politics in the Print Media: The British Prime Ministers 1945‚Äì1999.' Parliamentary Affairs 60(3): 371-387. p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of their private lives rose from around 1% of the leader‚Äôs coverage in 1945 to 8% during [[Tony Blair]]‚Äôs tenure in office (2007). A follow up study (period 2007-2008) showed that the coverage of opposition leader [[David Cameron]] was even more focused on his private life than that of Tony Blair, while that of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was less, suggesting the importance of  specific leaders for the amount of attention their private life receives.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2010) 'The Politicization of Private Persona: Exceptional Leaders or the New Rule? The Case of the United Kingdom and the Blair Effect.' International Journal of Press Politics 15(1): 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rahat and Sheafer, who looked at election coverage in two leading Israeli newspapers for 16 campaigns between 1949 and 2003, found no significant trend in media coverage of candidates‚Äô personal life, with the focus on personal life never exceeding 15% of the news items over time.&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparative research conducted so far by Stanyer found some interesting cross national differences. Looking at non-scandalous and scandalous media coverage in seven democracies (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US) the research found that intimization is more prevalent in the UK and US compared to the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer argues that there is no magic causal [[silver bullet]], such as, new communication technologies, or tabloidization that can explain the difference between countries. Rather, the outcome is the result of a complex interplay of necessary and sufficient factors operating in conjunction. These include: personal factors including the age of the politician, media conditions, such as the size of the [[tabloid press]] and presence and absence of privacy protection for public figures, and political factors, such as the nature of the political system.

'''Italian South Africans''' ({{lang-it|Italo-sudafricani}}) are South Africans who have full or partial [[Italian people|Italian]] ancestry. They are primarily descended from Italians who emigrated to South Africa during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Language and religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Most Italian South Africans, like other South Africans, are [[Christianity|Christians]]. The majority of them are [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] although there is a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] minority.

All the remaining first-generation Italian South Africans speak [[Italian language|Italian]] and also [[English language|English]] or other South African languages as second language.

The Italian South Africans of the new generations are assimilated into South African society, and most of them speak mainly English as first language with a handful that speak [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] but still secondarily Italian (and sometimes [[French language|French]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9426">[[File:Molossian hound BM GR2001.10-10.1 n02.jpg|thumb|right|Jennings Dog, on display in the [[British Museum]]]]
'''The Jennings Dog''' (also known as '''The Duncombe Dog''' or '''The Dog of Alcibiades''') is a Roman sculpture of a [[dog]] with a [[docked tail]].  Named for its first modern owner, [[Henry Constantine Jennings]], it is a 2nd-century AD Roman copy of a [[Hellenistic]] bronze original.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; The original was probably of the 2nd century BC. It is {{convert|1.05|m}} high; its leonine muzzle and one leg have been repaired since its rediscovery.  Though it is one of only a few animal sculptures surviving from [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], a pair of similar marble mastiffs of the same model can be seen in the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere Court]] of the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/canes/jennings.html One illustrated in Aelius Stilo, "Molossian: The Jennings Dog"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molossian dog==
It is identified at the [[British Museum]] as a [[Molossus (dog)|Molossian guard dog]].&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; The Molossian breed was native to [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece, which was sacked by Rome in 168 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/canes/jennings.html "Molossian: The Jennings Dog"]&lt;/ref&gt; so it is assumed to have been associated with some civic monument in Epirus, and to have been brought to Rome.  [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] mentions a highly valued bronze dog surviving in Rome into his lifetime, before being lost in 69 AD:

{{quote|... our own generation saw on the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], before it [[Year of Four Emperors#Vitellius to Vespasian|went up in flames burnt at the hands of the adherents]] of [[Vitellius]], in the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|shrine of Juno]], a bronze figure of a hound licking its wound, the miraculous excellence and absolute truth to life of which is shown not only by the fact of its dedication in that place but also by the method taken for insuring it; for as no sum of money seemed to equal its value, the government enacted that its custodians should be answerable for its safety with their lives.&lt;ref name=pliny/&gt;}}

==Discovery and purchase==
The stone sculpture was discovered at Monte Cagnuolo, near the ancient [[Lanuvium]], the site of an imperial villa of [[Antoninus Pius]], 32&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;The tradition of its place of discovery, reported by James Dalloway, author of ''Anecdotes of the Arts in England'' (1800), was noted in T. Whellan, ''History and Topography of the City of York: and the North Riding'' Volume 2, 1859:250.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was probably made; its first modern owner was the sculptor, restorer and dealer in antiquities [[Bartolomeo Cavaceppi]].&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;  [[Henry Constantine Jennings]] saw it in a pile of rubble in Cavaceppi's workshop in Rome between 1753 and 1756, bought it from him for 400 scudi, and took it back to Britain.

The sculpture became famous on its arrival in Britain, praised by [[Horace Walpole]] among a scant handful of masterly Roman sculptures of animals,&lt;ref&gt;Walpole, ''Anecdotes of Painting'', vol. IV: "As the ancients have left us but five animals of equal merit with their human figures, namely, the [[Barberini collection|Barberini goat]], the [[Porcellino|Tuscan boar]], the [[House of Mattei|Mattei]] eagle, the eagle at [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry-hill]], and Mr. Jennings's, now Mr. Duncombe's dog...".&lt;/ref&gt; with replicas that were thought to make "a most noble appearance in a gentleman's hall", in [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]]'s words.

=="The Dog of Alcibiades"==
A story in [[Plutarch]]'s life of [[Alcibiades]] tells of the statesman owning a large, handsome dog whose tail Alcibiades cut off so as to invoke pity from the Athenians and distract them from his worse deeds.&lt;ref name=plut/&gt;  The broken tail of this sculpture led Jennings to link it to this story, calling it "the dog of Alcibiades";&lt;ref&gt;The similar dogs in the [[Vatican Museums]] have unbroken tails; they were also found at Monte Cagnuolo, by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] in 1774, "within the precincts of the villa of [[Antoninus Pius]]", according to Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]], ''The Townley Gallery of Classical Sculpture at the British Museum'', vol. 1 1846:302, Rm VI, no 52 (A group of two grayhounds at play).&lt;/ref&gt; under this title a pair of copies&lt;ref&gt;The design was reversed to make a pair.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Portland stone]] were installed by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Newby Hall]], Yorkshire, about 1780, and in the later 19th century a pair in [[cast stone]] were set in the gardens at [[Basildon Park]], Bedfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;John P.S. Davis, ''Antique Garden Ornament'', 1991:101ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th-century pair carved in [[serpentinite|serpentine]] were sold by Bonham's, London,  in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/12067/lot/1/ Auction of 22 November 2005, illustrated]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Duncombe's Dog"==
In settlement of his gambling debts in 1778, Jennings was forced to sell the sculpture, stating "A fine dog it was, and a lucky dog was I to purchase it".  The dog was soon afterwards sold at Phillips for ¬£1000 to the Rt Hon [[Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham|Charles Duncombe]]. [[James Boswell]] records a conversation between Johnson and other members of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], around the time of the statue's sale, in which [[Edmund Burke]] exclaimed "A thousand guineas! The representation of no animal whatever is worth so much", to which Dr Johnson replied "Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but the skill in forming it, which is so highly estimated. Every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers, that shews man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable."&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', under date 3 April 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 150 years the sculpture stood guard in the entrance hall of [[Duncombe Park]], the family mansion in [[Yorkshire]]; it was enthusiastically described there in 1859: "Among the statues in this apartment is particularly noticed an excellent antique sculpture, representing the Dog of Alcibiades, said to be the work of [[Myron]], a Grecian sculptor".&lt;ref&gt;T. Whellan, ''History and Topography of the City of York: and the North Riding'' Volume 2, 1859:250.&lt;/ref&gt; It remained there, away from public view, until 1925.  In that year, [[inheritance tax]]es forced the Duncombes to rent out the hall to Queen Mary's School for Girls, whose pupils were rumoured to feed the dog unwanted [[Marmite]] sandwiches.

==The British Museum==
It was finally sold by Thomas Duncombe's descendent [[Charles Anthony Peter Duncombe, 6th Baron Feversham|Charles Anthony Peter Duncombe]], 6th [[Baron Feversham]], in 2001.  Initially the [[Houston Museum District|Houston Museum, Texas, USA]] attempted to purchase it (the sculpture had been shown in the US in the 1980s), at the price of $950,000, but the [[export bar|granting of an export licence was deferred]] by the UK government.  The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[National Art Collections Fund]], British Museum Friends, Duthie Fund, Ready Bequest, Caryatid Fund, Mrs Barbara G. Fleischman, Mr Frank A. Ladd and the Ready Bequest had already pledged funds to help "save it for the nation".   With the sculpture on temporary display in its [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]], the delay on the export allowed the [[British Museum]] enough time to raise the remaining ¬£662,297 through a public appeal, and thus to acquire it permanently.  It is now on permanent display in gallery 22 of the Museum, B. 2001.1010.1.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The '''Kakar''' ([[Pashto]]: ⁄©ÿß⁄©⁄ì, [[Urdu]]: ⁄©ÿß⁄©⁄ë, [[Hindi]]: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡§°‡§º) is a Gharghashti [[Pashtun tribe]], based mostly in the [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan Province]] of [[Pakistan]], and [[Loy Kandahar]] in [[Afghanistan]]. 

After the [[partition of India|partition of British India]], [[Hindu]] members of the Kakar tribe, known as '''Sheen Khalai''' (Pashto: ÿ¥€åŸÜ ÿÆÿßŸÑÿ¶€å, Hindi: ‡§∂‡•Ä‡§® ‡§ñ‡§º‡§≤‡§æ‡§à), became settled in Unniara, [[Rajasthan]], India.&lt;ref name="Haider2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tattooed-blue-skinned-hindu-pushtuns-look-back-at-their-roots/article22645932.ece|title=Tattooed ‚Äòblue-skinned‚Äô Hindu Pushtuns look back at their roots|last=Haider|first=Suhasini|date=3 February 2018|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|language=English|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary origin==
Kakars are sons of Gharghashti who was the son of Qais Abdul Rashid. 
In [[Herat province|Herat]], the Kakar are locally called Kak. Historically, the tribe has been called Kak-kor (lit. family of Kak). The tomb of Kakar (or Kak) is in front of Herat central Jamia Masjid's gate. Some historians{{who|date=August 2018}} argue that Kakar was first buried in Kohistan, but [[ Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad| Ghiyath al-Din Ghori]] brought the body to be re-buried in a mosque in the city of Herat.

Kakar‚Äôs father‚Äôs name was Dani. Dani had four more sons named Panai, Babai, Naghar and Davi. Kakar has 18 own sons and six adopted.
The [[Mashwani]]s are Arab origin Pukhtuns tribe settled in some parts of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] (Swabi, Mardan, Sirikot, Dir, Panjpai, Gadwalian, Panjgoor, Shakargarh, Quetta, D I Khan etc.) and [[Iran]], are also supposed to be remotely connected to the Kakars in the female line, but they are said to be descended from Syed Muhammad Kalan Gesu daraz eleventh descended from Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]], as he married a Kakar woman Sher Bano. Mashwani is said to be one of his sons from Kakar wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henry|first1=Walter Bellew|title=Journal of a Political Mission to Afghanistan in 1857, Under Major Lumsden: With an Account of the Country and People|date=1862|publisher=Elder Smith, 1862|location=National Library of the Netherlands|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=cVJUAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balfour|first1=Edward|title=The Cyclop√¶dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: Commercial, Industrial and Scientific, Products of the Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal Kingdoms, Useful Arts and Manufactures, Volume 2|date=1885|publisher=B.

The main languages spoken in [[Eritrea]] are [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Tigre language|Tigre]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Linguistic demography is uncertain due to a lack of reliable official statistics. [[SIL Ethnologue]] estimates that as of 2010, there are 3,360,000 speakers of Tigrinya and 1,390,000 speakers of Tigre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/ER/languages|publisher=Ethnologue| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining residents primarily speak other languages from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family, with a minority speaking [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages.

==Ethno-linguistic demographics==
{{further|Demographics of Eritrea}}
According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the Neolithic period from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;Zarins, Juris (1990), "Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia", (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research)&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond J, Bellwood P (2003) Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions SCIENCE 300, {{doi|10.1126/science.1078208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars propose that the Afro-Asiatic family developed in situ in the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]], with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.&lt;ref name="Blench143144"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=R.|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0759104662|pages=143‚Äì144|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eritrea's population now comprises nine [[ethnic group]]s, most of whom speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches of the Afro-Asiatic family.&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313306109|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote="The majority of the Eritreans speak Semitic or Cushitic languages of the Afro-Asiatic language group. The Kunama, Baria, and other smaller groups in the north and northwest speak Nilotic languages."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of numbers of speakers given below are from [[SIL Ethnologue]] unless otherwise noted.

===Afro-Asiatic languages===
The [[South Semitic]] ([[North Ethiopic languages|North Ethopic]]) languages spoken in Eritrea are [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Tigre language|Tigre]], and [[Dahlik language|Dahlik]] (formerly considered a dialect of Tigre). Together, they are spoken by around 70% of local residents:
*[[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], spoken as a first language by the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya people]]. As of 2006, there were around 2.54 million speakers.
*[[Tigre language|Tigre]], spoken by the [[Tigre people]]. As of 2006, there were around 1.05 million speakers.
*[[Dahlik language|Dahlik]], spoken in the [[Dahlak Archipelago]]. Variously regarded as either a divergent dialect of Tigre or a separate language, it was recently assigned its own [[ISO 639-3]] code. As of 2012, there were around 2,500 speakers.

Other Afro-Asiatic languages belonging to the family's [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch are also spoken in the country.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; They are spoken by around 10% of residents and include:
*[[Beja language|Beja]] (Bedawiyet), spoken by the [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]]. It is sometimes classified as an independent branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. As of 2006, there were 158,000 speakers in Eritrea.
*[[Saho language|Saho]], spoken by the [[Saho people]]. It is sometimes grouped with Afar as Saho-Afar. As of 2006, there were around 191,000 speakers in Eritrea.
*[[Afar language|Afar]], spoken by the [[Afar people]], predominantly in Ethiopia and Djibouti. As of 2006, there were fewer than 100,000 speakers in Eritrea.
*[[Blin language|Blin]] or Belin, spoken by the [[Bilen people]] in the Anseba region and Keren town area. As of 2006, there were around 91,000 speakers.
===Nilo-Saharan languages===
In addition, languages belonging to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language family are spoken as a [[mother tongue]] by the [[Kunama people|Kunama]] and [[Nara people|Nara]] [[Nilotic]] ethnic minorities that live in the north and northwestern part of the country. Around 187,000 individuals speak the [[Kunama language]], while around 81,400 people speak the [[Nara language]]. As of 2006, this corresponds with around 3.5% and 1.5%, respectively, of total residents.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; 
 
===Foreign languages===
[[Arabic]] is mostly found in the form of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] as an educational language taught in primary and secondary schools, but there are native speakers of dialectal variants of Arabic, as follows:
*[[Sudanese Arabic]], also spoken by [[Sudanese Arabs]]. It has around 100,000 speakers.
*[[Hijazi Arabic]], spoken by the [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]]. As of 2006, there were around 24,000 speakers.

[[Italian language|Italian]] was introduced in the 19th century by the colonial authorities in [[Italian Eritrea]] but is now used in commerce at times. It serves as the mother tongue of very few [[Italian Eritreans]]. [[English language|English]] was introduced in the 1940s under the British military administration of Italian Eritrea. It is now used as the de facto working language.{{Citation needed|reason=This really requires a source to provide credibility.|date=December 2007}}

==Official status==
The 1997 [[Constitution of Eritrea]] does not define any official languages. It states that "the equality of all Eritrean languages is guaranteed" without providing a conclusive list of the languages in question. The [[CIA Factbook]] cites Tigrinya, Arabic and English as official languages, alongside ethnic Eritrean languages like [[Tigre Language|Tigre]], [[Afar language|Afar]] and other Cushitic languages, as well as the Nilo-Saharan Kunama. [[SIL Ethnologue]] lists Tigrinya as the de facto language of national identity, Arabic as the de facto national language, and English as the de facto working language. The Eritrean embassy in [[Sweden]] says, "The main working languages are Tigrigna and Arabic. English is the medium of instruction from middle school level upwards."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eritrean-embassy.se/about-eritrea/people-and-languages/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and literacy==
According to the Ministry of Information of Eritrea, an estimated 80% of the country's population is literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Information of Eritrea|title=Adult Education Program gaining momentum: Ministry|url=http://www.shabait.com/news/local-news/12263-adult-education-program-gaining-momentum-ministry|publisher=Shabait|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[writing system]]s, Eritrea's principal orthography is [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]], [[Latin script]] and [[Arabic script]].  Ge'ez is employed as an [[abugida]] for the two most spoken languages in the country: Tigrinya and Tigre. It first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an [[abjad]] to transcribe the Semitic [[Ge'ez language]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Fattovich, "Akk√§l√§ Guzay" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C''. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, 2003, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]es. The Latin script is used to write the majority of the country's other languages excluding Arabic. The [[Arabic script]] has also been used to write Afar, Beja, Saho and Tigre in the past. However, Tigre is mostly written in Ge'ez script now while the Latin script is used to write the other languages. For example, ''Qafar Feera'', a modified [[Latin script]], serves as an orthography for transcribing Afar.&lt;ref name="Omafr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afar ( øAf√°r af)|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/afar.htm|publisher=Omniglot|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branigan's maternal grandparents were William O'Hare, Jr. (son of William John O'Hare and Agnes B. O'Connor) and Mary Conway (daughter of Francis J. Conway and Mary Teresa McGuiness); all of them were [[Irish people|Irish]].

Branigan attended [[Byram Hills High School]] in 1966 to 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/spectrum_july10.pdf |format=PDF|title=Bryam Hills School District Spectrum|date=2010|volume=48|page=9|website=Byramhills.org|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring in the high school musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' in her senior year.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3492000017.html|title=Branigan, Laura|author=|date=|work=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1972 she attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; and worked as a waitress. In 1972 she met acoustic guitarist Walker Daniels and his future wife Sharon Storm, and acoustic guitarist Chris Van Cleave, forming the folk-rock band ''Meadow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancleavemusic.com/feature/home.html|title=Chris Van Cleave Singer-Songwriter-Actor Feature Page|website=Vancleavemusic.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named as a good place for Paul McCartney's band ''Wings'' to land in). In 1973 the group, with bass player Bob Valdez, released their debut album ''The Friend Ship'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancleavemusic.com/feature/Meadow%20story/Back%20of%20album.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of Meadow album sleeve credits|website=Vancleavemusic.com|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the singles ''When You Were Young'', and ''Cane and Able'', which featured the hook line "Throw away your cane and you are able".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinylvoyageradio.com/search/label/Meadow|title=The Vinyl Voyage|author=Bruce David Janu|work=vinylvoyageradio.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhKTh4gcSRQ|title=The Friend Ship by MEADOW Ft Laura Branigan ‚Äì Whole album|date=June 29, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was not properly promoted and never re-released. The band broke up, after which Walker Daniels committed suicide. Branigan preferred not to discuss her involvement with Meadow publicly.

During the years after Meadow broke up, Branigan had various jobs, including a stint as one of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s backup singers for his European tour in April‚ÄìAugust 1976.

In December 1978 after meeting him at a party in [[Manhattan, New York]] earlier in the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20136934,00.html|title=Facing the Music|work=people.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branigan married Larry Ross Kruteck (1936‚Äì1996), a lawyer some years her senior, who died of colon cancer on June 15, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/01/watn.branigan/index.html "Laura Branigan is facing the music"].

In 1979, after a chance meeting with manager [[Sid Bernstein]] on her return from Europe, Branigan was signed by [[Ahmet Ertegun]] to [[Atlantic Records]].&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/01/watn.branigan/|title=CNN.com ‚Äì Laura Branigan is facing the music ‚Äì May 1, 2002|work=cnn.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength and range of her voice actually impeded her career for several years while the label went through the process of categorizing her as a [[pop music|pop singer]], and her 1981 single "[[Looking Out for Number One]]", from her unreleased album ''Silver Dreams'', made a brief appearance on the U.S. dance chart, reaching No. 60. Two other early Atlantic singles, "Tell Him" and "Fool's Affair", followed. None of these three singles (or the B-side, "When") were included on her first album, but all four songs were eventually released on CD over 30 years later in 2014 as bonus cuts on a U.S. CD reissue of Branigan's first album.

Branigan's 9-track debut album, ''[[Branigan]]'', was released in March 1982. The first single from the album was "[[All Night with Me]]", which reached No. 69 on the ''Billboard'' charts in early 1982. The album alternated four energetic up-tempo songs with five ballads, including one of the few songs written solely by Branigan, "I Wish We Could Be Alone". "Gloria", an Italian love song recorded in 1979 by [[Umberto Tozzi]] and successful in several European countries, was released as the album's second single. Branigan's version was reworked with Tozzi's own arranger, [[Greg Mathieson]], who updated its production with fellow producer [[Jack White (producer)|Jack White]] to give it what Branigan called "an American kick" to match the new English lyrics. U.S. radio stations were initially unreceptive to "Gloria" but after it was embraced by dance clubs it eventually won them over, becoming one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. The album went gold, and the single was eventually certified platinum (sales of more than two million U.S. copies).

Branigan's performance of "Gloria" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] alongside [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Juice Newton]] and that year's winner, [[Melissa Manchester]], becoming her only solo nomination. 

In the spring of 1983 Branigan released her second album ''[[Branigan 2]]''. Branigan's vocals propelled her English-language version of the French song ''Solitaire'' toward the top of the U.S. charts. The original "Solitaire" was written and recorded in 1981 by French singer-songwriter [[Martine Clemenceau]]. Two songs included on the album began the careers for two then-unknowns: the English translation of "Solitaire" was the first major hit for songwriter [[Diane Warren]], while the ballad "[[How Am I Supposed to Live Without You]]" was the first major hit for its co-writer, [[Michael Bolton]]. Branigan's version reached No. 12 on the hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' adult contemporary chart.

==Height of career==
{{Disputed section|date=November 2016}}
During the height of her career, Branigan also made acting appearances, first in 1981 in ''An American Girl in Berlin'' for West German television, and then after the success of "Gloria", guest appearances on American television series such as ''[[CHiPs]]'' ("Fox Trap", season 6, episode 16, in which she played Sarah, lead singer of the female rock band Cadillac Foxes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlgvvBG94ac&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLQmfNp8AukMMSDDp6TyG6Go6thGvyZXf4|title=Laura Branigan acting on "CHiPs" (1983) Part 1|date=July 24, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Automan]]'' and ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.  She would later appear in independent films including ''Mugsy's Girls'' (aka ''Delta Pi'', 1985) with [[Academy Awards]] winner [[Ruth Gordon]], and the Australian film ''[[Backstage (1988 film)|Backstage]]''.  She sang on major national television and radio campaigns for products including [[Dr Pepper]], [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Chrysler]], which sponsored her 1985‚Äì1986 "Hold Me" tour.

The year 1984 was the height of the European [[synthpop]] era, and "[[Self Control (Raf song)#Laura Branigan version|Self Control]]", the title track of Branigan's third album, released in April 1984 became her biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in over six countries, most notably [[West Germany]], where it spent six weeks at No. 1.  The original version. recorded a few months earlier in 1984 by one of the song's co-writers [[Raffaele Riefoli]] under the name "Raf" held the West German number 2 spot during this time period; outside of Raf's native Italy, Branigan's version enjoyed more success, hitting No. 4 in the U.S.  The song was featured on episode #8 of the first season of the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]'' titled "The Great McCarthy", which aired on November 16, 1984.

Other pop, disco, and adult contemporary hits from Branigan's ''[[Self Control (album)|Self Control]]'' album include "[[The Lucky One (Laura Branigan song)|The Lucky One]]" (which won her a [[Tokyo Music Festival]] prize), the continental ballad "[[Ti amo#Laura Branigan version|Ti Amo]]" (another Umberto Tozzi hit, and a No. 2 hit in Australia for Branigan) and the dance hit "[[Satisfaction (Laura Branigan song)|Satisfaction]]".  The album also featured an understated version of [[Carole King]]'s "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow|Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]"; as a counterpoint to all the dance productions, it was a bare-bones piano version.  (In concerts and television appearances throughout her career, Branigan accompanied herself on the piano for the song.)

Branigan's vocal coach was Carlo Menotti, and she worked with [[Steve Lukather]] ([[Toto (band)|Toto]]), [[Dann Huff]] ([[Giant (band)|Giant]]) and [[Michael Landau]]; keyboardists Greg Mathieson, [[Harold Faltermeyer]], [[Michael Boddicker]] and [[Robbie Buchanan]]; bassists [[Nathan East]] and Dennis Belfield ([[Rufus (band)|Rufus]]); drummers Carlos Vega and [[Doane Perry]] ([[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]); percussionists [[Paulinho Da Costa]] and [[Lenny Castro]]; and guest vocalists including [[Joe Esposito (singer)|Joe "Bean" Esposito]] and background vocalists including The Waters Sisters (Maxine and Julia), [[James Ingram]], and [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] and [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Stephen George]] ([[Mr. Mister]]).  As her stature grew, she attracted Grammy-winning producers including Phil Ramone, [[Richard Perry]] and [[David Kershenbaum]]. She performed duets with [[John Farnham]] as well as Latin pop artist [[Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri|Luis Miguel]].

In 1984 Branigan's live show was recorded twice, for a syndicated radio concert series and a concert video.  Branigan was also nominated for an award at the [[American Music Awards of 1985]] for favorite pop/rock female video artist, won by [[Cyndi Lauper]].  Also in 1985 Branigan performed the main theme song for the television mini-series ''[[Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives]]'', based on the novel by [[Jackie Collins]].

By the time Branigan's fourth album ''[[Hold Me (Laura Branigan album)|Hold Me]]'' was released in July 1985, "Self Control" was a worldwide success.  The hits continued with "[[Spanish Eddie]]", which was her sixth U.S. ''Billboard'' top 40 pop hit in two and a half years.  The subsequent single release "[[Hold Me (Laura Branigan song)|Hold Me]]" was a U.S. top-40 dance hit, and Branigan's introduction of the rock ballad "[[I Found Someone]]" (co-written by [[Michael Bolton]], a later hit for [[Cher]]) scored even higher on the adult contemporary chart. However, neither song was supported by a music video and stalled at the low end of the hot 100 chart.  On June 13, 1985 Branigan made her fourth appearance on legendary TV music show ''[[American Bandstand]]'', performing "Spanish Eddie" and "Hold Me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzuaK6r12YU&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Laura Branigan ‚Äì Spanish Eddie, interview [cc] and Hold me 1985|date=January 25, 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 1985 she performed in [[Point State Park]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.775322645811113.1073741828.391763117500403&amp;type=3|title=Concert at Point State Park, Fourth of July 1985 ‚Äì Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branigan's fifth album ''[[Touch (Laura Branigan album)|Touch]]'' (released July 7, 1987) marked a change in her career.  Under new management and using different producers, Branigan took a more active role in her work and in the studio, seeing her return to dance floors with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock-Aitken-Waterman]]-produced track "[[Shattered Glass (Laura Branigan song)|Shattered Glass]]" written by Bob Mitchell and Steve Coe, of the band [[Monsoon (band)|Monsoon]].  "Shattered Glass" was performed by Branigan on the last episode of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' (hosted by [[Dick Clark]]) to be broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (the show would last for two more years, first in [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] and finally on the [[USA Network]]) on September 5, 1987, becoming their last guest performer.&lt;ref name="www.youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhKTh4gcSRQ|title=The Friend Ship by MEADOW Ft Laura Branigan ‚Äì Whole album|date=June 29, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album also included a return to the Billboard top-40 with her cover of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Laura Branigan version|Power of Love]]", which was one of the 20 bestselling singles in the U.S. during the Christmas season.  The album's third single "[[Cry Wolf (Laura Branigan song)|Cry Wolf]]", a top-30 AC hit, did not capture the attention of pop radio stations and stalled; the ballad was recorded two years later by [[Stevie Nicks]], and more recently by writer [[Jude Johnstone]].

==Later years==
Branigan's sixth album, ''[[Laura Branigan (album)|Laura Branigan]]'' (March 21, 1990), brought her back to the [[Hi-NRG]] charts and [[gay]] clubs with "[[Moonlight On Water]]", and she scored a top-30 adult contemporary hit with "Never in a Million Years." Branigan added production to her list of credits with her cover of [[Vicki Sue Robinson]]'s disco-era "Turn the Beat Around" and the atmospheric "Let Me In," a cover of an [[Eddie Money]] song. The album also includes '"Unison,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-4KZPUV9c|title=Laura Branigan- Unison|date=April 11, 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the title track for [[C√©line Dion]]'s English debut CD in the same year. The album's closing track, a cover of [[Bryan Adams]]' "The Best Was Yet to Come," was produced and arranged by Branigan. The 1990‚Äì1991 Laura Branigan Tour, which was kicked off with an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on July 13, 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK3LUVhhTck&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Laura Branigan ‚Äì Two Performances and Interview ‚Äì The Tonight Show (1990)|date=July 18, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a performance in the [[Trump Regency]] Showroom in Atlantic City, N.J. on July 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFr-hqsVtk&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Laura Branigan ‚Äì Live In Concert 1990 (FULL CONCERT)|date=March 2, 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and filmed for a syndicated U.S. television show ''[[Laura Branigan in Concert|SRO in Concert]]'', which was released on videocassette and laserdisc; on July 15, 1990 she performed at the [[Warwick Musical Theatre]] in Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1029081227101919.1073741834.391763117500403&amp;type=3|title=LB's show in Warwick Musical Theater (1990) ‚Äì Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IWantToKnowWhatLoveIs.jpg|thumbnail|right|Laura Branigan and John Farnham singing "I Want to Know What Love Is" at the 1986 Logies in Australia]] --&gt;

On Branigan's seventh and final studio album ''[[Over My Heart]]'' (August 17, 1993), the singer again produced (with [[Phil Ramone]]), and wrote and arranged. It included "Didn't We Almost Win It All" (by Branigan and [[Brian BecVar]]) (released as the first single), a cover of [[Cher]]'s song "[[Hard Enough Getting Over You]]" (released as the second single), a cover of the [[Patty Loveless]] single "[[How Can I Help You Say Goodbye]]", a cover of [[Roxette]]'s song "The Sweet Hello, the Sad Goodbye", and "Is There Anybody Here But Me?" (Pessis, Wells), a smooth mid-tempo number.

==Retirement==
After 1990 Branigan's chart success cooled in the U.S., though she was still in demand around the world and went on several global tours. In 1994, not long after the release of ''Over My Heart'', Larry Kruteck, Branigan's husband (m. 1978), was diagnosed with colon cancer. Branigan refused to accept the medical prognosis, and left the music industry to devote her attention to him. Branigan put Kruteck on herbal treatments, eventually nursing him full time. Krutech survived for another two and a half years and died on June 15, 1996 in New York.

Branigan had official greatest hits collections released in South America, Japan, Germany, South Africa, and the U.S.; the U.S. collection was released in 1995. The 13-track ''[[The Best of Branigan]]'' included two newly-recorded covers: "[[Show Me Heaven]]" (written by [[Maria McKee]]) and the [[Donna Summer]] hit "[[Dim All the Lights]]," which Branigan released in several remixes.

On August 15, 1995, Branigan was a guest on the TV show ''[[Talking Food]]'', hosted by [[Robin Leach]] and broadcast by the [[Food Network]], and she promoted the album and sang the [[Donna Summer]] hit before preparing her Summer Delight pasta dish on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_oRNTsxus&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Laura Branigan ‚Äì "Dim All The Lights" LIVE [cc] 1995|date=May 23, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1996, she was selected to be part of the international jury at the XXXVII Festival Internacional de la Canci√≥n de Vi√±a del Mar, in Chile. Besides her duties as a jury member of this international musical competition, Branigan performed on Friday the 16th on the main stage for an audience who enthusiastically sang her greatest hits.

==Return==
In early 2001 Branigan's return to the stage was postponed, when she broke both of her [[femur]]s in a 10-foot fall from a ladder while she was hanging [[wisteria]] outside her three-bedroom lakeside home in [[Westchester County, New York]], resulting in physical therapy for six months.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; In 2002, she performed twice as the "singing" [[Janis Joplin]] in the [[off-Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Love, Janis (musical)|Love, Janis]]'', before dropping out of the show. "I left ''Janis'' because the producers failed to file with [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] properly," she told the ''[[Sunday News (Lancaster)|Sunday News]]'' in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. "I was sort of relieved. My voice isn't anything like Janis Joplin's, and there were 19 of her songs in the show."&lt;ref name="CrispSunday"&gt;Crisp, Marty (August 1, 2002).

Retrieved April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years she continued to record, and dated the drummer in her band Tommy Bayiokos. (People Magazine 9/13/04)

Also in 2002, her second official US hits collection, ''[[The Essentials (Laura Branigan album)|The Essentials]]'', was released, including the long out-of-print hit "[[I Found Someone]]."

==Death==
Branigan died in her sleep at her lodge in [[East Quogue, New York]], in 2004. The cause was attributed to a previously-undiagnosed [[intracranial aneurysm|ventricular brain aneurysm]].  It was reported in the media that she had been experiencing headaches for several weeks before her death, but did not seek medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singer Laura Branigan Dies At 47|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66707/singer-laura-branigan-dies-at-47|website=Billboard|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ashes were scattered over [[Long Island Sound]].

==Legacy==
Branigan affectionately referred to her fans many times as her "other half." On the first anniversary of her death in 2005, many fans attended the first "Laura Branigan Spirit of Love Memorial Gathering" weekend, sponsored by Other Half Entertainment and LauraBraniganOnline.com and held near the Long Island home where she last lived, caring for her mother. The gathering then became an annual tradition.

Other Half Entertainment, Branigan's management company at the time of her death, continues to oversee her career legacy through her official website at www.LauraBraniganOnline.com, and her official MySpace and Facebook pages by taking part in various media opportunities, as well as through relationships with Warner Music Group and other entertainment industry entities, serving as the official voice for her legacy interests and keeping her artistic visions and standards at the heart of its operations.

Since 2006, Branigan's management company worked regularly with [[Warner Music Group]] entities in the production and release of various new greatest hits compilations. ''The Platinum Collection'' is an 18-song compilation including all the major hits as well as tracks such as "Silent Partners", Satisfaction," "All Night With Me," and "If You Loved Me," which were four relatively new additions to Branigan hits compilations.

In 2007, the 1995 album ''The Best of Branigan'' was re-released, as part of Rhino's 2007 "Greatest Hits" series of CDs. In 2009, Rhino/WEA authorized the re-release of three out-of-print Branigan albums: ''Touch'', ''Laura Branigan'', and ''Over My Heart''. In June 2010, ''[[Shine On: The Ultimate Collection]]'' was released, which, for the first time, incorporated a PAL format DVD featuring official Atlantic music videos for 10 of Branigan's songs, in addition to an 18-track CD including "Forever Young", which made its return to the greatest hits compilations. The CD contains single edits of most songs.

At [[Byram Hills High School]] in [[Armonk, New York]], the Laura Branigan Memorial Scholarship is given annually to a senior for excellence in the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/Spectrum_Summer09.pdf "2008‚Äì2009 High School Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721004838/http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/Spectrum_Summer09.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}.

{{Lebanese people}}

'''Lebanese people in South Africa''' have a population exceeding 5,100&lt;ref&gt;[http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/13017/SF Arab, Lebanese in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; and other estimates report a total of 20,000 Lebanese in South Africa.  In addition, an increasing number of Lebanese students seeking education and career opportunities opted for the country in light of its relatively reputable institutions across the [[Middle East]]. Most of the Lebanese people in South Africa live mainly in the cities of [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]].

==History==
The history of the Lebanese Community goes back to the late 19th century, when the first immigrants arrived in Johannesburg, the biggest city in the Transvaal coming from Sebhel, Mesyara, Becharre, Hadath El-Joube, Maghdoushe and other places. It is recorded that in the year 1896 the first Maronite and Lebanese immigrants arrived in Durban, Cape Town, and Mozambique, and congregated around their local Catholic Churches. The majority of the Lebanese immigrants were Maronite and being concerned about keeping their Maronite faith alive in a new country, they wrote to the Maronite Patriarch, insisting on the need for a Maronite priest to come to South Africa to continue their tradition and the Maronite Rite. In 1905, Patriarch [[Elias Peter Hoayek]] sent Father Emmanuel El-Fadle to South Africa from Kfarhata‚ÄìElzawye, North Lebanon. Father El-Fadle converted a building in Johannesburg into a church and residence. 

In 1910, Father Ashkar arrived to build a church and a home for the priests. The Patriarch, then sent another priest to assist&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Father Wakim Estphan. Fr. Ashkar returned to Lebanon and retired in 1928. The mission was then handed over to The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries. Father Yousef Juan, who was appointed as a temporary visitor, received instruction from the Patriarch and the General Superior for Father Yousef Moubarak to succeed him in serving the South African Maronite Community. The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries have since served in South Africa among other countries and continue in their mission in serving and assisting in the Maronite Rite.

{{About|celebrations of nationhood|holidays with names like "National Item Day"|List of commemorative days}}

[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|''[[Independence or Death (painting)|Independence or Death]]'', famous painting from [[Pedro Am√©rico]] that celebrates the [[Independence Day (Brazil)|Independence Day]] of Brazil.]]

A '''national day''' is a designated date on which celebrations mark the [[nationhood]] of a [[nation]] or non-sovereign country. This nationhood can be symbolized by the date of [[independence]], of becoming a republic or a significant date for a patron saint or a ruler (birthday, [[Accession Day|accession]], removal, etc.). Often the day is not called "National Day" but serves and can be considered as one. The national day will often be a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many countries have more than one national day.

Most countries have a fixed-date national day, but some have movable dates. An example is [[Jamaica]], which up to 1997 celebrated its national day on the first Monday in August. This commemorated independence from the United Kingdom which was attained on Monday, 6 August 1962, the first Monday in August of that year. [[Israel]]'s [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|Independence&amp;nbsp;Day]] is not fixed relative to the civil Gregorian&amp;nbsp;calendar, being formally linked to 5&amp;nbsp;Iyar on the [[Jewish&amp;nbsp;calendar]], but may also be moved to any day between 3 and 6 Iyar in order to avoid preparing for or celebrating either Independence Day or [[Yom Hazikaron|Memorial Day]] (which immediately precedes Independence&amp;nbsp;Day) on [[Shabbat]]; the practical effect of this is that Independence Day may be celebrated any day between 15&amp;nbsp;April and 15&amp;nbsp;May. Another example is [[Thailand]] which celebrates the birthday of the [[King of Thailand|king]] on 28&amp;nbsp;July. This date will change on the accession of the heir to the throne.

Most national days can be categorized in two large blocks:{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* Newer countries that celebrate their national day as the day of their independence.
* Older countries that use some other event of special significance as their national day.

[[Denmark]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are among the few countries that do not have designated national days (though [[Constitution Day (Denmark)|Constitution Day]] has many of the same features of a national day in Denmark's case).

==Celebrations==
Importance attached to the national day as well as the degree to which it is celebrated vary greatly from country to country. For example, Spain's national day [[Fiesta Nacional de Espa√±a]] is held on 12 October, the day celebrated in other countries as [[Columbus Day]] or ''[[D√≠a de la Raza]]'', and commemorates the anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=Fuller&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Molina A. de Cienfuegos |first1= Ignacio|last2= Mart√≠nez B√°rcena|first2= Jorge|last3= Fuller |first3= Linda K.

France's national day |publisher=Frenchdesire.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely celebrated and the [[Flag of France|French Tricolour]] is much in evidence, while the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] attends a military parade on the [[Champs-√âlys√©es]] of Paris. In the United States, the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations on 4 July are widely celebrated with parades, fireworks, picnics and barbecues. In Ireland, [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 17&amp;nbsp;March, is the equivalent of a national day and has been a public holiday for many years. However, in the United Kingdom the constituent countries' [[patron saint]]s' days are low-key affairs. In recent times campaigns have commenced to promote the national days of England, Scotland and Wales, with [[St. Andrew's Day]] being designated as an official [[bank holiday]] when the [[Scottish Parliament]] passed the [[St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007]]. A [[British Day|National Day for the United Kingdom]] has also been proposed in recent years.

As with the [[Bastille Day military parade]] in France, many other countries have a '''National Day Parade'''. Examples include the [[Singapore National Day Parade]], and the parade for the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">'''Paper wealth''' means [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as measured by monetary value, as reflected in the price of [[asset]]s ‚Äì how much [[money]] one's assets could be sold for. Paper wealth is contrasted with '''real wealth''', which refers to one's actual physical assets.

For example, if one owns a house and its assessed value increases (relative to the general price level, i.e., assuming no [[inflation]]) then one's paper wealth has increased ‚Äì the asset has increased in value, meaning it could in principle be sold in exchange for a larger quantity of money, but one's real wealth is unchanged ‚Äì the real asset is still the same house. It is said that one has "gotten richer ''on paper''," meaning "as an [[accounting]] matter": numbers on a [[balance sheet]] have changed, but the physical world has not.

The term "paper wealth" is frequently used in popular discussions of wealth, and in some critiques of [[capitalism]], [[finance]], and certain economic theories, but is little-used in [[mainstream economics]], which instead generally identifies wealth with paper wealth. The term "paper wealth" has some pejorative connotations, suggesting "only on paper (but not in reality)", but can also be used neutrally to mean "(simply) as an accounting matter". Related distinctions are sometimes drawn between [[real asset]]s and [[financial asset]]s, or between [[tangible asset]]s and [[intangible asset]]s, the latter particularly in accounting, as detailed below.

== Evaporation of paper wealth ==
A confusing aspect of paper wealth is that it can increase or decrease across an entire economy, without any changes to the real economy; this is known as "asset price [[inflation]] or [[deflation]]" (a change in the aggregate (nominal) level of prices without corresponding real change). Thus, paper wealth does not "come from" or "go to" anywhere ‚Äì the prices just go up or down. "It's a common misunderstanding to ask, 'where did the money go'?"&lt;ref name="thor"&gt;[[Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson]], discussing [[2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis]], quoted in "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/globalbusiness/7385128/Icelands-vote-gives-UK-little-comfort.html Iceland's vote gives UK little comfort]", by Rowena Mason, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' 06 Mar 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which is particularly asked in the case of a [[stock market crash]] or in the bursting of a [[price bubble]]. This has more colorfully been described as "A lot of money goes to money-heaven."&lt;ref name="thor" /&gt;

=== Example ===
To illustrate, consider this example: Alice and Bob each own a house (suppose identical and neighboring). In a barter economy, Alice and Bob may decide to swap houses, and later to swap back ‚Äì there is no notion of paper wealth here, just which house they each own and occupy. In a monetary economy, Alice may offer to sell Bob her house for one million dollars, and Bob may accept, and sell Alice his house for a same one million dollars ‚Äì in this case they would each own a house, and each have paper wealth of one million dollars (the sale value of the house). If Alice decides to move back to her original house, and offers Bob her house for one dollar (rather than one million), and Bob accepts and sells Alice his house for one dollar, then they will move back to their original houses but now each have paper wealth of only one dollar.

== Accounting ==
Paper wealth is fundamentally an [[accounting]] matter ‚Äì one's [[net worth]] is the accounting value of one's assets minus the accounting value of one's liabilities. There are various accounting methods for different assets and liabilities, and they yield different notions of net worth; some methods are more or less volatile than others. For example, one may value ("hold", "mark") assets at [[book value]], meaning the price for which they were purchased; in this case paper wealth does not change when the potential sale price of an asset changes, but does change if the asset is sold, as the asset is replaced by the sale proceeds. Conversely, one may mark assets at [[market value]] ([[mark to market]] accounting), in which case paper wealth changes as the market varies.

In some cases different measures may differ significantly ‚Äì for example, one may purchase a stock for $1, and the market value may increase to $100, so the book value is $1 and the market value is $100. Conversely, one may purchase a house for $100,000, and then the housing market may fall, with the identical house next door selling for $80,000. In both these cases, book value and market value (to the extent that there is a market) differ, and which is more accurate may be debatable ‚Äì one may argue that liquidation value (price obtained if sold immediately) would be a [[distressed sale]] and not reflect the potential value in a more orderly sale.

== Economics ==
In economics, particularly [[political economy]], the distinction between paper wealth and real wealth is part of a larger debate on different notions of value; paper wealth corresponds to [[exchange value]] (value that can be realized in exchanging a good for something else) and real wealth corresponds to [[use value]] (value that can be realized in using a good oneself). This is a traditional distinction, dating from [[Aristotle]] in antiquity to [[David Ricardo]] in the [[classical economics]] of the 19th century, but the distinction is no longer drawn in mainstream economics, particularly [[neoclassical economics]], and the debate resolved in favor of exchange value ‚Äì market price is seen as a sufficient notion of value; see [[Exchange value#Other theories of exchange value|Exchange value: Other theories of exchange value]] for discussion.

In economics, the notion of paper wealth is most associated with the [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] school of [[Marxian economics]], in the notion of [[fictitious capital]] by [[Karl Marx]], in his critique of capitalism.

Paper wealth is also important in certain theories of [[economic crises]], notably those that believe these to be caused by [[price bubble]]s, as described below.

== Economic effects ==
Paper wealth is attributed as being a factor in [[economic cycle]]s; in mainstream economics this is interpreted as the wealth effect, while in some heterodox schools it is interpreted as price bubbles.

=== Wealth effect ===
{{see|Wealth effect}}
The most commonly discussed effect of paper wealth is the [[wealth effect]]: as people (households) increase in wealth, they are likely to spend more, while if their wealth decreases, they are likely to spend less. This is termed "the wealth effect" (compare [[income effect]]), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence ‚Äì one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally [[procyclical]], meaning that when the economy is doing well, asset prices increase, causing consumers to spend more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if the economy is doing poorly, asset prices fall and consumers spend less, leading to a [[vicious cycle]] and potentially a [[Depression (economics)|depression]].

=== Price bubbles ===
{{see|Price bubble}}
Less commonly, increases in overall paper wealth are seen as signs of [[price bubble]]s ‚Äì unsustainable increases in the level of prices. These are generally attributed to credit bubbles (prices are bid up using borrowed money), and seen as a significant warning sign of a pending economic crisis; they form the central mechanism of [[Austrian business cycle theory]] and [[debt deflation]].

These concerns are not widely shared by mainstream economics ‚Äì elevated asset price levels are considered a concern, but a minor one, while private credit levels are not considered macroeconomically significant, as they are simply a question of distribution.

[[Austrian economics]] ascribes price bubbles as due to excess printing of money by central banks, and ultimately inflationary; the resulting bursting of the price bubble and following depression being necessary purging of the previous excesses.

In debt deflation (most associated with [[Post-Keynesian economics]], but with some mainstream interest), price bubbles are particularly associated with excess ''private'' credit growth, especially extension of credit by commercial banks. While the price bubble itself is neutral, people then borrow against these inflated asset prices (as via a [[home equity line of credit]]), which increases the credit bubble, and it is the elevated level of ''debt'' that is the underlying cause of the ensuing depression.

== Related distinctions ==
Assets can be distinguished as real (physical) assets, notably [[property, plant, and equipment]] (PP&amp;E ‚Äì real estate, buildings, durable equipment) and [[inventory]] (consumables), and financial assets (equity and debt in other companies).

At the level of a household, real assets are most commonly a home (both the land and the building), personal belongings (notably cars or other vehicles), and some commodities (such as gold) or collectibles (art). Financial assets most commonly include stocks and bonds (both corporate and government). The status of cash is more debatable ‚Äì [[fiat money]] is formally a financial asset backed by a government, while a bank deposit is a financial asset backed by a commercial bank, which today is generally backed by a government (via [[deposit insurance]] such as the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]). As such, the value of cash may inflate away ‚Äì it is a form of paper wealth ‚Äì but it is generally distinguished from stocks and bonds.

A related technical issue in economics is the [[aggregation problem]], as debated in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]] ‚Äì to what extent is it permissible and useful to aggregate different measures? Aggregating different physical and financial assets is, in some views, illegitimate or misleading, though the ''market value'' of assets can simply be aggregated by adding. This aggregation is generally accepted practice in economic theory, with disaggregation reserved for accounting or detailed analysis.

In accounting, [[tangible asset]]s and [[intangible asset]]s are distinguished. In [[wealth management]], liquid financial assets (roughly corresponding to common understanding of paper wealth, ignoring value of housing) is a key metric.

== Other forms of wealth ==
Beyond real assets and financial assets, other valuable intangible assets, which are popularly referred to as "wealth", are formally referred to as forms of "[[capital (economics)|capital]]". At the individual level these are referred to as [[human capital]], including [[education]] and [[social connection]]s, while at the social level these are referred to as [[social capital]], and include communities, social norms, and institutions; more traditionally these were referred to as "[[civilization]]", but this usage is now considered pejorative.

The practice of '''[[polygamy]]''' has had a long history in '''[[Kazakhstan]]''', which officially decriminalized the practice in 1998, being the only [[Central Asia]]n country to do so.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saidazimova |first=Gulnoza |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1144507.html |title=Central Asia: Kazakhstan Debates Polygamy Amid Regional Rise In Popularity |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polygamous marriage==
While currently illegal, there have been numerous proposals in the recent years to legislate polygamous marriage in the country; the most recent attempt was in mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gizitdinov |first1=Nariman |title=Polygamy offers young women of Kazakhstan a ticket out of poverty |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/polygamy-offers-young-women-of-kazakhstan-a-ticket-out-of-poverty-8991759.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=22 June 2018 |date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar bill was introduced in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pannier |first1=Bruce |title=Kyrgyzstan: Debate On Legalized Polygamy Continues |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Article/1075173.html |website=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty |accessdate=22 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726054228/http://www.rferl.org/content/Article/1075173.html |archivedate=26 July 2009 |date=20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though was swiftly killed in the parliament. In February 2011, presidential candidate Amatay Asilbek stated that legalizing polygamy was one of his campaign positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Platt |first=John |url=http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/stories/kazakhstan-presidential-candidate-wants-to-legalize-polygamy |title=Kazakhstan presidential candidate wants to legalize polygamy |publisher=Mnn.com |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proponents of the legislation of polygamous civil marriage in Kazakhstan have argued that legalizing polygamous marriage would help balance out the uneven population, while others have cited the [[Qur'an]] as an argument in favor of such legislation, which permits men to marry up to four wives; according that he treats them equally and can financially look after them.

Opponents argued that the practice was dangerous to society, while other groups viewed the legislation as discrimination against women, since it would not allow for [[polyandry|polyandrous marriages]], which sparked a social debate over a possible "common ground" resolution.

==Public opinion==
A poll conducted in 2004 found that some 40% of [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] men supported the legislation of polygamy in Kazakhstan, while only 22% of women supported the idea, though with some reservations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Missmatch Registration.svg|thumb|Exaggerated example of a mismatch of [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] registration]]

In [[color printing]], '''registration''' is the method of correlating overlapping colors on one single image.  There are many different styles and types of registration, many of which employ the alignment of specific marks.

==Purpose==
When printing an image or a package of some sort that has more than one color, it is necessary to print each color separately and ensure each color overlaps the others precisely. If this is not done, the finished image will look fuzzy, blurred or "out of register" (see image to right). To help line the colors up correctly, a system of registration is necessary.

==Remedies==
[[Image:knockout trapping overprinting.svg|thumb|320px|
{| width="95%"
| width="5%" | &amp;nbsp;
! width="35%" align="center" | Knock-out&lt;br /&gt;without trapping

|}
Comparison of a knock-out with and without trapping, and [[overprinting]] for perfect and imperfect registration. Rows are as follows: {{ordered list
    |1=The cyan (lighter) plate,
    |2=The magenta (darker) plate,
    |3=Perfect registration (some monitors show slight misalignment)
    |4=Imperfect registration
}}]]
{{main|trap (printing)}}

===Trapping===
A remedy for slight misregistration is trapping. Where two colours abut, the lighter colour is slightly expanded into the darker to create an overlap. This yields a darker outline, which is considered less objectionable than a white gap. A major exception to this is the case when opaque (colors that completely obscure colors printed beneath them) spot colors are used. Other colors, regardless of their relative luminance, are always trapped to (spread under) these spot colors. If several of these spot colors are used (a common practice in the packaging market), the order of printing layers rather than luminance is the decisive element: the first color to be printed is spread under the next color. The trap width is dictated by the maximum amount of misregistration of the entire workflow up to the press.

===Overprinting===
Black ink is set to "overprint" colors in the background. The difference is not visible since the lighter color is spread underneath the&amp;mdash;almost&amp;mdash;opaque black.

==Types of (stone) lithography registration==

[[File:Registration Misalignment.jpg|thumb|An example of registration misalignment, note the cyan and magenta plates are not in the exact place. Also [[halftone]]s are visible on the top area.]]

There are many different styles of registration for many different types of printing. These deal with [[lithography|stone lithography]], as used in [[fine arts]] [[printmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Romano, Ross. "The Complete Printmaker", Page 226. [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===T-bar===
This method, using small measured registration marks on both the stone and the paper, is very accurate and simple to do.  The printer measures the exact size of the paper and the desired margins.  Then marks are made at both ends of the sheet of paper, and corresponding marks (usually in the shape of a "T") are made on the stone.  Then the printer matches the marks on the paper to those on the stone.  This way many runs of different colors can be pulled exactly in line with one another, each of them measured from the same system of marks.

{{see also|:ja:„Éà„É≥„Éú (Âç∞Âà∑)}}

===Pin-hole===

This method involves laying the paper on the un-inked surface, and making a pin-hole through both the bottom and top of the paper, being careful to make a mark in the stone's surface.  Then the locations of the holes are transferred to each sheet of paper to be printed.  When printing, one should place pins in each hole of a sheet of paper, and lower it onto the inked stone, placing each pin in its respective hole in the stone. This method can ruin paper by creating holes.  And if the holes get too large, they lose their function as registration devices.

===Eyeballing===
[[File:Common Registration Mark.svg|thumb|A commonly used registration mark. Although it seems black in color the actual value should be C=100,M=100,Y=100,K=100.]]
This method relies solely on hand‚Äìeye coordination.  The printer places the paper over the stone-image, measuring and judging registration by eye.  This is not very consistent, depending on the person.

==2010 Africa Cup of Nations==
Angola hosted the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]]. There were fears that the increased demand for prostitutes from the visiting fans would lead to a surge in [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="traf10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodham Clinton|first1=Hillary|title=Trafficking in Persons Report (10th Ed. )|date=2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1437937169}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Anti-Trafficking Law was passed, and a soccer based public awareness campaign was run.&lt;ref name="traf10" /&gt;

The spread of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] and [[HIV]] were a concern. The organising committee, LOC, initially tried to get all the prostitutes removed from the cites hosting games, but this wasn't practical. In conjunction with the Health Commission in Angola, they distributed 5 million free [[condom]]s to bars, hotels and other strategic locations.&lt;ref name="pmnews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Hawkers On The Prowl|url=https://www.lauraagustin.com/sex-hungry-babes-lure-and-trick-client-victims-a-change-from-the-usual|publisher=The PM News|accessdate=5 January 2018|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV==
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Angola}}
Angola has a large [[HIV/AIDS]] infected population. However, it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in the [[Southern Africa]] zone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendall|first=Carl|last2=Kerr|first2=Ligia Regina Franco Sansigolo|last3=Mota|first3=Rosa Maria Salani|last4=Cavalcante|first4=Socorro|last5=Macena|first5=Raimunda Hermelinda Maia|last6=Chen|first6=Sanny|last7=Gaffga|first7=Nicholas|last8=Monterosso|first8=Edgar|last9=Bastos|first9=Fransisco I.|date=2014-08-15|title=Population Size, HIV, and Behavior Among MSM in Luanda, Angola: Challenges and Findings in the First Ever HIV and Syphilis Biological and Behavioral Survey|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|volume=66|issue=5|pages=544‚Äì551|doi=10.1097/QAI.0000000000000213|issn=1525-4135|pmc=4733005|pmid=25014130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are a high risk group. [[UNAIDS]] reported that there was a 4.7% prevalence amongst sex workers in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The figure amongst the general adult population was 1.9%)&lt;ref name="unaids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola 2017 Country factsheets|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/angola|website=UNAIDS|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance to use condoms is a contributing factor. In 2016, UNAIDS reported 82.6% condom usage amongst sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom use among sex workers - Percent, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d78c616e-aabc-4c1e-b4e4-66fce6fab140 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sex workers charge double for sex without a condom.&lt;ref name="irin" /&gt; Another factor is that the many prostitutes that are in the country illegally have no access to health services.&lt;ref name="newera" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Angola}}
[[Angola]] is a source and destination country for women, and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Angolan girls as young as 13 years old are victims of sex trafficking. The provinces of [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], and the border provinces of [[Cunene Province|Cunene]], [[Namibe Province|Namibe]], [[Zaire Province|Zaire]], and [[U√≠ge Province|Uige]] are the most vulnerable to trafficking activities. Angolan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], and European countries, including the [[Netherlands]] and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="state16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258711.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=5 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women from [[Vietnam]] and [[Brazil]] engaged in prostitution in Angola may be victims of sex trafficking. Some [[Chinese people|Chinese]] women are recruited by Chinese gangs and construction companies with promises of work, but later are deprived of their passports, kept in walled compounds with armed guards, and forced into prostitution to pay back the costs of their travel. Undocumented Congolese migrants, including children, enter Angola for work in diamond-mining districts, where some endure sex trafficking in mining camps. Trafficking networks recruit and transport Congolese girls as young as 12 years old from [[Kasai Occidental]] in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Angola for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Angola as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]" country.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt;

==Recent history==
Prior to the [[Kosovo War]] following the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]], prostitution was limited to serving the needs of locals.&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3686173.stm|website=BBC|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=6 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ceasefire and presence in the country of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] and other international organisations, the demand for prostitution soared. As well as women turning to prostitution voluntarily, some were trafficked from [[Moldova]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] UK Director [[Kate Allen (Amnesty International)|Kate Allen]] is quoted as saying "Women and girls as young as 11 are being sold into [[sexual slavery]] in Kosovo and international peacekeepers are not only failing to stop it they are actively fuelling this despicable trade by themselves paying for sex from trafficked women."&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt;

Head of the [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] based International Press Centre, Rade Negojevic, claimed Kosovo had become the world's biggest [[brothel]] since the arrival of the international peacekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head Of Serb Press Centre Says Prostitution In Kosovo Flourishing |url=http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/news/tanjug050704.htm |website=Tanjug News Agency|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=7 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the UNMIK administration set up a Trafficking and Prostitution Police Unit with the intention combating [[pimp]]s, traffickers and organised crime. Measures against trafficking were included in the Interim Penal Code of Kosovo when it was drafted.&lt;ref name="diritto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadikaj|first1=Beqir|title=The characteristics of prostitution in kosovo: a sociological analysis|url=https://www.diritto.it/the-characteristics-of-prostitution-in-kosovo-a-sociological-analysis/|website=Diritto|accessdate=18 March 2018|language=it-IT|date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Police Service reported in 2008 that prostitution was occurring in 694 bars, cafeteria and night clubs in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="diritto" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
Kosovo is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Most victims are internally trafficked for sexual exploitation. Traffickers recruit victims through false promises of marriage or employment offers in cafes, night-clubs, and restaurants. Most sex trafficking victims in Kosovo are girls, although Kosovo criminal groups also force women from [[Albania]], Moldova, [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and other European countries into prostitution. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in private homes and apartments, night-clubs, and [[massage parlor]]s. Children used as dancers and escorts are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Traffickers subject Kosovo citizens to [[forced prostitution]] throughout Europe. Economically marginalized [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians|Ashkali, and Egyptians]] communities are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Government corruption creates an environment that enables some trafficking crimes. Several police officers, labor ministry employees, and other government officials have been charged with or convicted of trafficking crimes.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271220.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 171 of the criminal code prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of five to 12 years imprisonment and a fine of up to ‚Ç¨500,000. When sex trafficking offenses involve minors or a group of victims subjected to sex trafficking, the penalties increase to 15 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine. Article 231 prohibits taking sexual services from a trafficking victim.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Kosovo as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

A '''prosumer''' is a person who [[Consumption (economics)|consumes]] and [[Production (economics)|produces]] a [[Product (economics)|product]]. It is derived from "prosumption", a [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com era]] business term meaning "production by consumers". These terms were coined in 1980 by American [[Futurism|futurist]] [[Alvin Toffler]], and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. Today it generally refers to a person using [[commons-based peer production]].

"Prosumer" is also a trade term, used from a business perspective, for high-end electronic devices (such as [[digital camera]]s), meaning a price point between "professional" and "consumer" devices.

==Definitions and origins==

This blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative [[self-help]] movements that sprang up during various economic crises e.g. the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.

=== General meanings of "prosumer" (no relationship to the business term "prosumption") ===
*Enthusiasts who buy products (almost always technical) that fall between professional and consumer grade standards in quality, complexity, or functionality. Prosumer also commonly refers ''to those products''.
*Semiprofessional.
*"Prosumer" is a well-accepted category for camcorders, digital cameras, VCRs, "and other video playthings."&lt;ref&gt;Its usage grew when "it became associated with the video equipment market." http://www.wordspy.com/words/prosumer.asp&lt;/ref&gt; These advanced product features and higher prosumer expectations lend themselves to increased customizing in Toffler's product-improvement sense (see the next section).

=== Producer and consumer ===
[[Marshall McLuhan]] and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book ''Take Today'', (p.&amp;nbsp;4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'', [[futurologist]] [[Alvin Toffler]] coined the term "prosumer" when he predicted that the role of producers and [[consumer]]s would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book ''Future Shock'' from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated [[marketplace]] as [[mass production]] of [[standardization|standardized]] products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing [[Profit (economics)|profit]], businesses would initiate a process of [[mass customization]], that is the mass production of highly customized products.

However, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying [[design]] requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like [[architect]]s for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the [[Humanity+|H+ Magazine]] essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, A. 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative', H+ Magazine, 2014, [online] http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/01/13/prosumption-architecture-the-decentralisation-of-architectural-agency-as-an-economic-imperative/ [04/02/14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as ''[[Revolutionary Wealth]]'' (2006),  we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the ''prosumer'' as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in [[China]]. Discussing some of these issues with [[Newt Gingrich]] on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[After Words]]'' program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that ''The Third Wave'' is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |title= C-SPAN - After Words created. Toffler interviewed by Gingrich Episode
 |publisher   = [[C-SPAN]] |date = June 6, 2006 |accessdate  = December 5, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126051635/http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |archivedate = January 26, 2009 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Tapscott]] reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book ''The Digital Economy.''

Despite several decades of usage, the term only recently began to receive full theoretical elaboration.  [[George Ritzer]] and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claim that prosumption has become a salient characteristic of [[Web 2.0]].  Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.

Mass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food &amp; beverage industry for years. Look at how many choices we are faced with in the grocery stores and supermarkets. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving us thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of [[television]], [[sound recording|recorded]] music, and [[fast food]] would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In ''The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less'', [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that [[diminishing returns]] from a [[confusion|confusing]] abundance of consumer choice is producing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and dissatisfaction.&lt;sup&gt;[[#External links|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; Still, one key area of high-customization ''is'' taking place: highly involved hobbyists.

In the digital and online world, Prosumer is used to describe today's online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc.

In the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|last3=Kunz|first3=Friedrich|date=2017-06-01|title=Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|journal=Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|issn=2160-5882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green Iain Staffell|first=Richard|date=2017-06-01|title='Prosumage' and the British Electricity Market|url=https://doi.org/10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|journal=Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|issn=2160-5882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union‚Äôs Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way for example.

===Professional consumer===
With customization focused on [[leisure]] pursuits, Toffler's initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles: that of the [[professional]] and consumer. In particular, [[hobby]]ists have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies, often rising above the level of dilettante (an amateur, someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest) to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals. Key examples of such hobbies are:
*[[home improvement]] as illustrated by the rise of [[hardware store]]s such as [[Home Depot]]
*[[cooking]] as illustrated by creation of entirely new [[cable television]] channels entirely dedicated to the culinary arts such as The Food Channel or [[Food Network]]
*[[photography]] as illustrated by [[camcorder]]s and still [[camera]]s that are often on par with equipment used by professionals

This ''professional'' slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer [[Fads and trends|trends]]. Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as:
*high [[disposable income]]s by some sectors of the population
*increased leisure time, again, for some sectors of the population
*[[deflation (economics)|continuously falling prices]] of ever more advanced products (especially electronics)
*media geared towards amateurs and hobbyists:
**beginning in the 1980s with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], a growing profusion of [[magazine]]s to satisfy specialized interests
**beginning in the mid-1990s with the advent of the [[Internet]], an even wider range of [[website]]s with [[internet forum|online forum]]s to pool experience
*Pertaining to electronics; are considered to be "on the fence" as a product of lower quality than a professional product, and higher quality (sometimes in the form of [[wikt:bells and whistles|bells and whistles]]) than a consumer product. Some examples include:
** Digital camcorders
** Still cameras
** [[High-definition television|HDTV]]s
Toffler‚Äôs Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, Philip. (1986). Prosumers: A New Type of Customer. Futurist(September‚ÄìOctober), 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.&lt;ref&gt;Szymusiak T., (2013). Social and economic benefits of Prosumption and Lead User Phenomenon in Germany - Lessons for Poland [in:] Sustainability Innovation, Research Commercialization and Sustainability Marketing, Sustainability Solutions, M√ºnchen. {{ISBN|978-83-936843-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szymusiak T., (2015). Prosumer ‚Äì Prosumption ‚Äì Prosumerism, OmniScriptum GmbH &amp; Co. KG, D√ºsseldorf. {{ISBN|978-3-639-89210-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-corporate producer and consumer===
{{Anarchism sidebar |Economics}}
Yet a third meaning or usage of prosumer is springing up, especially among some [[activist]] groups. That is, the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to ''exclude'' (or at least diminish) the role of the [[corporation|corporate]] producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from [[value-add]]ed products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit [[commodity]] inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as [[globalization]], [[automation]], and [[wealth concentration]].

=== Prosumer from company perspective ===
A fourth view of the Prosumer is from the companies' perspective; that is, companies that open up their processes to the end-user, integrating them as prosumers for shared benefits. Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's R&amp;D. Other benefits might include strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles.
Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the [[end-user]]s to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from (or assistance of) third parties (i.e. companies, organizations, etc.). For example, [[Lego Mindstorms]] allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish.

===Prosumption===
In their 2006 book ''[[Wikinomics|Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything]]'', [[Don Tapscott]] and Anthony D. Williams use the related term of prosumption (production/consumption; also coined by Toffler) to refer to the creation of products and services by the same people who will ultimately use them.

== Impact and reception ==

===Adoption===
Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:
*a ''Do It Yourself'' ([[DIY]]) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income
*the [[open source software]] movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful [[operating system]] [[Linux]] which now dominates the server domain
*[[Fablab]] movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially [[3d printing]]
*the [[voluntary simplicity]] movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as:
**growing one's own food
**repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items
**playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music
*use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non-profit, "consumer-to-consumer" media and cultures (see [[Wikipedia]], [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]], most of [[Creative Commons]]); many involved in independent media reject [[popular culture|mass culture]] generated by [[concentration of media ownership|concentrated corporate media]]
*self-sufficient [[barter (economics)|barter]] networks, notably in [[developing nations]], such as Argentina's [[Red Global de Clubes de Trueque Multirec√≠proco|RGT]] have adopted the term prosumer&lt;sup&gt;[[#External links|4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Influence on a company's R&amp;D budget ===
A fourth view of the ''prosumer'' is as one who is aware:
* the fact that the whole wealth of a company (including profits, interests, ads, wages, investments, etc. plus waste, losses, taxes, fines, etc.) comes from the retail prices paid by generations of common consumers
* in a non-(quasi-)[[Perfect concurrence|perfect concurrence]] market, all prices are not equitable prices, they are influenced by some violence on wants in the strength rate between demand and supply, the difference between cost and price is the measurement of violence on wants
* the sense of existence itself of the whole economy is to serve the consumer
* retail price payers, or common consumers of the same product (or of different products sold by the same retailer company, or users of the same branch of a supplying line) can:
** decide together as consumers
** join, communicate, organize both locally or via the Internet, so that they can publish petitions offering the company:
*** ways to improve a product and its supply service
*** ways to help the company stop wasting its main resource, its consumers
*** how to improve the marketing (as often oligopolistic marketing is "hostile marketing", exploiting and manipulating retail price payers)
*** ways to improve positive motivations to work
** influence the R&amp;D spending of a company in ways which directly benefit them;
For example, a manufacturer of widgets has a customer who changes their requirements, asking that all their widgets sing. This customer is important enough that losing them would seriously hurt the company's bottom line. Based on this customer's request, the company direct a portion of its R&amp;D budget to address this requirement. While the customer didn‚Äôt make the changes directly, they did influence the company's design requirements. This arrangement has positive effects for both parties;

for the customer
* immediate access to the new technology
* technology that meets their specific requirements
for the company
* a strengthened relationship with the customer
* a demonstration of willingness to keep their customers satisfied
* a new feature/product/service they can market to other customers

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''Public property''' is [[property]] that is dedicated to public use and is a subset of [[state property]]. The term may be used either to describe the use to which the property is put, or to describe the character of its ownership (owned collectively by the [[population]] of a [[Sovereign state|state]]). This is in contrast to [[private property]], owned by an individual person or artificial entities that represent the financial interests of persons, such as [[corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clarke |first=Alison |author2=Paul Kohler |title=Property law: commentary and materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=676MTfEsZ3sC |isbn=9780521614894}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[State ownership]]''', also called '''public ownership''', '''government ownership''' or '''state property''', are property interests that are vested in the [[State (polity)|state]], rather than an [[individual]] or [[Community|communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clarke |first=Alison |author2=Paul Kohler |title=Property law: commentary and materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |page=40 |url= |isbn=9780521614894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crown property ==
In the modern [[representative democracy]], "public property" is said to be owned by the people as a [[commons]] or held in trust by the government for common benefit. In many [[Commonwealth realm]]s, such property is said to be owned by [[the Crown]]. Examples include [[Crown land]], [[Crown copyright]], and [[Crown Dependencies]].

==Canada==
In the Canada, The ''Public Debt and Property'' are under the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html#h-17 |title=Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 ‚Äì VI.

The '''Radio Amateurs of Lebanon''' ('''RAL''') is a [[non-profit organization]] for some [[amateur radio]] operators in [[Lebanon]].  Key membership benefits of the RAL include a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those amateur radio operators in regular communications with other amateur radio operators in foreign countries, and a network to support [[amateur radio emergency communications]].  RAL represents the interests of its members.
Other Lebanese amateur-radio organizations exist in Lebanon, such as RAK (Rachid Karame Amateur Radio Society)
Some amateur radio operators in Lebanon exist without being affiliated to any organization. In Lebanon, it is only the ministary of telecommunications that grants the right to become a radio operator.
Upon succeeding a written and an oral exam at the minstary premises, comes an interview. When the future operators passes the three tests, the ministary hands in a written certification allowing the new operator to operate within the Lebanese spectrum management. In Lebanon, there are two levels of Amateur radio: Phone operator and telegraphy operator.
A Lebanese certification gives the right for a callsign starting with OD5.   A callsign in Lebanon is for life.

[[File:Huck Finn Travelling by Rail.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the two con men being paraded on a rail in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'']]
'''Riding the rail''' (also called being "run out of town on a rail") was a punishment most prevalent in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries in which an offender was made to straddle a fence rail held on the shoulders of two or more bearers.  The subject was then paraded around town or taken to the city limits and dumped by the roadside.  

Being ridden on a rail was typically a form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] administered by a mob, sometimes in connection with [[tarring and feathering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmer's Dictionary of Americanisms ‚Äì Old and New|year=1889|publisher=Reeves and Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTdcQOlzjXAC&amp;dq=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;pg=PA448#v=onepage&amp;q=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;f=false|author=John S Farmer|accessdate=21 September 2010|location=London|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show community displeasure with the offender so they either conformed their behavior to the mob's demands or left the community.

A story attributed to [[Abraham Lincoln]] has him quoting a victim of being ridden out of town on a rail as having said, "If it weren't for the honor of the thing, I'd just as soon it happened to someone else."&lt;ref name="Cuomo"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abraham Lincoln and Our "Unfinished Work" |first1=Governor Mario M. |last1=Cuomo |work=Journal of the [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] |volume=8 |issue= 1 |year=1986 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.2629860.0008.106 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', Homer Stokes denounces the [[O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F#Soggy_Bottom_Boys|Soggy Bottom Boys]] as hostile to the social order, but the crowd is unimpressed and runs him out of town on a rail.

A '''self-clasping handshake''' is a [[gesture]] in which one hand is grasped by the other and held together in front of the body or over the head.  In the United States, this gesture is a sign of victory, being made by the winning boxer at the end of a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/10/magazine/on-language-the-self-clasping-squeeze.html |title=The Self-Clasping Squeeze |author=[[William Safire]] |date=November 10, 1985 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian leaders of the Soviet Union, such as [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], used the gesture to symbolise friendship when visiting the United States, and so risked misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cb8pUmpMvEC&amp;pg=PA199 |title=International Perspectives on Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management |author=Betty Jane Punnett |publisher=M.E.

'''Shaqaqi''' (also is written as shaghaghi) is an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] tribe of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shahsevan SHAHSEVAN] from [[Encyclop√¶dia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its branches nowadays live in [[East Azerbaijan]], [[Razavi Khorasan]] and [[North Khorasan]] provinces of [[Iran]] and also in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichodoc.ir/p-a/CHANGED/49/html/49-41.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly speak [[Azerbaijani language]] and are [[Shiite]] Muslims. They moved from [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]] border [[Kurdistan]] region to [[Iran]] after the [[Safavid]] proclaimed [[Shia Islam]] as the official religion in [[Persia]]. They should not be confused with [[Shekak]]s which are [[Kurmanj]] and [[Sunni]] Muslims.

The powerful Shaqaqi tribal warriors were extensively tapped into by the [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties of Iran.

Some branches of the Shaqaqi tribe moved westward into the Levant, finding great families there, as far south as [[Holy Land]]. There are found many illustrious Shaqaqi/Shiqaqi among the Palestinians today, which are still [[Shiite]] Muslims but they are assimilated into Arab identity, and can no longer be considered Azerbaijani.

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) ‚ÄúThe Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.‚Äù Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands‚Äô permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': divorce between 1976-1991 was allowed for non-Catholics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] in 1996, [[Chile]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile introduces right to divorce | date = November 18, 2004 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malta]] in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095119/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:◊ë◊¢◊ú|◊ë◊¢◊ú]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women‚Äôs fears and men‚Äôs anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrt√ºmer''''' ('''''Summa Iniuria: A Pitaval of Miscarriages of Justice''''') is a collection of ''[[Cause c√©l√®bre|causes c√©l√®bres]]'' by the Swiss author Hans M. Sutermeister.  It is considered ‚Äúone of the most detailed documentations about [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in the German language‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Gilli√©ron, G. ''Strafbefehlsverfahren und plea bargaining als Quelle von Fehlurteilen.'' Zurich: Schulthess, 2010, p. 15. {{ISBN|978-3-7255-6021-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is inspired by [[Voltaire]]‚Ä≤s early activism against French miscarriages of justice of puritan origin, as well as by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]‚Ä≤s criminalistic approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Sutermeister H M. ''Summa Iniuria.'' 1976, pp. 38‚Äì40 and 119‚Äì121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book proposes a legal reform for Switzerland which has never been realized because of political controversies.  The [[Maria Popesco|Maria Popescu]], [[Jaccoud case|Pierre Jaccoud]], and [[Vera Br√ºhne]] cases are discussed in detail, as Sutermeister was involved in the criminal researches.  The [[George Edalji]] case serves, among others, to illustrate the issue of faulty expertises.  The main part consists of the so‚Äìcalled ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù, based on [[Max Hirschberg]]s categories of causes of judicial errors.

===Hirschberg test===
The ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù begins with critique against the preliminary inquiries concerning [[Josef Issels]] and [[Bruno Gr√∂ning]].

The phenomenon of mis-identification are illustrated by the [[Courrier de Lyon case|Joseph Lesurques]], Billy Armstrong, [[Adolf Beck case|Adolph Beck]], [[Hilsner Affair|Leopold Hilsner]], [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]], [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], [[Joe Hill]], [[Caryl Chessman]], Charles Townsend, [[James Hanratty]], [[John Dickman]], [[Rubin Carter]], Jerome Frank, [[Will Purvis]], [[Anna Anderson]] cases, a large list of experiences which led to wrongful court decisions and which serve to illustrate also other items of the ‚ÄúHirschberg test‚Äù.

The issue of uncritical assessment of [[Plea|guilty plea]] is illustrated by the cases of [[Timothy Evans]], [[Harold Israel]], [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], [[Albert DeSalvo]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Mata Hari]], [[Renate von Natzmer]], [[Escobedo v. Illinois|Danny Escobedo]], [[Richard Speck]], and [[Alfred George Hinds]], among others.

In the chapter about the impact of fellow convicts on dispensation of justice is considered the judgment of [[Barbara Graham]]; and concerning the witness account, the [[Felix Fechenbach]] case, the [[Guillaume Affair]], and the cases of [[Antoine Argoud]], [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld|Beate Klarsfeld]], Milan Bogunovic, [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof]], [[Raoul Villain]], [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley]], and [[Maximilian Kolbe]].  In the cases of [[Marguerite Steinheil]], [[Leo Frank]], [[Sam Sheppard|Samuel Sheppard]], [[Karl Stauffer-Bern|Karl Stauffer]], and [[Green Bicycle Case|Ronald Light]], the lies of the accused would have offered guilty proof.

[[Circumstantial evidence]] lawsuits are illustrated by the cases of [[Frederick Seddon]], [[Marie Besnard]], [[Steven Truscott]], [[Graham Young|Graham Frederick Young]], and some [[white-collar crime]]s.  Suggestibility and emotional biases of the jury as causes of wrongful court decisions are shoewd by the cases of Jesse Hill Ford, [[Joan Little]], and [[Alger Hiss]].

The relationship between miscarriages of justice and [[public morality]] are analysed through the cases of [[Henriette Caillaux]], [[Ruth Ellis]], [[Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet]], [[Hawkhurst Gang|Arthur Gray]], [[Horst Schumann]], [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Berry]], Baader-Meinhof, [[Timothy Leary]], [[Patty Hearst|Patricia Hearst]], [[Kurt Gerstein]], [[Paul Gr√ºninger]], [[Rudolf Roessler]], [[David Frankfurter]], [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Derek Bentley case|Derek Bentley]], [[Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters|Edith Thompson]], [[Ivar Kreuger]], [[Stavisky Affair]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Viola Liuzzo]], [[Wilma Montesi]], [[Horst Wessel]], among many others.

The case of [[Jacques Isorni]] serves to illustrate certain relationship between law and ethics.

The author concludes by briefly analysing other aspects of misleading or other judgments revising the [[John T. Scopes|John Thomas Scopes]], [[Carl von Ossietzky]], [[Theodor Lessing]], [[Bruno L√ºdke]], [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany]], [[Hans Paasche]], [[Ludwig Quidde]], and [[White Rose|Wei√üe Rose]] cases.

==Reception==
The book has the appearance of a patchwork obtained by stitching together legal and controversial political parts, as has been criticized by German jurist [[Klaus Volk]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Volk]]. "Buchbesprechung: Sutermeister, H. M.. Summa Iniuria." In: ''Monatsschrift f√ºr Kriminologie und Strafrechtsreform''. Jahrgang 60, 1977, S.388.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Austrian [[Nazism|Nazi]] medical writer [[Otto Scrinzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Scrinzi]]. "Buch im Brennpunkt: Unvermeidliche Justizirrt√ºmer." In: ''√Ñrztliche Praxis: Die Zeitung des Arztes in Klinik und Praxis''. 1976/1977&lt;/ref&gt;  For the German criminal law expert [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]], on the other hand, the book represents a milestone in the series of works about miscarriages of justice which comes to terms with many failures of post-World War II criminal judgments in Germany and Switzerland, therefore completing a certain continuing effort which has its history in the works of Erich Sello, [[Max Alsberg]], Albert Hellwig, Max Hirschberg, and Heinrich Jagusch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]].

Many details about Wiseau's personal life (including his age and background) remain unverified, and as such have been the subject of intense fan speculation and various conflicting reports.&lt;ref name=cult/&gt; The 2013 non-fiction book ''[[The Disaster Artist|The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made]]'' by [[Greg Sestero]], as well as its [[The Disaster Artist (film)|2017 film adaptation]], chronicle the making of ''The Room'' and Wiseau's life behind the scenes.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Wiseau is very secretive about his early life.&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collis|first=Clark|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20246031,00.html|title=The Crazy Cult of 'The Room'|website=EW.com|date=December 12, 2008|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In various interviews, he has claimed to have lived in [[France]] "a long time ago";&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Is-The-Room-the-worst-movie-of-all-time-1305606.php|title=Is 'The Room' the worst movie of all time?}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed he grew up in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]];&lt;ref name="terminal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terminallaughter.ca/2009/03/29/interview-tommy-wiseau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422083903/http://terminallaughter.ca/2009/03/29/interview-tommy-wiseau/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 22, 2010|title=Interview: Tommy Wiseau ¬´ Terminal Laughter|website=Terminallaughter.wordpress.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/trapped-in-the-room-with-tommy-wiseau/Content?oid=5343821|title=Trapped in The Room with Tommy Wiseau|website=CL Atlanta|date=May 8, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2013|author=Maddux, Rachael}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described having "an entire family" in [[Chalmette, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="aintitcool1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/44619|title=Capone's wacky Windy City weekend with Wiseau, creator of THE ROOM!!!|website=Ain't It Cool News|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews following the release of ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'' in 2003, Wiseau gave an age which would indicate he was born in 1968 or 1969,&lt;ref name="crikey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/cinetology/2010/02/16/interview-with-tommy-wiseau-actorwriterdirectorproducer-of-the-room|title=Interview with Tommy Wiseau, actor/writer/director/producer of The Room &amp;#124; Cinetology|website=Blogs.crikey.com.au|date=February 16, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but friend [[Greg Sestero]] claims in his 2013 memoir ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'' that his brother's girlfriend obtained copies of Wiseau's U.S. immigration papers and found that Wiseau was born "much earlier" than he claimed,{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=258}} in an [[Eastern Bloc]] country in the mid to late 1950s.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=192}}

In his 2016 documentary, ''Room Full of Spoons'', Rick Harper claims to have researched Wiseau's background and concluded that he is Polish and originally from the city of [[Pozna≈Ñ]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tommy-wiseau-origin_us_56a11990e4b0d8cc1098fdb8|title=The Irresistible Mystery Of Tommy Wiseau|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=August 3, 2016|date=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiseau confirmed publicly for the first time in November 2017 that he is originally from Europe: "Long story short, I grew up in Europe a long time ago, but I'm American and very proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/11/30/tommy-wiseau-where-is-he-from|title=''The Room'' mastermind Tommy Wiseau actually opened up about his secret origins|last=Romano|first=Nick|date=November 30, 2017|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/the-disaster-artist-the-room-tommy-wiseau-james-franco.html|title=When Your Movie Is a Hit for All the Wrong Reasons|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=November 29, 2017|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2017 interview with [[Howard Stern]], he claimed to speak fluent French and said he is a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', December 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Disaster Artist'', Sestero asserts that Wiseau revealed to him‚Äîthrough "fantastical, sad, self-contradictory stories"‚Äîthat as a young adult he moved to [[Strasbourg]], where he adopted the name "Pierre" and worked as a restaurant dishwasher.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=192‚Äì94, 200‚Äì03}} According to Sestero, Wiseau described being wrongfully arrested following a drug raid at a [[hostel]] and being traumatised by his mistreatment by the French police, which led him to emigrate to the U.S. to purportedly live with an aunt and uncle in Chalmette.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=200‚Äì03, 207‚Äì08}}

===Life in America===
Sestero asserts that after Wiseau had lived in Louisiana for some amount of time, he subsequently moved to [[San Francisco]], California, where he worked as a street vendor selling toys to tourists near [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]]. Wiseau supposedly gained the nickname "The Birdman" for his bird toys, which were only popular in Europe at the time; this led him to legally change his name when he became a U.S. citizen to Thomas Pierre Wiseau, taking the French word for "bird" (''oiseau'') and replacing the O with the W of his birth name.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=244‚Äì45}}

Around this time, Wiseau also claims to have obtained a degree in [[psychology]] from [[Laney Community College]] in [[Oakland]],&lt;ref name="Bramesco 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bramesco|first=Charles|title=Everything We Definitely Know About The Room's Tommy Wiseau|website=Vulture|date=November 22, 2017 | url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/everything-we-definitely-know-about-the-rooms-tommy-wiseau.html|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EW.com 2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=A vintage interview with 'The Room' creator Tommy Wiseau: 'Believe in what you believe'|website=EW.com|date=November 28, 2017|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/28/tommy-wiseau-the-room-interview-disaster-artist|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that he had graduated on the [[honors student|honor roll]].&lt;ref name="Jagannathan 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jagannathan|first=Meera|title=Tommy Wiseau Bio ‚Äì Things to Know About Tommy Wiseau|website=Esquire|date=October 7, 2017|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/tommy-wiseau-bio|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sestero, Wiseau worked a variety of jobs in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], including restaurant busboy and hospital worker, and ran a business called Street Fashions USA that sold [[product defect|irregular]] blue jeans at discounted prices. He eventually purchased and rented out large retail spaces in and around San Francisco and [[Los Angeles]], making him independently wealthy. In the same book, however, Sestero admits that the idea of Wiseau becoming wealthy so quickly via the jobs he claims to have had is so unlikely that he himself finds it impossible to believe.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=246‚Äì50}} Sestero suggests on several occasions that many people involved with the creation of ''The Room'' believed the film to be part of some money-laundering scheme for organized crime, but Sestero himself considers this unlikely.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=100, 160}}

Wiseau claims to have been involved in a near-fatal car crash in California after another driver ran a red light and struck Wiseau's vehicle; as a result, Wiseau was hospitalized for several weeks.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=59}} Sestero suggests that this incident was the turning point in Wiseau's life that led him to pursue his dreams of becoming an actor and director, ambitions that he had long neglected while pursuing financial security.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=179}}

==Career==
===Film===
====Influences and early work====
Wiseau has stated that he has been influenced by the films ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and specifically the actors [[James Dean]] and [[Marlon Brando]].&lt;ref name="jrubenoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knegt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knegt|first=Peter|title=Tommy Wiseau Goes Legit|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/tommy_wiseau|website=IndieWire|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theonion"&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/articles/tommy-wiseau,29598 Interview: Tommy Wiseau], ''[[The A.V. Club]]''; accessed June 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sestero, Wiseau's obsession with James Dean was so intense that he often visited a Los Angeles restaurant owned by a former acquaintance of Dean,{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=84‚Äì87}} and that several lines of dialogue in ''The Room'' (including the infamous cry "You are tearing me apart, Lisa!") were based on lines from ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''.{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=126‚Äì30}} Wiseau also cites his cinematic influences as including [[Tennessee Williams]],&lt;ref name="jrubenoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrubenoff.com/interviews/wiseau|title=Josh Rubenoff: Interview of Tommy Wiseau|website=jrubenoff.com|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Welles]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref name="varsity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Will|title=The Varsity Interview: Tommy Wiseau|url=http://thevarsity.ca/2011/04/27/the-varsity-interview-tommy-wiseau|work=[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]]|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sestero notes that the actor had been "trying to bust in" to Hollywood since the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="V Magazine 2016" /&gt; and recounts being shown an undated [[VHS tape]] of Wiseau in Vincent Chase's acting class (with whom Wiseau had a contentious relationship).{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|p=57‚Äì58}} He was apparently enrolled in Chase's program around 1994.&lt;ref name="V Magazine 2016"/&gt; Wiseau also allegedly attended film classes at [[Los Angeles Community College]].&lt;ref name="V Magazine 2016"/&gt;

During this time, Wiseau directed a student film, ''Robbery Doesn't Pay'', shot with a [[Super 8 film|super 8]] camera in the [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] section of [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Sestero|Bissell|2013|pp=57, 84‚Äì85}} The film, which does not star Wiseau, has been described by Sestero as "just a dude walking around looking at cars to '[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]' by [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]]."&lt;ref name="V Magazine 2016"/&gt;

====''The Room''====
{{main|The Room (film)}}
Wiseau's film ''The Room'' was released in 2003. Its budget was $6 million, the financing of which has remained a source of intrigue. The film was based on an unpublished 540-page novel written by Wiseau himself.&lt;ref name="Knegt"/&gt; The movie was immediately lambasted by critics,&lt;ref name="crazycult"&gt;Entertainment Weekly "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20246031,00.html The Crazy Cult That is the Room]"&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately became a "cult classic" with late-night showings at theaters around the world.

Audience members typically arrive wearing wigs resembling their favorite characters, interact with the dialogue on screen, and throw plastic cutlery and footballs around the theater in reference to on-screen events. This attention grew into what was dubbed ''The Room''{{'}}s 2010‚Äì2011 "Love is Blind" International Tour, with the movie being screened in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Australia]] and [[India]], among other locations. Wiseau appears at many of these events, posing for photographs with fans and often addressing the audience before screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Room Official Movie Site|url=http://www.theroommovie.com|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 [[The Disaster Artist (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Greg Sestero]]'s autobiography ''[[The Disaster Artist]]'', [[James Franco]] portrays Wiseau, for which he won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. Wiseau approved of the choice, as well as that of [[Dave Franco]] as Sestero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/06/10/the-room-dave-franco-james-franco|title=Dave Franco to star in James Franco's movie about 'The Room'|author=Clark Collis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy Wiseau makes a cameo appearance in a [[post-credits scene]] as Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title='The Disaster Artist': James Franco Reveals Tommy Wiseau Has a Contractually Obligated Cameo|url=http://collider.com/the-disaster-artist-james-franco-tommy-wiseau-cameo/|website=collider.com|publisher=[[Complex Media]]|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagmaster|first1=Elizabeth|title='Freaks and Geeks' Reboot?

In March 2015, Wiseau stated in a [[Reddit]] "ask me anything" thread that he had commenced work on a new project named ''The Foreclosure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2zdzik/tommy_wiseau_creator_of_the_room_and_the_new_tv/cpi0lf8/|title=Tommy Wiseau, creator of THE ROOM and the new TV show THE NEIGHBORS, available now on Hulu.

He was featured as the villain Linton Kitano in ''[[Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance]]'', the sequel to the cult classic ''[[Samurai Cop]]''. In October 2016, it was announced that Wiseau and Sestero would star in a movie called ''[[Best F(r)iends]]''. The movie was written by Sestero and was shot in secret in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/room-director-tommy-wiseau-star-937339|title='The Room' Director Tommy Wiseau and Star Greg Sestero Reunite for New Movie (Exclusive)|author=Rebecca Ford|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 2008, Wiseau produced and appeared in the pilot episode of a television series called ''[[The Neighbors (2015 TV series)|The Neighbors]]''. A trailer for ''The Neighbors'' showed a series of clips set in an office. The show's website, accompanied by trailers and announcements at ''The Room'' showings in 2015, stated that the show is coming to various media distribution outlets in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theneighborssitcom.com|title=The Neighbors official site|website=Theneighborssitcom.com|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Wiseau guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' titled "Tommy", wherein Wiseau guest-directed a segment titled "Pigman". After Wiseau expressed a desire to work with the duo again,&lt;ref name="jrubenoff"/&gt; [[Tim Heidecker|Tim]] and [[Eric Wareheim|Eric]] announced in 2009 that they were developing two series for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_tim_eric/3|title=Wired article|website=Wired.com|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Wiseau appeared in [[Marc Wootton]]'s 2010 comedy TV series ''[[La La Land (TV series)|La La Land]]''. In a [[mockumentary]] format, Wootton's character, Gary Garner, accepted a role in Wiseau's present production at the time. Wiseau kicked Wootton off the set after Wootton jokingly alluded to using production funds to buy instant lotto tickets.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Internet===
In 2011, Wiseau starred in a [[YouTube]] web series, ''Tommy Explains it All'', in which he explained his views on various topics ranging from ''Citizen Kane'' to the art of kissing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyExplainsItAll|title=Episode 2: How Do You Know When You're In Love|website=Youtube|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiseau starred in segments on [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima.com]] called ''The Tommy Wi-Show''. The segments show Wiseau playing various video games, such as ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'', and offering commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxp83CimT0w&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=The Tommy Wi-Show Ep. 1: Mortal Kombat (Machinima)|website=Machinima.com|date=September 24, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/09/14/the-tommy-wi-show-is-a-video-game-show-with-tommy-wiseau|title=The Tommy Wi-Show is a video game show with Tommy Wiseau|website=Joystiq|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tommy Wi-Show Ep. 5: Driver: San Francisco|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaig213SE3o|website=Machinima.com|accessdate=October 6, 2014|date=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wiseau remains private about the details of his personal and family life. In 2017, he told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "I think private life should be private life, the professional life should be the professional life, and that's where I stand, and I have right to do that."&lt;ref name="EW.com 2017"/&gt; During a 2016 interview with [[James Franco]], Wiseau referred to Greg Sestero as his "best friend".&lt;ref name="V Magazine 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=James Franco Interviews the Men Behind the worst film ever made|website=V Magazine|date=April 12, 2016|url=https://vmagazine.com/article/james-franco-interviews-the-men-behind-the-the-worst-film-ever-made|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">{{Arab culture}}
'''''Wa·π£f''''' ({{lang-ar|ŸàÿµŸÅ}}) (literally 'attribute' or 'description'; pl. ''aw·π£ƒÅf'' ÿ£ŸàÿµÿßŸÅ) is an ancient style of Arabic poetry, which can be characterised as descriptive verse.  The concept of ''wa·π£f'' was also borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]], which developed its own rich poetic tradition in this mode.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Arabic verse==

''Wa·π£f'' was one of four kinds of poetry in which medieval Arabic poets were expected to be competent, alongside 'the boast (''fakhr''), the invective (''hijaa‚Äô''), and the elegy (''marthiya'')'.&lt;ref name=DotP&gt;Cole, Peter, ed. and trans., ''The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950‚Äì1492'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably deriving from the descriptions of the abandoned campsite and beloved in the ancient [[Qasida|qasida's]] [[Nasƒ´b (poetry)|erotic prelude]], and of animals and landscape in the journey section, or ''rahiil'', it evolved into a genre of its own in [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Baghdad]] and later in Spain. The tradition in Arabic was highly developed, with poets often devoting entire collections to elaborate treatments of single subjects, such as hunting animals, kinds of flowers, and specific objects. [...] While one might initially be inclined to take the genre of ''wasf'' poetry lightly--since it involves "mere" description, in fact an argument could be made for seeing this genre as, in some instances, central to the poetry of the period.&lt;ref name=DotP/&gt;

In ''wa·π£f'' love poems, each part of a lover's body is described and praised in turn, often using exotic, extravagant, or even far-fetched metaphors. The [[Song of Solomon]] is a prominent example of such a poem, and other examples can be found in [[Thousand and One Nights]].  The images given in this type of poetry are not literally descriptive.  Instead, they convey the delight of the lover for the beloved, where the lover finds freshness and splendor in the body as a reflected image in the world. Other varieties of ''wa·π£f'' include literary [[Riddles (Arabic)|riddles]].

==Outside Arabic==

This genre had a long history and later became a favorite of the troubadour poets and the authors of sonnets in the Elizabethan era.  This renaissance literature was popularized by French authors via Italian and was called the ''blasons anatomiques'' or [[blazon]] (see Italian poet [[Francesco Petrarch|Petrarch]]).  Shakespeare effectively ended this movement with his [[Sonnet CXXX|Sonnet 130]] which satirized the form.  For instance, the first line in that satire reads, "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."&lt;ref&gt;Mabillard, Amanda. [http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/130detail.html Analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130], including sonnet text and modern translation. Shakespeare Online. 2000. (7/Oct/2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Estonia''' are women who were born in, who live in, or are from [[Estonia]] in [[Europe]].

== Politics ==

Estonian women first gained the right to vote from [[Russian Provisional Government|Russia's Provisional Government]] in 12th of April 1917 together with Estonia being granted a national autonomy as a unified entity.&lt;ref&gt;http://feministeerium.ee/kuidas-eesti-naised-valimisoiguse-said/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertility ==

Between 1970 and 1990, the [[total fertility rate]] (TFR - the average number of children a woman bears&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;) of [[Estonians|Estonian]] women was little over 2 children born per woman.&lt;ref name="Main demographic indicators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/02Main_demographic_indicators/02Main_demographic_indicators.asp|title=Main demographic indicators|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fast decrease of the TFR occurred after independence. In 1998 the lowest rate was recorded: 1.28 children born per women. In 2001, the United Nations reported through its annual world-population report that "Estonia was one of the fastest-shrinking nations on earth, at risk of losing nearly half its 1.4 million people by mid-century". To prevent this drop in TFR, one of the steps the Estonian government took since 2004 was to start "paying" women by providing them with subsidies "to have babies" known as "mother's salary"). After giving birth and during maternity leave, working Estonian women received full monthly income for up to 15 months (equivalent to US$1,560.00); non-working women who gave birth received a monthly subsidy equivalent to US$200.00.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Marcus|title=In Estonia, Paying Women To Have Babies Is Paying Off|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB116128123297297938|work=As Low Birthrates Threaten Growth, Developed Nations Watch Incentive Effort|publisher=The Wall Street Journal (New York)|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TFR slightly recovered in the subsequent years, but fluctuated by year, and continued to remain below the replacement rate (being 1.54 children/woman in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0&lt;/ref&gt; As in many other European countries, the link between marriage and fertility has been weakened during the past decades: most children today are born outside of marriage (59% of children were born to unmarried women in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/among-baltic-states-greatest-birth-rate-growth-2014-was-registered-latvia-43062.html&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of mothers at first birth in 2014 was 26.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/among-baltic-states-greatest-birth-rate-growth-2014-was-registered-latvia-43062.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, according to [[Estonian mythology]], the ancient women of Estonia believed in the female deity and protector of pregnant women in [[Childbirth|labor]] known as [[R√µugutaja]].

First woman cleric [[Laine Villenthal]] was ordinated in 1967 by [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eestikirik.ee/naiste-ordineerimisest-eesti-evangeelses-luterlikus-kirikus/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wukan protests''', also known as the '''Siege of Wukan''', was an anti-corruption protest that began in September 2011, and escalated in December 2011 with the expulsion of officials by villagers, the siege of the town by police, and subsequent d√©tente&lt;ref name="teleg_14Dec" /&gt; in the southern Chinese village of [[Wukan]] (pop. 12,000). The villagers rose up again in June 2016, but were again suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1982989/wukan-village-living-fear-following-arrest-party-chief|title=Wukan: a village living in fear following arrest of party chief|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent rounds of clashes were in September, 2016, when the former village leader Lin Zulian was sentenced to jail. The clashes were suppressed.

The protests began on 21‚Äì23 September 2011 after officials sold land to real estate developers without properly compensating the villagers. Several hundred to several thousand people protested in front of and then attacked a government building, a police station and an industrial park. Protesters held signs saying "give us back our farmland" and "let us continue farming." Rumors that the police had killed a child further inflamed the protesters and provoked rioting. Residents of Wukan had previously petitioned the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|national government]] in 2009 and 2010 over the land disputes. In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, authorities allowed villagers to select 13 representatives to engage in negotiations.

Security agents abducted five of the representatives and took them into custody in early December. The protests strengthened after one of the village representatives, Xue Jinbo, died in [[police custody]] in suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_thumbs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThReut_thumbs" /&gt; The villagers forced the entire local government, Communist Party leadership and police out of the village.&lt;ref name="Hindu_police_evicted" /&gt; {{As of|2011|12|14}}, a thousand police laid siege to the village, preventing food and goods from entering the village.&lt;ref name="teleg_14Dec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_14Dec" /&gt; Government authorities set up [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|internet censorship]] against information about Wukan, Lufeng and [[Shanwei]].&lt;ref name="BBC_wukan_censored" /&gt;

Wukan is a village that had often been described as being especially harmonious.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007 /&gt; International newspapers described the December uprising as being exceptional&lt;ref name="teleg_14Dec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu_police_evicted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_14Dec" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj20111216page/&gt; compared to other [[Protest and dissent in the People's Republic of China|"mass incidents" in the People's Republic of China]] which numbered approximately 180,000 in 2010.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_180k_incidents" /&gt;

The village representatives and provincial officials reached a peaceful agreement, satisfying the villagers' immediate requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/21/world/asia/china-village-standoff/index.html |title=Chinese village protester says government relents |publisher=CNN  |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Communist Party secretary of Shanwei City said that the authority of the city has been "overridden" by provincial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16280635 |title=BBC News ‚Äì China round-up: Friendship with North Korea stressed |publisher=BBC  |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Wukan village (population 20,000) is located in [[Lufeng, Guangdong|Lufeng]] [[county-level city]] of [[Guangdong]] province, some 5&amp;nbsp;km south ({{coord|22|53||N|115|40||E|region:CN-62}})&lt;ref&gt;Google Maps&lt;/ref&gt; of Lufeng's central urban area. The village is near the shore of the Wukan Harbor (‰πåÂùéÊ∏Ø), which is part of the Jieshi Bay (Á¢£Áü≥Êπæ) of the [[South China Sea]];&lt;ref&gt;Google Maps; Guangdong Provincial Atlas.&lt;/ref&gt; the location of the village near the southern Chinese coast lends itself well to urban development.&lt;ref name=nyt20111226wines/&gt; The village has enjoyed the reputation on the mainland for many years as a model village for its harmoniousness, civility and prosperity.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt;

Since the abolition of agricultural taxes in 2006, local government has been increasingly raising money through land sales to the extent that this is now a primary revenue stream.&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt; Conflicts between farmers and local officials have risen throughout China, often because of land seizures (or "land grabs").&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt; The rate of forced evictions has grown significantly since the 1990s, as city and county-level governments have increasingly come to rely on land sales as a source of revenue. In 2011, the Financial Times reported that 40 percent of local government revenue comes from land sales.&lt;ref&gt;Rahul Jacob, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/710ea3da-1f14-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F710ea3da-1f14-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz1uHxCFDtI Drop in China's land sales poses threat to growth], Financial Times, 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Guan Qingyou, a professor at [[Tsinghua University]], estimated that land sales accounted for 74 percent of local government income in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rabinovitch, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/ef4fa68c-3773-11e1-a5e0-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fef4fa68c-3773-11e1-a5e0-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz1uHxCFDtI Worries grow as China land sales slump], Financial Times, 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], by the end of 2011 there was a total of 50 million displaced farmers across China (from all preceding years), and an average of 3 million farmers are displaced across China per year.&lt;ref name="ewing1" /&gt;  In most instances, the land is then sold to private developers at an average cost of 40 times higher per acre than the government paid to the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth C.

There are more than 90,000 civil disturbances in China each year,&lt;ref name="Gulf Times 460030"/&gt; and an estimated 180,000 mass protests occurred in the country in 2010;&lt;ref&gt;Demick, Barbara (10 October 2011) [http://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/10/3973035/protests-in-china-over-local-grievances.html#ixzz1adzrB3nj "Protests in China over local grievances surge, and get a hearing"]. ''Los Angeles Times'' / ''Sacramento Bee''&lt;/ref&gt; grievances are often [[corruption in the People's Republic of China|corruption]] or illegal land seizures. &lt;!-- To that end, the Central Government has announced a policy of "zero-tolerance" of illegal land grabs, and pledged to investigate any that are brought to light.&lt;ref name=asianews20110926&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Beijing:-zero-tolerance-against-illegal-land-grabs-22733.html "Beijing: zero tolerance against illegal land-grabs]. Asia News. 26 September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;  The Jamestown Foundation offers a macroscopic explanation for the rise in conflicts: that local officials, caught between local government revenue shortfalls due to measures by central government to cool the overheated property market and their personal ratings based on their contributions to GDP growth, have resorted to undercompensating villagers for land appropriations.&lt;ref name=jamestown20111220mattis&gt;Mattis, Peter (20 December 2011).

Farmland in Lufeng city has been progressively giving way to new developments. Projects in recent years have included a palatial new government building and a sumptuous holiday hotel resort that contained a row of 60 luxury villas. A glitzy new "Golden Sands" nightclub is a new attraction that brings rich visitors from out of town.&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt; In 2011, villagers alleged local officials had grabbed hundreds of hectares of cooperative land and were "secretly selling" it to a real estate developer.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007&gt;Choi, Chi-yuk (7 October 2011) [http://topics.scmp.com/news/china-news-watch/article/Rioting-in-model-village-attests-to-graft-woes "Rioting in model village attests to graft woes"]. ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a news analysis in ''The New York Times'', China's village committees are elected by the villagers themselves, and are thus theoretically the most representative forms of governance, yet most residents are unfamiliar with how the village system functions, and are unaware of their rights. The sale of collectivised land is supposed to require approval of the villagers under Chinese law, and the proceeds are supposed to be shared. However, the approval process lacks transparency in practice, and most decisions are taken by the elected village committee with the blessing of the Donghai township &amp;ndash; the level of government just above Wukan. The residents of Wukan made allegations of corruption: five of the nine members of Wukan's village committee had held their posts since the creation of the committee system by [[Deng Xiaoping]], and the village's Communist Party secretary, Xue Chang, has been in the position since 1970.&lt;ref name=nyt20111226wines&gt;Wines, Michael (25 December 2011).

=== Grievances ===
Residents in several villages near Wukan alleged that village officials had confiscated their farm land and sold it to developers.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Protesters riot"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The livelihoods of many were at stake: many were facing severe hardship with no land to till, and had difficulty buying food on their meagre urban incomes.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt; Wukan villagers said that they were unaware of the sale until developers began construction work, and alleged that local Communist Party officials had profited from the sale of [[people's commune|communal]] land, selling it for $1 billion RMB ($156 million USD) to [[Country Garden]].&lt;ref name=FT20110923&gt;Jacob, Rahul; Zhou, Ping (23 September 2011).

"Villagers vow to fight if police attack". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers petitioned various levels of government in vain over the years, accused local cadres of "pocketing more than 700 million yuan" ($110&amp;nbsp;million USD), which should legally have gone to compensating local farmers, since 2006. Local officials blamed the villagers' concerns on "troublemakers" who were manipulating those who were "unaware of the truth".&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt;

== September mobilisation ==
On the morning of 21 September 2011, hundreds of villagers participated in a sit-in protest against local officials outside government offices in Lufeng.&lt;ref name="Gulf Times 460030"&gt;{{cite news  
| url=  http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/printArticle.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=460030&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=45&amp;parent_id=25

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then as the crowd grew in numbers, protesters became restless and started damaging buildings and equipment in an industrial park in the village and blocking roads.&lt;ref name=ap20110923/&gt; Policemen were dispatched, and one villager said that they severely beat some teenagers who were banging on a gong to alert fellow villagers of the protest.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt; Three villagers were arrested during the first day's violence. The next day, the police station was besieged by more than 100 villagers demanding the release of the detained villagers, and the violence escalated.&lt;ref name=ap20110923/&gt;

The news that several youngsters had been seriously injured after being set upon by 'thugs' caused hundreds of irate villagers armed with makeshift weapons to besiege a local police station, where 30 to 40 officials were sheltering. Hundreds of well-equipped riot police were dispatched, and they engaged in a stand-off with the farmers. Video footage shot by villagers in Wukan showed people of all ages being chased and beaten with truncheons by riot police.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt; One Wukan villager described the police and other security staff as "like mad dogs, beating everyone they saw".&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt; The ''Financial Times'' reported that two children, aged nine and 13, were "badly injured", and that one may have died.&lt;ref name=FT20110923/&gt; Some villagers said that elderly people and children protesting peacefully were harassed and assaulted by "hired thugs", provoking an angry reaction from other villagers. The attacks on civilians by 400 police officers were described by the ''Financial Times'' as "indiscriminate".&lt;ref name=FT20110923/&gt;

One of the 'hired guns' bragged that he had been brought in by an influential businessman, who paid him RMB3,000 and promised him immunity from reprisals for any assaults.&lt;ref name=FT20110923/&gt; Officials blamed the escalating violence on "rumours" that police officers had beat a child to death. The official statement denied that any civilians had died.&lt;ref name="Gulf Times 460030"/&gt; Internet news of the riots, including photos and videos, were quickly [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|deleted by CCP censors]].&lt;ref name="ANDREW JACOBS nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press reported that searches on Sina Weibo (a microblog) for terms linked to Lufeng were blocked a short time after the protests began.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt;

On the third day of unrest, the municipality of [[Shanwei]], which has the responsibility for Lufeng, issued a statement saying that "hundreds of villagers attacked government buildings". It said "more than a dozen police officers had been injured and '6 police vehicles had suffered damage'".&lt;ref name="Gulf Times 460030"/&gt; In what appeared to analysts as a change of tactics, observers noted that the authorities withdrew visible police presence for several days instead of stepping up police presence and suppressing the protesters more forcefully. Guangdong party chief [[Wang Yang (official)|Wang Yang]] also reassured residents by declaring that he was prepared to accept lower economic growth in Guangdong in exchange for increased harmony within the province.&lt;ref name=reuters20110929&gt;Pomfret, James (29 September 2011).

Retrieved 13 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Pierre Cabestan, a politics professor at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], suspected that the policing change was due to the political aspirations of Wang, who wants to "survive and protect his image until next year". Wang, a strongly-touted candidate for the politburo when the [[Hu‚ÄìWen Administration|Hu / Wen generation]] retires, had been projecting a "[[Guangdong model|Happy Guangdong]]" model of development to level the wealth gap and emphasise social harmony. Police only returned on the fourth day after the riots.&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt;

=== Land grab and resolution ===
Addressing the land dispute underlying the unrest, a senior official admitted that a sale of the land was planned, and interested property developers had already surveyed the site with local officials, but officials said that no contract had yet been signed.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt; Guangdong media published reports that suggested protesters acted as mobs that assaulted and injured dozens of riot policemen. Villagers accused the press of blatant bias.&lt;ref name=scmp20111007/&gt;

The Shanwei city government offered to appoint an inter-agency committee to delve into the land seizure allegations in exchange for an immediate end to the protests.&lt;ref name=forbes20110926&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/09/25/general-as-china-village-riot_8699296.html "China vows probe to defuse violent land protest"]. Associated Press, ''Forbes''. 25 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Officials also said they would consider a fresh village election for clean and fair representatives to take part in future land negotiations. Because the government had agreed to deal with the issue openly and fairly, the villagers temporarily suspended their protests.&lt;ref name=reuters20110929/&gt;

== December uprising ==
[[File:Xue wukan procession.jpg|thumb|300px|Funeral procession of Xue Jinbo, Wukan village representative.|alt=Procession led by some Asian people dressed in white/hemp carrying a photograph of a man in a suit.]]
The local government agreed to negotiate with thirteen democratically elected officials from Wukan; but, before the negotiations could settle any of the villagers' disputes, three of the representatives were arrested. One of the representatives, Xue Jinbo (ËñõÈå¶Ê≥¢) died in police custody under mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref name="ewing1"&gt;Ewing, Kent. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NA07Ad02.html "Guangdong Boss Bets on Velvet Glove"]. ''Asia Times Online''. January 7, 2012. Retrieved May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After news of Xue's death became widely known, the villagers forcefully evicted local Communist Party officials and police from the village, leading to a blockade of the village by police.&lt;ref name="Hindu_police_evicted" /&gt;

=== Death of Xue Jinbo ===
Xue Jinbo was arrested by plainclothes police without a warrant in front of a restaurant just before noon (local time) on 9 December 2011. He was taken away in a minibus without licence plates.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_thumbs" /&gt; Four other village representatives were also detained on 9 December 2011.

At 11&amp;nbsp;pm in the evening of 11 December, a Lufeng City official, Huang, called Xue's daughter asking about Xue's full medical history, stating that Xue had been admitted to hospital in critical condition.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_thumbs" /&gt; Xue's daughter and wife went to the hospital at Shanwei in the following few hours, and were made to wait without having access to Xue. Officials told the Xue family that Xue Jinbo had arrived at a local prison at 7&amp;nbsp;am on 10 December and died at 10&amp;nbsp;am on 11 December. Other family members were contacted and arrived in Shanwei. Ten family members, including Xue's daughter and wife, were permitted to see Xue's body, but were prevented by police from using cameras and telephones.

The local police alleged that Xue had died suddenly of a heart attack after he had confessed to damaging property and disrupting public services, but his friends and family rejected this explanation, and believed that Xue had died after being subjected to police brutality.&lt;ref name="ewing1" /&gt;
According to Xue's relatives, Xue's body showed signs of torture:&lt;ref name=20111214nytimesinequities&gt;Jacobs, Andrew (14 December 2011) [https://www.webcitation.org/648tQxgbW "Village Revolts Over Inequities of Chinese Life"].

His daughter said her father had "a large bruise on his back suggested he had been kicked from behind."&lt;ref name="Telegraph_thumbs" /&gt; Xue's son-in-law Gao also noted that Xue's knees were bruised.

China News Service reported on 14 December that Xue's family members agreed with medical examiners' verdict that Xue died of "sudden cardiac failure".&lt;ref name=jamestown20111220mattis/&gt; [[Xinhua News]] stated that he had a history of [[asthma]] and [[heart disease]] that forensic investigators had found no evidence of abuse, and that Xue died of cardiac arrest at age 42 / 43.&lt;ref name="NYT_14Dec" /&gt; Xue's eldest daughter, Xue Jianwan, categorically denied to a Hong Kong online journal, ''iSun Affairs'', that her father had a history of heart problems.&lt;ref name="ThReut_thumbs" /&gt; Villagers held a two-hour vigil for him at his home.&lt;ref name=tele2011/&gt; Two post-mortem examinations were carried out: the first was undertaken by the Shanwei public security department, after which the family was informed that Xue had died of "sudden cardiac death". Following the family's protests, the authorities consented to a second autopsy, which was carried out by the medical examiner from [[Zhongshan University]], Guangzhou. At no stage were any relatives present. The family said that the short written autopsy report given to them failed to address their queries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/68M3q9TgC "ÂÆòÊñπÈ©óÂ±ç‰∏çÂèØ‰ø°" &lt;nowiki&gt;["Official autopsy 'unreliable']&lt;/nowiki&gt;"].

=== Uprising and siege ===
Villagers began holding daily protest meetings starting on 12 December.&lt;ref name="teleg_14Dec"/&gt; Throughout mid-December the villagers protested against the local government, waiting for the intervention of the central government and hoping that the central government would conduct an investigation.&lt;ref name=telegraph20111215moore&gt;Moore, Malcolm (15 December 2011).

After the news of Xue's death became widely known in Wukan on December 14, residents stormed the local police station and clashed with police, forcing them and local Communist Party officials out of the village.&lt;ref name="Hindu_police_evicted" /&gt; After evacuating, the police cordoned off the area around the village and blocked the roads leading to it.&lt;ref name="BBC_14Dec"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael | last=Bristow | title=China protest worsens in Guangdong after villager death | date=14 December 2011 |publisher=BBC News  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16173768 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63vo0QBhs |archivedate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government dispatched a force of 1000 armed officers to maintain order, but it was unsuccessful in retaking control of the village.&lt;ref name="teleg_14Dec" /&gt; The authorities held the village in siege, preventing supplies from entering.&lt;ref name=nyt20111216jacobs/&gt;

Local Communist Party officials accused the Wukan village representatives of being ringleaders of the protests. County-level official Wu Zili accused village representatives Lin Zuluan and Yang Semao of organizing and inciting the villagers to set up barricades around the village since 8 December (a day before Xue Jinbo was arrested): "They did this to prevent officials from entering the village and to stop the perpetrators of the earlier riots from leaving the village and turning themselves into the authorities."&lt;ref name="telegraph20111215moore2"/&gt;

On 16 December, provincial Chinese officials "vowed to temporarily halt questionable property sales and to investigate claims that the local government illegally confiscated farmland for private development", according to official news media,&lt;ref name=nyt20111216jacobs/&gt; but he police refused to release the body of Xue Jinbo to his family in order to have it buried.&lt;ref name="ewing1" /&gt; The same day, about 7000 people gathered for a ceremony for Xue Jinbo, and the standoff between villagers and authorities continued, with checkpoints from both sides set up around the village. Xue's son, Xue Jiandi, stated: "Right now we have only one demand, and that is that they return the body of my father, he belongs to us, not to the government."&lt;ref name="BBC_16Dec_wantbodyback" /&gt;

Protesters continued to demonstrate while displaying banners pledging loyalty to the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=telegraph20111215moore/&gt; A villager reported that the government had offered rice and cooking oil ‚Äì both of which were in low supply due to the blockade ‚Äì to villagers who switch sides from the protesters and over to the government. The government gained at least a hundred supporters from the effort, but the stall was later shut down.&lt;ref name=tele2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Malcolm |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8960077/Wukan-siege-rebel-Chinese-village-holds-memorial-for-fallen-villager.html |title=Wukan siege: rebel Chinese village holds memorial for fallen villager |publisher=Telegraph |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December, Lin Zuluan, one of Wukan's representatives, said that "leaders at a higher level of local government summoned [him] for talks" and that they wished to go to the village. Lin Zuluan refused the proposal, saying that there could be no talks until Xue's body was released, the four other village representatives held by police were released, and the villagers' land was returned.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_CP_refused" /&gt; During the siege the villagers administered Wukan, {{as of|2011|12|18|lc=y}}, from a temple to the goddess of the sea, [[Mazu (goddess)#Mainland China|Mazu]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph_CP_refused" /&gt;

A breakthrough occurred on 20 December when senior provincial officials intervened in the dispute and acknowledged villagers' basic demands. The officials admitted to mistakes in handling the grievances and vowed to crack down on corruption.&lt;ref name=global20111223&gt;Huang Jingjin (23 December 2011).

=== News coverage ===
A survey conducted on 19 December by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong indicates strong coverage outside mainland China, but none of the 200+ newspapers inside the country published any articles. The story was extensively covered in ''[[Ming Pao]]'' and ''[[Apple Daily]]'' in Hong Kong; abroad, articles were published by the ''Financial Times'', Reuters, ''The New York Times'', ''The Wall Street Journal'' and others. 58 articles were surveyed across the region in total, of which 37 were from Hong Kong, 6 from Taiwan, 14 from Malaysia and 1 from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;David Bandurski (19 December 2011).

Some [[Sina Weibo]] microbloggers told the BBC that internet searches related to Wukan and the area [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|were blocked]] after the December uprising started, and villagers' microblogs were deleted. Web users reacted by using alternative terms to refer to the events.&lt;ref name="BBC_wukan_censored" /&gt;

In an undated video circulated to the national media, Zheng Yanxiong blamed the media for his woes in front of a group of local officials and village representatives, saying that cadres like him were the only ones facing increasing hardship every year: "Our powers decline every day, and fewer and fewer methods are at our disposal. But responsibility becomes bigger and bigger ... Ordinary people have bigger and bigger appetites, and become smarter every day. They are harder and harder to control." This attitude was lampooned in an opinion piece in ''The Standard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&amp;art_id=118270&amp;sid=34879449&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20111223&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2011 "Talk is cheap at local level"]. 23 December 2011. ''The Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xinhua and various state media, which had previously hardly reported the dispute, started publishing articles on 22 December that praised the provincial government for its handling of the event.&lt;ref name=bloomberg20111222praise&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/648UliNNb "China‚Äôs State-Run Newspapers Praise Government Handling of Wukan Protests"].

He said: "The intervention is hard-earned progress, which rebutted previous claims by local authorities that the villagers had organized the protests 'out of malicious attempts'." Lin Zhe, professor at the Party School of the Party Central Committee, criticised local officials for having "poor sense of law and long-term neglect of the public's rights and interests," and said that the escalation of the dispute into violence would not have occurred if local authorities had "properly studied the complaints at the initial stages."&lt;ref name=global20111223/&gt;

==== International media commentary ====
During the protests, media including the [[BBC]] and the [[New York Times]] described the protests as "larger",&lt;ref name="BBC_14Dec" /&gt; "unusual for their longevity",&lt;ref name="NYT_14Dec" /&gt; and "a likely first in China's modern history".&lt;ref name="Hindu_police_evicted" /&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' declared the protests "[2011's] most serious case of mass unrest in China".&lt;ref name=wsj20111216page /&gt; However, after the protests' peaceful resolution, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' concluded that they were "not as unusual as it might have seemed" in the context of China's many small land and labor disputes, describing as "typical" the protestors' pledges of loyalty to the Communist Party of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/how-china-stays-stable-despite-500-protests-every-day/250940/|title=How China Stays Stable Despite 500 Protests Every Day|first=Max|last=Fisher|date=5 January 2012|accessdate=6 January 2012|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera English]] has produced a four-part observational documentary series about Wukan's transition to democracy.&lt;ref name="AJE-4Jul" /&gt;

{{main|Wukan municipal election, 2012}}
[[File:Voting in Wukan 2012.jpg|thumbnail|2012 election]]
Following the standoff in December, protest leader Lin Zuluan was named the new Communist Party secretary of Wukan.  As part of the truce with authorities, the governor of Guangdong, Wang Yang, acquiesced to a village election in Wukan: the first of its kind to employ a secret ballot.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Rahul Jacob and Zhou Ping, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0c7046d6-5560-11e1-b66d-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/home_uk/feed//product#axzz1mPuZ5dIJ Wukan‚Äôs young activists embrace new role], Financial Times, 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of three elections was planned, which would select 100 representatives to oversee the village's governing committee.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==Impact==
===On similar village protests===
Several other villages in China have drawn inspiration from the Wukan protests.

* In December 2011 residents of the nearby town of Haimen, Guangdong, staged large-scale protests over plans to expand a coal-fired power plant. The protests, which drew thousands of participants, were met with detentions and tear gassing by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wines, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/world/asia/china-jails-rights-activist-chen-wei-for-9-years.html?_r=3 Police Fire Tear Gas at Protesters in Chinese City], New York Times, 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Haimen residents told Reuters that they had followed developments in Wukan closely, regarding it as a good model of how citizens might negotiate with authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/21/china-protest-plant-idUSL3E7NL0KR20111221 Chinese official denies reports of deaths at Haimen protest], 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 17 January 2012 about 1,000 villagers from [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun district]] held a rally in front of Guangzhou city's government headquarters, angered by land seizures and corruption. The villagers threatened to turn the district into a "second Wukan" if their grievances were not resolved.  Protesters said that Party secretary Li Zhihang had pocketed more than 400 million yuan and had embezzled up to 850,000 yuan from village operatives.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. Guangzhou land rally erupts amid key meeting. 18 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2012 residents of East and West Panhe villages in [[Zhejiang]] staged protests against local officials over forced land requisitions with inadequate compensation. During a series of earlier protests in October 2011, police and government authorities reportedly fled the village.&lt;ref&gt;China Digital Times, [http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/02/wukan-2-0-zhejiang-villagers-protest-land-grabs/ Wukan 2.0? Zhejiang Villagers Protest Land Grabs], 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Communist Party politics===
Observers have credited the peaceful resolution of the Wukan protests to the intervention of the Communist Party chief in Guangdong, Wang Yang. By demonstrating his ability to resolve the issue peacefully, Wang has improved his reputation within the Party as a peacemaker who listens and responds to the interests of the people that he serves.&lt;ref name="ewing1" /&gt;

The citizens of Wukan welcomed intervention by Wang's government, and Wang has capitalized on the popularity of his approach since late December 2011. In a meeting with the Guangdong Party congress in January 2012, Wang pledged to use his "Wukan approach" to improve village politics throughout the province. Wang, commenting on his resolution of the protests, has stated that it "was not only meant to solve problems in the village, but also to set a reference standard to reform village governance across Guangdong."&lt;ref name="ewing1" /&gt;

== Protests in 2016 ==
Villagers began marching in protest daily since mid-June 2016 after the arrest of protest leader Lin Zulian (formerly known as Lin Zuluan), an elected leader of the village. Lin, 72, had written a letter to the village on March 2 complaining of continued corruption. Seized land had been "raped by power, money, and gangsters," he wrote. This protest letter followed multiple attempts to gain redress from direct contact with the developer, Hua Hui Real Estate, that had acquired a 110,000 square meter plot of land in Wukan without the approval of the village committee. The company gave a perfunctory response, and the Lufeng government, in which Wukan resides, later stated that the land did not belong to the villagers. On June 18, after calls for "renewed mass protests" over land seizures, Lin was arrested by special police who broke into his walled house in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/03/hopes-for-democracy-crushed-in-the-chinese-rebel-village-of-wukan/|title=Hopes for democracy crushed in the Chinese rebel village of Wukan|last=Reuters|date=2016-07-03|website=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an enquiry about the land deal and treatment of Lin, the Lufeng government said that it "has not discovered any situation of unfair suppression or punishment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lin later appeared on state TV admitting that he had taken bribes for government contracts. This sparked protests, with thousands marching accusing the government of forcing the confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-36583488|title=Wukan, China: Villagers rally behind chief after 'confession|last=|first=|date=21 June 2016|work=|publisher=BBC|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts by Lin and other village leaders to gain legal representation have been met with resistance by the authorities. Lin's family reportedly hired the civil rights lawyer [[Ge Yongxi]], including a retainer fee. The judicial authorities later made them return the funds, however. "The firm was banned from accepting any client from Wukan village, which obviously interferes with our normal, legal business... He should not be denied the right of legal counsel, whether he has taken any bribe or not," Ge told [[South China Morning Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/wukan-stirs-again/|title=Wukan Stirs Again|last=Diplomat|first=Cal Wong, The|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, new reports emerged that riot police had again repressed Wukan protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chinese Riot Police Quash Wukan Protests|url= http://www.voanews.com/a/3505419.html|date= September 13, 2016|publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of December 2016 a Chinese court sentenced nine of the villagers to prison terms between two and ten years for illegal assembly, blocking traffic and disrupting public order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-sends-villagers-prison-land-protests-44409892 ''China Sends 9 Villagers to Prison After Land Protests''].

'''Zoroastrian Dari''' ({{lang-fa|ÿØÿ±€å ÿ≤ÿ±ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™€å or ⁄ØŸà€åÿ¥ ÿ®ŸáÿØ€åŸÜÿßŸÜ}} literally Behdƒ´nƒÅn dialect) is a [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian]]&lt;ref name="ethnologue15_GBZ"&gt;{{harvnb|Cahill|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnolect]] spoken as a first language by an estimated 8,000 to 15,000 [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] in and around the cities of [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]] in central Iran, but until the 1880s was spoken by almost a million people in Central Iran.&lt;ref name="DLP_about"&gt;k{{harvnb|Farudi|Toosarvandani|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ethnolect]] is often overlooked by linguists because the region is predominantly [[Muslim]]{{cn|date=April 2017}} and because Dari is primarily spoken (rarely written). Dari is a Persian dialect.

Dari is also known as '''BehdinƒÅni''' or pejoratively as '''Gabri''' (sometimes '''Gavr≈≠ni''' or '''Gabr≈çni''').&lt;ref name="OWP_2005_149"&gt;{{harvnb|Farudi|Toosarvandani|2005|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dari has numerous dialects.&lt;ref name="DLP_2004findings_10_12"&gt;{{harvnb|Farudi|Toosarvandani|2004|pp=10‚Äì12}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are certain differences compared to new Persian, though it is still a Persian dialect related to middle Persian Pahlavi.&lt;ref name="Boyce_2001_178"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Browne|1893|p=425}} cited in&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{harvnb|Farudi|Toosarvandani|2004|p=ii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
Genealogically, Dari Persian is a member of the [[Western Iranian languages#Northwestern Iranian|Northwestern Iranian language]] subfamily, which includes several other closely related languages, for instance, [[Zazaki]] and [[Balochi language|Balochi]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue14_NWIr"&gt;{{harvnb|Cahill|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These Northwestern Iranian languages are a branch of the larger Western Iranian language group, which is in turn a subgroup of the [[Iranian language]] family.

==Name==
The language known as Zoroastrian Dari is also referred to as 'Behdin√¢ni' ("language of the people of good religion") or pejorative yet common name, 'Gabri' ("language of the infidels").&lt;ref name="DLP_about" /&gt; The roots of the name 'Gabri' date back to Muslim invasion of Iran and is resented by indigenous speakers of Dari to refer to their language. As Farudi and Toosarvandani point out:&lt;ref name="DLP_about" /&gt; "For them, choosing to call their language Dari, the speakers of the language invoke their ancestral connections to a pre-Islamic Iran."

==Dialects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[Image:yazd fire temple.jpg|right|thumb|The main Zoroastrian fire temple in Yazd, Iran.]]
The Dari language has traditionally{{By whom|date=June 2015}} been divided into two main dialects: the variety spoken in Yazd and the one spoken in Kerman. This division of the language, based on the division of its speakers into their two main cities of residence, conceals the complexity of the actual dialectical situation. The Yazdi dialect itself has some thirty varieties, each distinct and unique to one of the Zoroastrian neighborhoods in and around Yazd. The variation amongst the Yazdi dialects is so great that, were it not for their geographic proximity, they would no doubt be classified as distinct dialects. The Kermani dialect may also contain (or may have contained at one time) a comparable level of dialectical complexity.

==Endangered status==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Although Dari has been generally considered quintessential to Zoroastrian identity,&lt;ref name=ringer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringer|first1=Monica M.|editor1-last=Amanat|editor1-first=Abbas|editor2-last=Vejdani|editor2-first=Farzin|title=Iranian Nationalism and Zoroastrian Identity; Between Cyrus and Zoroaster|date=January 2012|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|location=Iran Facing Others; Identity Boundaries in a Historical Perspective|isbn=978-0-230-10253-8|pages=271‚Äì272|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the vitality of it is being affected, or has been affected in the past, by two main types of pressure{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}: [[economics|economic]] and [[politics|political]].

The pressures affecting the vitality of Dari Persian today are largely economic. In order to obtain an economic advantage, speakers are giving up their traditional language for the dominant language of Iran, standard new Persian. Parents intentionally do not transmit Dari to their children in order that they may have what is felt to be an advantage in school and in life. The language loss can also occur more indirectly and less visibly when people move to larger urban centers or abroad in pursuit of better economic opportunities; the lack of a complete language environment in which to immerse a child decreases or completely inhibits the transmission of the language to new generations.

In past times, Dari speakers have experienced political pressures to yield up their language as well. The period since the seventh-century Muslim conquest of Persia has been a time of great persecution for the Zoroastrians of Iran. Political pressures have directly resulted in language loss when Zoroastrians have deliberately abandoned their language as a means of hiding their identity so as to escape persecution. Political pressures have also led to language loss indirectly; the oppression the Zoroastrians have been experienced under Iran‚Äôs various rulers over the past thousand or so years has driven a steady stream of Zoroastrians to more tolerant areas, mostly the capital, [[Tehran]], or abroad. Again, a complete language environment does not exist in these places, inhibiting the transmission of Dari to new generations.

Linguists currently consider Dari to be in a state of language shift. Many of the language‚Äôs speakers have assimilated to the dominant culture of the society they live in and have given up‚Äîintentionally or unintentionally‚Äîtheir traditional language. Languages like Dari are transferring from a state of language maintenance, in which a language is being sustained in the face of pressure from a dominant culture, to language death, a state in which the language is no longer spoken.

Many of Dari‚Äôs dialects are facing extinction at an even more rapid pace than the language as a whole. Since each of Dari‚Äôs many dialects has a smaller community of speakers, they are more susceptible to the forces driving the language towards extinction. Some dialects have already effectively reached extinction, for example, the Mohammadabad dialect, which, it is reported, possesses only a few speakers living in Tehran. The Kerman dialect, always susceptible because of the smaller size of its Zoroastrian population, also seems to be largely lost.
